			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, thank you for the answer. What kind of triggering could cause an earthquake in a heavy fracking area? It's neither terribly close, nor immediate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am going to assume that you are referring to waste water injection associated with fracking, as this is what is thought to cause the significant increase in seismicity in Oklahoma and Kansas that has been in the news a lot lately due to the M5.8 earthquake that occurred on 2016/09/03. There is a difference between fracking and waste water injection, and this often causes confusion when discussing both of their relationships to earthquakes. The description below is taken from a previous post I wrote and modified slightly. I hope it is helpful, but if it brings up more questions I'd be happy to elaborate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fracking uses high pressure fluid to create new, little breaks in the rock in order to reach the gas. These new breaks are earthquakes, but they are very small, often negative magnitudes. The wastewater injection wells pump water (often from fracking but not always) much deeper and affect larger existing faults, decreasing the strength of the fault by upping the pore fluid pressure until they rupture. This <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/files/Quakes-Final.gif" target="_blank">animated graphic</a> shows the difference between the two very well. Both of these processes have been shown to induce earthquakes, but wastewater has been linked to much more seismicity than fracking by itself. Here is the paper on fracking induced earthquakes in Canada [<a href="http://srl.geoscienceworld.org/content/early/2016/03/28/0220150263.abstract" target="_blank">Atkinson et al., 2016</a>] and here is one (of many) on waste water induced earthquakes in Oklahoma [<a href="https://profile.usgs.gov/myscience/upload_folder/ci2015Jun1814143055600Weingarten_etal.pdf" target="_blank">Weingarten et al., 2015</a>].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earthquakes associated with waste water injection wells are typically quite close (within ~5-15 km) to the injection point, but that is a bound used by researchers and could be very conservative depending on the permeability of the ground. As for the timing, there are publications associating injection times to periods of increased seismicity [Figure 7 of <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/induced/pdf/Raleigh-Healy-Bredehoeft-1976-Science-\(New-York-NY\).pdf" target="_blank">Raleigh et al., Science, 1976</a>]. You can see the pulse of seismicity as the volume/pressure is increased in a well, where basically you are turning the tap on and off for earthquakes. There has been a delay observed in the timing of the largest earthquakes, where the maximum magnitude earthquake increases with the volume injected as long as injection activities continue [<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013JB010597/full" target="_blank">McGarr, JGR, 2014</a>]. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unrelated to the original question but when you said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earthquakes have triggered other earthquakes across long distances (1000+ km) through dynamic stress triggering. This occurs when an already stressed fault is near the breaking point, then the surface waves of a large earthquake pass by and throw that last straw on top to make the fault rupture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It made me think about how fault lines that are 'awaiting' a rupture are just slowly building pressure in a way that the longer it takes to rupture the more pressure will be released and the larger the earthquake will be.  No?  Has there been any research into artificially triggering such fault lines to minimize damage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is definitely something that has been thought about, but if you start looking at it practically it does not look very feasible. We aren't completely sure what stops an earthquake, so what if you caused an earthquake that unzipped an even larger portion of the fault than what would have ruptured naturally? I don't think NSF would fund that one. This is one reason why the Oklahoma situation is so interesting to scientists. It is an experiment we never would have been able to get funded and we are learning loads about earthquakes, unfortunately at the expense of those folks in Oklahoma and Kansas. I would love to see a study that proposed drilling into an oceanic transform fault to try to induce an earthquake get funded, as hazard would be minimal regardless of how large the earthquake ended up being. It'd be expensive though and still a little risky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been lots of examples of industrial scale wastewater injection causing earthquakes, probably due to lubricating fault lines and releasing stress that otherwise might not have been released.  They have typically introduced heavy seismic activity into areas that previously had light seismic activity.  So in those cases at least, looks like it's not a good thing to experiment with.  Oil and gas fields in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Texas experienced this as well as a nuclear disposal well near Denver, Colorado.  Curiously, the USGS wrote a paper saying wastewater injection in Los Angeles, where there's lots of activity, did not affect the size or frequency of earthquakes.  So using those examples, I'm going to hypothesize that artificially triggering earthquakes would be a bad idea, given that we can't currently predict when or where the most dangerous earthquakes are going to occur anyway, and the attempts might not do anything at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The type of fault will matter a great deal in how they're affected by different things. A large nuclear device underground in Southern California would result in different stresses than wastewater injection and might result in increased seismicity even though the injection didn't. The faults that run through the middle and eastern areas of North America are very different from the subduction zone faults around the Pacific ring of fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This study is careful and interesting, and I am cautious of the conclusion but intrigued. The earth tide is an obvious force that should be factored into earthquake behavior and triggering, but there are many factors to consider and our record of earthquakes is relatively short. I am very glad that these seismologists did this study as it is a common question and it helps to have current, precise analysis to reference.
