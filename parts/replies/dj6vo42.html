			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much, and he was in the right, IMO. To add a bit to your post; he wanted his voice in Aladdin under the strict rule that he didn't want his voice <em>selling stuff</em>. Disney sold stuff using his voice and he put a stop to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We had a deal,&quot; the actor said on the NBC show. &quot;The one thing I said was I will do the voice. I'm doing it basically because I want to be part of this animation tradition. I want something for my children. One deal is, I just don't want to sell anything--as in Burger King, as in toys, as in stuff.&quot;</p>
<p>Williams said Disney executives agreed to honor his wishes, &quot;Then all of a sudden, they release an advertisement--one part was the movie, the second part was where they used the movie to sell stuff. Not only did they use my voice, they took a character I did and overdubbed it to sell stuff. That was the one thing I said: 'I don't do that.' That was the one thing where they crossed the line.&quot;</p>

<p>They actually gave him an original Picasso painting, perhaps as a way to make up with him. If anyone else reads this and wants to know more, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-25/entertainment/ca-60882_1_robin-williams" target="_blank">it's quite the story.</a></p>
<p>Kinda sad that Disney took the &quot;sin now and ask forgiveness later&quot; road. Not too surprising, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen Cars 3 yet, but apparently Disney/Pixar created a significant role for Doc Hudson from the first movie using recorded lines and outtakes from Paul Newman. Now, Newman's family specifically OK'd this, but it seems clear that Robin Williams didn't feel the same way.</p></div>		</li>
