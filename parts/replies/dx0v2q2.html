			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, well the question is a bit beyond something a 5 year old would understand, but I'll simplify it further.</p>
<p>New formulas can come about from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experiments - Scientists complete experiments and their data might indicate a relationship between some various measurements. They create a formula based on this.</p>
</li>
<li>Reworking/ deriving - As with the example I used before, mathematicians sometimes rework known formulas to be more useful in certain situations. This could involve combining several formulae, or just rearranging the terms.</li>
