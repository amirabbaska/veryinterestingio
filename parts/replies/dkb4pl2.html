			<div class="markdown"><p>If your phone stays hot long after it has hit 100% then it probably has a crappy charging circuit that is still burning off power while the battery it's not being charged. Or the battery is in poor health so the charging circuit is constantly &quot;topping off.&quot; If you are actually using your phone while leaving it plugged in at 100% then it's probably the latter.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The funny thing is that a lot of first generation Apple Watches had this issue but I never saw an article specifically about it. I know it was an issue because mine overheated whenever I left it on the charger and eventually it had the battery pop the screen out and they extended the warranty by two years for ones that had parts pop out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like a faulty phone. Perhaps it is trying to charge the battery too agressively.   Or maybe there is something running on the phone that intensively uses resources when plugged in causing the CPU to run hot.</p>
<p>My phone gets warm when charging, but is currently at 100% charge and plugged in to the wall and is quite cool and will be (I know from experience) for a long time if I leave it to its devices. Of course there is some heat generated, after all the phone is on, but the heat isn't more than one would expect from a sleeping phone in one's pocket. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pay more attention to what <em>part</em> of the phone is getting hot. It's possible it's not the battery at all. The CPU and GPU can get hot too if run for a long time at close to 100% use. It's possible there is an app on your phone that runs your phone hot while plugged in or is just running wild all the time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When the power supply is plugged in to AC without a phone, it still puts out a constant 5 volts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same sense your wall socket &quot;puts out&quot; 120V. However the wall socket does not draw current because it is passive whereas a charger might draw a tiny amount. </p>
<p>In Australia libraries loan out plug-in power meters which are fun to test on household appliances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&lt; When the phone decides that the battery is fully charged, charging terminates</p>
<p>So it's not necessary to unplug the phone when it reaches 100% ? One of my phones displays the message &quot;Battery fully charged. Unplug phone.&quot; It's an older phone, circa 2012. My new phone doesn't display that message.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because it's a quick way to shorten the life of the battery. That message shouldn't be there. I had a phone that did that as well, always ignored it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Overcharging absolutely does shorten the life of a modern lithium ion battery. Academically, you get the longest life by staying perpetually between 30% and 80% or so (with a lot of give and take based on individual cell design). </p>
<p>It just doesn't matter much because chargers can usually stop themselves now and because the incremental lifespan improvements aren't that valuable to consumers relative to single-charge lifetime, particularly given rapid replacement cycles. </p>
<p>But really, if your phone is particularly warm when you unplug it and it wasn't busy doings lots of maintenence work at full charge, odds are good that you're degrading your battery. Probably not enough to care, though. </p></div>		</li>
