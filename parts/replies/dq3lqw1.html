Plus many of the strongest storms happen in the winter, when whales and dolphins have moved towards the calmer, warmer southern waters. </p>
<p>Edit also they have a lot of practice swimming</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. My friend taught me to swim against a wave underwater to stay in place, then take a breath before the next. These animals have a lot more muscles than two eight year olds and can hold their breaths for longer. I think they would be tired, and maybe injured a bit if they got hit with driftwood or something, but probably fine. Their reflexes are also a lot better and I guess they can see. Or they could dive deeper and come up for air really quick. It probably affects babies, injured, disabled, and old ones the most. </p></div>		</li>
