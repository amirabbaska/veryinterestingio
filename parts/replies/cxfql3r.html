			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are driven by high (or create) high pressure, very different application. For a wind turbine 3 can give you an efficiency in the 45-50% range (out of a possible 59.3%), whereas 2 will never break 40%, and 4+ can get close to the efficiency of 3, but at greater cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aviation guy here. Three and four blade propellers give you a markedly less efficient airplane, but are used out of necessity for ground clearance or harmonic/balance concerns.  I think you're thinking about this in terms of fluid flowing through a tube or something, instead of an open system. A single blade propeller is actually more efficient again vs a dual blade, so far as energy gained or expended is concerned when compared with similar blade area. But then you have even more engineering hurtles to overcome, with balance and axial loading. If I'm wrong, feel free to correct me, but this is what I've always been taught and come to understand</p></div>		</li>

<p>In typical wind turbine big part of the wind  energy is not going trough the blades ,but around them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A wind turbine is also driven by economic factors. It is possible to make a blade design or layout which captures more of the energy from the wind, but the cost starts to go way up.</p>
<p>A three-blade design captures a good amount of energy, but won't overload the mast with stress during high wind conditions, can be braked safely without causing oscillation, and - one of the most important factors - makes the most cost-effective use of the investment in time and resources required to transport and install the turbine.</p>
<p>I've seen math indicating that a five-blade design can be more efficient in certain applications (usually areas with sustained high winds) but the gains would be offset by having to make special builds in limited numbers, train crews to maintain and operate them differently, and satisfy insurers/investors that the increased returns would <em>more than offset</em> the additional up-front and ongoing costs/risks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>So, it's a tradeoff situation for efficiency that factors in  number of blades, blade speed, wind speed, and RPM to maximize the efficiency of energy conversion. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't forget the main reason: cost.</p>
<p>Adding a new blade is expensive. Plus, it adds weight, meaning it's more top heavy, requiring a stronger hub, column, and base. The addition of another blade wouldn't add enough electricity generation to offset the cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. There are so many things we could make more efficient, but the change is so little, and the cost would be so high, that it isn't worth it. </p>
<p>Some applications <em>are</em> worth it, such as solar panels in space. In those instances, increasing cost by 25% to increase efficiency by by 1% might actually be worth it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the real answer.  100 ft/ 30m blades are expensive to manufacture, transport, and install.  The designers are going for maximum production per dollar.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cost is not really the issue. A wind turbine is a long-term investment; the amount it would cost to manufacture and transport an additional blade at the onset is negligible with respect to the lifetime value the turbine will generate. </p>
<p>Rather, the design of the turbine is simply meant to maximize that lifetime value, most of which is directly related to the efficiency of the turbine. The 3-blade design is the best compromise of efficiency, practicality, and simplicity. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The life expectancy of a turbine is 20-25 years. Adding the cost of an additional blade, as well as the necessary improvement cost in making the base and column stronger to support the weight <em>is not negligible</em>. Wind turbines are extremely expensive, and expected profit margins are not that large. Any additional cost can make a turbine project not worth it.</p></div>		</li>
