One example is the way he treated farmers (especially in Ukraine), which led many of the latter to enlist in the army and help with the war effort in order to &quot;stay afloat&quot;. People would do whatever it takes to protect their family and put food to the table, even if it meant acting as cannon fodder.</p></div>		</li>
