			<div class="markdown"><p>To add: America's Social Security number was never designed to be identification. It was designed for social security use only. But companies liked the idea of global identifiers and latched on to it. </p>
<p>In addition, everyone has a social security number from birth.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SSNs are actually useful as a unique <em>identifier</em>.  They can definitively state &quot;I'm talking about <em>this</em> John Doe, as opposed to someone else who coincidentally has the same name and birthday&quot;</p>
<p>Where they fail is in <em>authentication</em>, e.g &quot;I <em>am</em> this John Doe, as opposed to some other John Doe or perhaps Jane Buck&quot;. The issue is places continue to expect them to work for the latter, when they should be restricted to the former.</p>
<p>It was years ago, but I'd heard numerous suggestions that the fix to this is to essentially publish all SSNs ever issued with corresponding data -- if they're public information then they <em>really</em> can't be used as an authenticator. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to link this same video. People keep comparing our SS cards to other countries ID cards which is not really a fair comparison. As you said, our SS card was never meant as an id card it was just the one thing we all had so here we are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, this was not a problem until the IRS started using the Social Security Number.</p>
<p>The Social Security Number was only used for Social Security prior to the IRS using it and people weren't issued one until they started working (since that is when Social Security matters).</p>
<p>However, the IRS decided to use the Social Security Number as a work around to be able to track people and their children.  They said that you couldn't claim a dependent without a social security number for them so then parents had to start getting a social security card issued for their child at birth. </p>
<p>This is where the problem comes from.</p>
<p>Kids are getting Social Security Numbers 20 and even 30 years before they really need them.  That leaves a lot of opportunity for people to steal them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Germany also forbids storing ID card numbers in any database except for</p>
<ul>
<li>the issuing office, for the duration of validity + some time</li>
<li>the registry of lost/stoled IDs, if required.</li>
</ul>
<p>The issuing office is the municipality where you are registered, and ID validity is limited to ten years.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no central database of all citizens</li>
<li>There is no unique number that identifies a citizen.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these restrictions are in response to Hitler, and this is also why a huge stink got kicked up when the tax office started assigning lifelong numbers to everyone.</p></div>		</li>

The problem is banks and the like don't want to see (just) your state ID for some reason, they require your social security number. That is where the fault lies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't need a national ID if we have state IDs, which we do and are as secure as a national ID would be.</p>
<p>The only issue with this is that instead of a single, nationwide system which needs to be compromised in order to create false identification, you've now got 50. Any one state can be compromised to create a false system. Additionally, in order to use state ID number rather than federal ID number, you need to interface with 50 different systems. Possible, yes. Easy? Definitely not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder why don't they build on the SSN card and basically add more and more features until it basically becomes a more secure id card?</p>
<p>Add a picture, reissue a new one every 5 years, make it with plastic, add an additional number to increase the variability (like the CVV code in the credit cards), require all businesses to accept only the card itself, and not just the data and bam, you have an ID card, wether you like it or not.</p></div>		</li>
