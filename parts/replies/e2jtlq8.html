			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I understand how sleep being a &quot;passive drive&quot; precludes the ability for sleep to be voluntary.</p>
<p>My body requires a certain concentration of of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood, and I will breathe involuntarily to maintain those concentrations.</p>
<p>However, I can still voluntarily control my breathing, which suggests that at some point in the past it was beneficial for some ancestor of ours to be able to voluntarily control its breathing.  Perhaps related to diving, but changes to our respiration when diving are also largely involuntary (diving reflex).</p>
<p>I can certainly imagine situations when voluntary sleep would be most beneficial for an animal (though I concede that that's not the same thing as evolutionary pressure, which is what's really required for a trait to emerge).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you, voluntarily, hold your breath for a sufficient period, your body will decide you are no longer in control. (go ahead and try, although I can't recommend it)</p>
<p>Passive drives are bodily functions which we can influence, but can't completely control. You can influence your fear response, but jump scares still work at a physiological level. You can influence your need to eat, but your body will drive you to become ravenous. You can influence your need to poop, but at some point your intestines are full, good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is: if you can voluntarily turn off your breath when convenient – subject to the constraint that it'll switch back on automatically after a point – why can't also you voluntarily turn off your awakeness when convenient, subject to the constraint that it'll switch back on automatically after a point? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also point out that it takes action to override a passive, or involuntary, response. Because of that, I'd guess it's impossible to will yourself into a &quot;passive&quot; response since that's contradicting the very nature to begin with. In other words, you can probably will yourself out of an involuntary response, at least to some degree, but you can't will yourself into an involuntary response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The funny thing is that it's one-sided.</p>
<p>Take breathing.  You can choose to breathe, to take deep breaths, to take quick, shallow breaths, to hold your breath, or let the body take over.</p>
<p>Take urination.  Within reason you can choose to hold it or release it.  If you're about to go for a long drive, you might choose to do it even though there's no real pressure.  If you're in the middle of a long drive, you might choose to hold it until you get home.  Although pressure builds up over time and it get harder and harder to hold it, you have a fair amount of control over holding vs. releasing.</p>
<p>With sleep, you can only really fight it in one direction.  You can fight to stay awake in a variety of ways (without caffeine), and it will often work to extend your sleeplessness hours past when your body would naturally want to start sleeping.  But, can you fight to sleep hours earlier than normal?  Not really.</p>
<p>It's strange that you can force yourself to stay awake when necessary, but you can't force yourself to go to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can't I force myself not to?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what if you somehow physically force yourself not to urinate, like to block the urethra. What would happen then? Would your blader just burst? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you will, eventually, piss yourself.</p>
<p>There's a muscle (the detrusor muscle) which acts as a gauge on your bladder fullness. When it reaches maximum tension your bladder <em>will</em> empty. Potty training increases the connections between the innervating neurons in that muscle and your brain, teaching you when you need to pee. Under max load, any desire you have not to pee will be overridden.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes when I wake up I feel an incredible sharp pain in what I believe is the area where the bladder is located. When I sit up and walk to the bathroom it hurts like hell. Then when I try to pee the pain is also very sharp and makes me not wanna do it, but it has to be done. Then the pain goes away. Why would my body won’t wake up in the night to go pee instead of holding it very painfully?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, eventually you will get to the point where you will involuntarily urinate. Like how you can't stop breathing indefinitely. Eventually your body takes over.</p></div>		</li>
