			<div class="markdown"><p>Thunder is loud, but it isn't dangerously loud.  You don't have to put your hands over your ears to protect them, and it generally doesn't physically hurt.  You also are not exposed to thunder long enough to do any real damage.   Some unnatural noises though are so loud that they physically hurt; something you rarely find in natural noises.</p>
<p>I have a feeling OP has the right answer.  There is just not good evolutionary reason to develop a sophisticated defense against loud noises because they are so rare in nature.  Dangerous light levels on the other hand are something you deal with constantly.  </p>
<p>The only instances I can think of where you might have a natural noise that is so loud it can damage your ears is during natural disasters.  A mudslide or avalanche for instances might be loud of enough to hurt, but those instances are so absurdly rare that they are unlikely to do any real damage to your ears.  Further, wanting to run like hell from anything loud enough to hurt is probably just makes good evolutionary sense.  Anything in nature loud enough to damage your ears is likely about to kill you and something you should be running like hell from.</p>
<p>I have a feeling OP has the right answer.  Why do we have no good defense against loud noises?  There was just never a reason to bother developing a defense.  You are not going to evolve a defense against something that isn't screwing with your ability to breed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I was thinking, at least.  Hence the reference to bats.  Many species produce sounds that are loud enough that it would damage their sensitive ears. Imagine if your own speaking voice was 120 decibels.<br />
So bats go deaf as they &quot;speak.&quot; Their ears actually assume an internal configuration that prevents any sound from registering, then return to normal as soon as the danger is passed, so they can hear the sound on the echo.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2 very loud sounds I can think of... volcanic explosions and meteor explosions (eg Chelyabinsk).</p>
<p>Not exactly a common occurence, and not healthy to be near anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the more likely evolutionary advantage of both reflexes I mentioned was the ability to pick out soft acoustic transients (I.e. twigs snapping, bushes rustling) among sustained environmental sounds. I'd guess that this was protection against predators or competing animals.</p>
<p>As it happened, the system may have adapted to be more accommodating to the spectrum of speech, thus allowing for more reliable verbal communication when hunting or foraging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, I was just pointing out that what you mentioned didn't appear to be a true &quot;loud noise defense,&quot; but rather an unrelated reflex that may be triggered by loud noises. </p></div>		</li>
