<p>Insulin sensitivity seems to be closely related to viceral fat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to clarify for others, it's a <strong>lack of</strong> insulin sensitivity that leads to viceral fat, type2 diabetes, etc. which is more commonly referred to as <strong>insulin resistance</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Being sensitive to insulin = good</strong></p>
<p>You eat a plate of pasta, your blood glucose spikes, your body releases a little bit of insulin, your muscles respond and it brings your blood glucose back to normal. </p>
<p><strong>Being resistant to insulin = bad</strong></p>
<p>You eat a plate of pasta, your blood glucose spikes, your body releases a little bit of insulin but your muscles don't listen to the message to take the glucose from the blood. So more and more insulin is released to be sure they get the message and eventually bring blood glucose back to normal. Higher blood sugar for longer periods of time is bad for the body.</p></div>		</li>
