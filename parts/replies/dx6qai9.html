			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't mind that USB is keyed, I just wish they had made it more obvious which way it goes.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes there are ways to tell by looking it at like which side the plastic bit or the logo is on. The point is that it could be much clearer. Think about how often you jam an ethernet cable in the wrong way versus USB. One is very obviously keyed and one is not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The irony is they did that from the start with the downstream connectors. If I had to guess, I'd imagine they just didn't expect USB cables to become as frequently connected and disconnected as they are now. In the '90s when you plugged something into your PC, you generally just left it there. They might've expected people to swap components at the other end, hence the more obvious keyed shapes for those connections.</p>
<p>And then of course, USB flash memory and ubiquitous mobile devices came along and just upended the whole paradigm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. One quick look at a PC from the mid-90s would show you the various massive connectors (serial/parallel buses). PCs were a big scale improvement over mainframes, and USB were a big scale improvement over the old connectors.</p>
<p>Technlogy improved, new forms and uses were invented along the way. As a kid who saw the first Apple II and started my coding on mainframe and stupid calculators, I can say that everything that has happened in the past 10 years looks like it came out of sci-fi graphic novels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When usb first came out and was widely supported (in Win98 SE?) it was not just the simplest and slickest connector anybody had ever seen but it ushered in the first real &quot;plug and play&quot; experience. Before Usb you had to manually install (serial) drivers and select virtual ports and hope it would all just work with no real feedback from the computer to let you know if anything was working.</p>
<p>While people bitch about it now, at the time USB was the computer equivalent of sliced bread (the best thing). Literally nobody was complaining that it only worked one way because it turned a 5 minute job into a 30 second job and saved much hair pulling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's also a great point! USB A seems antiquated now, but it was a huge leap forward when it was created. It's easy to see the flaws in hindsight, but during the design process it was all about the benefits relative to earlier connectors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, I remember running out of IRQs and having to carefully figure out which devices I'd never actually use at the same time so they could share. Not having to arse about with IRQs was, for me, <strong>*the</strong>* big thing about USB. I was so hyped for it, I couldn't believe how much easier it made pretty much everything.</p></div>		</li>
