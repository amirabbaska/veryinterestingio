			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your answer, but wanted to give a few minor clarifications (that border on nitpicking) </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Circular motion isn't strictly required! For non-circular orbits, the electron would lose and gain kinetic energy every orbit, but the overall energy (kinetic+potential) should still say the same. This, for any orbital motion, a particle should not lose or gain energy without some other reason. (EM waves, gravitational waves, etc.) </p>
</li>
<li>I'm not exactly sure what you mean by frequency, but assuming you mean the frequency in the exponential term in the wavefunction, electrons do not necessarily need to exist in multiple energy levels. In fact, if you tried looking at the electron, you'll &quot;collapse the wavefunction&quot; or &quot;become entangled with the electron&quot; (depending on your interpretation of quantum mechanics) and thus if you observed the electron it would always be in a discrete energy level with a specific frequency. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for helping to clarify! Like I said, this is coming to the limits of my physics knowledge.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the first point, I was trying to suggest that the movement is approximately circular (e.g. elliptical, etc.). I like your explanation though.</p>
</li>
<li>For the second point, by frequency I was referring to the likelihood that the electron would exist in any given location in the cloud. As per my understanding, there are many (infinitely?) different places the electron could occur, but the probability of it existing in any of those places is not consistent for every position. This isn't strictly relevant to the discussion at hand. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you can't really understand quantum probabilities as &quot;how often a particle visits a particular area of space&quot;, as the particle is not really considered to exist as a localised point particle when not being observed in many interpretations of quantum mechanics. In other words, a rather common view is that the various parts of the wavefunction aren't really being visited with varying frequency. The wavefunction is the particle. </p>
<p>There are of course those who believe otherwise, but it isn't immediately obvious which side is right. </p></div>		</li>
