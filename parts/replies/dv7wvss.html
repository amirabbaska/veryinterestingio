<p>a written document (such as a diary) written voluntarily is not &quot;testimony&quot;, it's &quot;evidence&quot;. testimony is when you talk in court or to the authorities, and are cross-examined. if you are forced to do this, they are forcing you to testify against yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes the case for an electronic diary to be heavily password protected, then.  Unlike a phone's 4 digit code, a document could easily be protected to the point of making it all but impossible to crack.  I just ran the passphrase for mine (which includes multiple numerals and punctuation) through an online PW strength checker and despite being able to type it from memory in about 4 seconds it says estimates it would take ~255 decillion years to crack.</p>
<p>Being that they would need some inference that evidence was contained in it to begin with (which would be unlikely if properly named), even if they did find the file they would have issues compelling production of the password.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I won't give the exact amount, but given that the passphrase is well north of 30 characters plus the character usage (and when allowed, I sometimes even use high-ascii characters), it's probably close enough to reality to work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The police and courts can compel you to provide that password though, because that electronic diary is evidence, and their warrant is valid for it, just like you would have to provide the physical key to a safe if they had a warrant.</p>
<p>Not providing that password would open you up to contempt of court charges, and in the main trial could be used against you as well, under the reasonable assumption that the evidence in your electronic journal was damning enough that you preferred contempt of court penalties to giving up the damning information.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This gets into the &quot;of the mind&quot; part of the equation that flips the issue from 4th to 5th Amendment questions.  Even if they know OF the diary, unless they have probable cause that incriminating info is in there they can't compel anything.  Do do otherwise would allow things like, &quot;You just got arrested for DUI, now give up the passwords for the laptop in the trunk,&quot; and the like.</p>
<p>Every time someone has been compelled to decrypt, there has already been probable cause independently established.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>good question.</p>
<p>basically, out of court statements that are OPPOSED to the interest of a party are admissible by the OTHER party. </p>
<p>out of court statements that are in FAVOR of the interest of a party are NOT admissible by the party who MADE THEM.</p>
<p>the reason for this is that if you say something opposed to your interest before trial, and at trial you are saying something different or being silent, the other party should have the right to bring up your previous statements.</p>
<p>on the other hand, if you what you said before is just consistent with what you are saying now, then introducing your previous statements is not really valuable - it is basically &quot;oath helping&quot;. it is also a sneaky way to put evidence on the record without exposing yourself to cross-examination.</p>
<p>there are exceptions to this rule. &quot;hearsay&quot; is  one of the most complicated parts of the law of evidence.</p></div>		</li>
