			<div class="markdown"><p>If by similar systems you mean autonomous diagnostic AI, we are working on autonomous AI for other diseases of the eye, especially glaucoma and macular degeneration. More in the future, Alzheimer as detected/diagnosed from retinal changes, cardiovascular disease, as well as diseases outside of the eye.</p>

<p>More general, objective inputs are crucial here. So the more objective the inputs to the AI, the better. That is why digital image based inputs are so attractive - very little subjectivity to pixel intensity.</p>

<p>Where it is physicians listening to patients speak and typing that in, objective inputs are more difficult to achieve.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously I'm not Prof.Abramoff, but I would follow this up and say these types of AI systems are currently a significant part of Stroke research, and neuroimaging in general.  AI can be trained quite effectively to recognize clots or bleeds in the brain, which is crucial to treatment decision making.  It is also an area where we have a lack of trained specialists, so AI has strong potential to bridge that gap.</p></div>		</li>
