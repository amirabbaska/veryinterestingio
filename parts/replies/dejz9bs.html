			<div class="markdown"><p>Real world example of single channel plain text is the medevac net. Seems kind of odd to have something as serious as that be unencrypted and i still dont know for sure why it is the way it is. Ive gotten several different reasons....</p>
<p>As far as the exercise goes, our primary net was freq hop cypher text. The frequency manager would not allow us the use one of his freqs so we did what we had to do in order to privide means of communication between my unit and our higher command...with their approval.</p></div>		</li>

<p>AKA stopped at the gate.  Probably at this point the Commander was called and some words were exchanged. </p></div>		</li>
