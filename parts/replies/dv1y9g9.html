			<div class="markdown"><p>Chosin, where the Marine Corps abandoned an Army unit fighting to cover the Corps retreat and later went on to claim glory while belittling and insulting that Army unit, despite the fact that the Army fought hard and delayed the Chinese long enough for the Corps to retreat safely. The Chinese even later commended that Army unit on their tenacity, but thanks to the Corps PR campaign most have never heard about it. It's the worst example of what happens when interbranch rivalry is placed before the mission.</p></div>		</li>
