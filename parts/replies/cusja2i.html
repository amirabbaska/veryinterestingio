<p>That's awesome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a case of a Dolphin, who was trained to pick up trash and receive a fish for each piece, who had planned ahead by hiding a piece of trash and ripping off smaller parts of it to hand in for multiple fish over time. </p>
<p>I can only find this as a source, it seems the original source was from a wildlife magazine though. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/jul/03/research.science" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/jul/03/research.science</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few days ago, I read about a small pod of Dolphins that herded up 3-4 humans who were diving at the time. One of the dudes tried to break away from them, but two of the larger dolphins herded him back and kept the humans in a little protective circle.</p>
<p>Turns out, there was a great white shark just feet away from them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just watching The Life of Mammals by BBC featuring David Attenborough and one of the more astonishing things I took away from it is that many Mammals plan for winter/drought/hard times.  Other examples of planners include foxes and beavers; not primates at all.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that was a real breakthrough, because he wasn't stressed by the visitors at the time he was stockpiling stones.</p>
<p>So he was planning ahead, not just for the ballistics, but also his future state of being upset by the visitors.</p>
<p>On the other hand, great apes include a lot of particle physicists and pure mathematicians.</p></div>		</li>
