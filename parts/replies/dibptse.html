			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I don't understand about Bell's theorem: how can you disprove the existence of unknown/hidden variables? In the case of OP's question, how do we know something as-yet discovered is driving the time of decay? </p>
<p>I'm well aware that I'm probably trying to apply a classical way of thinking here, but I'm having trouble understanding it in this case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>John von Neumann &quot;proved&quot; that hidden variables theories are impossible, in 1932. </p>
<p>Grete Hermann found a flaw in his proof in 1935, but the physics community didn't notice until fifty years later, and as you can see from the other comments here, the general public still hasn't caught up.</p>
<p>Von Neumann's theorem rules out certain types of hidden variables theories, but not others. The 'pilot wave' theory is an example of a hidden variable interpretation of QM that isn't excluded by Bell's inequalities or with von Neumann's article.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In one sentence: you do a bit of statistics and realise that &quot;hidden variables&quot; will give a certain result, whereas &quot;completely random&quot; gives a different result, then you do an experiment and the result for that disproves the &quot;hidden variables&quot; theory. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mind is revolting at this, but you've given me something to think and learn more about.  I don't understand how you could differentiate chaotic and pure randomness.  Very intriguing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It only disproves certain types of hidden variables theories. There are others that work just fine, such as the 'pilot wave' theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic idea is describing a system in a way with hidden variables and in a quantum mechanical way and showing that these descriptions are not compatible. </p>
<p>Description1:</p>
<p>Lets say you have two objects O^1 and O^2 that have three properties A,B,C (e.g.: size, colour, weight) that take one of two values (big/small, red/green, light/heavy) that can be described by either 0 or 1. These are our hidden variables. Now we demand that both objects are identical in all three properties (statement I) and put them in two different boxes. From this, one can derive in a straight forward way the following inequality for what you will find by opening the boxes (measuring): </p>
<p>P(A^1 =B^2 )+P(A^1 =C^2 )+P(B^1 =C^2 )&gt;1 or =1</p>
<p>where P(X^1 =Y^2 ) is the probability that property X of O^1 and Y of O^2 have the same value (both 0 or both 1). </p>
<p>Description 2:</p>
<p>Now we do the same thing but with the difference that our properties A,B,C are defined in a quantum mechanical way. Namely, they are projectors living on a 2 dimensional hilbert space H=span{|0&gt;,|1&gt;}. The whole system (both boxes) can be described as the product of two such hilbert spaces. If you define the three projectors A,B,C in the right way, then you can find a state living on this combined hilbert space that fulfills statement I from above but violates the inequality from above when you calculate the probabilities in the usual quantum mechanical way.</p>
<p>Therefore description 1 (hidden variables) and 2 (quantum mechanics) are not compatible.</p>
<p>You can prepare photons in an entangled state that resembles this whole analogy. By conducting the experiment one finds that the predictions by description 2 but not 1 are compatible with the measurements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is one issue with this: observation changes reality. Researchers have placed unstable isotopes under observation before and they have consistently been shown not to decay. Even well beyond their normal half-lives into the range of multiple full lives of samples of such an isotope. It is impossible to know when such an atom will decay, but you also cannot slap it under a microscope and find out.</p></div>		</li>
