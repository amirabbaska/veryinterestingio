			<div class="markdown"><p>Your post is sound apart from this bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's necessary to compress something (change its volume) to introduce energy (which, in part, increases temperature). </p>

<p>The whole point (which you are otherwise making perfectly well) about adiabatic temperature increase is that no energy is <del>introduced</del> (Edit: no energy is exchanged between fluids, but additional energy is required for it to be compressed).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm it's been a long time since I took thermodynamics. So in adiabatic (no heat transfer through the walls of your control volume iirc) you compress the gas. You would be then performing work, thus introducing energy into the system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please excuse me, I think you're right on that account. Work has been done, and this is the only means of energy transfer taking place. Perhaps I could state it better that: <strong>no exchange of energy takes place with the surrounding fluid</strong>. It is a higher confining energy density which forces a higher temperature to exist, but I wanted to emphasise that the fluid is not being actually heated, which is a common misconception. </p></div>		</li>
