			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't really quantify &quot;how close&quot; we are to a proof very precisely. It could be tomorrow, could be a thousand years from now, we won't know until we actually have the proof. I could see it taking about 50-100 years to prove it is normal in base 10 or 16, but that's my gut and someone more familiar with the problem might have a different gut feeling. Depends a lot on how many people want to spend time working on the problem.</p>
<p>As for possible methods, <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/163451/normality-of-pi-in-base-16" target="_blank">this</a> Math StackExchange post discusses a possible avenue and a rephrasing of the problem into a framework something with a little more tools.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can see how an irrational number could, at least in theory, be normal in one (rational) base and not in another, assuming one base isn't a power of the other. But is that a common thing at all? It seems obvious that the vast majority (i.e. approaching 100%) of irrational numbers are normal in every rational base, so I imagine it would be a great surprise for pi to be normal in one rational base and not another. Would it also be a surprise if a proof worked for one base and not another?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't really gauge but a proof can get more probable over time because you find equal formulations of it. For example saying a matrix A is invertible means there is a matrix A^-1 such that A^-1 A = I where I is the identity matrix. This is equal to saying that the determinant of A is not zero. Now you have two ways of proving that A is invertible. Either you find a Matrix A^-1 or you prove that its determinant is not zero.</p>
<p>When there are more and more ways to prove something, actually proving it can get easier. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This number being normal in base 10. Not in most other bases.</p>
<p>I believe typically when one speaks of number being normal or not, the question is if it's normal in all bases. Otherwise you'd have a property of a number being dependent on number system we happen to have chosen, which is really bothersome in how unelegant it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious; how can there even <em>be</em> an absolutely normal number? </p>
<p>Assume an absolutely normal number <em>x</em>. Now in base <em>x</em> the number will be 10, thus not normal.</p>
<p>I assume a number is absolutely normal if it is normal in every <em>integer</em> base.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Normal by definition in base 10, but as yet unprovably so in others.</p>
<p>I would conjecture that it ought to be normal in all other bases due to being both irrational and defined in such a way that it only has obvious structure in bases that are powers of 10... but I'd be equally willing to retract that given a pointer to something obvious that I've missed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let <em>x</em> be a normal number. Take some finte sequence of digits 'a'. Assume it only occurs finitely many times in the decimal expansion of <em>x</em>, say <em>n</em> times. Then let 'A' consist of the sequence 'a' repeated <em>n+1</em> times. Since 'a' only occured <em>n</em> times, 'A' cannot occur in the decimal expansion of <em>x</em>. But since <em>x</em> was normal, 'A' has to occur. So we have derived a contradiction, and we see that 'a' has to occur infinitely many times in the decimal expansion of <em>x</em>. Since 'a' was arbitrary, we conclude that any finite sequence of digits occurs infinitely many times in the decimal expansion of <em>x</em>. </p>
