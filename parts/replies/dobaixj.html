<p>If the sample is segregating, mixing won't help too much. If you have an heterogeneous mixture, mixing might help a little bit by allowing you to take the same proportion of each phase all the times, but an analysis of 2 phases is rather difficult anyways. The point of mixing is in the case that the mixture <strong>is</strong> homogeneous (it's not actively segregating), but wasn't correctly mixed before. For example: you add water, and afterwards isopropanol. If you stir a little bit you might have something that looks mixed and homogeneous, but still has some layers of water near the bottom or the walls of the container that are enriched in water respect to the alcohol. If you know your mixture is completely miscible, mixing can help you with that kind of error. But if your mixture is segregating, it won't help too much.</p>

<p>Segregation happens in a proportion (molar fraction). So if in 1 ml sample 1% of your alcohol segregates from the main solution, you will see 1% on a 10 litre tank in the same conditions. Of course the amount of mass is different, but usually the amount sampled is proportional to the amount existing on the container (in a 1 ml vial you can sample 1 ul to GC/MS, but in a 1000 l container you don't usually get 1 ul, but perhaps 100 ml). Another thing is that the 1% on the 10 litre tank can be probably seen by the naked eye, meanwhile a 10 ul segregation on a 1 ml vial might go unnoticed easily.</p>

<p>This usually happens when you break the surface of the liquid (vigorous shaking). If you just stir for a minute, not too hard, this is minimized. Also, the higher amount of analyte in the headspace is not in equilibrium, so after a time it will return to the solvent. If you shake hard and open just after doing it, what you say is true, you might lose a bit of analyte. If you stir without breaking the surface and let it rest for a few minutes afterwards, the losses are minimized. Anyway, this applies under two suppositions: The mixture is not actively segregating, it was only just poorly mixed (on the other case stirring won't help much, as I explained above), and also that the error you might have for the tiny amount of losses is too small compared with the error of a poorly mixed solution. If you are analysis trace amounts of CFCs on 1 ml water samples... It's a bad idea to shake. If you are analyzing the amount of iPrOH on a 50% mixture in a 10 ton tank that is very hard to &quot;shake&quot;, stirring might make a poorly mixed liquid to mix better (in case it wasn't) before the analysys, and losses are not important at all, as they will be too tiny to notice.</p>
<p>Everything depends on the sample, amounts, analytes... It's difficult to find a solution to a problem without knowing it perfectly. The above are just suggestions that may, or may not, be applicable to this problem, and I expect the OP to adapt them to his specific conditions. They are not &quot;unquestionable rules or protocols&quot;, but just ideas to try. Also, in general, aqueos solutions and molten metals behave very differently, as you don't have a lot of possible phases. Usually liquids are miscible or not, and solids are soluble up to a point. Sometimes things get a little bit more complicated with 2 phases, but those are exceptions, not the usual. Finally, I talk about my experience in a synthesis laboratory, where we worked with samples in the range of 10-1000 mg and volumes ranging 1ul-100 ml. On higher scales there might be better procedures I'm not aware of.</p></div>		</li>
