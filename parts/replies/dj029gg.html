<p>It seems very uncanny that there are what appear to be 30 different processes, that all produce photons following an extremely specific and predicable pattern. And it seems more uncanny that all roughly 30 of these process can determine the exact distribution of of color you get based on temperature.</p>
<p>That's a bit like hiring 30 different painters all with different styles and methods and they all produce perfect replicas of of the Mona Lisa.</p>
<p>One does not simply... 'emit' a photon by many seemingly wildly unrelated phenomenon all resulting in the exact same wavelength of photon being produced. After all what gives an object color normally gives wildly different colors when you change the method of emission, and tends not to change with temperature as far as I know.</p>
<p>What mechanism assigns the wavelength to black body photons on a quantum level? Why is this mechanism so consistent despite being a result of so many emission methods which vary wildly in their magnitude?</p>
<p>The Bremsstrahlung Emission page was actually quite good as it did provide the first quantum level description of such an emission I've seen including describing the component that assigns wavelength (I think). However their description is... well an equation with 300 different operators. It's a bit hard to process. </p>
<p>I'm curious overall about the exact quantum process that regulates black body wavelength, and what the common thread among multiple emission methods is regarding wavelength. It seems quite odd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>30? No, there are nearly countless many, but they can be grouped into different families.</p>
<p>If you have only one atom or one molecule then you have a narrow range of processes to store energy and to release that energy as EM radiation. But once you have a lot of atoms and molecules then you have processes <em>between</em> them that can store and release energy. The rest is just statistical processes and thermodynamics. If you have a sample of atoms/molecules that are all interacting with one another they will naturally come to an equilibrium level of average &quot;thermal&quot; energy. This is just the concept of &quot;temperature&quot;. All of the processes that <em>can</em> store energy will participate and come to an average level, because they're constantly giving up and acquiring some of that energy constantly. So the energy states will exist along a continuum around an average with some at a lower level and some at a higher level. Those energy storing states can release their energy as they transition to other states, and in doing so release photons. The photons will then have a characteristic spectrum that is dependent on the statistical spread of energy states, and this is where the concept of the black body spectrum comes from.</p>
<p>The reason why it's consistent is the same as the reason why radioactive half-lives are consistent: statistical processes that involves gobs and gobs of individual participatory elements (atoms/molecules or nuclei). Even a few hundred or a few thousand elements is enough for statistical processes to start dominating the overall characteristics of a sample of stuff, and yet even a trillion atoms is a very, very small amount of matter (roughly in the picograph range). There is such a colossally enormous number of atoms in macroscopic samples of stuff that these statistical aspects become dominant. Consider, for example, the number of molecular orbitals in a sample of metal. As you increase the number of atoms you increase the number of orbitals, and you increase the number of available energy states until you have a densely packed &quot;band&quot; of orbitals. Lots of similar examples for other processes (like phonons) in various materials, and it's this that creates the huge number of available energy states that essentially helps store thermal energy in a system.</p>
<p><a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/59825/4578" target="_blank">This stackexchange answer</a> might help you understand what's going on a bit more.</p>
<p>Note that not all conditions of arrangements of matter will allow for black body emission behavior. In low density gases there wouldn't be enough energy storage mechanisms coupled to thermal processes to allow for filling out the full spectrum, only some energy levels will be represented (emission lines). In dense materials you have lattice vibrations and other variations in the electron density field that are quantized into a sufficiently large number of different states to fill out the black body spectrum.</p></div>		</li>
