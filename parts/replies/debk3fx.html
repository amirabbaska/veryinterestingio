			<div class="markdown"><p>Body farms are places where scientists can put dead bodies in different situations to learn about fun things, like how fast a body will decompose in different situations. For instance, they can put a body in the trunk of a car and light the car on fire, recording the data over months. Now, when they find you hog tied in the back of your mothers torched Mazda, they can tell how long you've been there by comparison. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>A body farm is a research facility where decomposition can be studied in a variety of settings. They were invented by an anthropologist named William Bass in 1980, after he had realized how little was known about decomposition of the human body.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They let cadavers decompose in the open and conduct experiments on the rate of decomposition for various factors. I believe the research is helpful for forensic science</p>
<p>I remember seeing a documentary on the subject years ago, shouldn't be too hard to find</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I highly recommend donating your body to science.  Look up your local medical school followed by the words &quot;willed body program&quot; or &quot;donor body program&quot;.  For example &quot;UCSF willed body program&quot; will take you to willedbodyprogram.ucsf.edu .  Medical students really appreciate the opportunity to learn from the donated bodies.  You will get the chance to teach a doctor so much.  Then your body will be respectfully cremated or disposed of.  They will NOT end up hanging in a classroom middle school classroom.  Those skeletons are now mostly manufactured, don't believe the bully trying to scare you with that myth.  </p>
<p>My father registered, told us and donated his body, and I can still imagine him looking into a new medical student's eyes and (almost) whispering &quot;you got that, now what's this over here? You'll need to know that one.&quot;  </p>
<p>There are a few other bonuses.  It's free, there are no costs to the family of the deceased.   a funeral parlor and find out all the costs associated with transportation, paperwork, casket, viewing, embalming. Easily thousands of dollars, not to mention the cemetery costs.  When you donate your body, you won't have any of these costs. Your family member registers ahead of time. You or someone calls the donor program when the family member dies, and the medical school will take care of organising and paying for  picking up the body.  Then you know that they are in great hands and doing something important for humanity in their death.  </p>
<p>It's also a great way to give back, to make up for the things you did while you were alive- if that's how you feel about your life.</p>
<p>The best part is knowing that your loved one is helping out really enthusiastic medical student and faculty, and not alone in a hole 6 feet deep.</p></div>		</li>
