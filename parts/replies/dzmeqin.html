			<div class="markdown"><p>AMD decided to get out of OpenCL and start their own GPGPU processing language (because they want to lock software to their platforms, like CUDA is to nVidia). That's a really bad decision, but they are not known to making good decisions.</p>
<p>Intel is simply not providing enough raw computing power for the Watt, nor for the dollar. They persists in full x86 retro compatibility which is too big of a burden (but great for old software industry) and full cache coherency which is wasting a terrifying amount of their chip.</p>
<p>Nvidia has been the leader of GPGPU thanks to CUDA being first on the market. And there is so much software available for free based on CUDA it makes their platforms really attractive for new comers. They recently made their compiler and latest chip full compatible with C++ which I see being the killer language of the future.</p>
<p>Xilinx is doing surprisingly great on that front. They are building their software tools and software stack for machine learning. But their chip is way too expensive for new comers, and that is going to make their adoption slow, and they will need to beat Intel (which bought Altera). I never tried the FPGA on cloud though, that seems like it would solve that problem, but I guess people are busy mining crypto on that front...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh? OpenCL works on literally anything, even CPUs. It works on Intel, nVidia, AMD GPUS. </p>
<p>Intel is providing <em>fucking amazing</em> compute power for the watt. Their iGPUs rival many low-end GPUs... attached to a CPU... consuming less than 5W.</p>
<p>Please learn what the fuck you're talking about.</p></div>		</li>
