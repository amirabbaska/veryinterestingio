<p>I want pockets in my pants!<br />
<em>pants with pockets developed</em><br />
They're too lumpy/bulky! I want them to be less lumpy/bulky!<br />
<em>pockets are reduced in size or removed</em><br />
I want pockets in my pants!</p>
<p>While surely not all of them, I'd guess a large portion of the demographic want pants that have pockets and also look nice, which in the end is either contradictory, too expensive to make or some other reason. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found a shop called “white stuff” in the uk. They have pockets in practically all their dresses. Either hidden or little front pouches. </p>
<p>Great,  amazing. </p>
<p>It’s a tad Pricey but I bought some sale stuff. My mum warned me that when I wash it, look after it because it might shrink. </p>
<p>So I was super careful. I Washed on a delicate 30C wash and dried laid flat on a rack. Fucking shrank. </p>
<p>So. As much as I love all of their clothing designs. And was willing to pay more for them, I will never shop there again because it’s shit material. You pay for the label not the quality. </p>
<p>Sorry , that turned into a rant. I’m very bitter about my ruined pocket dresses. Thought I’d found my go to shop :( </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought about doing this but it’s an expensive gamble. </p>
<p>There’s no way to tell how it will shrink. I bought two and justified the spend as they were to wear to my new office job that I was very excited about.
One just got a bit more snug all over but was loose fitting to start because I liked that fit. Maybe not exactly what I want to be wearing to work now as it’s stretched a bit too tight across the bust!</p>
<p>The second just lost length. Like it shrank an inch or two. I bought it grazing my knees and now if I lean over i would show my knickers /ass. Not work suitable at all. </p>
<p>So I may still wear either of them to other social  events but I would never have spent that much on casual wear so I’m pretty gutted. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Why hasn’t some clothing manufacture thought to corner that market and start making clothes with good pockets?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They absolutely have tried that. However, those clothes do not sell. It turns out women value flattering, form-fitting clothes over those with pockets.</p></div>		</li>
