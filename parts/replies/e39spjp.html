			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what type of lifting you are doing, really. Generally, for strength, sets of anywhere from 5-1 reps at a very high working percentage (85-95% your one-rep max) the ideal rest period between sets is 3-5 min, per American College of Sports Medicine guidelines. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should revisit those guidelines, as they've been revised.  The latest data is pretty conclusive that the old 'recommended ranges' are not actually that important.  IE there is an equal amount of muscle hypertrophy between high-weight/low-rep training and low-weight/high-rep training.  There are likely energy system-related benefits to altering training load for the high weight/low-rep approach, but in terms of muscle hypertrophy the only two factors that are proving to be important are time and tension - that is, as long as the product of how much time the muscle is under tension and how much tension the muscle creates is the same, the actual structuring of the load isn't important (to be clear, for hypertrophy only).  It was talked about in several sessions at the last national ACSM conference.  </p></div>		</li>
