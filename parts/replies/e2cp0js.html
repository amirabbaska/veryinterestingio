			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, Ive seen more than a few funerals and other bad situations and always kept in mind that if I laughed about something, it was a defense mechanism, but I never thought about it taking over that same capacity during fail videos, etc. Very interesting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to cover my mouth when I'd see someone fall because I'd laugh, it was more of a nervous laugh. However, when it's my close friends I laugh because it's funny. It's not funny that they're hurt, it's funny because usually people falling in a non-serious/lethal way is just funny. I expect people to laugh when I fall, I would feel so awkward if I fell and people's faces got serious. Best case scenario everyone laughs hysterically at me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s because it’s a signaling of safety. I’m safe you are safe, shock came but no harm, we are joyous, I mean you no harm, please don’t kill me. You are safe, we are all glad. All different expressions of “no threat here”.</p></div>		</li>
