			<div class="markdown"><p>Sandstone is a concreted mixture of sand and clay. Hawkesbury sandstone (in Sydney where I work) is typically 20% clay. It was deposited over millions of years to depths potentially many kilometers thick. This acts to squeeze all the particles together. This can be subsequently eroded to make sand again, which is where a lot of the beach sand in Sydney harbor comes from. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not always. The St. Peters Sandstone of Wisconsin (and other less important states) has a Vsh &lt; 2%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sandstone does come from sand, but sand can come from a variety of sources.</p>
<p>Yes beach sand has lots of tiny invertebrates and sometimes bits of coral but not always. Sand is, by definition, lots of very small rocks. These rocks can be anything (and it does vary by a lot depending on local geology) Generally sand is made of up harder minerals like quartz, with softer ones getting worn away and washed/blown away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sand is any mineral particle between 0.05-2.00 mm diameter. Most often these are tiny quartz (silica) grains originally produced by the weathering of rocks, though it can be any mineral not just silica. </p>
<p>Soils are the complex layers of sediment (which may be sand or it may be clay/silt/gravel whatever), organic material, water and air (it's important for a soils to have a network of aerated pore spaces) which are capable of supporting life. Soils form in-situ, so the inorganic component is derived from the weathering of the bedrock below.</p></div>		</li>
