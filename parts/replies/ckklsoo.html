			<div class="markdown"><p>I have daily headaches for as long as I can remember, and I couldn't find a cause for them. Only recently I realized that every part of my body can go easily numb if I don't move it (arms, legs, etc.), and it probably correlates to my headaches? I always noticed that when I move, sometimes, my headache is not as bad as it is when I lie down. And when I sit down for a long time (reading a book/watching a TV), I slowly get a headache.</p>
<p>It may also explain why every morning right after I wake up, I get a really bad headache for a few minutes (because I didn't move all night)?</p>
<p>Is this called- vascular spasm? How can it be treated?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have similar issues.  Nine times out of ten I wake up with a headache.  I hate it.  It keeps me from going to sleep a lot of the time because deep down I know when I wake up I will feel horrible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No your symptoms likely do not have a pathophysiological basis in not moving. Morning headaches and headaches worst when laying flat are red flag signs, especially when associated with nausea and vomiting. Chat with your doctor. Also, get your eyesight checked if reading and TV are troublesome.</p></div>		</li>
