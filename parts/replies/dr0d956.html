			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer I was looking for. I have a 4WD Truck and my gf has an AWD car. I was trying to explain to her why I can’t always have 4WD on, for instance while speeding on a highway or how turning into parking spots is difficult if I’ve accidentally turned it on. It also explains why my vehicle is better suited for off road conditions. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are more modern versions of 4WD that allow somewhat higher speeds than in years past. I know some Jeep's are safe at 55 mph (this is a part time 4WD system operating in high range). There are also full time 4WD that use clutches or differentials which are devices that mechanically allow the wheels to turn at different speeds and remain contorllable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was true to an extent. </p>
<p>It is kind of broader then that though. 4wd is usually selectable, and can (doesn't) have to lock the front and rear drive shafts together (At the transfer case/center differential). A jeep locks them, while a toyota usually doesn't. A toyota might have an additional center diff lock. Both are 4wd vehicles.</p>
<p>Awd is a more general &quot;all the wheels are connected/powered&quot; and usually all the time, meaning not selectable. This can be reactive like in a honda crv where there is a viscous clutch on the rear driveshaft. Or like a golf R which utilizes an electronic management system so send power to whichever wheel it wants.</p>
<p>4wd will be your more robust/stronger system. While Awd will be found on cars and such primarily for light duty traction needs.</p>
<p>A key note: When you lock a differential, be it front rear or center, those parts then spin at the same speed. Bad for turning and driving on high traction surfaces. Great for low traction.</p>
<p>An awd generally will have open diffs which is great for turning and driving on high traction surfaces because it allows the tires to spin &quot;independently&quot; of each other, alleviating some of the stresses that may arise. What sucks about ANY vehicle with an open diff would be this situation: One wheel is on surface with traction, one wheel is on ice. The wheel on ice will spin for ever, while the wheel with traction won't budge. This is due to your open diff. This can turn your &quot;4wd&quot; into a two or even 1wd vehicle in the perfect scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Limited slip diffs can help in the situation you describe depending on how much torque they are able to redirect to the wheel with grip. This is done either actively using sensors and selective/reactive braking, clutches, or passively through viscous couplings or torsen diffs. The problem is these systems often take time to vector the torque to the good wheel, and usually only provide a fraction of the torque.  </p>
<p>Enter lockers. Lockers will force both left and right (or front and rear in the case of a center diff/transfer case) to turn together. Problem is the driver needs to know when to engage and disengage the locker. If you leave it engaged on dry roads it will chew up your tires or cause other $$ damage. Automatic lockers are available but they negatively affect the steering agility of the car due to counterproductive torque transfer during a turn (inside wheel is powered during a turn). </p>
<p>One of the solutions I came up with (and patented) to solve the above issues, flips the problem on its head - instead of trying to detect and then intervene to stop wheel slip, we start with a locked diff, and then strictly govern the allowable differential rotation (delta in rpm) between the two wheels to be within a plausible range for a given steering angle and vehicle speed. Anything beyond the plausible delta rpm would indicate wheel slip and would not be allowed. For more info, look up “sparc drive” and “steering fusion”. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wildcard: 2004 Volkswagen R32 which uses the Haldex system; no center differential, and the gearbox has twin output shafts. Slippage occurs in the electronically actuated multi-plate wet clutch internal to the rear differential (Haldex unit). So weird, but really does work well. Some Volvos and Audis use this as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4wd has both front and rear driveshafts locked together while in 4wd so they turn at the same rate. AWD has a center differential that lets the front and rear drive shaft turn at different speeds. This is needed when driving on pavement around corners as the front wheels take a different, wider curve when turning. 4wd doesn’t need this as it’s for offroad only and the dirt allows a bit of slip anyways. </p>
<p>In almost all 4 wheeled vehicles the left and right tires are able to turn at different speed thanks to the differential. The exception to this is if the vehicle is equipped with a spool or locker. These physically lock the left/right axles together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to add to this - you have a center differential, but also pretty much all modern cars have front and back differentials.  An alternative to this is something like an Ackermann steering geometry, but differentials tend to be more popular due to ease of computer control (for things like traction control AKA PosiTraction)</p></div>		</li>

<p>a four-wheel-drive car generally has its wheel all turning at the same rate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not true. This only happens if your vehicle has a <a href="http://www.4x4abc.com/4WD101/diff_locks.html" target="_blank">locking differential</a>, and only when you engage it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They require a trained and experienced driver to operate them properly. Untrained use may cause more harm than good. Improper use on pavement may cause death or injury. Improper use off-road may cause component failure or severe difficulties to maneuver the truck.</p>
<p>Ideally, differentials should be (manually) locked before traction is lost and wheels start spinning.They need to be switched off immediately after passing through a tough off-road section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Traditionally, the difference between four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive is that four-wheel drive vehicles made for off-road use have a two-speed <a href="http://www.fourwheeler.com/how-to/68958-how-transfer-cases-work/" target="_blank">transfer case</a> that essentially gives you a lower range of gears when needed. The driver usually has a selector to <a href="https://www.autocodes.com/qa/?qa=blob&amp;qa_blobid=4758664233338289728" target="_blank">choose between 2WD, 4Hi and 4Lo</a>.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there's another difference between 4WD and AWD, in that many AWD systems are now automatic AWD systems, marketed as &quot;Real time AWD&quot; and &quot;Intelligent AWD.&quot; In normal driving situations, these behave as 2WD systems, with all the power going to only one axle (front or rear). They only start supplying power to the other axle when the primary axle loses traction. They revert back to 2WD once both axles are going the same speed again.</p>
<p>4WD vehicles send power (torque) to all four wheels all the time (unless you choose to switch to 2WD mode).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this is right. It sounds like you're explaining the difference between a fully locking diff, a semi locking diff and a limited slip differential. I'm pretty sure that your explanation about city driving is wrong. Why would using only the rear diff even fix the problem you introduce?</p>
<p>I have limited hand on experience but I always thought that 4wd meant it had 2 diffs and awd meant it had a rear diff and a transfer case or some other sort of non-diff mechanism for the front wheels. It can't disconnect the front since there isn't a front diff. </p>
<p>I'm like 95 percent confident in the first paragraph. Less confidence in the definition in the second. </p>
<p>Edit: /u/rootbeer_cigarettes explained the second part to me. I thought AWD cars didn't have front diffs. Actually they just often have trans axles so the diff is hidden.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, this top voted answer is incorrect. 4WD vehicles can have all wheels engaged without any diff locks engaged, in fact, many do - especially in Australia.</p>
<p>The difference between 4WD and AWD is torque distribution; a true 4WD system will be able to provide an equal amount of torque to each wheel of the vehicle. Whereas an AWD system will provide in most cases less torque to the rear axle than the front, due to the arrangement of the centre diff or propshaft gearing. Many have a torque split of 70/30 or 60/40, but it's becoming more common to see distributions close to 90/10.</p>
<p>The reason this is done is cost saving. Manufacturers want to check the box for an AWD system, but the money to invest in rear drivetrain equipment is costly, so they increase the torque bias to the front such that the rear can have its torque reduced and have lower strength attached equipment. Enough to get you out of the snow or mud, but not enough to go rock crawling of offroading with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t a complete definition of the difference. My Subaru is full time AWD, but has a 50/50 front/rear torque split when it’s in 1st or 2nd gear, and can send something like 80% of the torque to the rear axle if the front is slipping.</p>
<p>Maybe AWD implies electronic LSD and 4wd is a traditional mechanical LSD?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Argh I always misunderstood 4wd to be that if you get 3 wheels stuck. The fourth wheel still has power and can turn independently to get you out. I've even heard it can get the power of the other wheels if they're stuck or raised off the ground</p>
<p>But now that I think about it, that's what an LSD is doing not 4wd system</p>
<p>So really the difference between an AWD and 4wd is how the front and back wheels are separately locked?</p>
<p>So basically I thought 4 WD meant 4 wheels turn independently with equal or more power</p>
<p>AWD equals front pair turn independently to rear pair and may also have lsds between them. But the main difference is that the power delivery to the front and back pair are separate</p></div>		</li>
