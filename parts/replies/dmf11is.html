			<div class="markdown"><p>I eliminated as much sugar as possible and kept carbs as low as I could, around 50-80g of carbs a day, eating fruit is good but try to avoid fruit juice. Your diet sounds good however, maybe upping the exercise will tire you out more and give you a more rewarding sleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an average diet too, I get about 6-7 hours of sleep and I go to the gym every morning (7am), but there are days when I feel tired? Why is that so?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, a while back I started the Nutrisystem program to lose weight (yeah it works) and immediately my sleep was better. It's was an incredible difference. I've always had difficulty sleeping and getting up. What, when (and if) I eat after dinner makes a huge difference in my sleep quality. No food at least an hour and a half before bed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i noticed you didnt mention breakfast</p>
<p>so what time in the evening on average are you eating dinner?</p>
<p>it is possible you have shifted your normal metabolic processes by skipping breakfast, having a bigger lunch, then eating a later dinner</p>
<p>this means your metabolism is active most in the evening (a time period where it should be the most inactive) causing you to be more &quot;energized&quot; at sleep time which can result in a less restful sleep because instead of releasing hormones and doing body repair, you are still processing your food from the day</p>
<p>this could also explain why you are more tired feeling in the morning because this is the point of your lowest metabolic activity (which is traditionally when you should be asleep) so you dont feel &quot;energized&quot; until you kick your metabolism back into gear by being awake or drinking coffee</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah my breakfast doesn't exist. I eat at 11am earliest - and dinner is late at 8.00pm usually due to schedule. Interesting theory you have! </p></div>		</li>
