<li><strong>DAY 1-2</strong>
You usually sort of think that you have a cold but there are no symptoms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What you can do</strong>: </p>
<pre><code>* Get plenty of rest, preferably in bed.
* Drink plenty of fluids.
* Take paracetamol or ibuprofen to reduce and ease aches and pains.</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>DAY 2-3</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What you can do</strong>: </p>
<pre><code>* Itâ€™s probably best to stay at home to avoid spreading your cold to others. 
* Take it easy and rest if possible. 
* Keep warm and keep the atmosphere moist. 
* Drink plenty of fluids, as you will lose a lot through mucus production and possibly perspiration. 
* You could take paracetamol or ibuprofen to reduce your temperature. 
* If your throat is very sore take a cough lozenge or use a spray. 
* Avoid smoking, as it will further irritate the throat and the lining of the nose. </code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>DAY 3-5</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What you can do</strong>: </p>
<pre><code>* Continue to drink plenty of fluids.
* You can take paracetamol or ibuprofen if you still have a temperature.
* A cough is a normal function of the body as it tries to get rid of phlegm. It can be relieved with a cool drink but if it continues to be troublesome, a range of cough mixtures are available.
* Sleep with your head on a high pillow if your nose is stuffed up at night.</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>DAY 5-14+</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What you can do</strong>: </p>
<pre><code>* Go back to your normal activities.  
* Keep on with medication if you need to, until the symptoms have gone completely.</code></pre>
<p>The following are a family add on. They are very effective.</p>
<p>A GOOD tea (any tea, lemon tea, lemon and ginger tea.....) and use a GOOD,NATURAL honey as a sweetener instead of sugar. </p>
<p>OR/AND</p>
<p>Just before going to bed have a good spoon of honey with few drops of lemon on it (the fruit lemon not from the bottle) and go to sleep. Don't drink any liquid after taking that so that it works its magic in the throat while you are asleep/resting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are a parent, you need to hound your doctor relentlessly until they give you a prescription for antibiotics.  Oh sure, they will try and tell you that it's only a cold and this and that but, No!, you know your child and she is near death.  Besides, little Tammy can't get back into daycare without a prescription and you have that important &quot;lunch&quot; meeting with Bill on Thursday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other than basically limiting your exposure to the outside world, there's not much you can do.  The cold virus has had literally millions of years to get <em>really good</em> at learning how to spread and reproduce.  I guess we're just lucky it's mostly harmless, barring any sort of immune deficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I HATE colds. It's the worst torture to me. I can't convey how much I despise having one. And I used to get a fair share as my daily routine brings me in contact with many snot-nosed brats. Out of those, one or several is conspiring to pass a virus to me by hacking and sneezing on surfaces I will touch. </p>
<p>Now listen to me. In my quest for stopping the common cold I searched high and low. In January, I began taking 5,000 I.U.'s of vitamin D, DAILY! Religiously! Since January I have had two colds which is low for me. Now, even better, those colds were so mild that if I wasn't so paranoid about getting a cold I prob wouldn't have noticed a slight tickle in my throat and a slight run to my nose. And that's all the colds ever amounted to. Very, very mild. A 0.5 on a scale of ten. 5,000 I.U's. You won't regret it. </p></div>		</li>
