			<div class="markdown"><p>And that’s how we got the local holiday, “Evacuation Day” (the day the Brits high tailed it out of Boston).  It conveniently falls on March 17, so it’s mostly drunk Irish people and their fans celebrating.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of odd to think about Americans laying siege to an American city.</p>
<p>The other thing people forget about the American Revolution is that at the same time the British were fighting the Americans they were also involved in fighting against the French, Dutch, Spanish, the Maratha Empire and the Kingdom of Mysore.</p></div>		</li>
