			<div class="markdown"><p>that's essentially it, but it goes deeper. several things can be done with this button click action.</p>
<p>1) slap a tracking pixel on the part that loads when the person 'continues reading'. now you can advertise to them on the assumption that they engaged with your material.</p>
<p>2) slap a pop-up that opens when the continue reading button is pressed. offer them an opt-in for some free stuff that they might be more interested in than the article.</p>
<p>ad revenue is a shitty business model for low traffic sites and ppc arbitrage gets harder every year. the more 'sophisticated' sites are using tracking pixels to advertise relevant products and collect a commission (or they themselves own the products and pocket the profits). </p>
<p>there's even more that can be done, too. you don't have to just advertise other people's products or your own products. you can advertise more of your content. read one article? you're now in the funnel. a content funnel, leading into a sales funnel. you might be served like 10 articles through subsequent ads, hoping that you're interested enough to binge read, subscribe to a mailing list, share their articles, follow them on social media, and/or buy one of their products.</p>
<p>it can go deeper than that as well. you might decide to opt-in on a mailing list. if you purchased something, you're almost certainly on a buyer's list. you'll be getting emails from them until the end of time (or until you unsub). they'll hit you over and over with more relevant stuff. the goal is that you eventually love this company so much that you don't give a fuck that they're advertising to you day in and day out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, according to the stackexchange link he provided, some other answers mentioned down below also seem to be correct. I usually do not mind &quot;Read the Full Story&quot; button, as it often only requires you to click once... but what I absolutely do mind are those slideshow sites where clicking &quot;next&quot; means you're being taken to a new page. You bet I'll have 100% bounce rate on those. </p></div>		</li>
