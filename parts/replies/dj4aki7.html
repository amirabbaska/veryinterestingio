			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I understand the math--shape and volume just don't figure in to it, but I'm still struggling to understand intuitively <em>why</em> that is so.</p>
<p>For lack of a better way of asking...  A solid inverted cone focuses its weight at the tip, it might pierce whatever it's placed on.  If it were a container of water and someone was inside sitting at the bottom why do they not feel magnified pressure?  Where does that force &quot;go&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

The pressure will act normal (perpendicular) to the wall, so one way that you could look at it is that some of the force that was pushing down on the water underneath is now pushing on downward on the slanted wall instead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, if you're at the bottom of the ocean you could assume that the water above you would form a massive cone, but it would be supported by a massive inverted cone of water too. The two would cancel out such that you essentially end up with a pillar of water whose pressure is based solely on depth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The force goes into the conical container. If you made a giant cone then filled it with water and tried to pick it up it would weigh as much as all the water, but if you poked a hole in the bottom you would be able to stop it with your finger easily because only the water immediately on top of the hole is actually pushing down on your finger, the rest is still pushing on the rest of the cone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Force and pressure are not the same thing. Pressure is a force/area. When I was first learning fluids, I had trouble understanding this concept. The pressure of a column of fluid is only dependent on the depth of the fluid. But if you measured the force of a column of water of any shape is dependent on the total volume of the fluid. </p>
<p>So if you held a glass of water in your hand you are feeling the force of the water while if you stick your finger into the glass of water you are feeling the pressure of the water. Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this still work if the column of water has a smaller horizontal cross section?   Like a box big enough to fit a person with a small garden hose sticking 10m out the top?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it would. You could bust open a sealed 55 gal drum with a garden hose if it were tall enough coming out the top rising straight up. For every 2.3 feet of hose height you'd generate another 1 psi in the drum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So say I have a one meter cubed box with a long hose sticking out the top filled with water. The pressure I experience inside the box is the same no matter what the width of the hose is? Even though, if I doubled the width of the hose, twice as much water would be pushing down on the water in the box. </p></div>		</li>
