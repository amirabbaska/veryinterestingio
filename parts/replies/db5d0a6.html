<p>You will be compensated for that and that's where you earn your stripes but yeah, you work late.</p>
<p>That's how finance works. I've worked with finance and with analytics for all kinds of fields.</p>
<p>Pulling late nights for reports due to the European Commission because they asked for a change to your protocols? It happens.</p>
<p>I'm not even that high up, but frankly, this is how it works if you want a salary of 6 figures. You have to be awake when they need you.</p>
<p>Now, that should not be happening all the time, but it happens.</p>
<p>And as for &quot;they&quot; learning... people who have the money don't have to learn. Come on. They can get someone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked for a company like that for 6 years before I quit. I found myself very unhappy despite the money I was earning. My philosophy has changed a lot since then. It used to be &quot;Work hard, Play hard,&quot; but now it's &quot;Work to live; don't live to work.&quot; I found that I didn't get have enough time to &quot;play&quot; at all and I was bordering on depression.</p>
<p>If you can put up with it and you're happy, more power to you. Balance is so important. Sorry for the unsolicited advice; just wanted to share.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've worked for a lot of startups and companies related to the entertainment field. Both (or either) of these would require funky hours and an impossible amount of work. For example, you usually get to enjoy the Oscars or the Emmys but if your company's target audience revolves around those events, you're pretty busy during those. </p>
<p>....I still have nightmares about the 2014 NFL Draft. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your thoughts mirror mine.  I also think a lot of hiring managers in IT respect the 'hard work' over credentials attitude.  I don't have all the certs, though I do have some, I didn't have a great GPA(low B's) in college(not that anyone asks me.  Actually the opposite, I still had my grad year on there and one hiring manager told me to take it off), but I also put myself through school by working in the industry.  I am not bragging as most of my success has been from working my ass off at just the right times, I don't feel special, and the good Lord knows I'm not the smartest, just eager as hell, lucky and willing to work my ass off to try and keep up with the guys who are actually good at this stuff!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand why &quot;hard worker&quot; is valued in a lot of professions- the more time and effort someone puts into a job, the more likely they are to get it right.</p>
<p>That being said, aren't there some positions where &quot;not particularly hard-working but occasionally brilliant&quot; is much more valuable? Specially in IT, where clever, efficient and rapidly-implementable solutions should be valued. I mean, do you prefer the guy who manually edits a dataset through a self-enforced 10-hour workday, or the guy that takes 20 minutes to implement a script that does the same thing and then finishes the workday a bit early to spend more time with the wife and kids? (This is exaggerated, but I'm just trying to make a point)</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong- again, I think it's good to be motivated on the job. I just take exception to this Victorian-era factory labor mindset that someone's worth as an employee is correlated to them being a productive little engine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well two thoughts.  The first being that I am in ops and there is very little to automate because most of the issues I see are one time shit shows.  So working hard on a daily basis is more productive than being brilliant once a month.  That being said both are good at certain times.  The second thought is that the two aren't mutually exclusive.  It really depends on the job.   Of everyone I have worked with, the best word hard, but lazy workers.  When things hit they fan, they will stick it out, but they will be damn sure to make sure it never happens again.  The 'once brilliant' sometimes comes with an ego too. </p>
<p>Edit, and fuck 10 hour work days, I work my 8, all the way through, but if that's rather regular, it is time to move on</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The guy was just describing his own personal experience being interviewed for jobs I doubt he ever even interviewed a single person himself. He's giving advice as if he looks for certain characteristics and then later in a comment mentions that he happened to have those exact traits coming out of college. I wouldn't take it too seriously he just wanted to tell us he makes a lot and sleeps under his desk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look bad? No way.  Everyone loves the cookie cutter idea that you either go to school full time or you skip school.  The reality is, we each take our own paths for growth and they don't all look the same.  If you're honestly eager to learn and show that your highest aspirations aren't to just sit in your mother's basement getting high, you'll be all right.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The third reason is HARD WORK. I've interviewed people with 4.0 GPAs and interviewed people who didn't put their GPAs on their resume and it doesn't exactly matter....the GPA does stand out and you are impressed with it and can make a great tie-breaker....but that's about it. What you're gauging for is how hard does this person work. If I have someone with a high GPA who didn't do anything else and someone who didn't state their GPA on their resume who worked their way through college, was involved in greek life/clubs/activities throughout college and can tell me why they want this job....I'm picking that person. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That got me every job I had. I had to work my way through college, but I started as a janitor while in high school and never stopped working since then. Took on all kinds of roles, manual, customer service, working the till, managing people, managing field work, anything. By the time I graduated, I had a 3.2 (higher in my major) but I had also taken 18 credits on average the whole time and graduated a quarter early.</p>
<p>&quot;To save money,&quot; I replied, incredulously, the first few times.</p>
<p>They looked at ME incredulously. </p>
<p>By the time I'd graduated I had also worked as a supervisor, a manager of up to 5 people, managed cash of up to $5k/shift, and led groups, and had significant work with other students teaching, grading, or assisting.</p>
<p>Literally have never, ever had a hard time getting a job.</p>
<p>High GPAs can be really stellar achievers but I see work translating more. Even when you have a high GPA person, you often find out they worked in mom and pop's store every night for four hours after school studying to get the hell out of that situation. You better bet that individual is motivated.</p></div>		</li>
