			<div class="markdown"><p>But how come when I was playing RPGs when I was young, my sisters would scoff as they walk by and call me a nerd when they saw a screen full of stats I was trying to build up, but now, it's &quot;cool&quot; to stare at an equally complex screen of Snapchat badges or whatever to figure out how to get them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more accurate to say it feels good to get validation from other individuals with like-minded interests/activities. Getting an upvote here on Reddit means other Reddit users agree and commend your comment/post. Your sisters scoffing at you is an example of someone not within your circle seeing something &quot;other&quot; and not understanding. It would be like if you went away from your RPG and called your sisters' new dress tacky as fuck.</p>
<p>Also your sisters are diiiiiicks</p></div>		</li>

<p>After a certain point ( $100 million ) money is as much an abstraction as karma. It's just a way of keeping score.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Validation from a community, BUT, a community you care about being validated by. Nobody cares about being regarded highly by a community they don't care about.</p>
<p>With that said, the point systems are just like real-life status symbols like cars and watches. People perceive them as being impressive to other members of the community. It makes them feel valuable and important.</p></div>		</li>
