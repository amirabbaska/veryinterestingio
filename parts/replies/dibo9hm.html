<p>This isn't accurate anymore. Amex rolled out a new pricing model in 2015 (called OptBlue) that brought their costs much more in line with Visa and MC, and also allows processors to set the markup and other costs.</p>
<p>Some processors are being sneaky with it though, because businesses don't know better.</p>
<p>Businesses doing more than $1million/year in Amex transactions have to go through Amex directly, but they also negotiate better pricing at those volumes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm curious why AMEX doesn't lower their rates? They need market share, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They offer fairly good reward options through AMEX, especially if you are try to build up air miles.  This makes them very attractive to business men who do a lot of traveling.   So they are popular business credit cards. This gets people to use Amex cards.</p>
<p>Transaction fees merchants pay cover these rewards.</p>
<p>If you have a business that works with other business a lot you need to take AMEX or you business clients will go else where.</p>
<p>I own a print shop and we get much larger orders from other businesses than non-business customer.   So we accept Amex and eat the fees to keep our large accounts coming back.   If I can I will try to get these clients to sign up for a charge account.  Then we can bill them directly, usually get paid by check, and avoid the credit card fees.  Of course charge accounts offer a whole other set of problems, but that is part if the cost of doing business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you take a lot of Amex and have fees that are much higher than Visa/MC, you should check if you're getting gouged.</p>
<p>Amex rolled out a lower cost pricing model (called OptBlue) in 2015, but many processors decided to charge old higher rates and pocket the difference.</p>
<p>My company has been trying to sound the alarm on it for 2 years, but it's difficult because processors don't want their income stream interrupted, and big business chains (like the Walmarts of the world) aren't the ones getting gouged, so there isn't pressure from the retail lobbying groups.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They did, in 2015. It's called OptBlue pricing. Most businesses don't know about it, and most processors aren't interested in telling them, because it means that the processor can continue to charge the higher rate, pay Amex the lower rate, and pocket the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On your own website you say that most businesses are still on the old amex processing model and no where do you definitively break down the interchange rates on average per merchant. You only say that optBlue is similar to Visa and MasterCard in it's pricing structure and they are opportunities to still gauge merchants.  Perhaps there is more concrete information behind your paywall.  And if you have that information somewhere it would be insightful to share instead of just saying &quot;no, you are wrong&quot;</p>

<p>From an analysis point of view Amex and Discover almost have to have higher interchange rates for them to be profitable since their cardholders skew much more toward spending than revolving and their benefits are so expensive.  They make very little money from interest rates compared to subprime lenders. So almost all of their revenue has to come from interchange.  Having a high annual membership fee certainly helps.</p>
<p>Regarding negotiating interchange rates, there have been many high profile lawsuits antitrust lawsuits involving Walmart and gas stations about this very subject (not to mention another user commented on his negotiation success).  They weren't  particularly successful however all of these companies still have leverage.  For instance, Costco only accept Visa. Why? Because they ended their in-store card contract with Amex and now have one with Visa. The revenue sharing is totally negotiable in that contract.  Almost all major retailers have there own card.  Furthermore, gas stations notoriously have a cash price and card price.  As long as they advertise these prices appropriately this is legal but it certainly puts pressure on the credit card networks to have competitive pricing.</p>
