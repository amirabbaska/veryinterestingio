			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. People have explained the primary market correctly but no one seems to have talked about the secondary market.</p>
<p>When a shipping expedition asks for money from investors in exchange for a share of the profit, you give money directly to the company. This is called the primary market. And this act is the IPO (initial public offering).</p>
<p>But suppose the expedition takes 5 years to complete and you don't have the patience or capacity to wait so long, what do you do? You can just sell off your 'share' to someone else. The price at which this transaction takes place depends entirely on</p>
<p>1) How much the buyer values the investment</p>
<p>2) How desperate you are for cash.</p>
<p>So, if the prospects of profit from the expedition appears brighter now, you may actually sell at a profit. But if the news or rumour is that the ship has been hit by a storm, you might not find a buyer or may need to sell your share at a huge discount.
This is called the secondary market. And it is this market that'sâ€‹on the news everyday, that the shares are up or down etc. Your selling of the share does not directly affect the company at all. If and when the expedition returns, they will pay the share of profit to whoever is holding the share at that point in time. They don't care who it is.</p>
<p>Since companies, unlike shipping expeditions, don't have a fixed period of existence, the company declares 'dividend', which is given out of the net profit the company has made in the last year. You get a fixed amount for every share you have.</p>
<p>The company can also decide that instead of giving the profit back to the shareholders, it wants to invest it back into the business. In this case, the only way you as an investor can realise profit from holding a share of the co is by selling it to someone at a price higher than you bought it.</p>
<p>Thus, like it has been said earlier, the stock market (or the secondary market) provides the liquidity and opportunity to enter and exit a business anytime you want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. </p>
<p>In addition, IPOs are often initial investors selling out rather than companies raising new funds. Venture capital, private equity, or a mom &amp; pops may have invested in the company when it was really small. It then grew in scale to the point where public investors would be interested in owning it. The IPO is often a way of monetizing the initial investments and only a small part of the cash raised goes back into the business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>The goal of the stock market is to have the most efficient flow of buying and selling of shares for investors.</em></p>
<p>Hmm, I like the explanation over all.</p>
<p>Though, I think it's worth noting that exchanges are responsible for all kinds of financial instruments other than your typical 'shares'.</p>
<p>In addition, I think it's worth noting that this is in fact not the goal, exchanges themselves are companies, and if you're going the market based approach, means they have profit motive and the product improves in response to competitive pressures. (Not a goal in and of itself)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how does the system know how much of a company is actually for sale at any given time? It seems like there should only be a certain number of people wanting to sell at any given time. But when I want to buy stocks, I've never been told no! What gives with that? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The system receives both bids (offers to buy) and asks (asking price/offers to sell) for the company, not just at the current price but across a range. Usually bids are less than asks, which is called the bid-ask spread.</p>
<p>There may only be a certain number of people willing to buy/sell at any given price, but as price changes, number of sellers may change too. The system sees all of </p>
<p>Additionally, you have companies that are called &quot;market makers&quot;- companies whose role is to act as a buyer/seller to sellers/buyers. HFTs are market makers who use their latency advantage to match, for example, low asks on one exchange with high bids on another. </p>
<p>So there's lots of potential buyers/sellers out there, which can be seen by Apple's average daily volume (the amount it is traded), of about 25m. Unless you want to buy or sell a few million Apple stock at a go, your trading volume is a drop in the ocean and easy to accommodate without moving the market, let alone having your trade refused. To have your trade not get filled (being told no) your order would have to exceed the total of all the available sellers (or be much lower than any asking price), which would only happen in very small companies or with very large trades.</p>
<p>TLDR: As an individual investor in large companies, your trades are not very big compared to the market volume- you're never buying more stock than someone is selling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the Eli5 version I like: imagine there is a big warehouse where people can buy and sell real apples (not Apple stock in this example). Buyers enter from one side and sellers enter from the other side and there is a large curtain in the middle so buyers and sellers don't interact directly.</p>
<p>In the middle, there are a few people who go between the buyers and sellers in the parts of the curtain. These people are &quot;market-makers&quot; whose job it is to match buyers and sellers. They may buy some apples from the sellers and then go through the curtain and sell those same apples to the buyers. If they do it right, they take a small profit or &quot;spread&quot; from the difference in the price they paid for the apples and the price they sold the apples.</p>
<p>So you may think, aren't the market-makers just taking advantage of the system? What function are they really playing? You have to also realize that people are coming into the warehouse wanting to buy and sell in different quantities and at different prices. Imagine a large apple grower comes in with 10 trucks of apples but when she arrives, each buyer only wants to buy a few bushels each. She would spend all day selling her apples at a bunch of different prices. The market-maker could instead buy  her whole ten truck loads at a relatively low price and then sell them in small quantities to each buyer. Did the apple grower get the best price for her apples? No. But she did sell ALL of her apples (no guarantee that would happen without a market-maker) and at a price she was okay with. The same could happen if a person came into buy apples in large quantities, say a cider-maker. The market-maker could agree to sell 10 trucks of apples at a set price then go about sourcing that sale in the market of sellers. </p>
<p>TL;DR: market-makers sit in the middle of buyers and sellers to provide the best execution between the two. When you go to buy a stock, you may not be directly interacting with a seller but instead a market-maker who will use your buy request to fulfill someone else's sell request.</p></div>		</li>
