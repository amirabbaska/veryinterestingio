<p>I could but I'd have to go in look at the menu, see the prices and get food I don't know will be good or not. Or I could go to McDonalds and get the same thing I always get. Which I know will be acceptable and quick.</p>
<p>Although sometimes I'll get a random flyer from one of those smaller places and think fuck it I'll try it.</p></div>		</li>
