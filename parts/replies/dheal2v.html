			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible for this to happen, but it's not the primary mechanism for supermassive black hole formation. If it was, we would expect to see galaxies with much more complex configurations, featuring several supermassive black holes orbiting each other, rather than spiral galaxies with a single black hole at the middle. The reason for this is because when many small bodies coalesce, they often to make several large bodies rather than one (think binary/trinary star systems). Since we've never observed such galaxies, we can rule out the possibility that supermassive black holes are formed by thousands of regular ones colliding.</p></div>		</li>
