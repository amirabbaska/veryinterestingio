<p>As a side note, if you ever notice problems with wifi disconnecting at your house (and you're not using 5ghz wireless) and you have 2.4 ghz cordless phones, get rid of the cordless phones. I've seen too many of these units operate outside of FCC guidelines and jam the entire spectrum around them whenever in use. </p></div>		</li>
