			<div class="markdown"><p>This is right. When I teach it, I draw a diagram that looks something like this...</p>
<p>W E W - - - - - M</p>
<p>Water = W
Earth = E
Moon = M</p>
<p>The moon pulls hardest on the close water since it is closest   The moon pulls the close W off the E and it pulls the E off the far W. On my whiteboard, of course, the diagram has shapes and texture. </p>
<p>The answer has nothing to do with the mass of the objects getting pulled. The answer is that there is a difference in the moon's pull on either side of the earth. Water close to the moon gets pulled away from Earth while water farthest away from the moon gets the Earth pulled away from it. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice explanation. If I understand it correctly, water at the top and bottom of the E on your diagram, where low tide would be, is being pulled parallel to the earth's surface and not away from it. Does this mean that low tide is actually the natural sea level <em>in the presence of the moon</em>? Without thinking too deeply about it until just now I always assumed natural sea level would be somewhere in between the two extremes.</p>
<p>Edit: didn't mean to imply the absence of the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the resting point without a moon would split the difference between high and low tide. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the net difference in force between where there is low tide and the average force on Earth (ie the force that Earth would experience if it were a point mass) is toward the center of the Earth. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's only a <em>spring</em> tide graphic though. Not a normal tide graphic.</p>
<p>Normal tides are going to follow the moon around the planet. Not just happen when it's lined up with the sun.</p>
<p>That graphic confused the heck out of me for a minute. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth mentioning that the sun also affects tides, but it is much weaker than the effects from the moon. So when the moon and the sun are relatively lined up during a full moon and new moon you will have stronger tides because the pull from both objects is along the same line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much weaker? I've read that the effect of the sun is about half that of the moon. Which is pretty interesting to me because it implies we would still have significant tides without a moon, even though most people attribute tides fully to the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't know that but you're right. The tidal force from the sun is about 45% of the tidal force from the moon according to the Wikipedia page on tidal forces. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The variation in the size of tides from day to day is caused by the sun. When the sun and moon are on the same side of Earth (new moon), tides are largest. And when the sun and moon are on opposite sides (full moon), tides are smallest. By comparing the tides when they are largest and smallest, you can determine how much of an effect the sun has.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We would still have high/low tides without the moon, but they'd be ~1/3 as high and slaved to the solar clock. The cycle would produce the higher high tide at solar noon, low tide at solar 6:00pm, the lower high tide at solar midnight, and another low tide at solar 6:00AM.</p>
<p>As it stands currently, high tides that peak near solar noon and midnight are higher than high tides at solar 6:00AM/PM. This is overshadowed (heh) by the phase of the moon, where we get the highest high tides near the new moon, the lowest near the waning and waxing half moons, and a lower than new moon highs but higher than half moon high tides at the full moon.</p>
<p>The highest high tide you will see is during a solar eclipse at high noon. The lowest would be at 6:00AM/PM during a half moon.</p></div>		</li>
