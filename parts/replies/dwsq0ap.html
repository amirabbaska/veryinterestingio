			<div class="markdown"><p>Bro had a boa. You would be surprised at how fast it can strike! The reach wasn't big, but enought so if a prey pass close then that prey is gone. I'ld say that a 6' boa had a reach of 6-9&quot; effective, up to maybe a foot... Once the boa bite the prey, it pull it and coil immediatelly around it. The prey have no time to react. Once there is one turn, it's too late.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most snakes have a strike range of about a third of their total length. That can be difficult to judge when a snake is coiled up, so if you find yourself confronting an angry snake, I would go ahead and give yourself some extra room. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's precisely why the Gadsden Flag is meaningful. It's warning you not to step on it, not because it's worried about itself, but because you will be injured.</p></div>		</li>
