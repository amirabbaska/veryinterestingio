<p>The basic breakdown of blue/green screening as I gathered it:</p>
<p>On emulsion film, blue was used because the chemical that was sensitive to blue wavelengths was the finest, and therefore held the most detail.</p>
<p>On digital, we made the CMOS sensors to favor green, since our eyes favor green.  So green became the ideal color for masking, as that was what held the best resolution and detail.</p></div>		</li>
