<p>E is for explain.
This is for concepts you'd like to understand better; not for simple one word answers, walkthroughs, or personal problems.
LI5 means <strong>friendly, simplified and layman-accessible explanations.</strong>
<strong>Not responses aimed at literal five year olds (which can be patronizing).</strong></p>
