			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife Kathy had a list of 13 things I had to do before he jump.   Some were obvious, like getting my will and advanced directives in order, but some where much harder.    They came under the general heading of &quot;I don't want to have to pick up the pieces when this goes bad&quot;, so I needed to do everything before the jump to plan my own funeral.   Which funeral home, where I was being buried, write my own obituary, designate a friend to the planning, have call trees is place to let people know.   The last item on her list was the hardes.   Do a person a video for each our my two children that explained why this jump was so important, to be only shown to them after I died.   Try that someday!  In the end, it was good to think about those issues, since it made me more safety conscious, and gave me a better understanding of what she and the family were going through.  AE</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you both so much for answering!  I think that no matter how much technical preparation and safety contingencies there are, nothing compares to having to make end of life/survivor plans for your family — that’s when you fully appreciate that you’re about to do something very dangerous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jerry: The day of the final mission, Alan asked me to record goodbye notes to his wife and children to give to them if he died, and to be deleted if he survived. I wasn't comfortable being in the room for that, so I set up the camera and waited in the hotel lobby until he was done.  Just the act of doing that gave me a great heaviness in my heart. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For Jerry: did you ever think about the fate of your documentary if something went wrong?  Maybe it would be transformed into a doc about the investigation of a horrible accident, that sort of thing? </p></div>		</li>
