<p>They often say something like 'THOSE JEW NWO MASONS TRYING TO RULE OUR LIVES ONCE AGAIN!'</p>
<p>but I'm pretty sure Mason's actually have a lot of Christian rituals even if not strictly religion based.</p></div>		</li>

I was invited to a ceremony by an employee, and he talks it up a lot and i suspect he wants me to join but with the big &quot;G&quot; for God sitting above the clock I don't think that aspect can be easily sidestepped. </p></div>		</li>
