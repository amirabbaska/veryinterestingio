			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, the rule of thumb is teratogens (such as alcohol) will kill a fetus from 0-3 weeks. So a pregnant woman would probably never know she was pregnant. She would think her period was just late (and maybe heavy) when she miscarriages. </p>
<p>Weeks 3-8 are considered &quot;the worst&quot; for teratogens because they <em>demonstrate</em> the worst effects. The worst effects would still be weeks 0-3, but you won't <em>see</em> them. From weeks 3-8 teratogens are less likely to kill the fetus, but will instead effect the things formed between weeks 3 and 8, such as limbs and organs. </p>
<p>As for your question, I <em>believe</em> that time period would still probably kill the fetus and therefore not cause visible birth defects, but it's on the line of where it would start causing birth defects and obviously there I should some variation on timing between different people (as exemplified by how some premature babies are fine, and others born a the same time are not) </p></div>		</li>

<p>^This image shows what organ systems become affected by teratogens (anything that harms the embryo) during specific weeks of pregnancy. </p>
<p>While during weeks 0-2 it says &quot;Not susceptible to teratogens,&quot; the fetus can spontaneous abort. (All or nothing reaction). There are some studies that are looking at weeks 0-2 where alcohol can cause some negative effects to the fetus, but nothing conclusive yet.  </p></div>		</li>
