			<div class="markdown"><p>They don’t fully go to sleep/doze- it’s similar to a cat still moving its ears when “catnapping”, or a more evolutionarily supported and restful version of when you blank out driving on the highway (highway hypnosis). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Four legs, widely spaced, straight, with a heavy weight resting on them evenly. That doesn't topple over easily. They don't pop a hip like horses do to sleep on three legs, and for the most part, if the area is safe, they simply lay down with the legs folded under. Even humans can learn to sleep standing up (leaning against a wall, admittedly), one of the survival tricks in the military, catching some sleep whenever possible, in any position.</p>
<p>The one thing ruminants really <em>can't</em> do is lay on their side for very long. When they're not upright they can't burp to relieve the pressure from the feed fermenting in their stomachs and literally blow up like a gas balloon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well my goats lay in the barn for most hrs of the night. True, bloating is dangerous, but it still happens on the ground.  Bloating usually happens when there is too much of a consumable that causes gas too quickly (ie. They get into the chicken feed and gorge)</p></div>		</li>
