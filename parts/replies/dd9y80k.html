			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I never realized so much was depending on the jury's ability to set aside what they believe and purely listen to the facts and logic. That's a little frightening actually, that the person on trial needs to have total faith in the jury that they will essentially act as machines reaching a conclusion and set aside any human urge to interject emotion. I have more respect for jury members now!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me add to this then, depending on where you live the jury is picked by both the defence AND prosecutors and each have the power of veto if they feel a jury member is bias for what ever reason </p>
<p>Long story short roughly 50% of the jury is picked because one side or the other knows that this particular person will not put aside believe and will judge from that and not facts and logic</p>
<p>Now this is not always the case but a lot of the time lawyers are trying to change opinions of only half as they picked the other half</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing that always puzzles me about juries, is that after the presentations of the prosecution and defence, and the judges direction, they then go into a room together and discuss it. Surely it would be better for jurors to decide individually?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any limit to the jury selection process - can it, in theory, go on indefinitely til both sides are satisfied with the selection, or are there restraints?</p>
<p>Edit: Also - do lawyers have the potential to find information about the jurors? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think so, you either find someone guilty or fail to find enough evidence that they are guilty. That doesn't mean they're innocent, although they are treated as such by the law. Same way failing to reject the null hypothesis doesn't mean the alternative hypothesis is false.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, because if enough evidence is presented to <strong>prove</strong> one's innocence, it usually results in the charges being dismissed before the jury gets a chance to deliberate. Once the argument rests in the hands of the jury, it's already been made clear that innocence cannot be 100% established.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So just like the R.Kelly case posted the other day (or was it yesterday?) regarding the Shaggy defense. For whatever reason he was found not guilty in the court of law but it certainly seems like he wasn't innocent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. Failing to reject your hypothesis could mean you didn't have enough evidence to support it.    </p>
<p>Finding someone not guilty could mean the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean 'failing to <strong>accept</strong> your hypothesis could mean you didn't have enough evidence to support it'?</p>
<p>As in, I think my hypothesis is true, but so far all my experimental evidence point to my current hypothesis being false, so I 'fail' to accept my hypothesis, regardless of my emotional or instinctual bias.</p>
<p>I am on the right track and you mistyped a word there, right? Or am I missing something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, yes. You can't prove something happened with statistics (i.e. Causality), but you can disprove. Good comparison. Theory is all about building a case for causality, which can't be proven. Legal matters sometime operate the same with determining proximate cause or how much at fault does one have to be before they are guilty. </p></div>		</li>
