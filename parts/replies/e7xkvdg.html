			<div class="markdown"><p>It is actually believed, although I doubt it's factually correct that left handers are better in mathematical issues and right handers are better in artistic environments. Never heard anything said about ambidextrous people though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you have that flip-flopped.</p>
<p>the left hemisphere does all the linear thinking like math and language. The right hemisphere does all the sort of holistic or foggy thinking like creative work.</p>
<p>Early in the US Space Program they tested all of the Air Force and navy Pilots for their ability to adapt to new learning situations, to deal with completely unexpected changes. When they had culled the thousands of Pilots down to a few hundred based on this criteria alone they found that half of them were left-handed. They also found a much higher incidence of speech impediments and minor learning disabilities like dyslexia because the individuals that were best at creative problem-solving were worst at rigid, logical, linear thinking. </p>
<p>It is important to note that hemisphere dominance and handedness are not 100% correlated. There is a small percentage of people who will be right hemisphere dominant but still right handed or left hemisphere dominant and still left handed. There's also a slightly larger number of people who have mixed dominance. The left eye, right hand and right foot is the most common configuration by far. Left-handed people generally have a dominant right eye and left foot but there is a small percentage that has mixed dominance meaning any configuration is possible.</p>
<p>Then again there are some people, notably autistic but not exclusively so, whose &quot;brain geography&quot; does not comply to most or any of the norms. some people, usually but not always blind, process sound in their visual cortex.</p>
<p>I have studied all this because I myself am a lefty with a minor abnormality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh I figured it was largely split the same. I'm right eyed, handed, and footed. I figured it would be uncommon to have it not split like that. Although, footedness and especially eyedness don't come up often at all since (I think) it matters and manifests much less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this stems from the whole right brain left brain thinking as your left, artistic side is linked with your right hand and your right, logical brain is linked with your left hand. The whole brains having personality sides has been pretty much debunked so it probably is just a myth</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I lefty I agree. It's obviously anecdotal but in my experiences and in dealing with my immediate family who is split half and half between dominant limbs we all fit this stereotype</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think I’m ambidextrous but I was forced to write right handed which has mixed up my dominance. I’m left handed in everything but writing and playing instruments, i shoot left in hockey I kick left footed I shoot a rifle left handed because my left eye is my dominant eye and i don’t many things with whatever hand is closest.</p></div>		</li>
