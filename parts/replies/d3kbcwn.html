			<p>It's most likely a requirement of the funding body(-ies) that support CERN. At least in the UK, most funding bodies require publications to be Open Access (i.e. not behind a paywall).</p>		</li>

			<p>Really? That is not the case in the USA. The NSF doesn't have an official stance on that that I'm aware of. A lot of scientists are very apprehensive about open access because it's viewed as being not as rigorously reviewed, and many &quot;open access&quot; journals are simply pay to publish that barely get reviewed at all. Most of the prominent journals in the world are behind a pay wall so it's surprising that the RCUK has that stance. </p>		</li>

			<p>Well this is news to me. My lab group has a couple NSF grants and publish in journals which are not open access. Most of the big journals aren't open access right now. It sounds like they don't require the publication to be open access but it needs to be deposited in an accessible repository? </p>		</li>

			<p>some journals I thought weren't open-access but actually did turn out to be available online (through Wiley or Elsevier website) <br><br>Also many journals use a delayed open-access policy. so 6 months or a year later it's available </p>		</li>

			<p>Ah yeah, that makes sense. I guess I never think about it because we have subscriptions to everything, so I have no way of knowing if things are open access, or if I had access through the subscription. Open access isn't really a huge issue in my field but a lot of people I talk to are actually fairly resistant to it.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think it's silly to be resistant to open access, especially if you're not part of the journal publishing industry. There might be many low-quality open access journals but also some very respectable ones. It just takes time for industry to accept it. </p>		</li>

			<p>With NIH the rule is that you can go behind a paywall for some period of time (I think a year) then the journal has to open access it.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, right.  The final draft of the paper has to be deposited into the NSF repository.  You can search the NSF repository here:<br><a href="http://par.nsf.gov/" target="_blank">http://par.nsf.gov/</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah I'm seeing that now...I'm just not quite sure I understand it fully. I know many people who publish under NSF grants and they definitely don't publish in open access journals. Most journals under the Nature or Science label are not open access and the old standards in my field are not either. Does this just mean they have to be uploaded into an accessible repository akin to JStor?</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't know what JSTOR is but yes, if you are doing work funded by NIH, you are mandated by law to provide the full manuscript no later than 12 months after it is accepted into a journal.  This is done through NCBI/PubMed. If you are non-compliant with this you can lose your funding. <br><br>The policy for NIH is found here <a href="https://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm" target="_blank">https://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm</a>.</p>		</li>

			<p>Almost every NIH paper I've read has been available openly <br><br>And the good news is that many prominent journals are taking a delayed or full open-access policy (ex. New England Journal of Medicine) </p>		</li>

			<p>Ah I see. I guess I just never really think about it because my institution always has subscriptions to things and I can use their VPN wherever I go. The time delay policy makes sense, because most research institutions need immediate access to new research so would still be obligated to pay for it.</p>		</li>

			<p>CERN is not actually funded through any intermediate organizations but directly by the member states themselves. So it kind of makes its own rules. And no, AFAIK there aren't any specific requirements for open data. In fact, for a good chunk of its history it was probably the opposite, what with the whole cold war thing and guarding of nuclear secrets.</p>		</li>

			<p>CERN and JINR had a close partnership throughout the Cold War. Despite the &quot;N&quot; in their names, they didn't (and still don't) deal in nuclear secrets.</p>		</li>

			<p>I had no idea about that! I always assumed that in its early days things might have been a bit more secretive with the whole paranoia of the 50s surrounding nuclear research. It's really nice to know that CERN was promoting peace and collaboration so early in its history.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, the data are actually the collaborations', so they get to decide what to do, not CERN. But CERN provide massive (pun not intended) support with making the data available, as you can see!</p>		</li>

			<p>CERN itself requires all publications to be open access. Independently, all particle physics publications are put on arXiv, an open access preprint server, so particle physics publications from CERN have two independent ways to be freely accessible. That only applies to publications, however, not to intermediate data. CMS does not have to release the data, but I think it is a good idea.</p>		</li>

			<p>(I'm not from the AMA team)<br><br>CMS analyzed the data before. That is not something where you can be &quot;done&quot;, however. You can look through the whole dataset for the things that are most interesting, then you look for things you find still interesting but not as much, but you cannot look for everything simply because the experiments do not have unlimited manpower. There are things no one looked at in more detail. You won't find a new particle in there, but it still can lead to publications.</p>		</li>
