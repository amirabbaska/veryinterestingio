<p>As very well said above, CMS physicist have studied these data before the release, but there is certainly things to be measured and studied.</p>
<p>Also, by releasing these data now, we ensure that they will be usable in the future, independently of CMS experiment's own services and resources.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's most likely a requirement of the funding body(-ies) that support CERN. At least in the UK, most funding bodies require publications to be Open Access (i.e. not behind a paywall).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? That is not the case in the USA. The NSF doesn't have an official stance on that that I'm aware of. A lot of scientists are very apprehensive about open access because it's viewed as being not as rigorously reviewed, and many &quot;open access&quot; journals are simply pay to publish that barely get reviewed at all. Most of the prominent journals in the world are behind a pay wall so it's surprising that the RCUK has that stance. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've been out of the US for a while, but the NIH has an opinion about it as well, someone else can link it though :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost every NIH paper I've read has been available openly </p>
<p>And the good news is that many prominent journals are taking a delayed or full open-access policy (ex. New England Journal of Medicine) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CERN is not actually funded through any intermediate organizations but directly by the member states themselves. So it kind of makes its own rules. And no, AFAIK there aren't any specific requirements for open data. In fact, for a good chunk of its history it was probably the opposite, what with the whole cold war thing and guarding of nuclear secrets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the data are actually the collaborations', so they get to decide what to do, not CERN. But CERN provide massive (pun not intended) support with making the data available, as you can see!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CERN itself requires all publications to be open access. Independently, all particle physics publications are put on arXiv, an open access preprint server, so particle physics publications from CERN have two independent ways to be freely accessible. That only applies to publications, however, not to intermediate data. CMS does not have to release the data, but I think it is a good idea.</p></div>		</li>

<p>CMS analyzed the data before. That is not something where you can be &quot;done&quot;, however. You can look through the whole dataset for the things that are most interesting, then you look for things you find still interesting but not as much, but you cannot look for everything simply because the experiments do not have unlimited manpower. There are things no one looked at in more detail. You won't find a new particle in there, but it still can lead to publications.</p></div>		</li>
