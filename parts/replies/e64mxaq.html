			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I always wondered is how does Pauli's exclusion principle apply to composite vs atomic particles.</p>
<p>Take Helium-4. As a whole, it's a boson. But bosons can occupy the same quantum state. Doesn't that imply that one could compress an arbitrary amount of Helium-4 matter to the diameter of a single proton or neutron?  Clearly that's not the case. So does Helium-4 behave as a boson at certain distances between protons, but as they get closer together, they start behaving like fermions due to the individual prons and neutrons being fermions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this is precisely what happens. Helium-4 is a boson in an <em>emergent</em> sense. It only acts as a boson at distances that are much larger than the  nuclear length scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer, and it's a great example of the concept of how different physics can emerge at different energy or length scales. If one works purely in the high-energy particle physics regime, one gets QCD physics (quarks which are fermions), while if one works in the classical regime one gets a classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (distinguishable bosons). But for low temperatures at normal pressures, you get Bose-Einstein physics (<em>indistinguishable</em> bosons!).</p>
<p>The energy-dependence of physics is a very important concept which has not been properly stressed to the general public imo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you expand upon that? For example, if the wave functions of two Helium-4 particles are overlapping, what does that physically mean? How is that physically meaningful if the composite particles of Helium-4 themselves cannot overlap? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the second option. Helium-4 is a boson, but if you localize then enough to resolve their substructure, they are made of fermions (nucleons, and then even deeper, quarks).</p>
<p>At very short distances, the helium-4 nuclei will repel due to Pauli exclusion between nucleons. Then at even shorter distances, interactions between nucleons become repulsive due to exclusion between quarks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is called a Bose-Einstein Condensate. They exist. </p>

<p>You probably think this because you believe the 'diameter' you alluded to to be a fixed quantity. However, in the process of making BECs the 'diameter' (extent of the spacial wavefunction of the atom) of the atoms increase and overlap. </p>
<p>All in all, remember the uncertainty principle. The more you try and trap an atom by reducing its speed to zero, the larger its 'diameter' becomes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you.
If I may ask another question to elaborate, how come the principle ever becomes relevant in say, the interior of stars then? The amounts of available spatial wavefunctions of a free electron seems intuitively to be infinite, since they could just have an arbitrarily small translation in a continuous space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Pauli principle only prevents identical fermions from occupying <em>exactly</em> the same state, but the antisymmetry of fermion states also creates an energy cost for them to occupy <em>similar</em> states. In this case, similar means that they have strongly overlapping wavefunction, or they’re “close together” (as well as all other quantum numbers being the same).</p>
<p>This is referred to as “degeneracy pressure”. It’s a quantum effect that is basically the resistance of identical fermions to occupying similar states. The PEP doesn’t fundamentally prevent them from occupying similar states, only the <em>exact</em> same state. But it costs energy to increase the “similarity” of their states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now that is something I didn't know. Thanks for clearing that up. I didn't k ow that the degeneracy pressure builds up as things get closer. I thought of it more like a wall you had to get over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. My initial question was prompted exactly by reading about degeneracy pressure. However in my literature, the emphasis is on the Fermi-Dirac distribution and the &quot;filling up&quot; of available states, which gives the idea, that there are only finally many available states due to PEP. Is this related to the effects, you are describing?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If by ever you meant only, it should be noted that the PEP is really the reason you don't fall through the ground. <a href="https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.48.553" target="_blank">[1]</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't access the article. Can you give me a TL;DR?</p>
<p>My guess is that the PEP is preventing my atoms from filtering through the ground's atoms, due to the increased energy cost of closing the distance between them, but this is somehow not adequately explained by coulomb forces?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would be right in free space. But if an electron is confined to a star, it's wave function is bounded, and this boundary creates a discrete spectrum of possible states, that are occupied from the lowest energy up.</p>
<p>The conductive electrons in a metal behave like this, too. They are not confined at any one place, but are smeared out over the whole metal. This is described by their electronic band structure:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>neutron stars occur when the gravitational pressure is so great that it causes the electrons to collapse into the protons, creating a neutron in its place. Without the outwards pressure from the Pauli exclusion principle of the electrons, the star can become much more dense than normal matter. However the size of the neutron stars is still limited by the Pauli's exclusion principle for the neutrons. </p>
<p>As for a black hole, we don't really know what is going on. This is where the whole question of making quantum mechanics mesh with general relativity comes up. </p></div>		</li>
