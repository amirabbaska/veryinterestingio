			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I am wrong but the “taste aversion” you are talking about can also happen as the result of a negative experience.</p>
<p>For example the taste of spaghetti makes me nauseous, apparently I once had an emetic episode after eating it as a child. So I “don’t like” it.</p>
<p>However I can eat and love lasagna. Because apparently my brain thinks the shape of the noodles is important .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know if your paragraph 2 can relate to Cucumber? The smell and taste of it is really strong for me and is almost enough to make me physically sick (and always has) yet everyone else assured me it’s virtually tasteless. Never met anyone else that seems to share this hatred. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even the tiniest piece of cucumber can ruin a salad or a sandwich for me. Even if I take the cucumber out of the sandwich, anything that has touched it will still have that taste, which overpowers any other flavors. I hate it! You're not alone!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the only case you missed is the imprinting of childhood diet on taste preferences. I think this is probably the most interesting avenue for answering the OP's question. So, if two people dislike a food because it was not something they experienced as a child, perhaps that would also go for anything in that category of flavors, thus making the disliked foods similar between the two people as long as they fit into that aforementioned category.</p></div>		</li>
