			<div class="markdown"><p>All oscillators without an external source of energy are lossy. The oscillation will die down with exponential decay, taking some number of cycles for the amplitude to decay by half. A good oscillator might take hundreds or thousands of cycles for that to happen, but it will stop if left on its own.</p>
<p>Electronic oscillators that are based around quartz crystals will use an amplifier that effectively gives it a little kick each cycle to keep it oscillating. It's kind of like pushing a little kid on the baby swing. You just have to put enough energy each cycle to compensate for the oscillator's natural losses.</p></div>		</li>
