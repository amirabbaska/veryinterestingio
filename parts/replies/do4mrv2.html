			<div class="markdown"><p>The conventional wisdom supports this. Psychopaths tend to be less insightful and self aware than their counterparts. In my case specifically, I've always been aware that I'm different in a general sense but never considered myself lacking in empathy until diagnosis and even now I cannot really see my callousness much of the time when others point it out. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Why is that? What aspect(s) of your psychology prevent(s) that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just tend to disagree with them and see it differently, they are being too sensitive etc. I'm sure there are several psychological factors that would lend themselves to this including the lack of empathy itself, the lack of conscience, perhaps the inability to take responsibility etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely because it's hard to understand why other people would care about stuff you don't care about. The standard internet troll is extremely unemphatic, their go-to reaction when people get upset is &quot;boo-hoo did you get your fee-fees hurt&quot; or &quot;it's just words on a screen&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
