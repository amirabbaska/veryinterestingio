<p>To be honest, that might not be true. It could still be a ridiculously huge amount of energy, just not a completely destructive amount of energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comparison might look false, but it is true. The thing is, in CERN, it was just 1 or 2 atoms that went at that temperature. When you click your fingers, its trillions and trillions and trillions, and much more but I dont know any word above trillion. You heat more atoms in clicking your finger than the number of stars in the galaxy. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The collision energy between two nuclei reaches 1,000 TeV (tera-electron volts). This energy is that of a bumblebee hitting us on the cheek on a summer day,&quot; says Jens Jørgen Gaardhøje, professor at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's see, the total energy of a single heavy ion collision at ALICE is ~574 TeV, which works out to ~1E-6 J (1 microjoule).</p>
<p>Assuming my fingers weigh 20 grams and I accelerate them to, say, 1m/s when snapping, 0.02 J are expended with each snap.</p>
<p>It's harder to find exact figures for exactly how many atoms are involved per collision event in ALICE, but a single snap of my fingers is equal to tens of thousands of those collisions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not true.</p>
<p><a href="https://lhc-machine-outreach.web.cern.ch/lhc-machine-outreach/beam.htm" target="_blank">This page</a> describes overall energy per particle and per beam - it is on the scale of an aircraft carrier's kinetic energy.</p>
<p><a href="https://lhc-machine-outreach.web.cern.ch/lhc-machine-outreach/collisions.htm" target="_blank">This page</a> has calculations for collisions per second. At 600 million collisions per second, each at 14 TeV, that's 1345 watts - around the energy of a small electric heater or kettle. Not huge, but way more than snapping your fingers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the energy per collision of bunches is a miniscule fraction of a joule.</p>
<p>However, we're asking specifically why the lab equipment doesn't melt. This means we have to think in terms of time scales which thermodynamically make sense for the lab equipment - and this is seconds, rather than nanoseconds. So, while there's about 30 microjoules being released per collision, the lab equipment is absorbing a little over a kilojoule per second because of how frequent the collisions are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably depends a lot on your definition of temperature here. The momentum in the beam is pretty high, the energy on involved in each collision is pretty small. Only a few protons in each beam collide whenever we cross the beams.</p></div>		</li>
