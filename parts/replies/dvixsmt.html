			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't see how this is correct, photons existed before 370,000 years after the big bang. It's almost the opposite of what you are saying. It became &quot;less bright&quot; after this date because this is the point where photons are less likely to interact with matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right but if I shone a torch in an empty room, you'd see the torch because the photons coming out of it wouldn't interact with any other matter in between being emitted and hitting your eyes. If I filled that room with really dense smoke, you wouldn't see the torch because the photons would only interact with the smoke and wouldn't reach your eyes. If you imagine I put a film on in the cinema, but filled the room with smoke, and only removed the smoke 30 minutes into the film, your knowledge of the film would begin 30 mins after the film actually began. Do you get what I'm trying to say?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that this would be correct if I was someone just outside of the big bang looking in. But the light isn't coming from a single source point like a cinema screen and I'm just outside of viewing distance, but the big bang was everywhere. I'm imagining myself inside the universe surrounded by the big bang.</p></div>		</li>
