			<div class="markdown"><p>Microwaving it softens the crust, which is a good thing IMO. But it makes the bottom of the pizza soggy. Solution: put a couple of paper towels under it while it microwaves; that'll soak up the water and the bottom won't be soggy!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting point about the ovens. The conveyer style convection ovens a lot of shops use these days cost $30k+ and are definitely the most expensive piece of equipment. Not to mention, I'm sure regulations are quite a bit more prohibitive of a homemade oven in a commercial kitchen (especially considering exhaust hoods and fire suppression). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you're talking about 1) modern restrictions on what can and can't be used in a licensed food sellers kitchen, and 2) the cost of a highly specialised piece of equipment that's made to be optimal to making pizzas and not much else.</p>
<p>With early 20th century regulations and no real need to have &quot;the best pizza oven&quot; (which means you can settle for &quot;an oven that can have a high enough temperature to cook a pizza and can cook multiple at once) a homemade oven would be fine. You'd be able to use an open faced fire pit with racks above it, or you could goto something more advanced if you wanted/could (most probably went more advanced that the bare minimum, but that'd be because it's not really hard to do so)</p></div>		</li>
