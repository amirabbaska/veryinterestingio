			<div class="markdown"><p>Like Rick Jeanneret with the Buffalo Sabres, a local legend and hero around here. His voice has been casting the games since before I was born, they will never get rid of him unless he retires. He was inducted into the NHL hall of fame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dewayne Staats is my favorite announcer ever. He knows the Rays so well and I enjoy his commentary. I also really like Dave Mishkin (Bolts radio announcer) and Mitch Huber (Gators radio announcer).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the NFL perspective, the Chiefs radio broadcaster, Mitch Holthus, is absolutely amazing. Has incredible depth of knowledge and is a huge fan and it shows. His level of enthusiasm + knowledge is out of this world. Friends and I usually keep the radio on while we watch the game on TV since his game calling is way better than any on national TV</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer. </p>
<p>An average football game is a few hours. Most announcers do one, maybe two games per week. But those guys aren't paid to do a job for just a few hours. It's still a full-time job. We just see the final few hours of their work week. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the insight. It may seem like a cuhsy job when you watch it on TV but this is what I imagine the real work is like....tons of studying film/stats/info so that you can recall it quickly during the game to keep the audience entertained and informed. Seems very stressful</p></div>		</li>
