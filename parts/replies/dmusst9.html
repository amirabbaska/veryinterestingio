			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't quite true. </p>
<p>Boiling will remove volatile contaminants. For example, chlorine or VOCs.  </p>
<p>Also, distillation won't remove all other contaminants, only those which also can't boil or vaporize at 100C or below, like salts.   </p>
<p>And distillation is not the only way to remove other contaminants, and in fact the vast majority of treated water does not use distillation. Most common involves things like filltration, ultrafiltration, coagulation, flocculation, activated carbon, reverse osmosis, and chemical injections.           </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good points :) distilled water isn't the cleanest. The best you can do at home is make RODI (reverse osmosis / deionized) water. Commonly used by aquarium hobbyists but you shouldn't drink deionized water without remineralizing it.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis (RO) is best for drinking, though!</p>
<p>Downside of RO is you need high water pressure to work so if you don't have a faucet (e.g. In the wilderness) you gotta filter some other way. </p>
<p>Edit: For drinking water at home just invest in a reverse osmosis system. This is the cleanest drinking water you can get and will probably be cleaner than bottled water if you keep filters clean. Deionizing resin (the filter material to deionize water) is only used after water is pre-filtered with reverse osmosis and is relatively expensive to maintain. I could be wrong but the only time DI would be needed for drinking water is if your tap water has toxic ions in it not filtered by carbon and RO membrane, though this would be rare. Additionally you'd want to add back in some salt and food-safe mineral content e.g. calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium (see smart water ingredients) to DI water, but thankfully RO water retains a good amount of these minerals while filtering out virtually everything else including things like chlorine and lead! I personally make RO for drinking and RODI for aquarium stuff using a system from bulk reef supply with a splitter valve to bypass the DI filter when making RO. And man that water is squeaky clean, or so my photometer says. </p>
<p>Edit 2: while the jury is out whether deionized water is actually harmful to you, it's easier to make reverse osmosis water as deionization requires RO to begin with. If you are buying water bottled drinking water is just fine. If it's an emergency you can probably drink deionized water (to be safe, maybe add a tiny pinch of salt and/or baking soda to give it some minerals). Also, deionized water doesn't taste the best. We usually enjoy the taste of a little mineral content in our water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you distill water and collect the fraction where the vapor was 100 C, you'd be left with a pretty small list of possible remaining contaminants. Discard all other fractions. Agreed that industrial scale water purification does not routinely use distillation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they use a big drum to remove &quot;undigestible&quot; materials.  String, plastic and the like.  This is carted off as solid waste.  Then they use a series of aeration ponds and let bacteria do it's job.  Then it goes to a settling pond/weir system.  Finally they'll add a flocculating agent that will remove any heavy metals and the like.  Then likely the return it to the environment.</p>
<p>Fun fact, the city of milwaukee reclaims their waste and they sell it in Home depot as Milorganite.  It makes your lawn look fantastic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wastewater treatment is a complex science. Among other things it often involves a bunch of filtering and biological processing in e.g. pools of specific algae and other microorganisms; and if the runoff is from a particular industrial process, then it's treated before mixing with other things - if you <em>know</em> what specific contaminants are there in large quantities, then you can select appropriate chemicals to neutralize or remove them.</p></div>		</li>
