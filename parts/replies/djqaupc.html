			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an interesting radiolab episode recently about the transfer of germs during a handshake.  Unfortunately the website doesn't link to any journal articles but iirc they had a research scientist talking during the episode as well as Neil deGrasse Tyson.

<p>I think it's this episode where they also talk about how unique each persons bacteria are to that person.  With the hypothesis that a persons bacteria is likely more distinctive than their fingerprints. </p>
<podcast spoiler>   
Interestingly, in their very small sample experiment bacteria was only transferred in a single direction between the handshake. </div>		</li>

<p>That seems bizarre.  Did they offer any explanation as to why transfer was only one way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They specifically mentioned that they found a strain of (non-pathogenic) streptococcus on Robert's hand, which served as a kind of &quot;invasion force&quot; that allowed for the introduction of bacteria onto Neil's hand.
Edit: this is at the 24' mark. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They discuss that section starting at 19.27.    They didn't really have a clear answer though.  This was only a single handshake, and it seems like the research and what they should expect is still fresh and relatively unknown. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the explanation is that many people are using antibacterial-based hand cleansers, which lead to dramatically different bacterial colonization. I personally believe this is why we're seeing <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17932824" target="_blank">such an uptick in MRSA-resistant staph</a> in the population.</p>
<p>If you've got one person who doesn't use antibiotic-based cleansers and one who does, you're going to have fertile ground for bacterial transfer. I can't hazard a guess as to which way, however - there's a case to be made for both. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There's been a slew of research that correlates insufficient exposure to &quot;germs&quot; and other foreign bodies with a higher rate of allergy development as well as autoimmune disorders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relevant: The National Institute of Health's new guidelines regarding peanut exposure to infants. There's good evidence supporting exposure at a younger age to prevent severe allergy. Obviously under the guidance of a physician, but this is contrary to past guidelines (avoiding peanuts like the plague.) </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, you would be surprised at just how much bacteria are on your phone/keyboard, often including fecal bacteria.  If it doesn't get to your mouth that way, you might have some on your tooth brush.</p>
<p>Like others have said, your body is adept at managing most of these.  It is just good practice because it reduces (doesn't eliminate) the risk of an infection, plus you might have residual chemicals on your hands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends. For example, E. coli grows in our gut and is often in our feces. It's alright there, doesn't harm us for sure, and not too big of a deal. If we eat it, or it gets into our blood stream, however, it can be lethal. Time and place definitely matters when it comes to bacteria. I haven't done my research, but I don't think it is easily aerated or at least it isn't in large enough quantity to throw off our toothbrush and make us sick. It does infect things like crops, etc, however and makes many people sick each year through contaminated water.</p></div>		</li>
