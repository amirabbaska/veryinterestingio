<p>So maybe someone can verify: it sounds like what they're saying is that since the affecting gravitational field is in motion it creates a vector to its current position, i.e. part of the orbital path is determined by momentum, which, assuming the velocity of the sun is constant, causes the movement to follow the true position of the sun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds like how I usually imagine it. If an object is in constant-velocity motion, then after there has been enough time for its gravitational field to fill up a certain amount of space around it, the field itself is also in constant-velocity motion, pointing towards the instantaneous position of the object.</p>
<p>~~ Of course, if the object experiences any acceleration, then the field can no longer point towards its instantaneous position. ~~ EDIT: It's a bit more subtle, as pointed out elsewhere. </p>
<p>If you know some special relativity, and think about how both the object and its surrounding field change under a Lorentz boost, it actually becomes clear how this must be the case. A lot of people are assuming that the paper disagrees with relativity, but in fact it is relativity which is responsible for this behavior. In GR the story is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9910050" target="_blank">a little more complicated</a>, but for weak fields and small velocities the corrections are small.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is true of the EM field. The EM force propagation &quot;anticipates&quot; velocity but not acceleration. For gravity between the Earth and Sun it actually anticipates to the second order not just the first - so both velocity and acceleration. Therefore, to produce EM waves you just need 2nd-order motion between two charged particles. To produce grav waves you actually need 3rd-order motion, 2nd-order won't suffice:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mathpages.com/rr/s6-08/6-08.htm" target="_blank">An even more impressive example of the position-lag cancellation effects involves the &quot;force of gravity&quot; on a massive test particle orbiting a much more massive source of gravity, such as the Earth orbiting the Sun. In the case of Einstein's gravitational field equations the field interaction depends not only on the position and velocity but also on the acceleration, so the aberration cancels out not only to the first-order (as in electromagnetism) but also to the second-order. Thus the &quot;force of gravity&quot; on an orbiting body points almost exactly in the direction of the gravitating source at the present instant, even though the source (e.g., the Sun) is actually undergoing non-uniform motion. In the two-body problem, both objects actually orbit around the common center of mass, so the Sun (for example) actually proceeds in a circle, but the &quot;force of gravity&quot; exerted on the Earth effectively anticipates this motion (to the second order).</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that, if the above commenter was correct, acceleration is already anticipated. In fact, the sun is constantly accelerating under gravitational influence. But we would be effected by &quot;jerk&quot;, i.e. a change in the rate of acceleration. </p>
<p>Realistically this is always happening too since the sun is being acted on by other astronomical bodies as well as the planets themselves. However it's probably in immeasurably small amounts.</p>
<p>Your hypothetical situation depends on the magnitude of the jerk. A small jerk is no different than what we would expect every day. But an extremely large one would alter our orbit. Although I imagine this would mostly be due to the change in the sun's position, not the &quot;lagging&quot; effect. The lag would go away as soon as the magnitude of jerk decreased.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We would only be able to notice that the sun is accelerating after 8 minutes. Until then, we will be attracted to where the sun would have been had it not accelerated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The word anticipating of course makes it sound like the force is actively calculating the expected position. It's more like the information is just built into the movement of the gravity waves.</p>
<p>For example, if you consider the case of throwing a ball directly out of the side of a moving truck. The ball doesn't land directly out from where you threw it, but roughly (because air resistance and such) where it would land if you threw it where you would be when it landed because it actually had forward velocity matching your speed too because you were holding onto it before throwing it even though to you it seems you only gave it a purely sideways acceleration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like they're actually carrying momentum too, though. Like the waves curve or have spin.</p></div>		</li>
