			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be confusing the antigen with the allele. The O allele is essentially the O &quot;version&quot; of the gene, which when you're double-O, results in <em>no</em> A or B antigens on your cells.</p>
<p>So let's look at the two copies of your DNA side by side, supposing you're AB:</p>
<pre><code>-----A-----  
-----B-----</code></pre>
<p>This means that your blood will have A and B antigens, and the surface of your blood cells will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>   A   B    A  
   |   |    |  
---------------</code></pre>
<p>Now let's say you're type O:</p>
<pre><code>-----O-----  
-----O-----</code></pre>
<p>The surface of your blood cells looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>----------------</code></pre>
<p>You still have 2 copies of the &quot;O&quot; version of the gene, but this means no antigens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still confused - if we have say 100 people with 25 each having blood groups A,B,AB and O, then if we assume uniform random mating, wouldn't there be less people with O bloodgroup in the next generation, since you need both alleles to be O? And this should lead the recessive trait to die out in a couple generations.</p>
<p>Clearly I'm wrong, but can't figure out what I'm missing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the A and B people can be A-O / B-O or they can be A-A / B-B, just like a person with brown hair can have a recessive blonde gene and thus have blonde kids.  So if there's enough of the A and B types that are A-O and B-O, they can potentially have O kids and add back to the O group in the next generation even as the O people from the last generation have kids that are A and B.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weirder still, if the population has only AB people reproducing with O people, there would be ZERO people born AB or O in the next generation.  Theyâ€™d all be A or B.  All four blood types would be possible again in the generation after that, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AB is heterozygous, A and B can be homozygous (AA or BB) or heterozygous (AO or BO), and O is homozygous (OO).</p>
<p>A and B are considered codominant, so they are recessive to nothing, dominant to O, and will both be expressed if you have one copy of A and one copy of B.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, that's the interesting part! There's 2 trains of thought that I want to go over- the mathematical, and the geographical.</p>
<h2>Mathy bits</h2>
<p>Let's look at a simple population, and a simple gene. Suppose that out of 1000 people, 10 people have the 6 finger allele, and they're homozygous- that is, they have 2 copies of the 6 finger allele. Everyone else has 2 copies of the 5 finger allele.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at what happens when we pair them off. Let's assume that each pair is loyal to each other (ha-ha) and that they have 2 children who all survive to the next generation.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>66 x 66. Both children will have 6 fingers and 2 copies of the 6 finger allele.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>55 x 55. Both children will have 5 fingers and 2 copies of the 5 finger allele.</p>
</li>
<li>66 x 55. Both children will have 6 fingers, and 1 copy each of the 6 finger and 5 finger allele.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>This is the important part. Even though the number of 6-fingered people may increase, the number of copies of the 6 finger allele remains the same.</strong> We can easily see this if we match all 10 6-fingered people with 10 5-fingered people- we end up with 20 6-fingered children, but <em>there are still only 20 copies of the 6 finger allele in circulation</em>.</p>
<p>So what happens when these heterozygous- they have one of each allele- people have their own children?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>65 x 55. There's a 50-50 chance for the child to either have 6 fingers and have 65 alleles, or to have 5 fingers. On average, the number of copies of the 6 finger allele remains the same- 1 per 2 children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>65 x 66. All children will have 6 fingers, but there's a 50-50 chance they will be 65 or 66 children. Again, the number of copies of the 6 finger allele remains the same on average- 3 per 2 children.</p>
</li>
<li>65 x 65. This is where things get interesting! There's a 25% chance for a child to be 66, 25% chance to be 55, and 50% chance to be 65. Yep! Two 6-fingered parents can give birth to 5-fingered children, if they're heterozygous. And look closely at the numbers! If we take the average chance for each allele to occur in the children, we see the same thing: on average, each child will have one 6 finger allele and one 5 finger allele.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is pretty awesome. We've seen that on average, if there isn't any advantage to having 6 fingers, the number of copies of the 6 finger allele in circulation remains the same, throughout the generations. This means that even if our original 20 copies (remember- each of our original 10 6-fingered people have 2 copies each) get distributed within the population, there will be at most 20 6-fingered people in our population of 1000.</p>
<h2>Geographical</h2>
<p>There's another set of very important factors to how alleles spread within a population. You see, even with the number of humans on this planet- 7 billion- we still generally meet, fall in love with, and have screaming, kicking children with people close to us.</p>
<p>And so, given the relative rarity of these rare dominant alleles, they also tend to stay clustered in their vicinity. That's why you get villages of people with similar characteristics- the alleles simply didn't get the chance to spread further than the local area.</p>
<h2>In conclusion...</h2>
<p>There's a lot more to how and why some alleles are more widespread than others than whether one is dominant or recessive. It's a fascinating science!</p></div>		</li>
