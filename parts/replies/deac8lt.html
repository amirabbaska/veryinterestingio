</blockquote>
<p>The reason they cannot be discharged is in large part <em>because</em> of those other 5 points though. If the ROI (from the state's perspective) on student loans was so bad, then there's no way that the government could get away with making them non-dischargable.</p>
<p>Edit: Talking about ROI from the state's perspective. On the whole, more 4-year degrees in a city/state/region adds more in business activity, tax revenue, public health, birthrate, and a whole slew of other positive externalities that are more beneficial than the cost of the loans, the majority of which are repayed to the government anyway.</p></div>		</li>

Granted it ruined my life and I regret the decision,  but that's what happens when you tell a 17 year old they need to have their future planned out right now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Got royally screwed over by a for-profit school. Of course, it's partly my fault, but as you say, that's what happens when you're 17/18, the first person to attend college in your family, and the extreme pressure these people put on me. Not to mention the lies they weaved and how absolutely gullible I was at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I know it's an outlier,  but that's for profit schools for you.  Pretty much everyone without rich parents is in 60-100k debt.  No one offered what I wanted but them and I'll be damned if it didn't actually get me an industry job.  It just doesn't pay what I need it to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good list.  I'll add that in theory a good business idea should have funders lining up.  It's less clear that student loan lenders have the ability to evaluate whether a kid is smart and likely to go into a lucrative field, which would make them a good credit risk.  More likely, student lenders look at parental income, which makes it very difficult for poor kids to get loans and perpetuates poverty.</p></div>		</li>
