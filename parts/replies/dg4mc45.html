<p>Yes, it only react to visible light, which can be dangerous to your eyes of you are exposed to strong UV or infrared light sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most common danger being sunglasses that reduce visible light (so your pupils contract less), but don't have a good UV filter (so you still get almost full UV exposure).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the planetarium I worked at, we had a UV exhibit, part of which was a beam and sensor (only a few inches apart) that would tell someone how much UV their sunglasses blocked.</p>
<p>My coworkers's $120 shades blocked 99%.</p>
<p>My $20 shades blocked 95%.</p>
<p>Of course, now I have prescription sunglasses, so I suppose the joke's on me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A 405nm laser is something you can use to optically assure yourself it's effectiveness of UVA reflection. UVB is higher energy and therefor 'more dangerous' but it only makes up ~5% of sunlight that comes through the atmosphere and any damage caused would be on the eye's surface (which is much more treatable than photochemical damage of blue light or damage of retina by inflammation by IR, which both tend to be permanent). In short: if you shine a UV laser through the glasses onto a surface that fluoresces (like glow-in-the-dark stuff) and it looks anywhere close to as bright as without, don't use 'em.</p>
<p>Coming from a guy who plays with lightwaves a lot, the scary fuckers are the lower frequencies of IR or any visible light more power-dense than your eye-safe laser, especially blues. Unless you have proper safety lenses of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you'd just see their eyes. Not exactly what you're looking for but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMpqR1vyKPc" target="_blank">here's people putting on sunscreen under a UV camera</a> which is similar enough to be interesting.</p>
<p>Also if you've ever seen eye-tracking software on computers they usually use a <del>UV</del> IR camera so that they can get a clear picture of your eyes with no reflection from the screen.</p>
<p>Ok now I'm only tangentially related but if you have any polarized 3d glasses (the clear ones you usually get at movie theaters) go look at your eyes in the mirror and close one eye at a time for some weird effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In infrared imaging, sunglasses are see-through. But that's because it's essentially detecting heat. </p>
<p>Had no idea UV imaging was a thing, but it is.
This UV camera has sunscreen showing up as black: <a href="https://petapixel.com/2016/05/26/tiny-uv-camera-shows-youve-put-enough-sunscreen/" target="_blank">https://petapixel.com/2016/05/26/tiny-uv-camera-shows-youve-put-enough-sunscreen/</a></p>
<p>So for UV glasses ... I would guess it's the same principle?
I imagine it works by detecting reflected UV light. So you wouldn't see anything from behind proper UV blocking sunglasses. And you probably would if they didn't block any. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While in a sense it is true that pupils have to perceive light in order to constrict (it's what tells us about the things in our environment), it's not always the light itself that provokes this constriction. Motion perception constricts pupils, regardless of the level of light. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does this mean your pupils constrict when you perceive that you're moving, or when you perceive something that is moving? Or both? And why does this happen - is it a way of focusing your perception on the most essential info, a la tunnel vision when you're driving a car or motorbike at extremely high speed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only published study investigating that issue at the moment shows pupillary constriction during the perception of something moving. I can't speak to pupil response when you are physically moving because that is a very complex question to answer - there's so many things changing during physical motion that could be affecting pupil size. If luminance isn't controlled for across conditions, then we can't really conclude anything since the light response is so prevalent.</p>
<p>I can't off-hand remember the authors conclusions, but focused perception (tunnel vision) seems like a good inference to make. </p>
<p>I'll have a paper published in the next month or so that shows pupillary dilation to the perception of illusory motion though (which is counter-intuitive to constriction during real motion). So there's lots of things at play!</p></div>		</li>
