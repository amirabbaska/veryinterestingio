			<div class="markdown"><p>My parents took me to a museum as a child and they had one of those on display (I can't remember if it was a picture or an actual fossil). Long story short: that thing is responsible for my fear of deep water. If I can't see the bottom there is no way I'm risking it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely hate anything from deep water. Ever see photos of the fish and creatures that hang around today? Now imagine something like that but bigger, deadlier, and uglier just hanging around every body of water around the world. Screw that. Even looking at a photo of ancient sea creatures scares freaks me out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is that someone with a PhD can quickly assess the quality of a Wikipedia article--Colin has probably read most of the references already!</p>
<p>When it comes to class work, you still need to establish your credibility, which means going to the references and using them as a source. You will find that many Wikipedia articles are misleading or not supported by the references.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;... a high speed of jaw opening, opening their jaws in 20 milliseconds and completing the whole process in 50â€“60 milliseconds, comparable to modern fishes that use suction feeding to assist in prey capture and produce high bite forces when closing the jaw, estimated at 6,000 N (1,350 lbf) at the tip and 7,400 N (1,660 lbf) at the blade edge in the largest individuals...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scariest might be Megistotherium, a rhino-sized predator from Libya (15 million years ago). Canines like serrated bananas and possible elephant specialist. </p>
<p>Most unnerving (not sure if it would scare me) is Homo erectus. They're brains were way larger than chimps, but not as large as ours. They would have been expert problem solvers, but probably not as capable imaginative, symbolic thinkers, abilities that underpin H. sapiens ability to work together in large communities. I sometimes wonder what it would be like to interact with something so close to human...but not quite human. I guess I just described the conceit of ET. </p></div>		</li>

Any successful ambush predator which was also the length of a <a href="http://dinoanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Deinosuchus-11.jpg" target="_blank">school bus</a> is pretty unnerving.</p></div>		</li>
