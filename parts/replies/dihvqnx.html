			<div class="markdown"><p>It would depend. If there was a lack of blood pressure, and then a lack of blood flow to your brain as a result, but with normal oxygen and CO2 concentration, then yes. But you would pass out shortly after.</p>
<p>If it was a lack of oxygen concentration in the blood, but with normal blood flow, you would feel a very extreme and uncomfortable shortness of breath. This is because you have receptors to feel oxygen concentration and CO2 concentration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>my cardiologist told me exactly this. i had two important falls due to this and the high temperatures of summer.</p>
<p>Best way to avoid this:
-get up slowly, go from laying down, to sit down, to stand up
-drink water, a lot, combination of dehydration and this low pressure issue could lead to faint (that was what happened to me), by the way alcohol dehydrates instead of hydrating</p></div>		</li>
