This one is probably more accurate to true &quot;sound&quot;  because it uses the correct instrument.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's quite a pleasant little tune. It makes me interested in hearing more &quot;ancient style&quot; music.</p>
<p>Also this version sounds <strong><em>far</em></strong> more authentic (not that I would actually know) than the dude playing an acoustic and singing. His version sounded a lot like a more modern song.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it though? 3400 years and it's virtually the same in terms of pitch and time. Some motifs sound a lot like 'Good King Wenceslas&quot;, which dates to the 13th Century (2000 years of not much changing) and that could <em>easily</em> be updated to the modern charts with some 21st century production.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard similarities to Good King Wenceslas as well, but the description of the video says the beat of the song is unknown, so who knows exactly how close that transcription of it is to the true song.</p>
<p>Regardless, it <em>is</em> incredible just how far back musical history goes, and both how much and how little music has changed over time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really.  Equal temperament and the standardization of A-440hz didn't come along until the 1700s.  Prior to that, different pitches, and tunings based on non-logarithmic intervals were the rule.</p>
<p>An example is the Great Highland Bagpipe.  Instead of equal temperament, it is tuned to a Myxolidian scale, and it's C major note is <em>almost</em> equal to a Bb on any other modern instrument.</p>
<p>Even the twelve-note scale originated in the west.  East and South Asian systems often have many more notes, more closely spaced than ours.</p>
<p>Sheet music makes tons of assumptions that the reader understands the meaning of the symbols and the conventions of the age and culture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps in terms of melody there's nothing to talk about, but in terms of harmonization, we've come a long way since 1400 B.C.E., particularly with 'minor' keys advancing from Aeolian mode to harmonic and melodic minors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds to me like they have the melody but not the time signature or how long the notes should be played. Or would be interesting to see a music historian familiar with that region recreate the song. I bet it would sound a lot more &quot;modern&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
