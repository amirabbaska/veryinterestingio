			<div class="markdown"><p>The word &quot;orda&quot;, one Russians use for &quot;horde&quot; originally appeared before the invasion of the Mongols. It meant a group of nomads, who were often traders. The word &quot;boyar&quot;, used for a rich and influential member of the elite, also came from the Tatar-Mongols. </p>
<p>I'll just list some words that have been brought to Rus' by Tatar-Mongols, and their meaning:</p>
<p>Zhemchug - pearls.<br />
Tovar - merchandise.<br />
Chertog - a big, richly furnished room.<br />
Loshad' - horse.<br />
San - just &quot;title&quot;.<br />
Telega - cart.<br />
Biser - beads, used for simple jewelry.<br />
Cherdak - the attic.<br />
Almaz - diamond.<br />
Sarafan - a type of dress.<br />
Yarlyk - originally, an official permission to own land, then simply became used as &quot;label&quot;.<br />
Kazna - treasury.<br />
...and many, many more.</p>
<p>Obviously, there were plenty of war related words that came as well, bogatyr (a mighty warrior that defends the land), karaul (the watch, as in guards), kinzhal (a dagger), and so on. </p>
<p>Now, something that needs to be noticed, not all of these words actually appeared in Turkic or Mongol languages first. Some of them were simply carried to Rus' by those languages, like the word khozyain (owner), which has Arabic origins. But it still speaks to how exactly the Tatar-Mongols impacted Rus', since there are many more commerce, power, and even everyday life terms that come from them, than there are military. </p></div>		</li>
