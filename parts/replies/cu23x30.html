<p>Are you sure about this? I would have thought the discrepancy would be due to oscillations in the procession of the equinoxes (and similar factors) rather than the inconsistent nature of the earth's rotation. I'm relatively certain that for calculations like this the day is taken to have a constant length, rather than being based upon the observed length of the day over the course of the year. Curious if you have a source for the claim.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do the position of the other planets make up for any of this variation at all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it usually isn't possible to measure things exactly, we can only narrow it down to a certain number of figures.  also, I believe the orbital period changes over time, albiet very slowly, so it would be different each year and different depending upon where we set the beginning and end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To sort of add on to this (other replies to this post), other things also slightly perturb both Earth's rotation and revolution (Jupiter, the Moon, largeish near-Earth asteroids, even earthquakes) which throw a slight (usually too small to notice or measure, though they accumulate a little over time) variance into the answer of the question 'how long is...?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, just looking at the orbit energy, you would need to slow earth down by about 55 cm/s, so not much. But as earth is very fast, thats still 18kJ per kg mass of earth.</p>
<p>Which amounts to pretty exactly 10^26 J, i.e. 25 billion megatons of TNT. Or the complete energy production of humanity (including burning fussile fuels for heat and stuff) of 160000 years at the current level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm... Earth's <em>sidereal</em> year (one orbit around the sun) is actually a bit longer than 365.25 (365.256363004 to be exact). The number he's talking about is for the tropical year, which is shortened a bit because of Earth's precession. In other words, one year's worth of seasons is out of sync with one orbit around the Sun. (by about 20 minutes I think)</p>
<p>The only way I know to calculate the energy required uses the orbital period, so the problem is I'm not sure how the precession plays into it... </p>
<p>Assuming that the difference would still be 20 minutes (probably not a bad assumption), a tropical year of exactly 365.25 days would be a sidereal year of 365.26389 days. So you've increased the orbital period by a factor of 1.0000206. That corresponds to an increase in Earth's semimajor axis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period#Small_body_orbiting_a_central_body" target="_blank">1.0000206^(2/3)</a> = 1.0000137. </p>
<p>Specific orbital energy is -μ/2a. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravitational_parameter" target="_blank">Sun's gravitational parameter</a> (μ) is 1.32712440018×10^11 km³/s². <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" target="_blank">Earth's semimajor axis</a> is 149598261 km. We would want to increase it to 149600316 km. The difference between specific orbital energy in these cases is 0.00609 km²/s². That's 6090 Joules per kg of Earth. Multiply by Earth's mass and you get a whopping 3.637×10^28 J. </p>
<p>Which is a LOT. It's 100 times more than the other guy got, so I don't know which number is a better answer. Though at this level it hardly matters. According to Wolfram Alpha, this is roughly the amount of energy needed to stop the Moon from orbiting around Earth! (kill its relative velocity). And it's 100 times more energy than the Sun outputs in one second.</p></div>		</li>
