<p>The thing that bothers me with the PIN system in win10 is the fact that when you type in the length of the PIN, it automatically goes to verification, without you pressing enter (if you had a 4 digit PIN all you had to do is enter 4 digits and it automatically unlocked your PC) which makes it more vulnerable, because the attacker can easily determine the length of the PIN.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the attacker already has access to your device, a pin or password isn't going to stop them and since the pin only gets you into the device, it's a great second step.  Someone looking over your shoulder watching you enter the pin cannot access your MS account.  Just the device you entered it on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh â€” revealing the length isn't a big insecurity. It's still just as secure as any single standard-fixed-length system, only this way you get to pick the fixed-length yourself.</p></div>		</li>
