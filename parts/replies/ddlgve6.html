TV often over sells it, but really it's just being able to go through the process whereas a public defender will just try and get you to take a plea bargain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is generally not true (although in some areas of the U.S. it can be) but the real difference is between the ultra rich and the rest of us. If you are only moderately wealthy and hire a private attorney they actually have an incentive to plea you out because most people can't afford the 20-50k that a trial would cost, but can easily afford the 5k to retain someone to negotiate the case and plea them guilty. </p>
<p>Whereas a public defender gets paid either way and so going to trial doesn't actually make a difference for them except for slightly more work (but most good public defender agencies give bonus case credits for trials and therefore trials actually don't take more work cause they are getting fewer cases for going to trial).</p>
<p>I have seen hundreds of private attorneys who come in on a case that a public defender had, get the same exact deal, plead the guy guilty, and collect 5-10k and call it day. That is extremely common. The only thing they do more than a public defender will do is hold the client's hand more and spend more time talking to them because they get to bill those hours. Public defenders tend to have 10x the experience and don't sit around and small talk with their clients like a private attorney will...because they don't need to do that to do a good job.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is most public defenders represent people with history, unlike fairly wealthy people who likely have no priors. </p>
<p>A public defender may come to someone and say, &quot;you need to take a deal&quot; because that person has a large amount of felony points and is looking at 10, 20, 30, or life in prison if you lose a trial. A rich person can risk a trial a lot easier when the max they may be looking at is a couple of months and a judge is likely to let them serve it on work release or electronic home monitoring because they have no priors, bring in a bunch of community members to speak well for them, and all that. </p>
<p>Poor clients with criminal history don't get such leniency from a judge, and you gotta factor that in when deciding whether to plea or risk trial - which is why public defenders are more likely to plea someone out because the risk of straight prison time is much higher if someone loses and the punishment is much higher. You go to a rich person and say, &quot;if we lose you will serve 0-3 months in prison or take this deal for 0&quot; and they will roll the dice for trial. You go to a poor person with history and say, &quot;if we lose you will do 5-10 years in prison or take this deal for 2 years&quot; most people will take the 2 years unless you have a good chance of winning (which most cases don't have).</p></div>		</li>
