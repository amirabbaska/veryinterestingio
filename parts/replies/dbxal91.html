			<div class="markdown"><p>I have correct you on one thing.</p>
<p>You can completely cut off bloodflow to a limb for hours and still save it.</p>
<p>I currently work as a combat medic in the Swedish Armed Forces and we practice with torneques very frequently. If you do not know what a torneque or CAT is, its a medical &quot;belt&quot; that is used when a limb is severely wounded or shot in order to cut of bloodflow from the aurora. Every soldier drills putting on torneques on them selves and a requirement is to put it on yourself within 45 seconds in order not bleed out. When drilling one is allowed to have it on for one minute, its the pain from using it is extrodinary (of course).</p>
<p>The limb wont receive any major damage and will work fine even if a torneque have been set for 2-24 hours. The longest recorded case was a wounded soldier that had it set for ~48 hours and still survived wiu√§thout bleeding out nor loosing the limb. (Difficult to find case as this was in class).</p>
<p>But yeah, that is what i know!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to say that it is possible to cause some damage. After a party in college where I most likely had alcohol poisoning, I passed out for about 16 hours. I must have slept on my arm for most of that because when I woke up my forearm was numb. The feeling took almost a month to come back (yes, I went to a doctor), but I still have times where I have some slight numbness along my radius almost 8 years later (like Novocaine just about to finish wearing off).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like nerve damage, which can result if a nerve is pinched for long enough or deprived of oxygen for long enough certainly.</p>
<p>Under ordinary circumstances, a limb going numb isn't going to be dangerous - the nerve isn't pinched hard enough or for long enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also the reason for tinnitus (the ringing in your ears).  The tiny hairs that pick up sound inside your ears can die from loud and/or repetitive sounds.   When those are dead, your brain doesn't know what to do without that auditory input, so you perceive a ringing/ buzzing sound.</p>
<p>I have hearing loss from marching band and various other things and therefore have sufficiently hearing loss to hear the ringing constantly.  It's annoying most of the time, but only bothersome when I'm trying to sleep/ it's really quiet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not the only reason for tinnitus, but it's one common reason for it.</p>
<p>Our ears also contain what is essentially an amplifier - the sensory cells are essentially tuned to the point just below self-activation so that they can be as sensitive as possible to sounds.</p>
<p>Sometimes things go a little wrong with that amplifier, and the nerves hit the point of self-activation, which causes a buzzing or ringing sound.</p>
<p>That amplifier is also why tinnitus can sound extremely loud when in quiet places, but can be easily drowned out by low levels of sound. When there's no sound, the amplifier winds itself up to maximum to try and pick up noise - but when there's some sound to calibrate itself against it doesn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh that's cool!  I heard the hairs presented as the only cause.  That method sounds alot more like what causes mine though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Put your fingers in your ears and thump your head. When you have it right it should make loud laser like sounds on the same frequency as tinnitus but do that for like 10 seconds and it will dampen the ringig for a couple minutes. Helps when it's really bad.</p></div>		</li>
