			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems accurate. I would argue that Rex was likely a solitary predator. Something like Males roamed a large distance while females likely stayed more local. It’d be hard for something that massive, destructive, and I’m assuming loud to live near another one and both manage to hunt and feed themselves. Anything worth eating would likely note their presence and leave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually pretty likely that tyrannosaurids were at least somewhat social animals. We have trackways of at least three similar- walking in the same direction, a bonebed of Albertosaurus with at least 12 individuals of various growth stages, and face-bite scars (most complete specimens have these and they are almost assuredly from other tyrannosaurids) provide sufficient evidence to suggest they were indeed gregarious.</p></div>		</li>
