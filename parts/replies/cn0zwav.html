			<p>USA = banker run debtor's colony. 85% of infrastructure now owned by shareholders and investment banks. Very little private property, lots of Communism with the elite class taking the money from the top - from everything. Typical US citizens - by far - have no political mind and are too dumb to see it.<br><br>Virtually ALL of my substantive incomes goes to pay: insurance, taxes, interest. I am chasing work to hand over the money to these. I get no services for the taxes and I never EVER make an insurance claim on anything. Oh and I am very far from paying for any kind of &quot;health care insurance&quot; which is a scam from hell anyway.</p>		</li>

			<p>I understand that, and I am right there with everyone in demanding it go back. What I am confused about is people purchasing an education with a $50k price tag with interest, and wondering what the hell happened 5 years later.<br><br>I understand it is expensive as hell, but damn. You know?</p>		</li>

			<p>You do not comprehend the conditions of extortion. You think participation is voluntary and you question why anyone would do it.</p>		</li>

			<p>Everyone has their place. Some people do not give a shit about college and they like a hammer and shovel and work van. Other people are complelled to study, have hungry mind. Also you should note that college / university is the fabric of the land of the modern west. To aswer your question, for people of intellectual wit and might, college is not option, it is what you do after high school.<br><br>My friend from high school could not go to college because his wife's parents refused to sign the financial aid paperwork, which was required from parents of both husband and wife young couple, required for the parents to fill out financial disclosure paperwork and tax forms for him to go to his local state university. The wife's parents hated him, would not even close to do it. So he could not go to university. So he started his own company instead, was always a little manic and off kilter and lacking balance. He had been fucked and good, and by things outside of his control. He sold his company for a couple million. He is dead now. I would like to strangle those college &quot;financial aid&quot; architects with my bare hands. You could not get my locked thumbs out of their neck, goddamn motherfuckers I wish they would die in a car fire. USA ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WEST WORLD TO FUCK ITS PEOPLE IN THIS WAY.</p>		</li>
