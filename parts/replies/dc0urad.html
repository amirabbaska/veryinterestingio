<p>That's me, current state-level trial prosecutor.</p>

<p>Best kind of correct.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it's worth pointing out that questions of law are generally handled by appellate judges not trial level judges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I strongly disagree. Admissibility issues are questions of law. Motions to dismiss the indictment are generally questions of law. The trial judge's jurisdiction over questions of law is so important that, in my state, jury instructions focus on exactly that: &quot;I am the finder of law, and you are the finder of fact. Let me explain what that means.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike television most states don't let people agree to a specific sentence in a plea, you have to have a range of sentencing (i.e. you don't sign a pea to four years in prison, you sign a plea to 3-5). Judges decide the sentence within that range and are required to give sentences &quot;specific&quot; to the circumstances. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This must also be specific to your state. Where I practice, defendants most definitely agree to a specific term. There are some circumstances where the judge can undercut the prosecutor's offer, but often the judge only has the power to accept or reject the offer. I have never seen a plea offer of &quot;3-5 years, and the judge decides where it falls&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you are quite right. The problem is that when the layman hears &quot;decide&quot; they think decide as in make a decision between choices. Trial judges don't really have a &quot;choice&quot; in the same way that laymen think they do, they are bound by precedent, which is why I avoided the term of art and instead explained that judges don't really decide things, but &quot;apply what appears to be the most relevant and recent law to the current situation.&quot;</p>
<p>I appreciate that it's not the way a lawyer would phrase it (it's why I said you were &quot;technically correct&quot; but then went on to offer more explanation as to what a decision is in a trial vs. appellate court), but after having to explain the point to countless indigent clients of various degrees of education I explained it in the manner that has been the most easy to understand in my experience, and therefore more fitting to a ELI5. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Trial level judges don't really have the authority to decide questions of law, instead attorney's brief them on the state of law and then the judge applies what appears to be the most relevant and recent law to the current situation.  For example if you go to a judge and say 'the police searched me illegally' the judge doesn't say the police should or shouldn't have done what they did, they just find the most similar existing case-law and follow that decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I get the point, but I think most lawyers and judges would refer to that as a judge deciding a question of law.  Every time a judge rules on a demurrer/MTD, they're making determinations of law.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is such an interesting read, because the system is so far different from what happens in the Australian trial system (which I know the OP hasn't asked about). It's just really interesting to see how much of a back seat that the trial judge takes in an American trial.</p></div>		</li>
