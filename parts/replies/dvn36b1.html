			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I should have used the word recirculated instead of recycled. I would assume it's the same liquid until the reactor is retired. Then the liquid would be left to evaporate and the condensate would be handled like any other nuclear waste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The spent fuel pool water will pass through filter/demineralizers and through heat exchangers for cooling. You just continuously recirculate it. Typically water only enters the pool from the condensate makeup / transfer system to compensate for evaporation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there radioactive material (e.g. from neutron capture) in the reactor side?  Does this affect the water circulating in the other side?  Is the heat exchanger designed to block radiation?</p></div>		</li>
