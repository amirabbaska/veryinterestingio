<p>True, life plays a role in everything. I need to make an adaptor for a pipe to go from 3/4 to 1/2. Sounds simple, that's a pretty standard set of sizes. Walk in and what do you know, the 3/4 to 1/2 is out of stock! But I can go 3/4 to 9/16 to 3/8 to 1/2... hey foreman, this is fucky but we don't have the right parts in stock, what do you want to do? &quot;Just get it back in production!&quot; K, sign off here on saying this was your call.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good 'ol McMaster-Carr, they can get you any fastener you want as long as you don't mind getting a box of a hundred (especially in the smaller sizes).  Needed 10 316 SS washers last week to finish a job, didn't have any other washers in the building that would survive the caustic environment they would be in.  Now I have 90...  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Larger fasteners, I can always get almost what I need and figure I'll use the extras down the road.  It's the tiny, common fasteners that wind with a pile of extras on.  But those go into a common use cabinet that everyone is supposed to check before ordering more bits.  Doesn't exactly work but we try. </p></div>		</li>

Everything is in stock, arrives tomorrow, and if you have a question a human answers on the first ring. If an asteriod whiped us out but somehow skipped McMaster and Digikey we could rebuild in a few days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just don't order the wrong thing, there's no easy way to cancel it.  Found that out the hard way- placed my order, realized the mistake and called to cancel it 20 minutes later.  They already had it on a box heading to the Big Brown Santa's trailer truck. While I had em' on the line, I order the correct bit and arranged to return the wrong one when it showed up the next day. Gotta love being within a days shipping of their NJ facility. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I’m a product designer. We don’t use Phillips bc it looks too cheap and techy. Also a lot of people have Phillips at home, while they need to go out to get more rare stuff. Also, we try to avoid custom making screws. We just get whatever is available on McMaster </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I installed luggage on a motorcycle once. It required hex, Philips, and torx to complete the job. Every time I got a layer of plastic shell off, I made another trip to the hardware store. I also just replaced a component of a computer that used three different sizes of torx drivers and a single precision-sized Philips screw. I swear, I think &quot;product designers&quot; do it out of spite sometimes.</p></div>		</li>
