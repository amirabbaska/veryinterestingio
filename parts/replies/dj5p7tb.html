			<div class="markdown"><p>Your explanation about grooves is right, but your conclusion is partially wrong:
Yes, we kill plenty of bacteria all the time by stepping on them, there are just many more surviving. So as you concluded, you can not sterilize a surface by pressing on it, but you will kill bacteria that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there any significant or interesting discoveries that lay undetected for time before depression slides were developed? (Due to not being able to see the larger, now-dead bacteria in action?) sorry if that's a stupid question. Thanks in advance! </p></div>		</li>
