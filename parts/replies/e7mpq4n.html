			<div class="markdown"><p>It's amazing how that storm affected things even today. The Houston Chronicle did a series of pieces a while back about the history of the city. Houston used to be a backwater until the port at Galveston was destroyed which gave Houston the opening to build its it's own. This eventually lead to the city becoming a railroad hub which meant it had the infrastructure to support the oil boom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Houston was already a railroad hub for trans-loading to send cargoes down to Galveston. </p>
<p>The Houston Ship Channel was already in planning stages. </p>
<p>The Galveston storm cemented and accelerated Galveston -&gt; Houston shifts that would likely have happened anyways. Although if it hadn’t been accelerated Beaumont would have been more likely to end up the oil capital which was already a close thing given its closer proximity to spindle top. </p>
<p>This is not to say that I don’t pretty much shorten the history of the Houston/Galveston area in pretty much the same way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the suggestion. I just ordered it. I grew up in a small town about an hour from Galveston. I spent a lot of time there growing up and was in the area when Ike hit. </p></div>		</li>
