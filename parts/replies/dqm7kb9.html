			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more that your genetic makeup defines how &quot;pleasant&quot; someone might smell. </p>
<p>It's linked to HLA type, but I doubt it's actually those molecules that cause the smell. </p>
<p>Essentially; if you're closely related they smell bad if they're genetically dissimilar, they smell good. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OPs question was about the causal, or evolutionary reason for this behavior. </p>
<p>As a baby and a child it is super super SUPER important to look cute and lovable. </p>
<p>Rearing a child is no easy task, even with modern comforts, the amount of time, effort and resources required back in the Paleo age and before, was significant, a baby that is not cute is just not gonna make it. </p>
<p>This creates a tremendous genetic incentive to produce cute babies. And damn are babies cute, but at some point that is simply no longer necessary as a genetic trait, and other priorities begin to arise. Like bigger pores for better sweating and tougher skin to resist damage from the sun and weather. </p>
<p>But OP hints at another interesting question. </p>
<p>How come we get Acne, right at the age where attention from the opposite sex becomes paramount in our lives?</p>
<p>Well, scientists have found that when we engage in grooming activities like popping pimples, we get a serotonin release in our brain. We used to groom each other all the time, and have a genetic advantage when we do so. </p>
<p>So a guy at 13 getting acne, is really his body trying to get the attention of the female groomers in the tribe to go work on his face. </p>
<p>Talk about a backfiring mechanic. </p></div>		</li>
