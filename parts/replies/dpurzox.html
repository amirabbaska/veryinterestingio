			<div class="markdown"><p>ER doc here... think about stretch in the atria and carotid arch (bnp measurements). If you lose the limb, these will sense the new relative volume overload and make adjustments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the removal of the limb is inevitably going to involve some blood loss (even if you remove it with no bleeding, you lose the volume trapped in the limb itself)...</p>
<p>So IMO there's no instantaneous blood volume overload, it's just a matter of making sure the body maintains an appropriate supply thereafter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s fairly quick, over the timespan of minutes-hours. We have the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system which regulates the fluid volume status of the body to maintain blood pressure. In times of high blood pressure this system is diminished and when pressure is low it’s activated.  This system is also activated via low sodium concentration and neural input. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>oxygen is the main stimulus for EPO, but I️ learned that testosterone increases EPO as well and RBC. Hard to find why this happens though. </p>
<p>Also do you need to be in an oxygen debt for a while to produce EPO? I️ assume exercise would initiate hematopoiesis but for you to really need a difference you would need to be in higher altitude or a hyperbaric chamber. Or I️ guess long distance running frequently would have the same effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're not really talking about intravascular volume here though. The usual volume and BP control mechanisms such as the RAS, ADH release, natriuretic peptides, carotid bodies and sympathetic tone will certainly be in effect here as you said, but to my understanding, OP is mainly asking about erythropoiesis here.</p>
<p>Edit: Welp just reread the question. OP is definitely talking about volume control and not erythropoiesis, my mistake</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting to know - I'd somewhat assumed that the loss of a limb would mean losing those bones would naturally scale back the RBCs produced, but as a non-doctor I wasn't aware that by adulthood this job was so unevenly distributed. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Immunologist here. I have a very hard time believing this. We harvest long bones from aged mice (1.5+ years, equivalent to 70+ year old humans), and you see decreased lymphopoiesis, but bone marrow cellularity is maintained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting these feedback mechanisms have limits. In the most extreme cases you not only have excess capacity to produce blood but your heart is effectively oversized for your body. </p>
<p>Hypertension, hypervolemia is a severe and deadly eventuality in the most extreme cases of amputation. It's one reason why many of them, while hypothetically survivable, are deemed and treated as &quot;incompatible with life&quot;</p></div>		</li>
