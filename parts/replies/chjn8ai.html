			<div class="markdown"><p>you can understand this better by understanding how a single fertilized egg, mostly made out of a single cell, develops into a complex embryo of many cells.</p>
<p>search for:</p>

<li>morula -tion</li>
<li>blastula -tion</li>
<li>gastrula -tion</li>
<li>neurula -tion</li>
</ul>
<p>different stages and the processes of transitioning and the ways they are organized.</p>
<hr />
<p>In very early stages some regions have more of a substance than other regions, setting poles, equator and bilateral symmetry. The count of cells is barely relevant as different types of twins are common.</p>
<hr />
<p>caterpillars simply can re-trigger that process by turning into some kind of egg a second time but with a secondary building plan.</p></div>		</li>
