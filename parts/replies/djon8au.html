			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I was going to say. Wars generate income for the country, be it through increased manufacturing that provides jobs for the citizens or indirectly through outside contractors that &quot;clean up&quot; and rebuild after we came in and decimated everything. This is why our asshole presidents are continually cutting things like Medicare and Medicade (I just saw that our current asshole wants to take away 56 BILLION dollar from Medicare and Meals On Wheels and put it towards our military) because they don't make the country any money, all they do is cost money. From a business stand point you want to be frugal with your money and invest in those things that generate revenue, but from a moral and well-being standpoint those things are absolutely needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The military–industrial complex (MIC) is an informal alliance between a nation's military and the arms industry which supplies it, seen together as a vested interest which influences public policy.[1][2][3][4] A driving factor behind this relationship between the government and defense-minded corporations is that both sides benefit—one side from obtaining war weapons, and the other from being paid to supply them.[5] The term is most often used in reference to the system behind the military of the United States, where it is most prevalent[6] and gained popularity after its use in the farewell address of President Dwight D. Eisenhower on January 17, 1961.[7][8] In 2011, the United States spent more (in absolute numbers) on its military than the next 13 nations combined.[9]</p>
