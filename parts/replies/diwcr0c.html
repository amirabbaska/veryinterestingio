			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always found Jupiter to have some width, and maybe Mars, and also Venus as well. According to Wikipedia...</p>
<p>Venus is between about 10 and 63 arcseconds wide</p>
<p>Jupiter is between 30 and 50 arcseconds wide</p>
<p>Saturn is between 14.5 and 21 arcseconds wide</p>
<p>Mars is between 3.5 and 25 arcseconds wide</p>
<p>Here's a neat diagram:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Venus is the closest planet to us and is roughly the same size as Earth compared to Mars which is roughly half the size of Earth (very roughly). What you're seeing is that it is brighter due to these conditions rather than just it's size. Your eyes can't see the angular difference at these distances but something that hasn't been brought up much here is that we experience 'seeing' on Earth. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/seeing" target="_blank">https://www.britannica.com/science/seeing</a> So a brighter source will have more light smeared or blurred in the sky and the object will look bigger than the point source that we would see if we were say looking from the ISS. This is also why stars/planets seem to twinkle sometimes.</p>
<p>(Distance from the Sun: Venus is .7 AU, Earth is 1 AU, Mars is 1.5 AU)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Venus is also brighter because it's much more reflective than the other planets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brightness can cause an object to look bigger as well, but as pointed out, some planets are just big enough that you can make out a difference sometimes.  Everybody's eyes are a bit different, after all.</p></div>		</li>
