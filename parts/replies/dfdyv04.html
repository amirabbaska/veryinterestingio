<p>If dealerships truly lowered prices then they have nothing to fear.  </p>

<p>Except that doesnt mean that the manufacturer one day might not decide to sell their stuff directly to the consumer at what they sold to the retailer for. I don't know what you do for a living but if your boss said our main office decided to sell your service or product for an amount that pays them but does not pay you it would be a big deal to you. I am a retailer of other goods and when a mfger does some crazy sale it fucks up our income. We can match price and still sell product, but if you pay $50 cost and sell $50 retail you dont break even. You still lose 3% from the credit card. I'm all for consumer protection, but that should apply to the people who bring that product to the market.  </p>
<p>In regards to cars, I'm sure if the mfger bought out the dealerships and recreated a distribution network people could keep their jobs and have lower prices by buying directly. Just not sure if the mfgers will be willing to do something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what if there was no middle man. No retailers just mfgers and consumers? Stores that you use every week would not exist. Walmart wouldnt exist, target, cvs, amazon, best buy. They are all middle men. You are telling me you would have no issues with none of those stores existing or soemthing similar?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no way they would sell the same vehicles for less money even if all the dealerships decided they didn't want to make money anymore.  Don't forget the biggest winners in all of this, finance companies.  They won't give in either.  Once a commodity like this has an established price point you'll never see it go backwards unless nobody wants cars anymore.  Here in America where a driver's license is treated like a constitutional right and we refuse to even take licenses from 75+ year old people with the reflexes of a sloth who kill people daily, this demand will never change. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are completely ignoring the supply side, and if there is one thing the auto industry has is plenty of supply.  There are many cars sold with little to no profit and would continue to drop in price if costs were cut.  Large demand doesn't matter if there is equally large supply.  Your whole argument falls apart when you think about food and water.  There are so many more people today than just 100 years ago.  People also consume way more food and drink.  Yet food prices and water prices have not skyrocketed and in fact continually take up a smaller percentage of a person's budget.  That is because supply has kept up with demand. </p>
<p>Demand by itself is meaningless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not now and maybe not ever. Butbsay in my industry we're seeing things go down $100 below normal because the buying is slowing down and the mfgers are trying to provide incentives to buy in any way not just from their dealers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>and they don't have to, yet should be given the right to if they so desired.  Let the consumer decide what is best not he government.</p></div>		</li>
