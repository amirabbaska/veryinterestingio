			<div class="markdown"><p>I studied fine art (bfa in painting and drawing) and have made amd/or assisted the making of other artists' works while employed as a freelance &quot;artist's assistant.&quot;  While many (most) artists hide the fact that their assistants make/help make their works (to varying degrees, of course), some acknowledge it.  In fact, one artist I worked for displayed her assistants, while we were helping to make her drawings, inside the gallery space and on view to the public (Aleksandra Mir, Newsroom exhibition, Mary Boone Gallery).</p></div>		</li>

I'm suggesting more of a collective that all works under the name &quot;Banksy&quot; so they can share the benefits without having to each build a name for themselves.</p></div>		</li>
