<p>What many redditors may not know is that Paul was originally Saul, one of the Jewish religious leaders. He was responsible for persecution of Christians, and called himself the worst of sinners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes so much more sense than the idea the he was just a crazy who popped up out of nowhere with some wild ideas and gained a huge amount of followers after death. I mean, that may be true but his ideas (or the ideas of those who mythologized him) are actually just an offshoot of an existing religion. I guess I kind of knew that but hadn't really put the pieces together in my head. </p>
<p>Do (non Christian) historians think he was a real person? Did Jesus claim he was the son of god  or was that invented after he died? If so, did he have a mental illness or was this a normal thing?</p>
<p>The other weird thought that occurred to me - if there were animal activists back then they'd probably love Christianity. No more slaughtering baby sheep (and goats and cows and whatever else) left and right. </p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus" target="_blank">Yeah historians believe he existed.</a> We don't know for sure if he claimed to be the son of God when he was alive (assuming you don't consider the Gospels 100% factual), but that claim (as well as stories of his resurrection) are what popularized Christianity through oral teaching before the Gospels were written. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my knowledge historians believe he was a real person. Jesus did claim to be the Son of God, but there were not only prophecies in the Old Testament that he fulfilled and miracles that occured to have him be the Messiah the Jewish system looks for, but accd to the Bible was pointed out by God himself (in the baptism by John). The Jewish leaders at the time rejected him as Messiah but also rejected his anti-religous stance and popular following. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so could that have started as a retro-age atheism, where they no longer needed to go to the temple, so they went their own way... and eventually became Christianity? Perhaps due to needing a similar following but without sacrifice, out of comfort or tradition? It was just a way of life...</p>
<p>Where did you get the information pertaining to this passage?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bit later, St. Paul joined the movement Jesus had started, and developed a theory about Jesus's death and why it was necessary. Blood, he said, was necessary for the forgiveness of sins. Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice: as he was &quot;the son of God&quot; (however you interpret that phrase), his blood was enough to grant forgiveness for us all. There was no need to bring any sacrifices to the temple, and no need to convert to Judaism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is this an actual scripture or is there proof that he said it this way &quot;The true son of God&quot; intended as a huuuuge compliment and eventually taken literally? Or perhaps was? Who knows but man this is interesting!</p></div>		</li>
