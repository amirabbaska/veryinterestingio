			<div class="markdown"><p>Rofl. That was my thought too... So often people forget this is meant to explain simply rather than in a complicated manner. Although I'm guilty of doing that as well :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I tried to simplify as much as I could without losing the content too much. Sorry if I went too ham. But the idea behind ELI5 is to explain something in detail and in a simple way. While I'm aware this isn't the simplest of explanations and a five year old might not be able to understand it fully, there is also a very high chance that OP is older than 5, so he's likely to undestand most of this. </p>
<p>Imo, what makes ELI5 a nice sub is that you get some really simple answers and some detailed answers (mine is the latter), and this allows different people to look into the question at different levels, based on their understanding, while still remaining fairly basic and not requiring super scientific prior knowledge. So someone who is actually five will look at the simpler posts, while someone who is interested in the specifics (and is most likely older) will look at detailed answers.</p></div>		</li>
