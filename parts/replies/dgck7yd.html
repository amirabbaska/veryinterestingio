<p>Reddit seems to have enough difficulty keeping servers up that serve core site functionality, search is an added difficulty.  It's clearly not a priority, whether intentionally or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can hook into a dedicated search service that uses its own servers and indexes all of your records for you very easily. Google has such a service. At Reddit's scale it's probably even cost effective to do so given the engineering and server resources they'd save on.  They want their search to be bad, plain and simple.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm very doubtful of anything purported as &quot;easy&quot; at the scale Reddit operates.  There's 250 million users, there has to be billions of posts and comments to work through, billions of monthly page views of which some sizable percentage attempts to use search.  </p>
<p>The cloud works in lots of circumstances but it's expensive and wrought with high latency for large scale installations.  I work at a company that is wildly popular online, and we have to own our own servers because of these reasons.  </p></div>		</li>
