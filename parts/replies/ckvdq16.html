<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\(8.531*10^22\)*\(1.674*10^\(-27\)%20kg\" target="_blank">(8.531*10^(22))(1.674*10^(-27) kg)</a>) = 142 mg, which is a couple grains of sand.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So say it was just us with a magical ability to breathe and a single atom floating around in a voidless area of space.</p>
<p>Would we have any gravitational properties at all so's the atom can actually orbit/be influenced by us?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, anything with mass has its own gravitational field, that is why it is affected by gravity. A hydrogen atom or a golf ball orbiting 10 meters away would take a month to orbit you.</p></div>		</li>
