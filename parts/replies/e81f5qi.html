			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is way off. There aren't &quot;relatively few&quot; types of covalent bonds that can give rise to polymers, and we certainly don't measure their bond strengths to &quot;absurd precision&quot;. Even if we did the relevance of these data to plastic degradation is minimal at best because in the environment plastics are exposed to moisture, oxygen, and light, all of which play a role in breaking them down. What others have said about accelerated degradation studies is correct: we put them under controlled conditions to study how they break down when exposed to a certain set of conditions, and extrapolate to the range of conditions commonly encountered in the environment.</p>
<p>Wood most certainly isn't bonded with similar bonds to most plastics. Cellulose is a polysaccharide while lignin is a complex branched polymer composed of aryl monomers. Meanwhile we have things like polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, PVC, SBR, ABS, SAM, POM, polyamides, polyimides, polyetheretherketones, polysulfones... You get my point. That wood can survive for a very long time under certain conditions is not at all indicative of how long plastics will survive, even under the same conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking for extrapolation as the answer because I wasn't going to bother to write it, but was surprised to see that top-ranked answer, which even had me going &quot;hmmm...&quot;.</p>
<p>It really does go to show the power of writng gud. </p></div>		</li>

<p>recent identification of bacteria and even caterpillars</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is... fascinating. Do we know why this happens? 'How' bacteria decide they need to be able to digest plastic? And could the same occur with radioactive waste, or is that too much to handle?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the replies, they've been very interesting to read!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As to your answer about radioactive waste:</p>
<p>Radioactive waste is toxic because it consists of atoms that have nuclei that are not stable, i.e. over each time interval there is a certain probability that the nucleus splits (fission), releasing energy in the form of ionizing radiation. The ionizing radiation consists of helium nuclei (alpha particles), single electrons/positrons (beta particles) or photons (gamma radiation) that each have enough energy to ionize a molecule. If enough molecules in the DNA or RNA of an organism are ionized the cell can be damaged enough to induce cell death.</p>
<p>This means radioactive waste isn't some molecule that can be broken down into harmless components. It's atoms that are inherently unstable. As such it can not be altered through any biological process.</p></div>		</li>
