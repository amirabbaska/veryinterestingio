<p>The instant admins place new limits on what can or cannot be posted or presented on the frontpage, it's time to move to greener pastures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The HDDVD/BR encryption key scandal was web-wide, to be honest, and not just limited to Digg.  There was a YouTube protest where people literally recorded themselves singing the encryption key in videos.  Digg was just the big social site at the time so it got a lot of attention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DVDs, HDDVDs, and Blu-Rays as they are sold in the stores, are sold with disc encryption. You can think of disc encryption like a lock on a door -- it keeps the content from being removed from the disc, so it can't be copied and/or shared, like on torrent sites.</p>
<p>The 09 F9 key was the hidden <em>master key</em> to all HDDVDs at the time, so using that, anyone could come along and unlock the disc, then copy or share the content. Now keep in mind that this was at a time when HDDVDs and Blu-Rays had <em>just</em> come to market, and were battling fiercely to be the new media standard. Blu-Rays were already boasting the ability to modify encryption on already-pressed discs (whereas HDDVDs has to press a new disc with a new master), so HDDVD was <strong>real</strong> touchy about their key getting out.</p>
<p>And in general, the film industry is just touchy about this anyway -- they've managed to make disappear many software companies that sold software made to crack DVD encryption.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Then they censored posts that contained the HD-DVD/Blu-ray encryption key which caused a huge backlash. Literally the entire front page page contained the key in protest, and the admins couldn't keep up. Eventually they lifted the ban.</p>

<p>I had completely forgotten what made me leave digg and join reddit. That shit got crazy. Thanks for the refresher!</p></div>		</li>
