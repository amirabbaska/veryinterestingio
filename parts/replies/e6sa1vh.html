			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but eye movement is not restricted by sleep paralysis, and the eyelids themselves move quite a bit during sleep. I don't think its a stretch to think that someone who can sleep with their eyes open could blink in their sleep, and this leaves the question still quite open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an anesthesiologist.  When we put patients to sleep for surgery, we make sure to tape their eyes closed and some of us even apply lubricant prior to doing so.  Eyes dry out quickly and bad things can happen even if nothing touches them.  The most common complication in our specialty is corneal abrasions and they happen when the eyes are not taped shut.  They really suck btw, it's like having sand stuck in your eye 24/7.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>What happens when you keep contacts in for too long? Is the damage noticible by the wearer?</p>
<p>I get mixed results when investigating this. I've been wearing contacts for a week straight for the last 10 years and there is no discernable effect yet.</p>
<p>edit: thanks for all the replies, I'm going to have to get into the habit of changing daily.</p>
<p>The reason I've never had an eye infection is probably due to changing to fresh lenses every week and just being in very good health overal. </p>
<p>The reason I've been using my dailies as weeklies is I used to be poor and the habit stuck, they are 50 cent per lens so that saves the difference between 4 bucks or 30 a month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other people have correctly noted the risks but I don't see a reply explaining what hypoxia will do to a human eye over time. Your eye will begin compensating for the lack of oxygen by growing little blood vessels. These little blood vessels will continue to grow for as long as your eyes are deprived. At some point these vessels will become big and fragile enough that even a sneeze will be enough to burst them. Once one of these vessels bursts you will go blind in the eye that housed it as there is no current way to successfully evacuate blood from a cornea. In short, take your god damn contacts out.</p>
<p>Source: I used to wear my contacts too much</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the contact and the starting health of your eye.  Your eyes don't get all the oxygen they need from blood flow, they need to have oxygen exchange with air, too.  </p>
<p>If the contact is very permeable to oxygen, that lowers the risk of hypoxia damage.  Several brands are specifically approved for overnight wear because they have been designed to be highly oxygen permeable.</p>
<p>If you have very good blowflow to your eyes, they are better able to tolerate the reduced oxygen received through the contact.  This is likely to deteriorate with age, so while the last 10 years are OK the next 10 might not be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, if your cornea doesn't get enough oxygen from the air (because it is seperated from the air by a contact lens) then you will start to form blood vessels that carry oxygen to your cornea.</p>
<p>Having blood vessels going across your cornea isn't ideal because it interferes with vision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been wearing Air Optix Night and Day (formerly Focus Night &amp; Day) for 20 years.  Same every 7-10 days in, one night out, back in for a total of 30-40 days, with no issues.   Checkups every 1 to 2 years and consistently my doctor finds eyes are super healthy.</p>
<p>So, I've always highly recommended the Air Optix brand for people wanting to try extended wear lenses.</p></div>		</li>
