			<div class="markdown"><p>I was told while visiting the Grand Tetons that it is a matter of the atmosphere.  Each species of plant needs a certain amount of intake (presumably carbon dioxide) to flourish.  Pressure falls as altitude rises, so there is a precise level beyond which a given type of tree cannot survive.  The highest bits of forest already tend to be pretty homogeneous, being above the threshold for most species.  This is why the upper edges of high altitude forests are so sharply defined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though at a certain point the composition of the atmosphere would take effect, the primary factor behind tree lines is temperature. At a certain point it becomes too cold for the species to survive, or there is too much moisture that remains as snow cover for them to get started.</p>
<p>The atmospheric composition statement can quickly be debunked by comparing altitudes of tree lines across different regions. In tropical and warmer climates you'll find trees at much higher altitudes (in many cases all the way to the mountain tops), where as in colder climates the tree lines will generally be much lower. If the primary factor were atmospheric composition you'd find tree lines across the world were much more uniform in altitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is higher up a lower temperature? Is that just a matter of the atmosphere changing as you go up, or is it because of the shape of the mountain, which leaves the top parts exposed to the wind? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you clarify this? Why would a mean change in atmosphere of 0.01% be the difference between trees and no trees?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curriois too, as I think co2 difference is just one component of the conditions that converge to contribute to distinct tree line boundaries. </p>
<p>Searched and bit off a tad more than I can chew at the moment- but here might be an answer;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may not be correct, since the consensus seems to hold that it is about the need for sufficient time on the warm side of freezing to allow for growth.  I don't think it would be implausible if there was a pressure threshold beyond which respiration would not be possible.  However, the argument about freezing looks solid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems an unusual explanation. The typical reason is because of the amount of freezing versus frost free days at altitude. Above a certain height, depending on latitude and aspect as well, it is too cold for trees to grow. For a perspective on latitude, compare an alpine forest in Colorado, to one in Banff, and the arctic tundra. Latitude controls the tree line as does elevation. <a href="http://northernwoodlands.org/articles/article/why_is_the_treeline_at_a_higher_elevation_in_the_tetons_than_in_the_white_m" target="_blank">http://northernwoodlands.org/articles/article/why_is_the_treeline_at_a_higher_elevation_in_the_tetons_than_in_the_white_m</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer to that question lies in air pressure. Trees take up water from capillary pressure and at high altitude the air pressure is not high enough for the water to travel up the tree so trees can't &quot;drink&quot; water.</p></div>		</li>
