			<div class="markdown"><p>Here to confirm your second point. I worked at a restaurant for 3 years, and we had a company-based health and safety audit and a city health inspection.
We literally would get fed info from other chains when the company's health auditor would come, so one or two days before we expected them, we would be required to stay past our shifts and come  in early to do cleaning that the managers shirked off every night. The grossest shit I've ever seen was in that restaurant cleaning before audits.
When the city health inspector came, they hardly checked anything. It was always so surprising to me.
And that's why I don't work in restaurants anymore :)</p></div>		</li>
