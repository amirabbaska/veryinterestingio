			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be a cigarette butt which could in turn have DNA. That would be sheer luck though. Sometimes ATV tracks can be easier to find because of specific treads. Same for shoes but finding that one spot on match would be quite the challenge. Investigations are so cool to do. The different aspects of what caused the fire, how, where, when. It's all so fascinating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The investigation is really fun, when you are tracking burn indicators for hours and finally find a train brake pad or a lightning tree (my favorite, there is no paperwork) it's pretty exciting. Conservation Officers help a lot with the evidence collection and tracking down of suspects, which is fine cause I'm mostly interested in the fire anyways.</p></div>		</li>
