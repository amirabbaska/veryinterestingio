			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense in my experience.  Before becoming a father, I slept like a log, but ever since I have been much more of a light sleeper.  My wife did the opposite shift, and now tends to sleep more soundly than before parenthood.  The only time this rule doesnt apply is when I'm out of town, in which case I sleep like a log again.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense to me. When I'm trying to sleep, I can sleep through nearly anything. However, I can sleep &quot;with one eye open&quot; as it were, where I'm sleeping very lightly. Though this is for when I nod off during work, or I'm waiting for my turn while playing boardgames.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know the feeling waiting during board games. My mum takes forever, and I mean ten minutes to put her settlements down in Catan forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This definitely exists for me, but I can't usually control it. I'll have nights where I 'wake up' and realize I was never truly asleep the entire evening. I was just in that semi-conscious state right before sleep the entire time.</p></div>		</li>
