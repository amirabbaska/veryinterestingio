<p>I will say this though, they train like a motherfucker. 5-6 days a week. Very common for sports teams in Japan, even to the university level. Even if the team is shit, they'll still train. Its the whole 'ganbaru' - never give up bullshit which consumes the country.</p>

<p>To be fair - when I went to high school in the US, we also had practice 6 days a week for half a season, then 4 days of practice and 2 game days for the other half. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's too bad that they don't &quot;ganbaru&quot; at studying ways to work smarter instead of thinking going all &quot;Kyojin no Hoshi&quot; and thinking hard work is all it takes. I blame manga for continuing to romanticize this way of thinking also.</p></div>		</li>
