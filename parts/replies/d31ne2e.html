<p>Even many space images that are scientifically accurate are enhanced to make them prettier--there's nothing wrong with it, but then people say &quot;Isn't space so beautiful&quot;--well, yes, but this particular image is beautiful because someone intentionally made it that way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not necessarily true. Yes, many pictures, especially those of nebulae and galaxies, don't show what the human eye would see. Instead they are taken with different filters to highlight/show different chemical elements to analyse the distribution of elements. Some of those are composites of several pictures taken with different filters, some are composites with infrared or radio images. But those so called <em>false color images</em> have a lot of scientific use beyond just looking prettier.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I seriously doubt that. Sure, they use special filters to highlight elements, but the false color? That's all about art. I doubt the images used for studies have any color at all. It serves no purpose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but color those images with lots of browns and greys and they don't look as nice. A large part of the reason they look so pretty are the colors <em>chosen</em> to color them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean it should be fairly obvious that we can't take pictures from outside our solar system, let alone our galaxy. I figure they don't bother to label them because everyone knows they're artist's representations. I agree with recoloured random space images though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair I had no idea about artistic liberty taken with many of the images because I first saw them as a kid. Then I never had any reason to dig further and always assumed they were real naked eye photos, or at least I did until I joined reddit a few years back. At which point I was in my late twenties. </p>
<p>Same for underwater photography. Everything is blue down there. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If nothing else, there are always younger people who just won't know any better.  and also people who just never think about that sort of thing, at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although at optical wavelenghts we can indeed not look very far into our own Milky Way, this can be done very well with radio telescopes. Hydrogen emits at 21cm (1420 MHz) and this radiation is not at all absorbed by the gas and dust that extinguishes light so strongly in those directions. Using this signal, you can make some very good maps of the Galaxy showing where e.g. the spiral arms are. This was pioneered in the 1950's by the Dutch radio astronomer Oort.</p></div>		</li>
