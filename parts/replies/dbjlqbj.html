Things like &quot;light year&quot; and &quot;parsec&quot; must be used instead. A light year is something like 9 trillion km. Which would be 9 billion megameters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it is crazy how fast your brain adapts to using different increments. Working in crafts (metalwork) made me think in millimeters for almost anything (besides 'long' distance). </p>
<p>Meters become 1000 millimetres, centimetres become 10 millimetres and sometimes I might have once labled as about 25 centimetres becomes 250 millimeters. I just don't think in larger units anymore, just like I didn't think in a small a unit as millimeters before. </p>
<p>I am sure that if I worked
with something like gigameters for a while my brain would switch around because of the ease of labeling. </p></div>		</li>
