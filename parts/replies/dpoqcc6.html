<p>Somehow I picture a hunter going around wearing that meme horse head now and just walking up to animals as they completely ignore him.</p>
<p>Till ya know, a lion spots him and eats him for being the slowest horse around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was walking along a trail and came very close to a deer. The deer was about to make a run for it and for some reason I started pretending to eat the ferns that were growing at my feet. After about 30 seconds of that the deer completely ignored me. Maybe I had tricked it?</p></div>		</li>
