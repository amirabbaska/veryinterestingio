			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know if there's any sort of mechanism that bloodsuckers have that tells them when to stop feeding? I ask because a while back I was bitten by a mosquito that fattened itself to the point that it was unable to fly (it would comically hover up to about an inch high before falling back down), which made it a lot easier for me to smash it. Obviously, that's a bad spot to put itself into. I'd assume they know to stop before they pop themselves, but it seemed like the one that bit me took it too far. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some blood feeding insects (ex. mosquitoes, phlebotomine sandflies to name a few) undergo a process known as prediuresis,  in which they excrete urine as they feed in order to concentrate the blood protein (the nutrient rich part which they need) and filter our the &quot;junk&quot; (ex. water, parts of the blood that are not needed). This reduces their weight &amp; allows them (most of the time) to fly off after they have finished feeding. This allows them to retain all the nutrients they need, while maintaining a weight which allows them to fly. If you let a mosquito feed for a couple of minutes, you'll see a bunch of liquid droplets fall! It's pretty interesting, but don't try that at home - I did it in a lab where the mosquitoes were bred &amp; they were not carrying any pathogens.</p>
<p>To answer the question you've asked, there is a mechanism that tells them when to stop, but I don't know exactly how it works. Hopefully someone who knows something about that can comment!</p>
<p>Edit: grammar, spelling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mosquitoes, like most other insects, have an insulin signaling pathway. They use insulin-like peptides (ILPs) but it works similar to insulin in us, in that it can signal to send a 'full' signal to the brain. When you mess with this pathway, you can make mosquitoes take smaller or larger meals. They also have nerve cells that can sense the level of abdominal distention which also determines when they will stop feeding and can also drive them to feed again if they haven't reached 'full'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem like a mosquito expert, how come I never get bitten by mosquitos but my SO gets absolutely devoured right next to me? Sometimes I think that i might get bitten also, but I just don't react to it like she does. On the other hand, I've seen mosquitos having a bit more trouble piercing my skin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm allergic to mosquito bites and of course they <em>love</em> me (will bite me over anyone else in the room), so a story about one dying in a hilarious fashion brightened up my day considerably. thanks!</p>
<p>if anyone's wondering how my allergy manifests: a bite will swell up to the size of a golf ball, sometimes tennis ball. it forms a huge hard disc that sits underneath my skin, which is visibly white, with the actual bite sitting neatly in the middle looking like a tiny red dot. it itches like the devil, usually between 7-10 days. nothing will stop the itching, and it drives me insane. i have many relatives and friends that do nothing to prevent mosquitoes from entering their house, as they don't care if they're bitten. so whenever i have to stay there, I'm in hell</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I chased a fat one one around my living room for about 15 minutes without letting it rest. It got slower and slower and took more and more frequent rests at each end of the room until in the end it just sat on the wall while I ended it with a leisurely swipe from a rolled up newspaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a pro tip that will let you catch flies 100% of the time. It's a fun little party trick. When a fly lands, instead of approaching it from the top, but your hand even with it, and just swipe and close your hand. you'll catch it every time with practice. then it's just easy to throw it outside. or shake your fist, and throw them at people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I study flight behavior of fruit flies, and the experiments I run require the fly to remain in flight for 15 minutes straight. This tends to be right around the border of what most of them can handle.</p>
<p>Obviously fruit flies aren't house flies, but they are closely related in the grand scheme of insects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i have the same question. with insects like houseflies, even if their flying is relatively efficient for them, it still seems incredibly energy intensive to beat their wings so fast, and amazing that they don't need to constantly refuel, or can keep flying for more than a few seconds.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Really? I have seen some seriously fat house flies in my time. And skinny little starved ones when it gets colder/less rotting things around. Are these just different ages of fly? Do they not fluctuate in mass depending on food sources?</p></div>		</li>
