			<div class="markdown"><p>From what little digging I was able to do, I found the No.3 (Schofield) to end production around 1898 and the service history (it appears) ends in 1915. However, the Nagant began production in 1895 and had a service history up until the 1950's. The Russians definitely had a shortage of rifles from what I was able to find, and the doctrine suggests they would actually take up a rifle from a fallen colleague. I can't seem to find any hard information whether regular soldiers or only officers were issued service handguns in Russia at the time. I'm not going to say it was equally likely, but I'd probably lean a bit more towards the Nagant. The remaining No 3's would probably have been used up by reserve troops by 1917.</p>

<p>I also want to add that writers typically suck at writing about guns realistically (turn the safety off on your glock /s). Surdez was born in 1900 in Switzerland and moved to the US at 13, and as I understand remained and finished school in New York. I can't find a history of military service for Surdez either, and that is fair, considering he would be 18ish around the end of WWI. Like most people he probably didn't have a very great knowledge of firearms, and just used the 6 shot revolver as a trope. As Surdez was a child in the west during WWI, I have a hard time believing he knew how Russians in Romania were outfitted in 1917 even if he wrote about it 20 years later. </p>
<p>edit: more info and sources</p>
<p>Edit2: it gets deeper. </p>
<p>So the Nagant revolver has a fixed cylinder, so it can't be &quot;snapped back into placed&quot; like the author describes. However, the no.3 is a break open, so it might be more likely in this scenario, yet the cylinder and barrel assembly move together. But I really believe the author is referring to a cylinder that moves out of the side of a gun, similar to the 1917 US service revolver. This really leads me to believe Surdez didn't know what guns they had at all, and just described a generic (to him) revolver.</p>
<p>(The following links show what I mean as far as the cylinders are concerned)</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/CIBH2GLIyRU?t=161" target="_blank">No. 3</a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/N9o_ALC-e7c?t=411" target="_blank">1917 service revolver</a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cLJz288AY0M?t=36" target="_blank">This</a> kind of seems like what the author was describing. With the exception of the number of rounds being different. </p>
<p>TLDR; The Nagant doesn't function right for the authors description, the no.3 kind of does, but it's most likely the author was describing a different style of revolver altogether. </p></div>		</li>
