			<div class="markdown"><p>Your blood will clot in water, but it will take longer.  They don't have to be dry.  Clots are formed by a nonsoluble (won't break down in water or oil) protein called fibrin.  Platelets are called by your body to the place you're bleeding from and begin pumping out glue to make everything stick together.</p>
<p>Blood becomes slippery when washed off with soap because soap contains chemicals that will break down the glue faster than the other materials.  Your hands will only stay slippery if you don't wash them well enough.  Blood is really smooth because it has to be, so it doesn't get hung up in your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not only due to platelets either. Because of many proteins in the blood called <em>coagulation factors</em>, blood exhibits certain weird traits as a liquid. It gets thinner (less viscous) the more you move it, for example. If blood stops moving, it will become thicker and thicker until it eventually forms a solid clump, completing the process known as <em>coagulation</em>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how this specifically applies to the soap example, but I just wanted to add that coagulation factors are also very important in the coagulation process. Platelets are rather ineffective without them, and vice versa.</p></div>		</li>
