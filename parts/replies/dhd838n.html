			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? I thought that meth mouth was due to the fact that meth is cytotoxic, as in its toxic to cells. I know that for drugs like heroin appearance changes due to lack or personal hygiene and such but I believe that meth causes direct damage because it corrodes the body in a way that many drugs do not. Maybe I'm mistaken though. Meth is not really a thing where I live so I don't know any users/much about the subject in general:</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah- so I don't know why they didn't do a little work on them to make them a little more scuzzy,budget I guess- also maybe because he was only supposed to be in it for one season they didn't think it was too big a deal. He was supposed to be killed off at the end of season one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand... he grew up in a nice middle income suburban home.  His dental health was probably very well attended to.  He was a dealer riding on an inheritance at a very young age.  I doubt his teeth would be THAT fucked up s few years out of high school even with infrequent meth use.  Weed and cigarettes don't do That much damage in the short term.</p></div>		</li>
