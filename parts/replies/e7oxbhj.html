			<div class="markdown"><p>In a technical sense (materials engineering) some of his definitions are wrong or more of a colloquial definition. </p>
<p>He has swapped the definition of strength with toughness. Strength is the ability to resist stresses applied to a material. Toughness is what the other person said and is the amount of energy needed to induce fracture.</p>
<p>The other definition of his to be weary of is hardness. Hardness is a surface phenomenon of how able a material is resist indentation. It is measured by applying a known force through a small indenter an measuring the size of the mark made. Different scales use different forces and indenter shapes.</p>
<p>Those are the two big ones, but there are others.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Toughness = overcooked steak versus ground beef</p>
<p>Brittleness = cheesecake versus chicken breast</p>
<p>Ductility = Taffy</p>
<p>Malleability = pizza crust</p>
<p>Hardness = granny's fruitcake versus angelfood cake</p>
<p>LMAO! I like the way you think, my friend. :D</p></div>		</li>
