			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more that the question itself is malformed, like asking what happens if you stand at the north pole and go north.</p>
<p>Under a Classical GR model, there is no &quot;before&quot; t=0. It's not that we just can't determine what preceded the Big Bang. It's that the notion of events preceding the first moment of time is incoherent.</p>
<p>LATE EDIT: I'm just adding to this post rather than responding to 10 different people with the same comment. For everyone who says that asking what came before the Big Bang isn't necessarily incoherent, or that there could be time prior to the Big Bangâ€”you're right! The operative qualifier was &quot;Under a Classical GR model.&quot; You can always violate the assumptions of whatever theorem you're working with and thereby escape its implications.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not exactly.  Let me quote Stephen Hawking, from <a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-beginning-of-time.html" target="_blank">this page</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since events before the Big Bang have no observational consequences, one may as well cut them out of the theory, and say that time began at the Big Bang. Events before the Big Bang, are simply not defined, because there's no way one could measure what happened at them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not that it's incoherent, it's just that it's impossible, even in theory, to derive any information about it whatsoever.   So we <em>might as well</em> say time started at t=0, and all discussion about t&lt;0 is purely baseless what-if-   But there's no reason to suspect there wasn't a different spacetime before, just like ours.  Or a different kind.  Or nothing.  Or who knows what?  It's perfectly fine to conjecture, as long as you remember that your opinions on the subject are as valid as those of any high school dropout taking acid for the first time in the forest.</p>
<p>Not <em>incoherent</em>, just <em>unknowable</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is there any way we can figure out how the big bang happened? As far as I am aware, all of the universe existed at one point before the big bang and then expanded into the space we know now during and after.</p>
<p>Is it also incoherent to ask what did the universe grow in?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not pointless to ask. But it is meaningless to ask within GR. A more powerful and complete theory of gravity may be capable of answering that question. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The distance to the cosmic event horizon, on the other hand, is decreasing over time in comoving coordinates. That means that eventually all we will see in the sky are stars in our own galaxy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like a confusing way to state this to me. We always &quot;see&quot; more  stars with time because the particle horizon increases, but eventually all but the closest of these stars will be red shifted to the point we can't really detect them anymore. The decreasing cosmic event horizon doesn't directly impact the number of stars we can see, only the number of stars we can talk to. Right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that's right. I was going to clarify once I was able to paste links to some previous posts. </p>
<p>Galaxies that come into our view never leave it, but they do redshift to the point where we can't detect them. And yes you're right that the cosmic horizon is really about what galaxies we can talk to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't that mean the universe is almost like a reverse black-hole? The light can't reach us due to the acceleration of the universal expansion in the same way light cannot escape the black whole due to its own gravitational acceleration. That's got to be related in some way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well thank you for a supportive response. I have many varied interests and few hobbies. Unfortunately I'm a &quot;jack of all trades, king of none&quot; type. The higher-order thinking on display here is fascinating, but Ill likely never spend the time or effort required to attain such understanding of the cosmos.</p></div>		</li>
