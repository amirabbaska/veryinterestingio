<p>Would the Earth really be consumed in minutes?  We're trying to fit the entire Earth into a nickle.  Wouldn't there be a bottle neck as the matter collides and releases x-rays which impact the matter above and the radiation pressure hinders the infalling matter?  I'm not saying the Earth wouldn't be destroyed.  Even on the opposite side of the planet, the acceleration would still be nearly 50 g, but I would think more of an accretion disk would form.  To be consumed, you need to hit the hole, otherwise you just go in orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a fair point. I do expect a large disk to form, but there is the distinct difference between other systems that we study or simulate; the entire earth is initially at rest with respect to the black hole. When accretion disks form in space, for example from a companion, that material already has a considerable amount of angular momentum before it gets heated by the disk. </p>
<p>I'm not sure how the magnitude of the radiation pressure would compare to the force of gravity and I honestly have no real sense for the energy considerations of this problem or size of the resulting disk. </p>
<p>Edit: And now that I've put some more thought into I've rewritten my post and fixed a few gross math errors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would also look pretty neat if you consider that the black hole is appearing on the surface of the Earth, 1 Earth's radius away from the center, traveling at around 1,000 miles per hour.</p>
<p>That would probably make for some pretty wicked slingshot effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, you're saying a black hole with a mass slightly higher than the Earth itself, in New York City, will pull with roughly 50 g of acceleration on objects in Australia?</p>
<p>If the mass of the new celestial body is only slightly more than double the original mass, why is it not adding only 0.5 g (it is twice as far away as the center of the Earth, after all)?</p>
<p>This is where my meager understanding of black holes collapses like a paper cup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking the same thing. Only I would expect it to be 0.25 g, because the distance term is squared.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that doesn't add up to me.</p>
<p>I think part of the blame lies on this all being based in theoretical physics, but I think the math just doesn't check out.</p>
<p>It's pretty well-understood that if, for example, the Sun were to collapse into a black hole, all that would happen (physics-wise) is our sky would go dark nine minutes later. The gravitational force is the same, and our orbit would be unchanged.</p>
<p>In the same way, if the Earth collapsed into our nickel-sized black hole... well, we begin falling towards it at 1g. Unfortunately, that acceleration accelerates as we get there, thanks to the inverse-square law (the reason we get a constant 1G at the surface is that the surface gets in the way of getting closer to the center). So yeah, we die. Satellites in orbit get a free pass, though. However, I'm 99% sure you're correct in believing that with no change in mass, there will be no change in gravity in an equally distant location.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually more what would happen, the black hole couldn't consume enough matter at an appreciable rate, it would take time. Also the center of gravity of both would attract each other, so the black hole would just eat itself into the core of the earth and the earth approached it's center of gravity. Earth would exist for a little while as its slowly eaten away at from the center, because the energy going in repels itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, this is more convincing. Except the center of mass of the system is basically at the black hole, not the center of the earth. I expect that the black hole will pull the center of the earth toward it, and the earth will enter some bizarre sort of harmonic motion, oscillating about the black hole with columns of mass getting swept up by the black hole with each pass. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't a black hole drop like a stone through water, pass the core, nearly get to the surface on the other side of the earth, and then continue oscillating? I wouldn't think the density of the Earth's crust would slow a singularity appreciably. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So since I'm not doing my work like I'm supposed to be, I did a really quick calculation. Assuming the radius of the black hole is that of a nickel, I got 0.000005 solar masses. Putting that into the equation for the Roche limit gives a distance of just over 10 million meters. The moon is about 38 times farther away than that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but you have to remember the moon isn't instantaneously changing its velocity in this scenario, so it's not going to be in a circular orbit anymore.  The earth-moon distance is the apoapsis of this new highly-eliptical moon orbit, not the periapsis.  I'm not sure how to calculate this new orbit; I know it can be done knowing the mass, distance, and orbital velocity at apoapsis, but I'm betting it dives pretty close to the new black hole and (I'd think) gets tidally shredded on closest approach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but the Moon is moving around the Earth at 1 km/s.  Depending on where OP and the black hole were on the Earth, the relative motion of the Moon with respect to the black hole would be anywhere from 0.5 to 1.5 km/s.  Combined with the black hole's much stronger gravitational pull, the Moon's new orbit would be highly elliptical, with a perigee of between 300 and 3000 km.  That's much closer than the Moon's Roche limit, so the Moon would be broken up at its first perigee passing, within 1-2 days of the black hole's appearance.</p></div>		</li>
