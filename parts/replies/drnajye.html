			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, mechanical stimulation through exercise can lessen accumulation of bone marrow fat. Right now the exact mechanisms are unclear, but it's likely a combination of better caloric regulation as well as shifting the balance of differentiation towards osteoblasts that improve bone health with exercise. However you can't prevent it entirely as it is a natural process of aging that begins in adolescence.</p></div>		</li>
