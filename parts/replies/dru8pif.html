			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same as you: I'm almost deaf in one ear. I've never experienced the phenomenon discussed here, but I've come close.</p>
<p>I've set the audio on my Android devices to mono, and I enjoy my music so much more now. </p>
<p>On my desktop, I don't want to switch to mono audio because it bugs my friends when we play games together. So I bought a mono earbud. It mixes both channels into my good ear and I don't miss a thing.</p>
<p>Feel free to PM me if you want. I can send you the link to the earbud I bought.</p>
<p>Edit: I've received several PMs from people and replied to them, so I'll go ahead and post the links to the earbuds I bought for anyone else who's interested. I use this one on my desktop: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01FECB318/ref=ya_aw_od_pi?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01FECB318/ref=ya_aw_od_pi?ie=UTF8&psc=1</a> . </p>
<p>However, my desktop earbud doesn't play nice with my phone. So I bought and tested another mono earbud on my phone (even though I have mono audio enabled). I've used this one on my phone and I haven't encountered any issues: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01L2SW38U/ref=ya_aw_od_pi?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01L2SW38U/ref=ya_aw_od_pi?ie=UTF8&psc=1</a> . </p>
<p>Hope this helps people! If anyone has any questions or wants to talk about hearing loss, feel free to drop me a PM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fellow one sided deaf person here. Another neat thing I've found is cross feed plugins for media players. Occasionally you can find it built-in, in the settings. It mixes the channels so you don't miss anything, but the sound coming from the other channel will be quieter, so you still can have some semblance of spatial sound.</p>
<p>I wish it was included in games and the like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was actually a setting on my old surround sound system on my tv (remember when those were a thing?) called &quot;Theater Stereo&quot; or something similar that made it sound like the voices were in the dead middle of the screen while the actual background noises, cars driving past, etc all followed the direction on screen. Blew my mind as a kid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And also, more expensive headphones are manufactured to tighter tolerances - less discrepancy between two channels' volume levels. There's an extra step to match left and right sides of a pair of earphones to a closer tolerance, therefore it takes longer to build a pair (and you can have more waste/rejected equipment).</p>
<p>So, say, a $50 pair of earphones might be matched to +/- 6 dB of each other. A $100 pair might get +/-3 dB, but a $1000 pair might be down to +/- 1 dB before they go into a box and hit the shelf. This can extend to how the earphones reproduce the full spectrum of audible frequencies, as well as their overall loudness. The challenge is found in mass producing large amounts of these to an acceptable specification and consistency with a low rejection rate -- and the really good ones sound good, too!</p>
<p>Manufacturing materials may be only a few dollars more between pairs, but again economies of scale come into play (fewer pairs leave the factory per hour) - usually the higher-priced earphones come with more expensive packaging, larger marketing budgets, higher R&amp;D costs etc. to match.</p>
<p>Edit: I could be just thinking about deviation 3-6 dB from a given frequency response, or just dB SPL on a much smaller (2-3 dB) level - fwiw, I'm not exactly an engineer but rather a marketing guy with a strong physics background. There is some credence to be given to the fact that measurement of frequency response and acceptable tolerance DOES tend to decrease as price increases. Say that two products have printed specs of 5 Hz to 50 kHz frequency response, the one that is centered +/-1 dB is going to be significantly more expensive than one +/-3 to 6 dB. Regardless, nobody's walking around listening to 1kHz @ 1 mV test tones, white noise and frequency sweeps ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That being said, your perception of left-center-right depends on the mix of whatever the track is. Pretty much every instrument is mixed so that one doesn’t overpower anything else and you hear all of the instruments from different angles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has a lot to do with neuroscience-- the auditory nerves have a &quot;coincidence detection&quot; system that can localize sounds based on the difference in time between a sound reaching both of the ears. </p>
<p>A signal only gets sent when input from both ears reach a coincidence detection (relay) neuron at the same time. When there is very little difference in timing (and the source of the sound is so close to the ears) the location can't be determined as well-- so, in the case of headphones, it feels like it's coming from the middle of your head. </p>
