			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, that's right! I forgot about the rifling inside the barrel. I wonder how fast the rifling gets the bullet spinning? Would it be a significant impediment to catching the falling bullet in your hand?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that there's a car going past at the speed of a bullet.  Even if they set up the software so the bullet would shoot at exactly the right time to drop next to you, that's a lot of turbulence.  Would you still be alive?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bullets spin incredibly fast (upwards of 100,000 rpm), so it would likely glove some of the skin off the palm of your hand, then maybe break your bones when it became too unbalanced and started to wobble widly.  The bigger the bullet, the more inertia there.  Plus, the sudden imbalance could cause some bullets to explode like a grenade, as they nearly instanteously rip themselves apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if we take the original position of the bullet to be where the chamber of the gun is located before it's fired, wouldn't it end up slightly displaced in the direction of the car's travel? The car is moving at the bullet's final velocity to begin with, but the bullet needs time to attain that velocity. There will be a period of time when the car is traveling faster than the bullet, and so it will continue to move in the direction that the car for that interval.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All that matters is the bullets speed as it exits the muzzle, because at that precise moment, it stops accelerating forward, or rotationally.  So as long as the speed of the car matches the speed of bullet's speed as it leaves the muzzle, then the hypothetical situation would produce the intended result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I realize that there would be no <em>additional</em> movement from the moment the bullet actually <em>leaves the gun</em>. But what I'm talking about is <em>from the moment the gun is fired</em>. While the bullet is still in the barrel, it has not yet reached its maximum velocity.</p>
<p>For example, if we pick the interval where the bullet is accelerating from 3 m/s to 4 m/s in one direction relative to the barrel, the car is moving considerably faster in the opposite direction (let's call it -400 m/s). Consequently, the gun and the barrel (minus recoil effects) must also be moving at -400 m/s. So for that interval, wouldn't the bullet be moving at -397 to -396 m/s? And wouldn't that mean there was some displacement from the bullet's starting position when the gun was fired?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, relative to the ground the bullet would decelerate to zero horizontal speed over a short distance. Also, if you want to get picky, the car would accelerate slightly from the recoil (assuming the gun is attached to the car). But that's probably bit more detail than OP had in mind.</p></div>		</li>
