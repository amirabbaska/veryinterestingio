			<div class="markdown"><p>Technical grade helium is also used for deep (50m+) scuva dives as a replacement for nitrogen.
The price of helium is now so high that a fill of normal air about $7 while a tank of trimix with ~50% helium costs $70-$100 depending on place.</p>
<p>This means that the highest cost with today's pricing for getting your trimix certification is the breathing gas itself, even if you have to travel for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just spectroscopy - lots of experiments require helium. I've heard of some labs being effective shut down for months before because they can't get the helium they need. A lot of the shortages (at least in the US) seem to be due to bad policy decisions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use helium as a carrier gas in GC/MS, to degas mobile phases in LC, and as a collision gas in ICP-MS. No access to helium for these spectroscopic techniques would put the biggest hurt on providing nutritional information, pharmaceutical characterization, and multiple points in chemical manufacturing, namely for semiconductors. </p></div>		</li>
