<p>Things can be contaminated and sour tasting too, and a lot of microorganisms that can grow on food also excrete acidic waste products </p></div>		</li>

<p>Here's a source showing that acidity (sourness) is protective.</p>

<p>here's a source showing acidity makes things sour.</p>
<p>The last bit of evidence to support the hypothesis would be that humans don't like mildly sweet (but non sour, non bitter, non salty) things as much as very sweet, and mixed sweet with sour or salty flavors. </p>
<p>Regarding your dextrose comment, <em>very</em> sweet things like sugar don't count because some things are <em>too</em> sweet to be contaminated. Honey, for instance, is so sugary that nothing can grow in it. The hypothesis would be that there exists some intermediate degree of sweetness (presumably combined with texture or temperature cues and some mild bitterness cues) that is either unpleasant or less pleasant than the equivalent combined with sour or salty.  I don't have sources for human taste preferences but subjectively speaking this checks out to me. For example, candy corn. Some people like it but the mildly sweet and otherwise bland flavor is pretty controversial. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There are very few manufactured soft drinks that aren't highly acidic.</p></div>		</li>
