			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like it all could be done a million times better.</p>
<p>In Australia paramedicine is a 3 year Bachelor's degree from a university. There used to be diploma level training run by the ambulance service but there has been phased out in most states. We don't have EMT's, but do have patient transport officers (in my state) for non emergent/pre-booked transfers. Where I am I see mainly paramedics doing transfers though as our patients are often higher acuity.</p>
<p>Each state's Ambulance service is run by the state health department, meaning that state taxes fund the service and there is no discrepancy in service level between small towns and big cities. There are rural/remote allowances paid if you're working in those areas, but otherwise there is no discrepancy in pay. </p>
<p>In my state we pay extra tax meaning everyone is covered for an ambulance. In other states you can pay &quot;Ambulance insurance&quot; which is around ~A$45 (~US$32) a year so very affordable.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't have EMT's, then who does your non-emergent medical transport? Like a bed bound patient heading to the nursing home? I work in a hospital and make these transfers all the time. Seems like a waste to have a paramedics accompanying grandpa to the nursing home. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US has 3 levels (typically) of prehospital caregivers. EMT-B, EMT-I, and Paramedic. That was due to a shortage of Medics so they wanted to get people on the ground that at least had some training to help that burden. Some states only recognize EMT-Bs and Paramedics. Each state handles the licensing of the ambulance districts and EMTs/Medics but there are also local policies of each ambulance district. The district I work for is supplemented by sales tax. We are in such a rural area though that not much sales tax comes from our little area. It certainly helps that we can bill insurance because have you looked at how expensive an ambulance is lately?</p>
<p>Now I've not heard of ambulance insurance here in the states but we do have insurance programs for helicopter ambulances (air evac). They sell you a yearly membership and that money goes to support the air ambulance. If you ever get in a bad auto wreck and need to be airlifted the company will still bill your insurance (if applicable) for whatever they can get but they will not send you a bill to pick up the rest if you are a member. You gotta watch that though because those helicopters have weight limits and some patients exceed that. The salesman doesn't care though. He'll sell you a membership knowing that we can't fly you if we needed to. Another thing about it is that if your area is covered by 3 helicopter services and you buy a membership to the one furthest away by air... yeah, that isn't going to help you. If we are flying you to a hospital we aren't going to wait 10 more minutes just so you can save a bill. You are probably in rough shape and we're flying you NOW.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can bill your private health insurance for Ambulances in Australia too (in states where it's not state-funded). But so few people have private health insurance that ambulance only insurance is needed for them. I guess the higher proportion of people with private insurance in the US means that ambulance only insurance isn't as necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You hit the nail on the head, most people in this thread are disregarding that today there is not a standard of education for EMT's/Paramedics. In the US I can literally take an private online paramedic program that is 16-18 months long, meanwhile my program was done at a college and I got a degree out of it. Meanwhile a nurse that got their education in California will be similar to the education a nurse got in New York. The majority of nurses also have one of the strongest unions in the country that are able to fight for higher wages and benefits. For example, a nurse with overtime, holiday pay, and shift differential can sometimes make more than a Physician Assistant or a Nurse Practitioner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the majority of nurses are not unionized. There are many many nurses in many states that have crappy pay and crappy benefits. The range even in the same city is outrageous, and it varies hugely by hospital and specialty. And there's a lot of other things that should be taken into consideration, like staffing ratios and weekend requirements. Sure, my hospital won't give one nurse more than five patients as policy, but some hospitals go up to 8 or 9 and that's just insane.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of variations on education too. You can have an associates degree and be an RN. You can have a bachelors of masters and be an RN. You could have went to a crappy diploma mill school and passed your nclex, or you could have went to a prestigious university. All of these things are taken into account in hiring (at least in areas that have a good amount of nurses, some areas can't afford to be picky and take what they can get). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The labor supply and demand curves are not &quot;factors&quot; in determining how much a job pays. The &quot;factors&quot; are things like job difficulty, which is understood in the supply/demand framework as moving the labor supply curve to the left (which may or may not increase the wage), and in a way job importance, which can indirectly move the labor demand curve to the right through price increase in the product/service market (or not). The labor demand curve is even more nebulous than the supply curve.</p>
<p>Someone appears to say they are agreeing with you, but are essentially disagreeing with you, since they say that garbage men make more because no one wants to do that job, which is similar to saying it's because of job difficulty.</p>
<p>It might be best to say that the main factor determining how much a job pays is nothing; wages are often based on no sense, and though influenced by relevant factors, are influenced in nebulous and unjustifiable ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ultimately that is all still supply and demand though, you are just arguing semantics. No one is a garbage man because no one WANTS to be a garbage man, sure if you think about &quot;job difficulty&quot; broadly enough then yes that is why the supply is low, but you are just stating the same point slightly differently.</p>
<p>There is a number that corresponds to how much someone should be paid, it's not &quot;nothing&quot;, but due to the increasing size and complexity of the economy that number is absurdly difficult to calculate. In reality, we simplify that into ambiguous terms and instead say that the biggest &quot;factor&quot; in how much someone is paid is anchoring. You only know how much you should be paid based on how much someone else is paid and how you compare to them. This is why revealing your pay should be completely normal, your pay will be very far off the mark if you have nowhere to anchor to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no, actually that was a supporting example<br />
the difficulty of the job is not a direct factor, it wouldn't be a factor at all if it didn't affect supply</p></div>		</li>
