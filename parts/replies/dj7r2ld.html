<p>Lets be honest though, senators usually don't read the bills themselves anyways, they have someone(assistants, interns, lobbyists) else read it and give them talking points about why it's good or bad. Also the text isn't usually finalized until shortly before the vote. (Which was the root of the Pelosi &quot;we have to pass it to find out what's in it quote&quot;, the final changes were not yet done when she made that speech)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup, that's true too, although it's not always as bad as it sounds at first glance. For a lot of bills, you kind of need to be an expert to truly understand the nitty gritty anyway, so having an aide translate it from legalese is ok. (But that does give aides/lobbyists/whoever <em>a lot</em> of incidental power)</p>

<p>Also true, although usually the broad strokes are pretty well known. It's not uncommon for touchups during the amendment process to get it over the finish line</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure re: broad strokes. My issue is that in the few fields I am decently knowledgeable in the nitty gritty small thing are usually where the really shitty stuff is happens. What sounds like (to the layperson, which senators are) a minor change could make a common practice illegal or an illegal practice common. (Also those small last minute amendments are usually where most of the wheeling and dealing things are snuck in)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used scale, but &quot;big&quot; isn't really the right word. Far reaching effects/unintended? is more where i was aiming at. It's still not quite the right word. I wasn't happy with big, but couldn't decide on a better phrase.</p>
<p>It's been used on big stuff<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/23/13709518/budget-reconciliation-explained" target="_blank">(Vox has a nice list here)</a> which in pure dollar terms might've been bigger, but aren't on the same kind of scale in terms of impact. You could probably make an argument for the Bush tax cuts or welfare reform (probably the latter more than the former IMO) as coming pretty close. but i think it's fair to say that this will probably &quot;bigger&quot;, especially if it's similar to the AHCA. </p></div>		</li>
