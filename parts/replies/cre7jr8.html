			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Fry:</strong> Well, usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan then explain it with a simple analogy.</p>
<p><strong>Leela:</strong> Hmm. If we can re-route engine power through the primary weapons and reconfigure them to Melllvar's frequency, that should overload his electro-quantum structure.</p>
<p><strong>Bender:</strong> Like putting too much air in a balloon!</p>
<p><strong>Fry:</strong> Of course! It's so simple!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since we know the speed of light, can we measure the speed at which two particles of light are moving away from each other and derive how &quot;fast&quot; space is expanding? If we could, what would be the meaning/usefulness of such information? I hope that makes sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, we actually do know the rate of expansion of space. Its about 74 km/s/mpc. Or, 74 kilometers per second per megaparsec (about 3 million lightyears).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes we can. Amazingly we can also figure out how fast space used to be expanding in the past as well as how fast it is expanding now. Up until 5 billion years ago the expansion of space was decelerating because of gravity. Then it started accelerating and we don't really know why, but it probably has something to do with dark energy. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space#Understanding_the_expansion_of_the_Universe" target="_blank">here</a> for more explanations</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct, but only because the rate that space expands is accelerating. If it was expanding at a constant speed, the ants would always eventually meet (even if it took a really long time).</p>
