			<div class="markdown"><p>It should also be mentioned that warfarin has a VERY tiny therapeutic index. Meaning that even a slight change to the dosage (too much or too little) can be lethal. Most drugs don't have this problem. </p>
<p>Back when warfarin was made generic in Australia a few people died because the inactive ingredients they used changed the bioavailability of the drug slightly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not quite that terrible for most people who take it. </p>
<p>After a thrombosis it's a good idea to reduce coagulation for a bit to prevent another one. At that level people will notice that small wounds bleed far longer than before, and an accident would get ugly faster, but they don't usually just start bleeding at random.</p>
<p>Some people need their coagulation reduced a lot further, f.ex. after getting a mechanical heart valve. It's not so much that the drug itself is dangerous, the patients are balancing on the narrow ledge between an embolus caused by the heart valve and spontaneous bleeding (mostly gastrointestinal, not always easy to notice before it's an emergency) . At that point there really isn't much room for error anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It's like how a car has different options like moonroof, all wheel drive, upgraded speakers, etc. - each option is a different isoform.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol. That happens sometimes. Luckily the rules say that it doesn't have to literally be understood by a 5 year old. </p>
<p>Some things can't be accurately broken down into &quot;bad things in your kidneys do bad things to your heart&quot; and make sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but CYP3A4 plays a minor role in warfarin metabolism, and so there is not a significant interaction with grapefruit juice. (Grapefruit <em>is</em> a major interaction with amiodarone for heart arrhythmias or simvastatin for cholesterol.)</p></div>		</li>
