			<div class="markdown"><p>Never worn goggles like that, but I wear contacts that correct for near vision in the left eye and far vision in the right eye. So, when I have them in, I can see up close with the left eye and far away with the right eye. </p>
<p>This was one of the options offered to me in place of bifocals, and I jumped on it. </p>
<p>The first time I put in my new contacts, I couldn't see a damned thing. The optometrist told me to give it about 10 minutes. So I'm kinda just stumbling around the room, trying not to fall over stuff and suddenly it just clicked in my brain. It was like my brain did a reboot, said &quot;oh, the eyes work this way now,&quot; and everything was fine.  </p>
<p>I've been wearing them so long now that it really is put the contacts in, blink, and...perfect vision. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had neglected my eyes for a long time, and when I finally updated my prescription my left eye had to learn how to &quot;see&quot; again. I was SO clumsy for a few days because I suddenly had depth perception again.</p>
<p>Edit: to explain, my left eye wasn't really working. The prescription got stronger and stronger but my right eye didn't change. It wasn't doing anything, just sort of <em>there.</em> My right eye was doing all the seeing, and giving me my (probably shitty) depth perception. Having full, corrected vision in both eyes instead of just one was very jarring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask why you didn’t have depth perception and what that felt like? Apparently my eyes don’t focus on the same centerpoint. An optometrist told me many people are born that way but their eyes strengthen over time and it goes away by the time they reach adolescence but for some reason it didn’t for me. She said the only real noticeable problem I might have is a lack of depth perception but since I’ve never seen any other way so I don’t know what it would be like to have depth perception.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once had some inflammation in one eye and the optometrist recommended me to simply not wear the contact for that eye for a couple of days, maybe a week. I'm very short sighted.</p>
<p>What ensued were two days of major headache and feeling very tired until I decided to just wear my old glasses (was from a much older prescription hence being plan B) instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I can do this, just. It's so strange, I really have to focus to get it to switch, but once it does then you don't have to focus any more, and it carrys on going the other way.</p>
<p>The techniqe I use is to imagine the swinging leg as a pendulum swinging in a 2d plane. Forget about the rest of the body, just concentrate on the black line swinging left to right. If you are imagining this  pendulum to be swinging Infront  of the pivot leg, then to switch its direction you need to imagine the swinging leg to be swinging behind the pivot instead. Then refocus on the whole body and it will be spinning in the other direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I have no idea how anyone can see this as spinning counter clockwise. I wonder what makes it different for some people? Does it have something to do with spatial intelligence?</p>
<p>Edit: After searching somewhere else, I found a way to convince yourself that she's spinning in the other direction. Focus on the foot touching the ground. Whenever that foot appears to be facing you, imagine it facing the other direction. After a few rotations of you doing that, it somehow spins the other direction when you look at the whole thing again.</p>
<p>I think this works becuase the foot is a small enough area to manipulate in your head easily. It is also fairly isolated from any other area of motion, allowing you to ignore other spinning areas that you would otherwise have to pay attention to. Since it is easier to trick yourself into thinking a simply shaped object is spinning in the opposite direction, you begin to see the foot spinning opposite to how you saw it spinning originally after a few rotations of focusing on it as described. This means that when you shift your focus to the rest of the figure, you are forced to assume that the rest of the figure is spinning in the same direction as the foot, so the whole body changes its direction.</p>
<p>If anyone else had a different experience tell me please. This is very interesting to me, and I would like to think about it and discuss it more. Thanks to everyone who talked with me about it.</p></div>		</li>

Two days ago I was on my home subreddit, squaredcircle, and someone made a reference.  Greatest reddit day ever.  Now this, this is my second greatest reddit day ever.  Thank you for brightening my life with my teenybopper childhood coming back to me.  </p></div>		</li>
