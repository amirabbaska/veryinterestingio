<p>All in all, concrete is a far superior material in construction, with the exception of earthquakes, but there are even ways of accounting for that.</p>
<p>Uo here, north of the order, a house must've placed on a foundation that sits below the ground in order to  prevent the building from shifting and heaving during winter since the ground moisture freezes, and thus expands.</p>
<p>The foundation is typically made of concrete asit has superior strengths against compression from the earth, and rot from moisture. The portions aboveground aremadeof wood. A standard basement foundation (9 foot walls, 5 inch floor, etc .) Can be 50,000 + dollars, this gets you a footing, the foundation walls, and the floor. The rest of the building (main floor, walls, and roof) tends to be 10,000 dollars. </p>
<p>Concrete also poses the issue of electrical/plumbing. With a wood structure, pipes and wire can run right in the walls by simply drilling holes through the studs and joists. With concrete, you have to plan out the plumbing in the floor and pour over the pipes, meaning that any issues with the system will be costly to repair (jackhammering, repouring). And you usually have to line the exterior walls with a stud wall so that pipes, wire, and insulation can be installed, furthering your costs and reducing useable floor space.</p>
<p>Basically, because lumber is so readily available in almost all of north america, it is a vastly cheaper and easier form of construction (that's another thing, a wooden shell of a house can be built in days, whereas concrete requires days for forming, then a day for pouring, a day or two for stripping, and depending on local code, up to weeks before any weight can be placed on the fresh concrete).</p></div>		</li>
