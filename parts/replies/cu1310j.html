<p>The acacia tree does not move nutrients to its roots, but releases lethal amounts of tannin to its leaves. (The discovery was kicked off when the researcher, Van Houten, was asked to investigate the death of 5000 Kudu antelope.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish Attenborough's <em>The <del>Secret</del> Private Life of Plants</em> was available online somewhere, because he talks about plant communication extensively. Clearly, the plants are not trading jokes ('a human, a cow, and a lawnmower walk into a bar...'), but they are communicating in extremely primitive, yet fascinating ways.</p>
<p>Thanks kind redditor for correcting the title, because now I can find it on the web!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say they are anything but primitive. A great deal of chemical signaling (and nutrient / water sharing) goes on between plants, facilitated by networks of symbiotic fungi that live on or in their roots. For the uninitiated, these associations are called mycorrhizae (my-ko-rise-ay) and are fundamental for the vast majority of terrestrial plant life. We're only just scratching the surface of understanding the interconnectedness of the natural world. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whether you're making a <em>The Happening</em> joke or not, this is &quot;communication&quot; in its most literal, generic sense (basically &quot;sharing information&quot;). But it's not &quot;communication&quot; in the day-to-day sense that we'd ever mean it--the information is far too specific in its purpose to really be worth calling &quot;communication&quot; in a social way, and doesn't really carry meaning or offer much opportunity for exchange of ideas.</p>
<p>That said, even for how simple and specialized this communication is, plant communication was considered crank science for some time (mainly because a lot of cranks and the popular media went wild and expressed a view of the sensitive, thinking plant that simply didn't hold water), and its acceptance has actually been dramatic enough to broaden our concept of what &quot;communication&quot; could mean.</p>
<p>As somebody who's always thought that it's fascinating that plants and humans share a microscopic ancestor, I'll admit to getting pulled into the romanticized sci-fi concept of plant communication and that propelling some of my interest here. That said it's pretty established science.</p>
<p>tl;dr It's communication, Jim, but not as we know it.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Not quite. In behavioural testing, monkeys exposed to a mixture containing that odour showed a faster reaction time in a behavioural test after fatigued, which was interpreted to represent a faster recovery from stressful conditions. And in a separate experiment, odour exposure was associated with slow metabolic increases in the anterior cingulate, the authors made no inference to stress in relation to the PET scan, just reported the area of increased activity. </p>
<p>If they wanted to speak to stress with better evidence, they would have looked for stuff related to cortisol, not just where the brain &quot;lights up&quot;. TBH it's a bit of a stretch to say the PET results are related to stress at all, there was no task associated with exposure, they didn't mention if the monkeys were the same as those who completed the behavioural task (if they did, I missed it), and they ignored testing for the gold standard molecule reflecting stressful experiences.</p></div>		</li>
