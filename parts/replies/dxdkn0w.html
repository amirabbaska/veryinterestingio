			<div class="markdown"><p>Being cramped up is still there, and if driving under similar conditions, that's still all there, too (I've driven at 8-10k+ many times, so...). And if you're driving, you're (hopefully) being constantly alert, fighting with things like wind and traffic, etc. Plus there's <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_hypnosis" target="_blank">highway hypnosis</a>. As much as you're just sitting there, you're spending quite a bit of energy the whole time. I have done 18 hours of driving once, and I was completely exhausted after that, just from so much energy expelled throughout the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a 26 hour hell drive from Pittsburgh to Houston and then immediately had to fly back to Pittsburgh to close our our apartment there.  I went nuts around Texarkana due to the very restrictive lanes in the construction zone (not to mention  having my teeth rattled out of my head due to Arkansas' terrible roads, plus the constant Ka band drones making my V1 go apeshit) and had to sleep for about 3 hours at a Pilot before continuing on to Houston.  I spent a whole month trying to recoup before I started looking for work. </p></div>		</li>

Wearing these on flights, my ears haven’t endured the stress of the pounding noise for hours on end. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I remember getting off the plane and commenting that they should interrogate terrorists with plane flights instead of water boarding. Fucking awful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree 100%.  I just flew to Israel to work from the US, coach, on a domestic US carrier.  I was in a ton of pain on arrival, my ankles were swollen and it felt like I had spontaneously gotten arthritis in my hands.  After all that we had to travel another 5 hours then attend a meeting once we arrived at the destination.  2 days of misery, I’m not ever doing it again unless they fly me business.</p></div>		</li>
