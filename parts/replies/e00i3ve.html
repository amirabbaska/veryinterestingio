			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn’t realize there was that 4-week limit. When they talk about it in the news, they do refer to “new unemployment claims”, which led me to believe unemployed meant receiving unemployment benefits, which does have a time limit. Though benefits usually run out in about 8-10 weeks, depending on a few factors. </p>
<p>Good insights here!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is not a four week limit. OP misunderstood the rule. If it's been twenty weeks since you lossed your job, and you're still looking for work, you're unemployed.  If you stopped looking for work on week 15, then you're not part of the labor force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, you're not counted as unemployed if you haven't <em>looked for work</em> in the last four weeks. As long as you're looking for work, you're counted as unemployed, even if you've been unemployed for longer than four weeks.</p>

<p>You might be under one of those nasty non-competitive clauses in certain tech sectors that prevent you from finding anything else for a few months or years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are rarely enforceable, and the situations in which they are typically involve taking specific trade secrets or client lists to a direct competitor. Even in cases where they may be <em>theoretically</em> enforceable, they are almost never <em>practically</em> enforceable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just &quot;haven't looked for work&quot;: If you haven't looked for work using the right channels (such as most job banks or temp agencies) in more than four weeks you drop off the 'list'.</p>
<p>So you could be going around town handing your resume over to local shops, or going through craigslist, but still no longer count.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How could those statistics possibly have any actual real data on people &quot;looking for work&quot; that makes no sense. I email 90% of my applications in and get ignored by 100% of them. They damn sure aren't reporting my application to the government for unemployment statistics. How are the numbers not completely arbitrary?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a survey sent to about 60,000 households per month. The survey asks about employment status and job search activity. The unemployment rate is calculated based on the result of the survey. </p>
<p>In addition, on the employer side, there is a parallel survey sent to a couple hundred thousand firms that asks about payrolls. </p></div>		</li>

<p>All it requires is the employer to sue you. They may even make money on the deal if you have anything to take.</p>
<p>Sure, in Cali they are illegal, but that's pretty much the only place. Hairdresser in Texas lost everything some time back due to a non-compete. </p>
<p>And SCOTUS has been allowing enforcement of even 'questionable' contract terms lately. If I can enforce an agreement to go to arbitration for a rape claim then I can probably do the same thing for a non-compete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>California bans noncompetes outright, under all circumstances. In other states, noncompetes are often explicitly restricted. In all states, noncompetes are implicitly restricted.</p>
<p>Noncompetes are not uncommon for stylists, and they are enforceable in some cases. Generally, the basis for a noncompete is the concern that a stylist will take the salon's clients with them to a direct competitor in the same geographic region.</p>
<p>In Texas, a noncompete for a stylist may be enforceable if they are limited in scope, in duration, and in geography, and if they are reasonably necessary to prevent disclosure of the employer's proprietary information (i.e. client lists) to a direct competitor. This is a fairly narrow situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is another officially-tracked metric that covers some of these cases -- called the &quot;U-6&quot; underemployment rate.  It considers &quot;underemployed&quot; as traditional unemployment or &quot;part-time for economic reasons&quot; or &quot; marginally attached to the labor force&quot;</p>
<p>That rate stands at 6.8% at present.</p></div>		</li>
