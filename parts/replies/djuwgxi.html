			<div class="markdown"><p>That's possible. But how about those restaurants that have huge plates full of sushi and sashimi? Those are pretty freaking expensive! And at a reasonable price, too!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Restaurants buy things in bulk, so although those items might seem expensive to you in your experience as a single individual those restaurants are getting it for tremendous bulk wholesale discounts. So even fairly &quot;expensive&quot; things are pretty well covered by an 8 or 10 dollar cover charge. And, like I said, 90% of people won't come anywhere close to eating up the profit margin, so it's not a huge deal if some people do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much this. I worked for a restaurant once. When ingredients are bought in bulk they cost much cheaper than when you buy them on a market, specially because some are bought directly from the producer (in my case), further eliminating a cost like the middle-man.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus the restaurant can use whatever is borderline expired. If they are overstocked on tuna then they can offload that on the all-you-can-eat rather than letting it wind up in the trash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those places also offer a lot of filler items as well.  I see many people go to a sushi buffet place and load up noodles or fried rice too...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention buffets save a lot of employee labor.  The &quot;servers&quot; are pretty much only there to take drink orders and then give refills and take away dishes, that's it.  After you tell them what you want to drink there's not really any interaction after that point.</p>
<p>And instead of the kitchen staff making (and plating) individual meals, they just watch the buffets and have stuff ready by the time the buffet runs out.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanna share a story: my father and uncle went to an all you can eat sushi place back in the early 2000s, stayed for about 7 hours and got very drunk, finally the owner came out and said &quot;No! No more! You go home now! We close, everyting close!&quot;
Apparently they'd gotten a bit rowdy as well but it stands to reason that they alone probably exceeded the profit margin that night, though the liquor bill may have made up for it.</p></div>		</li>
