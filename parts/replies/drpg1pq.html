			<div class="markdown"><p>Effectively, direct energy conversion from fusion aims to convert the kinetic energy of fusion products into an electrical voltage.  <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_energy_conversion" target="_blank">There are a few different theorized schemes to do this.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>The first working fusion power plants will be designed very carefully to direct energy away from sensitive components and put that energy to good use for boiling water to turn the electric turbines (if we don't perfect direct energy conversion first).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>using turbines is desirable in a grid (stabilizing the frequency). plus no one knows what direct energy conversion even means here. neutrons are emitted and heat the walls. it just seems like &quot;vapor turbines are old-fashioned&quot; but they aren't. </p></div>		</li>
