			<div class="markdown"><p>I am the exact same way. Used to love the trampoline, at some point it became that I can't jump on one without a headache happening rapidly. Any sort of shaking will wreck me, even just shaking my head to move my hair around. I can't go on wooden roller coasters anymore, because I will get a headache that will ruin the rest of the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I cant go on rollercoasters over and over. i can do a few, but after like 2-3 intense ones i need a break. Now that I think about it, it may have something to do with playing ice hockey when i was growing up and had a concussion a few times. Not anywhere around the same time but separate occasions.</p></div>		</li>
