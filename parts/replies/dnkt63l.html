<p>We know you don't need a hidden energy source for radioactive decay because it still happens in extremely cold environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe this is elementary, but is quantum decay affected by temperature at all? Throughout both extremes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rate of radioactive decay is not a function of temperature.</p>
<p>The rate of decay is </p>
<p>A = Î»N</p>
<p>Where A is the activity (rate of decay), lambda is the decay constant, and N is the number of nuclei.  Therefore the temperature of the environment should not be a factor in how fast the material decays.</p>
<p>It used to be thought that 209Bi was the heaviest stable nucleus until it was discovered to be radioactive in 2003. They measured the half life to be 2x10^19 years. As a reference, the universe is 'only' ~1.5x10^10 years old. In order to do so they had to reduce the temperature of their system to 0.02 Kelvin. Very close to absolute 0. The half life they measured at that temperature is valid at all temperatures.</p>
<p>The next obvious question is why did it have to be so cold. The sensitivity limit of an alpha detector (p/n doped Si with a ~40-100 V bias applied) is entirely dependent upon how many alphas per second your sample emits and how many background (typically electrical noise) events unrelated to your sample the detector registers per second. To measure something with such a long half life you need a detector with extremely low background. The electrical background noise drops with temperature, thus why they made such a great effort to reduce temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so long and short, no. And the instrument they used had to be very cold so collect accurate date since the rate of decay is so low. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That the chemical environment can not alter the properties of decay is not 100% true.  Electron capture can not occur if there are no electrons nearby.  It's a minor effect for sure, but interestingly enough chemistry can affect radioactive decay.</p></div>		</li>
