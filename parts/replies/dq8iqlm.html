Strongmen, powerlifters, weightlifters use it pretty liberally in competition and other athletes do too. It really shines when you are getting fatigued and need to get a second wind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldn’t want to. I’m a powerlifter and have used them in competition and just in training when going for a big attempt. For lifting, I love them. It took a while to get to feeling that way. The difference is I’m already relatively hyped and about to do something I really want. When I’m about to do a lift, I also get a good jolt of energy from a slap on my shoulders. Great for amped energy but do you really want to wake up by getting slapped in the face every morning? It’s like that, but worse.</p></div>		</li>
