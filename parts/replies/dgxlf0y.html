			<div class="markdown"><p>Literally form. </p>
<p>I totally forget the actual physics of it. But the nitrogen goes from being a part of the liquid solution to being its own separate gas.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, it is a totally different process physically, but it just like when water boils. The bubbles aren't small bubbles that become bigger. The bubbles are literally a liquid turning into a gas. They form at the bottom of the pot because that is where the heat is concentrated causing the state change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is completely wrong wtf. I'm a paramedic student and I just wrote a final which included a large portion on decompression sickness and altitude sickness and the differences between. </p>
<p>Your body dissolves gasses into the tissues and blood etc. The bends occur when the pressure outside the body drops so fast that the solution breaks down and the gasses &quot;bubble&quot; out. A ton of things can go wrong there. </p>
<p>The reason oxygen doesn't typically bubble out is because it's not necessarily dissolved but chemically bound to the hemoglobin in the blood. Whereas if you were to hold your breath on ascent you can damage the lung.  </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>To anyone wondering, this is because the volume of air in ones lungs will expand as the ambient pressure decreases. </p>
<p>When diving, the regulator regulates the pressure of the air being inhaled to match the water pressure outside (a regulator regulates. who'da thunk it?). When rising with full lungs, the ambient pressure will drop and the air will try to inflate the lungs like a balloon. If one ascends too quick, the lungs will stretch too much, and the delicate bits inside the lungs don't like that too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can hurt you.  I was taught in my diving class that if you took a full breath of compressed air at 4 feet depth, held your breath and came to the surface, you would damage your lungs.  It doesn't force your airway open, it just expands and damages lung tissues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just &quot;your lung&quot; that is the issue. It's the parts of the lung. All the capillaries could explode and hemorrhage too.</p>
<p>Imagine that air isn't invisible- let's make it pink. If you take a breath at 120' underwater and hold your breath, then ditch your weight and make for the surface, you might as well be hitting all that pink air with a &quot;expansion ray&quot; (is that opposite of a shrink ray?) </p>
<p>So, that breath and everything from that breath is going to expand very quickly and damage everything in the way.</p></div>		</li>
