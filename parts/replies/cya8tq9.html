<p>A jet engine is something like 140 dB. Decent noise cancelling headphones can cancel about 30 dB of ambient noise, ... you still have 110 dB getting through</p>

<p>Since dB are logarithmic, can you use them linearly like that? (honestly asking)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, you can add and subtract decibel values. (EDIT: <em>relative</em> decibel values, that is*) Subtracting dB corresponds to dividing the intensity (or power, or whatever) by a factor, and adding corresponds to multiplying. So reducing a signal by 30 dB means the signal strength gets smaller by a factor of 1000. By 20 dB corresponds to a factor of 100, and so on.</p>
<p>Actually, the whole reason decibels exist are so that we have numbers we can add and subtract when the actual underlying change is a multiplication or division.</p>
<hr />
<p>* As a couple of replies pointed out, you can add and subtract <em>relative</em> decibel values, which are describing an amount stronger or weaker (or more/less intense, louder/softer etc.), but you can't just add and subtract values which describe absolute measurements of power or intensity etc. This is kind of similar to temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit), where you can add or subtract changes but not actual temperature measurements. Same goes for position: you can add and subtract relative positions (which we call <em>displacement</em> in physics), but not positions defined with respect to a fixed origin (which is the closest thing to &quot;absolute&quot; a position can be).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This point needs a little clarification, although you're correct. For instance if you take a 10 decibel cell phone ring and add it to 140 decibel jet engine, you don't end up with 150 decibels</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way we perceive the relationship between frequency and amplitude is linear, the actual sound waves internal properties of frequency and amplitude are logarithmic. We perceive sound pitch linearly due to the very nicely shaped decreasing size of the cochlear. If you are interested in sound and how we perceive sound you should check this out.

Fletcher-Mundson curves. As a further aside humans have this ∆ bias towards the 500-1300Hz range as it's the frequencies most representative in the human voice. </p>
<p>In regards to dB cancelling headphones... Low frequency sounds require less energy to cancel, ironically they also propagate through mass easier. While higher frequencies  are reflected and absorbed by mass easier and require slightly more energy to superimpose. You'd also need to look at whether they are in-ear, supra-aural(on-ear) or circumaural(around the entire ear). Headphones therefore provide a passive noise cancellation through absorption and reflection, probably about 10-15dB. Active sound cancelling can potentially counter any frequency the transducer (speaker)can produce. So the size of your speaker limits the lower frequencies reproducible and you will never stop the sensation of vibration as you are hammered with transverse waves. But apart from that, with a big enough battery you can technically cancel any noise the speaker can perceivably produce, dB be damned.
Your headphones can produce between 100-120dB, if you had an I identical speaker to cancel as to listen with I don't see why 140dB would be out of reach. </p>
<p>To answer the question. Yes. A reduction of dB is just subtracted. A 10dB sound plus a 10dB sound does not make a 20dB sound. But a 10dB sound played 10dB louder does make a 20dB sound. I hope that helps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know the annoying phenomenon where it seems like the top 50-100% of an audio slider seems to do nothing? This happens because audio sliders are often implemented in a linear scale instead of a logarithmic one, while the human ear interprets audio more closely to a logarithmic scale. Therefore, any proper audio system generally uses an exponential slider.</p>
<p>The human ear is incredibly versatile. The decibel scale was meant to have 0dB as approximately the softest sound a human was able to perceive. Meanwhile, we can also hear sounds as loud as 110dB (and higher but then even short exposure can cause permanent damage). On a linear scale, this would correspond to 1 (0dB) up to 100 000 000 000 (110dB). So I'd ask you, does the softest sound you can hear seem one hundred billion times less loud than a loud rock concert?</p>
<p>Also, since addition and subtraction of audio power are pretty rare (generally it's either amplification (multiplication) or damping (division), it makes a lot of sense to work on a logarithmic scale. Both these operations are simple addition/subtraction on such a scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>85 db over an 8 hour period though. Even 110 hearing it briefly won't affect your hearing. 140 db however is the pain threshold and hearing that at all will probably do significant damage. </p></div>		</li>
