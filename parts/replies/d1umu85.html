			<div class="markdown"><p>Whilst the top comment is intuitively right, preserving the concept of 'innocence until proven guilty' is not the only reason, nor is it actually entirely correct. The whole concept of using bail to uphold the premise of 'innocence until proven guilty is actually quite contentious with legal scholars as I will explain later. The purpose of bail can be split into these three reasons, ordered in terms of importance:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Ensuring someone comes to court</strong></p>
<p>Historically speaking, the purpose of bail was to ensure that people rocked up to court which is why even some less serious crimes are granted bail. Come to bail or we'll take away your $10,000 bond, and we'll probably still catch you in the end anyways! Depending on country or state, different areas have different ways of allowing bail and judges have to weigh a series of factors including: The chances of the accused offending on bail, the seriousness of the crime accused, his prior history of crime etc. Bail conditions are only enacted if the judge thinks that these risks can be mitigated with a set of restrictions. If any set of conditions cannot reasonably mitigate these risks, then bail is refused.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Cost savings</strong></p>
<p>Locking someone up in jail costs the taxpayer approximately $150/day. If bail didn't exist, judging by the amount of cases of bail granted each year, either a countries prison expenditure would be yuuuuuge, or their legal systems wouldn't work at all.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Upholding the notion of innocence until proven guilty (?)</strong></p>
<p>This is an interesting concept. Whilst /u/HugePilchard is right to an extent that some people justify the use of bail to uphold this notion, wouldn't it be arguable that the refusal of bail essentially means that a pre-emptive decision of guilt is placed upon the accused? Taking into account the criteria used in deciding bail discussed in 1), it is highly contentious among legal scholars whether bail reinforces this tenet, or rather goes completely <strong>against it</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Well another thing to consider is that bail is proportional depending on the risk of safety to the community.  Bail for shooting someone in the face will be much higher than bail for stealing someone's iphone.  There are cases where bail has been denied because the person is deemed either too much of a risk to the community or too much of a risk of never returning.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Misconception is that people are not actually literally innocent until proven guilty. The only entity which needs to presume that they are innocent is the court - and only in order to give them a fair trial by not assuming guilt. The police don't have to pretend they are innocent and neither does the public.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assigning bail based on anything other than the charges (that is any contested details of a case) and flight risk is illegal. Technically even basing it on charges is unconstitutional as bail exists to make someone show up to court and almost everyone will show up to court for anything more serious than a ticket. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several problems with your answer.</p>
<p>First, showing up to court only makes sense if you are released in the first place. The OP question is aimed at why judges let potentially dangerous people go at all, particularly for sums of money.</p>
<p>Second, the incentive to show up only applies when it is a relatively large sum of money. Many are let got on their own recognizance, meaning they are allowed to go on a promise to return for trial. Other bail conditions are functional (give up passport) or nominal, such as relatively small fees. For lesser crimes, and when the accused has otherwise ordinary life commitments, such as a job, bills, and family, then the incentive to come back for a relatively small crime is that you will be arrested, on the run, or otherwise give up your ordinary life if you don't show up. The bigger the crime, and the lesser your costs of being on the run, the more bail amounts play into incentives to show up.</p>
<p>As far as innocence, it's important to remember that the principle is that you are <em>presumed</em> innocent <em>by the state</em> until proven guilty. Whether you are actually innocent or not doesn't change, but rather the rules of the justice system must presume that you are innocent. Whether or not the <em>intention</em> of bail is to facilitate that is hard to answer. Certainly if there was no such thing as bail or release awaiting trial, there would be a huge legal, ethical, and political push back on the violation of the principle of the presumption of innocence. A fair system <em>requires</em> that an accused not a suffer significant punishment <em>without cause</em> prior to being found guilty at trial.</p>
<p>The key here is <em>without cause</em>. If the court has a good reason to believe you will either do more harm or flee if released, then a short trial (bail hearing) on that topic is held to look at <em>that</em> risk, not necessarily guilt of the crime charged. It may violate the presumption of innocence in principle, but it is a compromise whereby it finds the accused &quot;guilty&quot; of being a public risk or flight risk while awaiting trial. It's a lesser of two evils middle ground, so doesn't strictly violate the principle. It is fair and reasonable. </p>
<p>So it <em>functions</em> as supporting the principle of presumption of innocence. Whether anybody ever designed it for that purpose is difficult to say because it isn't like one person designed the concept at a single point in time. It evolved and tweaked, and no doubt many had this principle in mind.</p>
<p>Cost savings is certainly a good one too, but I'm not aware of anyone designing or implementing on the basis of a cost reduction measure either. Again, it serves that <em>function</em> and can be used in policy reforms to help bring costs down, but the system wasn't designed by one person for one purpose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see it as something that goes against notion of justice. Why a judicial system should differentiate between people that can afford to pay a bail and people who can't? I mean, it goes against the very first principle of justice, that law is equal for all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's much more sensible. I'm not from the US, but it always seemed to me that it's awful to imagine some people losing months of their lives, most likely losing their job, developing any number of health or psychological issues, family problems etc. just because they cannot afford to pay bail or even the bond. Coupled with how infuriatingly long it can take for the trial to happen.</p>
<p>I imagine this can totally destroy an otherwise innocent person's life. I have no clue how often it does happen, but it shouldn't happen, at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory that wouldn't happen. The bail would be set at an amount that is both affordable for the accused yet still a strong enough insentive to insure they return to get the money. That being said, it probably doesn't always work that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It almost never works that way. The bail system in the US is part of way the justice system is skewed so negatively against the poor. I'll use the actually example of my brother here. He lit off some illegal fireworks that almost started a brush fire (this was last year in California, so the issue was a hot one), fire department and sheriff came out. No harm was reported, but he was held by the fire marshal on location for two hours, before being arrested on felony charges. He was booked and taken to the county lockup. Bail was set at $20k (of which a person would need to pay $2k to a bondsman in order to get released, that $2k that goes to a private bondsman is not returned. The bond paid to the court is returned, but you don't get anything back unless you yourself paid the full cash bond). </p>
<p>So $2k was needed to get released, and this was money that would not be returned. My brother, in his early 20s, did not have the cash, and neither did my parents. Without paying his bond that day, he would have spent 2 months in the lockup awaiting trial, and he had only until midnight to pay it. Luckily for him, my grandmother came through, and got him out. The felony charges were later reduced to misdemeanor, and he paid a fine of $500 for the event. </p>
<p>My brother would have spent 2 months in jail awaiting charges for a crime that DA was happy to plead down to a misdemeanor. Without being able to pay bail, a person is often punished not for their crime, but for their inability to pay. Personal finances are rarely if ever taken into account in these instances. The bail system in the US is utterly broken, and is at the core of a two-tier justice system that rewards wealth over guilt or innocence.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All I know is I've read some stories about low charges, misdemeanors, with bail set to a few thousand dollars that many people can't really afford. Maybe they have that much money available if they gather it all up, but that would mean staying without that money waiting for trial, but there are bills to pay and other costs to consider.</p>
<p>And when the sentence for the accusation is just 1-2 months, while waiting for a trial in jail might take more than that, I've read that people in such a situation often just plead guilty and stay their sentences, even if they might be innocent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My best friend spent 3yrs in a jail in Louisiana due to not being able to pay bail and court dates continuously being pushed back. He got out and was innocent but that doesn't really matter when you go looking for jobs and have a 3yr gap in your work history due to sitting in jail. he had just had his daughter before going in so didn't get to really know her until she was 3. His fiance left him for another man. It fucked up his life in a huge way and he wasn't even guilty of anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is why plea bargains are so nasty. A lot of people end up taking them, even if they're innocent, just so they can move on with their lives. As a result you have a lower class with an unusually high rate of criminal history and police departments with artificially high closed case rates, and in the meantime a lot of guilty people get away with shit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm too lazy to actually look for the article, but in some cases the prosecutor uses that as a bargaining chip. &quot;Hey, you've already spent a year in jail and this is only going to drag out longer, but if you plead guilty you'll get 3 years. With time served and good behavior you can be out in another year. OR.... We can go to trial maybe 6 months from now and you're risking at least 10 more years if found guilty.&quot;</p>
<p>edit: I found a follow up <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/09/nyregion/kalief-browder-held-at-rikers-island-for-3-years-without-trial-commits-suicide.html" target="_blank">article</a> about the case I was talking about. This article links to the original article.<br />
