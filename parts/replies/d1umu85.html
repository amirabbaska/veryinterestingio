			<p>And an important point is that if someone is judged as a violent threat or a flight risk, they may be remanded without bail, which means they sit in jail until the trial.  Although if they are convicted of the crime, they usually get credit for the days (or months, or years) they sat in jail awaiting trial.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Whilst the top comment is intuitively right, preserving the concept of 'innocence until proven guilty' is not the only reason, nor is it actually entirely correct. The whole concept of using bail to uphold the premise of 'innocence until proven guilty is actually quite contentious with legal scholars as I will explain later. The purpose of bail can be split into these three reasons, ordered in terms of importance:<br><br>1) <strong>Ensuring someone comes to court</strong><br><br>Historically speaking, the purpose of bail was to ensure that people rocked up to court which is why even some less serious crimes are granted bail. Come to bail or we'll take away your $10,000 bond, and we'll probably still catch you in the end anyways! Depending on country or state, different areas have different ways of allowing bail and judges have to weigh a series of factors including: The chances of the accused offending on bail, the seriousness of the crime accused, his prior history of crime etc. Bail conditions are only enacted if the judge thinks that these risks can be mitigated with a set of restrictions. If any set of conditions cannot reasonably mitigate these risks, then bail is refused.<br><br>2) <strong>Cost savings</strong><br><br>Locking someone up in jail costs the taxpayer approximately $150/day. If bail didn't exist, judging by the amount of cases of bail granted each year, either a countries prison expenditure would be yuuuuuge, or their legal systems wouldn't work at all.<br><br>3) <strong>Upholding the notion of innocence until proven guilty (?)</strong><br><br>This is an interesting concept. Whilst /u/HugePilchard is right to an extent that some people justify the use of bail to uphold this notion, wouldn't it be arguable that the refusal of bail essentially means that a pre-emptive decision of guilt is placed upon the accused? Taking into account the criteria used in deciding bail discussed in 1), it is highly contentious among legal scholars whether bail reinforces this tenet, or rather goes completely <strong>against it</strong><br><br>Source: Law student currently studying bail</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; If a cop sees someone shoot another person in the face point-blank, it seems silly to let that person wander the streets just because we have to wait until next week to have the trial.<br><br>Well another thing to consider is that bail is proportional depending on the risk of safety to the community.  Bail for shooting someone in the face will be much higher than bail for stealing someone's iphone.  There are cases where bail has been denied because the person is deemed either too much of a risk to the community or too much of a risk of never returning.  </p>		</li>

			<p>That may depend on jurisdiction, because its very much not the case here in Canada. Risk to the public goes to what conditions we put you on and whether you get out at all, but higher cash bail isn't seen as helping on the public safety ground, but rather on the &quot;will he show up&quot; ground.</p>		</li>

			<p>Misconception is that people are not actually literally innocent until proven guilty. The only entity which needs to presume that they are innocent is the court - and only in order to give them a fair trial by not assuming guilt. The police don't have to pretend they are innocent and neither does the public.</p>		</li>

			<p>Precisely. In the Jordan Johnson trial, Kirsten Pabst filed a motion arguing that the Missoula PD policy of believing rape victims violated his presumption of innocence. The prosecution countered with a brief arguing that presumption of innocence was a penumbra of the sixth amendment, and hence only applied at trial. Also that the police treat all other crimes that way, and the policy was only necessary because of prejudices against rape victims. The judge ruled in favor of the prosecution. As far as I can tell, a bail hearing is not a trial, and hence presumption of innocence is not applicable there either. But IANAL.</p>		</li>

			<p>Bail isn't about protecting the public. That's a big misconception. It's about making you show up to court. One of the biggest cases about bail in the US was about a guy who showed up during his entire first murder case where he was released on his own recognizance during the case. Then he got off on a technicality. When he was arrested again for a different murder, the judge tried to deny him ball, but as bail is only about compelling someone to show up to court not about protecting the public, the appellate cost overruled the judge because of his history of always showing up to court. He was later convicted of murder. </p>		</li>

			<p>Perhaps this is why there is such a problem with police brutality since they can and most probably do assume that every person they interact with is guilty of some crime without any evidence and are guilty of evading arrest by not turning in themselves.<br>The fact that you can be arrested only for resisting arrest blows my mind, since to be guilty of that you have to be arrested and resist, and you cannot resist until you are arrested, and if you weren't being arrested you couldn't resist, so they are arresting you for the expectation that you will resist when they arrest you. It's an arrest for future crime and its ridiculous.</p>		</li>

			<p>Assigning bail based on anything other than the charges (that is any contested details of a case) and flight risk is illegal. Technically even basing it on charges is unconstitutional as bail exists to make someone show up to court and almost everyone will show up to court for anything more serious than a ticket. </p>		</li>

			<p>There are several problems with your answer.<br><br>First, showing up to court only makes sense if you are released in the first place. The OP question is aimed at why judges let potentially dangerous people go at all, particularly for sums of money.<br><br>Second, the incentive to show up only applies when it is a relatively large sum of money. Many are let got on their own recognizance, meaning they are allowed to go on a promise to return for trial. Other bail conditions are functional (give up passport) or nominal, such as relatively small fees. For lesser crimes, and when the accused has otherwise ordinary life commitments, such as a job, bills, and family, then the incentive to come back for a relatively small crime is that you will be arrested, on the run, or otherwise give up your ordinary life if you don't show up. The bigger the crime, and the lesser your costs of being on the run, the more bail amounts play into incentives to show up.<br><br>As far as innocence, it's important to remember that the principle is that you are <em>presumed</em> innocent <em>by the state</em> until proven guilty. Whether you are actually innocent or not doesn't change, but rather the rules of the justice system must presume that you are innocent. Whether or not the <em>intention</em> of bail is to facilitate that is hard to answer. Certainly if there was no such thing as bail or release awaiting trial, there would be a huge legal, ethical, and political push back on the violation of the principle of the presumption of innocence. A fair system <em>requires</em> that an accused not a suffer significant punishment <em>without cause</em> prior to being found guilty at trial.<br><br>The key here is <em>without cause</em>. If the court has a good reason to believe you will either do more harm or flee if released, then a short trial (bail hearing) on that topic is held to look at <em>that</em> risk, not necessarily guilt of the crime charged. It may violate the presumption of innocence in principle, but it is a compromise whereby it finds the accused &quot;guilty&quot; of being a public risk or flight risk while awaiting trial. It's a lesser of two evils middle ground, so doesn't strictly violate the principle. It is fair and reasonable. <br><br>So it <em>functions</em> as supporting the principle of presumption of innocence. Whether anybody ever designed it for that purpose is difficult to say because it isn't like one person designed the concept at a single point in time. It evolved and tweaked, and no doubt many had this principle in mind.<br><br>Cost savings is certainly a good one too, but I'm not aware of anyone designing or implementing on the basis of a cost reduction measure either. Again, it serves that <em>function</em> and can be used in policy reforms to help bring costs down, but the system wasn't designed by one person for one purpose. </p>		</li>

			<p>I see it as something that goes against notion of justice. Why a judicial system should differentiate between people that can afford to pay a bail and people who can't? I mean, it goes against the very first principle of justice, that law is equal for all.</p>		</li>

That's not fair.<br><br>Hell, the whole existence of the bail bondsmen industry is proof that the system isn't fair.

			<p>Yeah. There was a guy here (Ireland) who was involved in the banking crisis and was hiding in the states and after being caught and deciding he didn't like the US's prison system stopped fighting his extradition. He argued that the case was so complex that he couldn't plan it properly from a prison cell so the judge let him out on bail but had to give up his passport and sign in at the local police station <em>twice</em> a day. </p>		</li>
