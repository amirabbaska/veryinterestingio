<p>This is utterly incorrect.  They started playing 1 game a season in England and I think this upcoming season is 4 expanded from 2.  There are even discussions on England getting a team but the logistics make it nearly impossible right now.</p>
<p>They are having a game in Mexico this year and American Football is huge there.  Like, seriously.  More so than even England.  I wouldn't be surprised if Mexico got a team in the fairly near future (10'ish years) because it's close enough to the US to support a team.  The only issue would be crossing into Mexico and coming back after a game could cause a headache for border security.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is probably true, though.</p></div>		</li>
