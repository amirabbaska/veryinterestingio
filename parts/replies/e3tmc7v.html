			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I always explain it like that. Alcohol basically reduces your risk awareness. It can be physical risk, social risk, monetary risk, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that's a decent way of explaining it, the root cause is the impaired decision making.</p>
<p>Someone under the influence is aware of the risk, but they'll misjudge the magnitude. They'll overestimate their own abilities, underestimate the chances of failure, and place less value on the consequence of failure. </p>
<p>Basically, they perceive less risk because they mis-estimate the factors, rather than simply being unaware or disregarding them. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Why not underestimate their abilities? Overestimate the chances of failure, or place more value on the consequences of failure? We don't really see those impairments with alcohol. It's not simple confusion and impaired decision making. It's specifically reduced value placed on risks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but isnâ€™t risk awareness what would cause you to become violent? As in, if you are more aware of a physical risk, you would be more likely to react physically to a risk or a threat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Violence is typically about forcing things to be your way. If people have those impulses normally they won't act on them because they're aware that doing so comes with the risk of alienation or punishment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what about people who seem to always be in control, no matter how drunk they get? Myself for example, I ALWAYS know what I'm doing at the time, and remember it the next day (yes, even with heavy drinking). Is it simply that violent people are affected more than passive people?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for clarity, tendencies and trends aren't rules. While animals tend towards violence as a whole, there's certainly individual variation and outliers. Some are going to be more aggressive than others, even if they share the same parents and upbringing. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Alcohol decreases control/judgement/reason, it doesn't eliminate it entirely.</p>
<p>Someone who always seems to be in control is simply not drinking enough to lose control. They're not immune to the effect, they're avoiding it. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, that's good, and responsible. Everyone can drink too much and reach the point where they lose control or black out. The fact that you have enough self control to avoid that is admirable, but it doesn't mean you're immune.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it simply that violent people are affected more than passive people?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Violent people are equally affected, but they are much closer to the edge to begin with, which means it simply takes less to push them over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People who control their impulses more in sobriety control their impulses more when drunk. It's really a matter of personal psychological differences.</p>
<p>Why people differ in this regard is a huge subject, including such things as upbringing, life experiences, and genetics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the implication is that some people have an abnormal reaction to drinking, and one of the most common of these reactions is violence.</p></div>		</li>
