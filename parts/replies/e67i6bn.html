			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess i could have been more clear in my comment. I KNOW that microorganisms breakdown organic compounds and this will include the pigments that are the source of the colour in the leaves. BUT I didn't know if there was some kind of chemical degradation as well that had an effect. The reason i chose the word &quot;assume&quot; was because I only new the biological pathway of decomposition, and not how large the effect of the abiotic degradation had on the structure of the leaf and the pigments.</p>

<p>I didn't want to pretend my answer was the complete picture, but i do see &quot;assume&quot; wasn't the right choice of words.</p></div>		</li>
