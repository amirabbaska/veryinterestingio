			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually it is exhaust gasses from burning or vaporising the oils that were on the surface of the metal. But you will also be breathing in some metal ions that have been released from the surface, and these will react with your skin inside your nose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd guess it wouldn't smell at all. But you can test it by taking a piece of iron, washing it (maybe with alcohol), letting it sry and then only touch it with gloves on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A thing cannot smell, by definition, if it does not give off molecules that are then carried by air to our noses. Metal probably doesn't do that much at least unless you intentionally abrade the surface somehow and inhale the dust. Which I guess happens a lot in machine shops, actually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you smell close enough, wouldn't you technically be able to inhale the vapor layer of a chunk of iron? (even though its vapor pressure at STP is probably on the order of 10^(-100) Pa) </p></div>		</li>

<p>Metal in the water vapor reacting with the skin in your nose</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oil on the sponge or being cleaned off</p>

<li>Perhaps soap can react with metal in a similar way?</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stainless is never really 100% oxydation resistant. What causes it to remain clean is the chrome added to the alloy, which reacts with oxygen to form a super thin layer of chrome oxyde on the surface. So every time you scratch or rubs stainless, you remove part of that layer and the reaction occurs again as new chrome is exposed.</p></div>		</li>
