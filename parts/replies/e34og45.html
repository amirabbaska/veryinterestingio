			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, they each have their advantages and disadvantages. Strictly speaking the bird can extract more oxygen at lower tensions than a mammalian lung. The avian lung also has more homogenous ventilation. Bird pulmonary capillaries are also thinner and allow for better gas exchange. Bird faveoli are smaller than mammal alveoli, also improving gas exchange.
At normal to high oxygen tensions, mammals do ok, because diffusion isn't as important as surface area.
Mammalian lungs are less susceptible to pulmonary hypertension.</p>
<p>Bird lungs are rigid, while mammalian lungs are deformable.</p>
<p>Pretend you have some primitive reptile that has to improve oxygen extraction. One option is to increase surface area of an outpouching, another is to thin the capillary walls to improve exchange. If it is too thin, blood leaks out into the lung, and you die. So now you have a bioengineering dilemma. Mammals chose stronger capillaries and deformable lungs, birds chose rigid non-expanding lungs and more delicate capillaries. The high levels of oxygen in the Carboniferous and Permian probably favored the mammalian approach. Once hemoglobin is saturated, there is no way to increase extraction, so a thinner capillary offers no benefit. Mammals chose to crank up the surface area. Birds (dinosaurs) probably evolved during the low oxygen Triassic, where there was an advantage of thinner capillaries. Rigid lungs with air sacs allowed for  thinner capillaries.</p>
<p>So if there is enough oxygen, both do well. In low oxygen settings, the bird does better. However, mammals can alter pulmonary artery resistance to blood flow depending on oxygenation differences. The bird lung is more homogenous, and cannot regulate flow (they lost the type one collagen cables that aid in blood flow regulation). So when a broiler chicken suddenly gains weight, it develops pulmonary hypertension, leading to death. This syndrome costs the chicken industry over a billion dollars a year.</p>
<p>Keep in mind these are generalizations. The gas exchange of bat lungs is as impressive as birds, even though it achieves this using the same mechanisms as other mammals. Tibetan plateau humans (mammals last time I checked) addressed the problem by evolving hemoglobin that extracts more efficiently. Creatures develop adaptations to increase their fitness in an environment.</p></div>		</li>
