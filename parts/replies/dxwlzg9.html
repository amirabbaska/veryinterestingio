			<div class="markdown"><p>So I have a question that maybe you know more about, recently the use of plastic fibers like nylon or polyester in clothing has come under fire, and the argument is that they get washed, the laundry water drains out to the ocean, and now we have all these bits of polyester fiber adding into the giant oceanic garbage patch. This is such an alarm that a lot of eco-friendly clothing companies, especially outdoor gear makers, are switching over to natural, biodegradable fibers.</p>
<p>How big of a contribution is clothing fiber waste making, really? From a layman's perspective I just can't see it adding up to much - waste water is going into treatment anyway, and we are just talking about the bits of lint, half of which gets caught up in my laundry/dryer filter anyway. It's not like people are just dumping closets full of Patagonia jackets straight into the ocean.</p>
<p>Is the &quot;natural fibers&quot; push just wasting a ton of effort (in both energy cost to produce, and also opportunity cost for other things we can R&amp;D?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few studies you can look up on google scholar. E.g. </p>
<p><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es201811s" target="_blank">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es201811s</a> who, if I can trust the secondary source for it conclude that up to 85 % of human made debris on shorelines close to rivers might consist of microfibers.</p>
<p>also</p>
<p>&quot;Across all treatments, the recovered microfiber mass per [polyester] garment ranged from approximately 0 to 2 g, or exceeding 0.3% of the unwashed garment mass.&quot;
<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.6b03045" target="_blank">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.6b03045</a></p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&quot;Analyzing released fibers collected with a 200 μm filter during 10 mild, successive washing cycles showed that emission initially decreased and then stabilized at approx. 0.0012 wt%. Release of fibers during tumble drying was approx. 3.5 times higher than during washing.&quot;</p>
<p>I can not access the full articles at the moment, so I don't know if they write anything about how dangerous that amount is for organisms (if you want to do that yourself and have no way of bypassing the paywall, use sci-hub.tw). It seems accepted that synthetic fibers are hard to break down, especially when ingested and our waste water treatment facilities are not equipped to sufficiently remove it. It is worth noting that toxicity can not easily be estimated from the amount of pollutant. Very small amounts might already be dangerous... or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very interesting way of framing it. I almost feel that because it's so small, it should therefore be a lot easier to clean up, or at least figure out how to stop releasing trash into the oceans.</p>
<p>Here's my take on the end game: the plastic waste will continue to break down into smaller and smaller pieces. Most trash enter the oceans through rivers, but it's not until they interact with sandy beaches do they start to break down. Waves tend to bury trash in the sand, and the sand particles themselves will grind it down into the microplastic. When you see a water bottle floating out at sea, it was likely thrown off a ship - most plastic in the ocean are microplastic in size.</p>
<p>The big danger of microplastic is that it's roughly the same size and shape as plankton, and it's usually buoyant enough to float near the surface just like plankton. Unlike plankton, it's also great at absorbing oils and heavy metals, so you can imagine it as a &quot;toxic,&quot; inedible version of plankton. While sunlight will help break it down even further, I don't believe it will ever &quot;atomize.&quot;</p>
<p>If we can somehow control the garbage entering the ocean, the amount of microplastic will decrease over time due to animals eating all of this waste. They will die, but hopefully their bodies will sink to the ocean floor and be removed from the surface environment. The end result is that one day, far in the future, we'll get a geological strata filled with fossils and plastic material. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I totally agree with your assessment — the problem here is the microplastic. It’s essentially impossible to remove (unlike macroplastic), it accumulates in the stomach of fish who think it’s food (and later die because there’s no space in their stomachs), it can absorb toxins which are then consumed by the aforementioned fish (which you mentioned), and it increases the turbidity of the water, which reduces the photosynthetic yield of the phytoplankton and aquatic plants that live in it (and that’s really bad because it could have a bottom-up effect on the entire ecosystem). As of right now, as the original comment says, it’s mostly macroplastic, but if it all broke down, it could be a more serious issue. Therefore, our efforts should be focused on the present (and they are — projects are going on right now to clean it up, which is great to see). </p>
<p>I think the original comment is very well-researched, and I enjoy how it is structured to avoid sensationalism (because people often cite that as a reason for being desensitized to these types of environmental issues) but microplastic is probably the biggest threat posed by the patch, and I feel like that comment doesn’t address this issue all that in-depth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Microplastic just means that it's under around 5mm in length. You just pass the seawater through a fine mesh and you'll get almost all of the plastic (especially any large enough to block a fish's stomach).</p>
<p>To say &quot;it's impossible to remove microplastic!&quot; <strong>IS</strong> the problem: you've decided the situation is hopeless already. The brain is heuristic enough that if nothing can be done, then you won't do anything--why waste the effort? The above posters points are important because they re-frame the problem: it's not dire, it's not impossible, we can do it-- it's just expensive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why would it accumulate? The fish will excrete it. It's only large stuff that might get stuck, and only in certain types of animals that swallow things whole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point. The plastic patches are always described as state sized masses of plastic which makes people feel like that can never be cleaned up. But what /u/MattsAwesomeStuff described sounds quite managble to clean up. It won't be fast as that plastic is spread out over a ridiculously large area but it doesn't have to be cleaned up right away or it's not worth it. It just needs to be tackled so it's size stops growing and starts shrinking. </p>
<p>What's great is a non-profit is getting ready to launch a passive cleaning device to start tackling the largest patch off the West US coast. If that device proves successful they want to launch hundreds more to work on that patch and others.</p></div>		</li>
