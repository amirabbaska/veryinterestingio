			<div class="markdown"><p>Had a minor TIFU related to this. I had posted up at back of the line at the sub shop, and a small group of maybe 20 somethings is in front of me. I think nothing of them and go to my ADHD happy place.</p>
<p>I begin to snap out of it when I realize they had each turned around to look at me within a few seconds of each other, which I'd seen in my periphery. The dude standing right in front of me turns around again with a major stink eye as I look up to meet his gaze. Still pretty oblivious to what's going on, I give a half hearted smile. He turns back around and mutters to his friends, &quot;I mean, whatever floats your boat,&quot; and they all giggle. He thought I'd been unabashedly eye fucking him though his pants for however long we'd been in line, I guess. I was pretty embarrassed at first, but then I got kinda pissed. </p>
<p>I was actually thinking about how much I'd like to build my own tube amp. They're so expensive to buy, but I was thinking building one might be fun. I had some good ideas when <em>poof</em> I'm the creepy gay guy at the sub shop. Lol get over yourself, dudebrah.</p></div>		</li>
