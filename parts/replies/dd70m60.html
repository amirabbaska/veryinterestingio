			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer seems much more plausible than most others I've received; I already knew about the Romance Languages as others have been saying, but Spain and Portugal are only two of those, so things still weren't really adding up for me.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why? It makes sense to call it Latin America if three romance languages but not two? What would the call it otherwise? Spanish-Portuguese America?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iberian is the term usually used when referring to both Portugal and Spain. Thus &quot;Iberian America&quot; would make more sense than &quot;Latin american&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean in Central and South America they do. Latin America is explicitly defined as the countries or regions in the Americas that primarily speak Spanish or Portuguese. There are South American countries that have English as their official language, they are not considered Latin-American by definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. If memory serves, it was Napoleon III, grandson (or something like that) of Napoleon Bonaparte, in the 1860s-70s who came up with this idea of &quot;Latin America&quot;. Prior to that, there was only a vague idea of &quot;Our America&quot;, and even then it probably encompassed only Spanish-speaking countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This &quot;king&quot; was actually Emperor Napol√©on III (the nephew of the famous one), and this happened in the 1860s. The influence that he sought to undermine wasn't that of Spain and Portugal, but that of the US. Which makes more sense, because those countries were much poorer and less powerful than France at the time, more so than nowadays, and because how would calling it &quot;Latin&quot; help sever the link with Spain and Portugal ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the clarification on who it was, sometimes my memory isn't exactly precise. I probably could have phrased that better. Instead of saying the attempt was to weaken others' control of the area, it was an attempt to help establish a stronger claim for France. As for the Spain/Portugal v US argument, I don't know. </p></div>		</li>
