			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is it's typically the very old, the very young, and the immunocompromised who die from a secondary infection like pneumonia.  When a young, otherwise healthy person dies from the flu, I believe (not an expert) the prevailing thought is that it's an overly robust immune response, &quot;cytokine storm&quot;, that causes ARDS, or acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is similar to how the lungs flood with fluid due to inflammation in sepsis, and that it's typically an early death, like within a few days of symptom onset.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is exactly why a lot of illnesses are deemed not as dangerous as others.</p>
<p>My grandad had Alzheimer's which eventually lead to his death, but on his death certificate it will say Pneumonia. Had he not had Alzheimer's he would not have developed Pneumonia, so officially Alzheimer's is not &quot;dangerous&quot; as not many people die as a direct result of it. Which leads to underfunding and a lack of awareness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I think Alzheimer's is considered 100% fatal, albeit the proximate cause of death is an opportunistic infection like you described. I don't think anybody considers Alzheimer's as anything but a horrible death sentence.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, but only by the literal-minded people who also consider life to be 100% fatal.</p>
<p>A better way to phrase it is that Alzheimer's is incurable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alzheimer's is obviously well known but few people understand the devastation it causes until they experience it. It's a disease that requires a whole family to manage.</p>
<p>The funding for research into prevention/cures is massively underfunded, at least in the UK. There is just so much about the mind that we don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I usually get my flu shot, but never got around to it last year.
I haven't had the flu in probably over 5 years.</p>
<p>I got the flu really bad on new years.</p>
<p>Weakened my immune system enough to get a rash ( viral ).
It will probably take months to be fully gone (still spreading, atm). <strong>I'm only 36.</strong>
If you get the flu, you can give it to someone else and it might kill them or someone they know.</p>
<p>GET YOUR FLU SHOT.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>37 y/o here with the flu. </p>
<p>possibly the 2nd time this season, but the first time was short. had the extreme fever chills, etc. but it only stuck around 2 days so i assumed it was just a bad cold. when it started again 5 days ago i figured it was the same thing so i didn’t seek help or worry. i haven’t been this sick in years. i went to urgent care last night and the doctor thought i was luckily over the “hump” so treatment wasn’t really necessary, and my lungs are good to go, but still. there were so many others there with the flu it was actually kinda scary. several older people, and one guy i overheard had a 103 temperature. i also have my first ever ear infection and wow, they DO suck. </p>
<p>i will be getting a damn flu shot next year. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's less effective than normal at completely preventing the flu, but your symptoms should you catch it will be less severe.</p>
<p>Also, it's worth getting even if it were only 10% effective.  Every single person immune to a virus is one less person to pass it on to those who aren't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't work as well against this year's more common flu, but that shouldn't be taken to mean that it provides no benefit against it and other strains. This year's predominate strain is also simply harder to make effective vaccines for, so people shouldn't get the idea that someone &quot;guessed&quot; incorrectly. </p></div>		</li>
