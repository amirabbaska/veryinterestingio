			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll go along with your characterization of ants as ancient computers, but many birds are problem solvers with solutions that run several steps deep, as is well documented with crows and ravens and such.  Is every stitch of the weaverbird preprogrammed? Probably not, because there is too much variation in the building materials. Could it be that nest building is an example of animals learning through culture? Can a bird understand nest construction by imprinting on its original environment?</p>
<p>My guess is that nests are built on a combination of instinct, imprinting, culture, and learning. Bird brains have evolved to be really good at a few general skills (like gathering, selecting for physical properties, and interlacing).  Imprinting provides the basic blueprint for what defines a nest (sticks must be a certain length and gauge, interlaced together, bowl-shaped, etc.). Culture provides the pressure to perfect it (my nest must be better than my peers' in order to attract a hot chick). Finally, good ol' fashioned trial and error fine tunes each bird's maker process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to mention crows (and jackdaws, obviously), since they're impressive as hell with how they solve fairly complex problems, but figured it was a bit much for this question.  And yes, their behaviour is almost certainly a mix of of things you've mentioned, but they still don't have anywhere near the level of cognitive function as humans and other primates, and a lot more instinctive behaviour.  Then again, some humans I know are probably not as good at solving problems as your average crow..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crows are just as smart as primates as far as i know. They can solve puzzles children cannont solve. I think you are vastly underestimating them by claiming birds are basically pre programmed robots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well not quite my friend, even the dumbest humans (as long as they are not mentally impaired/retarded) is the most advanced mind in the history of this planet. In short we are the pinnacle of evolution on this planet, and crows are not even close to being as smart as primates. The latest I heard is that Crows are as smart as the smartest of dogs; somewhere around a 2-3 year old toddler. </p></div>		</li>

<p>To put it into a computing analogy - the birds and ants are very old, very slow computers with very limited RAM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or they're relatively new computers (even if they're not) that are made to do a specific thing, like a computer that regulates a parking lot meter or something, you can't compare it to a human ''computer'', whereas we could still learn how to operate parking lots, we're just not made for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a better way of describing it. An ant capable of thinking shit through is useless in comparison to a normal ant - it uses too much energy, space, and time when it could just react instantly based on instinct.</p>
<p>The rest of life is like a computer-evolved neural network that is built to accomplish one task: survive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Birds, especially Crows and Ravens are way more than just &quot;instinct-controlled&quot;. </p>
<p>They sometimes do things for no reason at all. For example, they like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjgpenWavO8#t=19s" target="_blank">playing</a> in snow. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dWw9GLcOeA" target="_blank">Here</a>'s another example. </p>
<p>Some can argue, that he's cleaning himself in the first case, but the second case does make close to no sense. Just like rolling the dice makes close to no sense for humans, yet we do it, because it's a fun, yet useless,  activity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>parrots, corvids, bower birds, etc. are within the range of human intelligence. that is, if you had a kid as smart as a crow, you might be saddened but he might learn how to care for himself somewhat, able to eat with utensils for example. if he was as smart as a parrot, he could communicate somewhat.</p>
<p>birds are much more intelligent than almost all non-human mammals.</p></div>		</li>
