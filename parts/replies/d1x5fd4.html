			<p>Pregnant women do &quot;nest&quot;. Its just that our higher functions overrides those instincts for the most part.<br>My wife would go crazy days before giving birth cleaning and rearranging the house. She said it felt instinctual. <br><br>So ya, we do have those same insticts</p>		</li>

			<p>Oh god, that's so creepy.  My wife is currently 2/3rds of the way through a pregnancy, is is <em>right this second</em> rearranging her office in a mad frenzy.<br><br>But yeah, we have lots of instincts, we just learn to override them (most of the time) once we get to a certain age.  One that I deal with a lot is the 'fight or flight' instinct.  Very specific situations set it off in me, and it takes all my effort not to punch somebody and run away from what is essentially a very non-scary thing.</p>		</li>

			<p>If we lived in the woods, I could definitely see her making some sort of neat organized ring made of twigs, leaves ans fur- while I was out hunting or something. </p>		</li>

			<p>I think a smartphone analogy would fit very well here:<br><br>A bird is like a smartphone with a fixed set of instructions in it's ROM (Meaning the OS and some pre-installed apps) and a very small space for the RAM where he can install new apps.<br><br>A human is like a smartphone where there is of course a similar (and probably extended) ROM, but much much more space for the RAM so the human can install a butt-load of new apps.<br><br>This also fits for how detailed and how far back the memory goes. Imagine having a smartphone with 10MB of space for photos. That means the photos will have a very bad resolution or there won't be many. That's the bird. Meanwhile the &quot;human smartphone&quot; has 512GB of space for photos.</p>		</li>

			<p><br>&gt;Now, a better question is why don't we humans have the same 'programs' in our brains?  <br><br><br>Humans are genetically predisposed to certain kinds of grammars that heavily constrain the range of possible languages we can use. We know, for example, that human language must be structure dependant, and not linear dependant. Recursion is encoded genetically.<br><br></p>		</li>
