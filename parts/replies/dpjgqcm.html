			<div class="markdown"><p>Since one of the other comments mentions how as programmers become more experienced, the brains treats the two (natural language and programming) more the same, I think it would be interesting to see a comparison between people programming, and people trying to learn a second language.</p>
<p>Maybe the difference they're seeing in less experienced programmers is just the increased cognitive load from trying to think in a language they aren't super familiar with.</p></div>		</li>
