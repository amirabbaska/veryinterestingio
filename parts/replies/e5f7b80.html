			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the non internationals is wierd from a non American perspective. </p>
<p>Just as an anecdote for American readers.  In the Super Rugby competition a couple of years ago the Brumbies (Australia) played the Crusaders (New Zealand) on ANZAC day  which is a day that commemorates the first time our 2 countries went into battle together (think Veterans Day for the US I guess). </p>
<p>The Brumbies applied to play the anthems at the start of play and the governing body said 'Ah, it's just a club game get over yourselves' and disallowed it. </p>
<p>So it's mostly reserved for Test Matches  although it gets played at the grand final (think superbowl) for a lot of sports as well. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Just like that whole controversy with the guys kneeling during it.<br />
For some reason a lot of Americans feel like it's disrespectful to their armed forces? Like how does that work? A national anthem is just some music, how is there any link to your armed forces.<br />
Do Americans think their national anthem is a theme tune for their army or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, a lot of us think the flag <em>is</em> the country.</p>
<p>It's not about the anthem, it's that they're 'disrespecting the flag'.  And some bizarre notion that if you 'disrespect the flag' you're 'disrespecting our armed soldiers'.  And &quot;how dare you disrespect our Jimmy who died overseas for that flag&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're also expected to recite the pledge of allegience <em>every day</em> to start the day as a kid all the way through K - 12 (from Primary School all the way through High School).</p>
<p>If you don't do so then you're considered disrespecting America and I got sent to the Principal's office and issued a suspension for not doing it before.</p>
<p>Pretty sure it's just outright indoctrination and propaganda. I get we should be thankful to live in a democratic country but these people take it too far.</p>
<p>It kinda ties-in with religiousness I think, especially with how God is tied-in to the pledge and is on all our currency and everythimg. </p>
<p>I suppose this is a country composed of people who are used to worshipping things so anything less than worship is disrespect to them. They worship God, they worship the armed forces and the flag, and they worship the president. They don't see any line separating love from obsession, in fact they'd argue love <em>is</em> obsession and fail to see a difference. So yeah, I often kinda chalk it up to Americans being natural-born worshippers which is what they descended from, unable to differentiate respect and love from obsession and cult following.</p></div>		</li>
