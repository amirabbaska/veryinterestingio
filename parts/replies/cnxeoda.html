			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting analogy. It also kind of adds in that most humans wouldn't be able to differentiate a color from the neighboring color &quot;options.&quot; Like <a href="http://www.color-hex.com/color/ba3269" target="_blank">BA3269</a> would be nearly impossible to tell apart from <a href="http://www.color-hex.com/color/b93168" target="_blank">B93168</a>. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If you're viewing on a TN panel, you might have trouble.  If you're viewing on a properly calibrated IPS monitor in the correct light settings, not so hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kind of my point. If you move a pawn one turn, then a knight the next, or you move a knight one turn then the pawn the next, almost nobody would be able to tell the difference. They would either had to have watched you do it, or looked at the opponents pieces and figure out why you chose your past moves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's probably a group of people who could demonstrate that given that the display was both precise enough and accurate enough to represent those different colors correctly.</p>
<p>More generally, this concept was termed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-noticeable_difference" target="_blank">just-noticeable difference (JND)</a> back when people were first investigating these phenomena. Depending on the specific stimuli, some people will have a much larger JND than others, but they could have a much smaller one on another JND test.</p>
<p>Here's an everyday example: Let's assume someone else has the remote, and they're adjusting the volume on your TV while you make popcorn in an adjacent room. Changing from 12 to 13 doesn't seem to make to much of a difference. Make the jump to 14 and, well, you still can't really tell. Suddenly though, you realize that the TV is loud, and at this point you've discovered your JND.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The human eye is estimated to be able to differ between about 10 million different colors or roughly 2^23. (2^24)^7 is about (2^23)^8.  So you would actually need 8 pixels with colors people could distinguish between so it doesn't actually make that huge a difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.</p>
<p>Another analogy of that kind was &quot;How many different possible Windows icons exist?&quot;</p>
<p>It used to be 32*32 pixels, with 256 colors each, waaay back in windows 95 days. 1024 pixels with 8 bit each, so 2^(8192).</p>
<p>Unimaginably many. So many that all computers every build by humankind till the end of the universe together will never be able to store all of them.</p>
<p>Nowadays, with 128x128 24bit icons the result is obviously even bigger, but lost a bit of its unexpectedness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>correct me if I'm wrong but you wouldn't need 7 pixels, you would still need more that you can get with pixels, since you can at max get 2^24 different pixels,and each pixel holds only one piece of information at a time</p></div>		</li>
