			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to make charcoal the traditional way in a big iron kiln. It is made by what is called a ‘controlled burn’. You let it (the wood) burn but starve it of oxygen so it just smoulders. 72hrs later you have some high quality bbq charcoal!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok this part I never got.  So is charcoal just basically prechewed wood that lights real easy?  Otherwise I was under the clearly false impression that &quot;you burned it already&quot; so &quot;how does it still burn?&quot; that I don't understand.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The remaining charcoal would melt, but you'd need to get it past 3550C (6422 Fahrenheit). For comparison, steel melts around 1300C (depending on the exact alloy), Tungsten melts around 3400C. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically it's what goes on inside every solid-fuel flame. </p>
<p>Gas isn't dense enough to create the kind of light you see from a campfire.  What's happening is that the visible flame is the area where all the oxygen is gone.   The heat pyrolyses the fuel,  vaporizing it. But with no oxygen it can't burn. The fuel floats up through the flame to the edge where there is oxygen available.   Once at the edge it can burn,  and does so, releasing heat.  This heats up the vapor still in the flame making it hot enough to visibly glow in the visible spectrum.   Hence, visible flames.</p>
<p>Ie campfire flames aren't showing you combustion.   They're areas of glowing fuel vapor stuck in an oxygen-less bubble.  When they reach the edge of that bubble they burn, vaporizing and heating more fuel, and eating up oxygen so the inner bubble stays O2-free.  The combustion is on the tips of the flames. The flames are just fuel lines. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So would the wood be considered a type of thermosetting polymer? I know thermoset polymers are usually networked or crosslinked and don't melt but they do catch on fire as opposed to thermoplastic polymers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The wood decomposes into other compounds (charcoal, methanol etc) that cannot be called wood anymore. Thermoset polymers do undergo some chemical change but the polymer backbone remains unaltered after crosslinking, unlike what happens with wood.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's also the main reason you shouldn't recycle the cap with your plastic bottle, it's thermoset, won't melt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about the bottle cap being thermoset. In my plastic materials engineering course we were told that the bottle body is made of PET while the cap is PE, which makes sense as being thermoplastic means the processing by injection molding is much easier. The difference in materials is justifiable by the more complex shape of the cap and its inner thread, hard to achieve by molding PET. I think the reason why it is advised to separate the caps is because they are made of a particularly high molecular weight, 'precious' PE, not sure though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thermoplastics will melt if there is enough heat to break the polymer bonds. Most thermoplastics are polymerized at 200 to 250 degrees F, much more than that will break the polymer bonds, unless it's a high temperature polymer. Of course at the temperature it will melt, it will also burn, unlike thermoset plastics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I realize thermoplastics will melt, but I didn't realize that they burn at the same temperature. I just had a lab where we melted PET into a mold and it didn't seem to be burning as it was liquified​ I assume as you increase the temperature it would begin to burn.  </p></div>		</li>
