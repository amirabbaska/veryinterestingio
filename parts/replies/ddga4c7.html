			<div class="markdown"><p>Credit cards do this too. The 15 digits of your card identifies the card, while the last digit checks the validity of your card number. Try this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Multiply each of the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, ect. digit of you credit card number by 2. (eg. 6: 6*2=12)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the number after multiplication is 10 or greater, add up the two digits. (eg. 12: 1+2=3)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add all the 2nd, 4th, 6th, ect. digits of your card with the values you got in #2 for each of the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, ect. digits. </p>
</li>
<li>The sum that you get <em>will</em> add up to a number divisible by 10. The 16th digit is there for that very purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is how the bank knows whether you got the wrong credit card number vs you got the wrong password. Otherwise, you'd be freezing other people's credit card accounts every time you accidentally type a number other than your own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your disc is in perfect condition, you can actually drill up to a 3mm hole in the disc (not at the edges, inside or outside though). I've tried it, it works. If you try it, don't try it on anything important, obviously, just in case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>isnt that the only way error correction can actually work? if the data is corrupted, there is no way to uncorrupt it. and if you can't do that how do you get it? it has to be somewhere else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on to this answer, since CDs are read as the disc spins, scratches that follow the curve of the disk tend to be quite a bit more serious than scratches that radiate from the centre like wheel spokes.  It's harder for the CD player to compensate when the missing bits are right next to each other. With wheel spoke scratches, there's the opportunity of only fucking up one bit at a time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that is why they recommend cleaning discs in a center-out manner. Less chance of accidentally causing a <em>problematic</em> scratch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! Some topics aren't as easily ELI5able as this one though. And then people either get too technical or give misleading analogies instead of just simplified versions of what actually happens. And then people start arguing about what a 5 year old can understand (because they don't read the sidebar).</p>
<p>But every now and then it all works out.</p></div>		</li>
