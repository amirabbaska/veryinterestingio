			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're underestimating the distances. There are some that are dozens of light years away, but most would fall between around a hundred and a couple thousand light years.</p>
<p>The other thing I'd mention here is that the vast majority of stars won't end as supernovae (granted, many of those are stars so faint that we can't see them, and the distribution of stars overall is different from the distribution of stars we see in the night sky, which tend to be more massive, and therefore more likely to end as a supernova)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Relevant XKCD:
<a href="http://xkcd.com/1342/" target="_blank">http://xkcd.com/1342/</a></p>
<p>You made me go research it further, and the average visible star appears to be around 100-200 LY away: either high dozens, or low hundred(s), however you want to look at it. I will retract my statement that there are only a handful in the hundreds, but it appears there are only a small handful that are a couple thousand LY away, the majority are in the low hundreds of LY away.</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'll add, there is actually a concept of a birthday star... that is to say, a star whose light left around the same time you were born as can be found here:

<p>With the exception of, like, 4 stars on that list, these are all naked eye visible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a couple followup questions based on your flare, I hope that's okay. Does the distance of a star affect the likelihood of finding an exoplanet?</p>
<p>And, given the fact that we can only see a limited number of stars, about how many total stars are able to be searched for exoplanets with current technology?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It absolutely does matter, depending on the different methods. The first method that was routinely used was radial velocity detections, where we measure the speed of the star, and if a planet is orbiting around it, it'll cause the star to wobble back and forth (<a href="http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view6/3209666/hammer-throw-2-o.gif" target="_blank">think of someone swinging something heavy</a>). To do this, though, we have to look at the spectrum of the star, and we can't do that for stars that are too faint since you need a lot of light from the star (comparatively) for this, and the farther away the star is, the fainter it is.</p>
<p>For transiting planets, we look for planets that pass in front of their star, blocking out some of the light. Our observations are always going to have some noise that gets in the way (from the earth, this is basically what a star twinkling is), but the brighter the star, the less the effect of noise will be, so again, the same star is going to be easier if it's closer because it means it will be brighter.</p>
<p>The other method I'll mention is direct imaging (it's only been used a handful of times, but I'm hoping to see it improve). In this case, part of what matters is the angle that separates the planet and the star. If the actual distance doesn't change, the closer it is, the bigger the angle will be, so being closer again benefits us.</p>
<p>So overall, and for different reasons, in general the closer the better (this doesn't fully apply, as the Kepler satellite looking for planets really can't look at stars above a certain brightness, but that's because the instrument was designed to look at ~150,000 stars, rather than the handful of bright ones.</p>
<p>As to the last question, I don't think anyone has an answer on that. A big part of it is also that it's more often that searches are incomplete.... for example, we've been able to check a lot of planets for close-in Jupiter sized planets, but some of those could still have planets on a different angle, or planets that are smaller, or planets that are further out. We're never totally complete on a search of a star, and there's a lot of variables involved (as well as a couple other methods that I didn't mention)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That really wasn't the question I wanted to answer (the OP), but regardless: no</p>
<p>The redshift of the light would make the explosion invisible (infinite wavelength, no energy?). Someone with better foundations in relativity should confirm though, don't just take my word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Asking what happens <em>at</em> the speed of light doesn't really work because you can't reach it, and if you somehow did then basic concepts like time (needed to measure wavelength) would no longer apply.</p>
<p>It will slow down, dim and redshift if you accelerate away at near the speed of light.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One other point that I haven't seen made yet to the OP's question, is this:</p>
<p>How exactly are you going to choose &quot;one that had already died&quot; to travel to? The information travels to us with the light from the explosion. So, while the answer is technically 'yes', you wouldn't know if you'd guessed well until you saw the explosion or arrived at a still-burning star.</p>
<p>Also, it wouldn't make much of a difference time-wise compared with staying on the Earth unless you able to travel at speeds close to the speed of light. If you do travel at speeds close enough to the speed of light, time would slow down enough for you compared to the star you're flying to that you could still be alive when your ship is at the point where you can see the explosion. (But I'll leave it to someone else to explain <em>that</em> one without using algebra.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ty for clearly answering op's question. I have one related to it. Could the explosion you start to see ,while traveling towards it, affect you?In other words is the explosion real and dangerous, or would it just be a harmless image?</p></div>		</li>
