			<div class="markdown"><p>Hanzi have their origin in quite literal drawings. However, you can't draw everything. So people used a rather clever trick: they would combine two or more characters, with one usually hinting at the meaning, and the other hinting at the pronunciation. Of course, at some point then this newly created character would just be looked at as a primitive character and people would use it as a component in even newer symbols. And so the complexity grows. </p></div>		</li>
