<p>This. You basically become a true zombie - still alive, but actively rotting away. Living dead. Your body has now has no way to replace the dying cells and part by part will start to fail. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiation cancer treatment aims (literally and figuratively) to kill cells so the don't reproduce. Normal cells are expected to be collateral damage but therapy is targeted as tightly as possible.  Unfortunately it is not an all or nothing radiation dose, and cells don't get a lethal dose. In these cases you either don't kill all the cancer or you scramble the DNA of normal cells. The <a href="https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/radiation/science-behind-radiation-therapy/how-does-radiation-work.html" target="_blank">American Cancer Society</a> has a pretty good explanation that I've referred to interested folks.</p>
<p>Hopefully the body can deal with the harm, but sometimes those &quot;scrambled cells&quot; can turn into secondary/latent cancers.  It's actually a testament to how much we have improved radiation therapy that patients are living long enough to see these secondary cancers. On the other hand it's a case of cancer...</p></div>		</li>

<p>No. By definition. </p>
<p>But in general sense, yes they can treat radiation poisoning. You can borrow someone else's blood via a transfusion, antibiotics so your body isn't busy fighting off infections, and even bone marrow transplants (where blood is made).   </p></div>		</li>
