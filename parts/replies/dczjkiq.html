			<div class="markdown"><p>So close, and yet so many errors. First, when they designed POTS, there were no &quot;electronics&quot;; there weren't even vacuum tubes. The reason for the 4kHz upper limit was to limit atmospheric interference; as the OP noted, the majority of human speech's spectrum is under 4kHz, while the interference is generally at much higher frequencies. You may have noticed the big wastebaskets up on telephone poles; those are 'loading coils', which are essentially a single stage low pass filter, designed to attenuate the higher frequencies. If this hadn't been done, you would not have been able to understand a long distance conversation - the noise would have drowned out the signal. </p>
<p>To save costs, AT&amp;T developed a way to send 24 voice channels over a single wire using Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) - all still analog, BTW. When the cost of digital fell (in large part due to Bell Lab's innovations), AT&amp;T, to keep things compatible, developed the T-1 digital circuit - 24 digital channels. To make a digital channel, the signal was sampled at 8 kHz (Nyquist theorem), and coded into an 8-bit sample. Thus 8,000 samples/second * 8 bits/sample = 64,000 bits per second. This is a basic digital channel. 24 of these gets you a digital T-1, which is 1.544 Mb/s. (Those who are interested can look up the current list of carriers, frequencies, and channels on Wikipedia. The OC (Optical Carrier) lines carry thousands of channels at once.)</p>
<p>Then, to save more money, nerds started crunching numbers to find ways to cram even more channels into a circuit. Using things like Adaptive Predictive Pulse Code Modulation, they were able to reduce a single voice channel to as low as 8 kb/s (one eighth of normal) without substantially reducing voice quality. </p>
<p>I honestly don't what rates are used today, but if you were ever on a clear 64 kb/s digital channel, you'd know the voice quality was outstanding. I used to call a girl in San Jose from Toronto, and in the silence between our billets-doux, I could hear her sigh. Can't do that on a cellphone today. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The coils also caused issues when DSL was introduced too, I think.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So there were no phones when they designed the phone system. Right.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At half that standard bandwidth or 2,000hz the quality of the speech reduced so you wouldn't recognize your own mom. At half again of that or 1,000hz you could barely understand it and could not recognize male from female speakers on the other end</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By chance is there a video on the internet that can present audible examples? I'm interested to hear what the difference is like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a thing on some Canadian carriers. I know Freedom Mobile (formerly WIND) has &quot;HD Voice&quot; or something to that effect. It's not proper VOIP, so something like Discord will still sound a lot better, but I <em>think</em> it's better quality than when I was with Virgin Mobile. </p>
<p>Regardless of how the carrier operates, a major limiting factor is the actual phone's earpiece speaker. I think the iPhone's has improved significantly (to the point where they're confident enough to use it in a stereo speaker setup, though I haven't heard it in person), but my Galaxy S7 edge's speaker still doesn't sound that great. Heck of a lot better than my old Huawei Ascend Mate 2 though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>T-Mobile in the US has had it for years. It's automatic too. Anybody else you call on T-Mobile will have it. Night and day difference. Problem is both ends have to have it in order for it to work, so a T-Mobile person calling a Verizon person won't be sending HD audio, but a T-Mobile person calling a T-Mobile person will get HD audio. </p></div>		</li>
