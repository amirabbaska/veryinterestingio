<p>Once the cable is approved it does not play part in charging anymore, besides being a wire.</p>

<p>I don't know if the lightning cable specification defines cable gauge, but on android platforms the diameter of the wire itself can dictate maximum amperage despite the charger and phone supporting higher rate.  When buying cables for android, it's important to buy the thickest (lowest gauge) cable available.  If the cable gauge is not listed on the product description, don't buy it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is due to the resistance of the wire. Thin wire has more ohms per meter. And more ohms per meter means loss of power. </p>
<p>A thin cable for example might drop 1 volt when charging only 500 mA, falling below the minimum voltage where charging is possible.</p>
<p>Another problem are poor or damaged connectors which have high contact resistance, thus loss of power in a small area. This causes heat and burned out connectors with bad luck.</p></div>		</li>
