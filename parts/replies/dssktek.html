			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish that I could have read that article. It does seem interesting, but I do not own a membership. </p>
<p>I do have a gripe, however: evolutionarily speaking, I don't see lowered VWF and Factor 8 as an evolutionary advantage, but more a disadvantage, if anything. My reasoning: stroke and heart attack are more common in older individuals, who would already have attributed their DNA to the gene pool. VWF and factor 8 may be disadvantageous for stroke and MI, but they're both great to have around in the event of injury to tissue- they will close the wound, slow and stop bleeding. I just think that injuries would have been more common in our ancestors than would have them living, or especially procreating, all that much past 30... 40 at the most. </p>
<p>But this is all of great interest to me. So thanks!</p>
<p>Edit: checked article again and realized it said Factor 8 not 13. Still doesn't change my position. Kind of reinforces it. Factor 8 is very important in the cascade and good at causing a clot- something a non-technological, budding apex predator like us would need. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>VWF levels in group O individuals are still in the normal range, so the decrease has cardiovascular benefits (reduced risk of thrombosis, primarily) without significant bleeding risk. VWF levels naturally increase with age, so the commensurate overall reduction in O individuals maintains its benefit in an aging population, even in the circumstance where increased wear and tear would benefit from increased VWF circulation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. In modern medicine where people have longer lives than when we were small tribes of hunter gatherers killing mammoths and other dangerous creatures. I'm more coming from an evolutionary stance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>O is pretty beneficial! One of the modern problems with being group O, however, is that transfusions and transplants are just a touch harder to match since O is less common than A and B. </p></div>		</li>
