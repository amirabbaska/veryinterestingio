			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the wrong way around. Put 1.5v Alcaline cells in and the LED with no series resistor would see a much higher voltage at the LED than if you put a 1.2v nicad in it. Its the foreward drop of the LED that matters. The series resistor is there to act as a voltage dropper - most leds - small ones - work at about 2-3 volts, so you have a resistor to drop the excess voltage. If you dont fit one, yeah, that LED is going to overcurrent with excessive voltage. And that will be more likey with say 4x1.5v cells than with 4x1.2v cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you supply the exact right voltage to an LED, if the current isn't externally limited somehow, the LED will die pretty quickly. This is a well documented process. </p>
<p>An LED torch without any resistors in its circuitry is <em>by definition</em> relying on the internal resistance of the power supply - battery in this case. </p>
<p>Rechargeable batteries' low internal resistance is the reason they can start fires with loose change in your pocket if you're not careful, whereas that just won't happen with an alkaline or dry cell. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were definitely less LEDs in the 90s flashlights than there are now. More often than not the filament of incandescent couldn't handle the current, but still provided some resistance. Less about diodes cooking themselves and more about filament melting. I would imagine these batteries provided more current, therefore more risk, but not normally problematic. However in true corporate fashion they protected themselves from the 1 in 1 million chance that the slight deviation would be detrimental.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was talking specifically to mention the issue of internal resistance, which is something old non rechargeable cells have, and rechargeable ones don't. How it applies to 90s toys is down to your own interpretation; I don't know of any specific examples from the era, but one that is certainly the case now is cheap LED torches. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>More often than not.. filament of the incandescent... provided some resistance </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The filament in an incandescent bulb supplies <strong>all</strong> the resistance. </p>
<p>You could connect the 12 volt incandescent bulb from the vanity light in a car to the 12 volt output of an arc welder and it would run quite happily with no damage whatsoever, because its resistance climbs as it warms to balance against the incoming voltage and draw a set current. You couldn't do that with an LED because its resistance <strong>falls</strong> as it warms up. Hence the need for external limitation, be it a resistor or in a cheap lamp, relying on the internal resistance of the cells. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is bullshit. Your house for example is connected to a high current public supply, with your logic this would blow the fuck out of a 40w lamp. Each device has its own resistance which is high compared to the source resistance. So much amateur crap posted here. Source am electronic design engineer of 30 plus years</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A 40W lamp is limited by the inherent resistance of the filament.
At switch on a <em>lot</em> of current flows (which is why incandescent bulbs are most likely to blow when powered on), but as the filament heats up, its resistance (or impedance if you want to be pedantic about AC circuits) climbs, and balances out with the voltage across it to create a stable current. </p>
<p>An LED doesn't do that, it's a negative resistance device, like a fluorescent tube, or an arc light of any description. As it gets hotter its resistance falls, which allows a higher current flow, which causes it to get hotter, which causes its resistance to fall <em>further</em> creating a runaway situation, unless a resistor is put across the circuit <strong>or</strong> the power supply, in the case of those torches, an alkaline battery, provides its own resistance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AC and DC are not particularly relevant to the post. We are talking about what actually limits current in a circuit. Its the static resistance - or if AC - the impedance - that creates an obstacle to current flow and has nothing to do with the source.</p>
<p>Try looking up ohms law. It relates to resistance of a LOAD and not the resistance of the source current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually connected with multiple stages of transformers, a power distribution system, and a decent length of wire, all leading to the high voltage from the plant dropping to approximately 120 volts and the lamp circuitry dropping amps to around .3 amps for a 40W bulb or .5 amps for a 60 watt bulb. However LED bulbs are notorious for lower power usage, which is why they have the adapter base attached. This prevents the relatively high 40W from destroying the 7.5W LED.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is rubbish. For example in the UK a typical home has a 240v supply at 100 amps. thats a lot of power. And you can connect it to a 40w incandescent bulb that has an internal resistance (ohms law) of  about 1.5 kilo ohms. Its the resistance that limits the current, not the source. </p>
<p>For LED lights, they internally use a low voltage DC - around 30v. This is rectified from the AC via a bridge and capacitor dropper. This is what the base is for, its housing the drive and conversion electronics. Go on youtube - you can tear teardowns of lamps that show exactly the above.</p></div>		</li>
