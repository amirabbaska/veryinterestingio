			<div class="markdown"><p>Electric toothbrushes work this way, inductive charges in phones are slightly different. The receive coil is an LC circuit and it relies on resonance to increase the voltage rather than simply turns ratios.</p>
<p>In the QI standard, data is sent back to the power transmitter through load modulation. The data tells the transmitter to adjust the frequency away from or towards the resonant frequency to adjust the amount of power transmitted.</p>
<p>I know you were presenting it simply, but it is misleading to say the receive coil is connected to the battery. It is connected to the inductive charge controller IC, which is in turn connected to the battery management part of the circuit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just tried to find some info reading the first few google results.</p>
<p>The efficiency seems to be around 60%, dipping down to 40%. <a href="http://www.batterypoweronline.com/conferences/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WirelessConsortium.pdf" target="_blank">[1]</a> &lt;-- pdf warning<em>!</em></p>
<p>Pros/Cons:<a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/140239-wireless-charging-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-about-powering-your-iphone-or-android-device-wire-free" target="_blank">[2]</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Safer way to transfer power to your phone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple to just drop your phone on the charging pad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Puts less strain on the charging port of your phone.</p>
</li>
<li>Qi wireless charging pads being installed in various places around the world, if you run out of juice and don't have a cable you can still charge your phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only supplies up to 5 Watts of power, same as that from a 1 Amp plug. So a 2 Amp plug would charge your device quicker. Phones with Quick Charge technology wouldn't benefit from wireless charging either, as plugging into a wall outlet will be much quicker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you've got your phone charging via a cable, you can still hold it and use it as normal. If you take your phone off a wireless charging pad to use it, it stops charging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adapters and cases are expensive because the technology is expensive to produce.</p>
</li>
<li>Can't be used with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in the car.</li>

<p>But at the moment, no. Feel all that heat emanating from your phone when you drop it on the plate? Qi charging and the like is far from efficient on current devices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Induction can be pretty efficient, but small separations between sender and receiver are important. When I take off my silicone protector, charging time drops to about the same as direct connection. That suggests to me the limiting factor is the battery, not the charger. IANAE, that's what I get when comparing them day after day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LC is a circuit with inductors (L) and capacitors (C) thatâ€™s good for signal applications. QI is the wireless charging method currently used by most wireless charging phones. IC is integrated circuit. Just means a circuit on a board basically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LC is Inductor/capacitor, the mechanical analogy is a mass on a spring. A spring by itself won't bounce, a mass by us elf won't bounce, but put a mass on a spring and you get motion. </p>
<p>QI I assume is a type of charger - subtle correction, it's a [standard](<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_(standard%29" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_(standard%29</a>) that chargers are required to meet</p>
<p>IC is Integrated Circuit, lots of transistors in a single package, in this case it means &quot;black box that does the thing&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>QI is an inductive charging standard. It is just an agreed way for electronics companies to handle inductive charging so they are compatible with eachother. LC is a simple circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, when an AC voltage is out across it at the right frequency it will 'ring', much like the amplitude of the movement of a spring and weight will increase if you jiggle it at the right frequency. IC is an integrated circuit, a miniaturised collection of components inside a single package serving a specific purpose. In this case handling everything's required by the QI standard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking on the top comment, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/JQhVo" target="_blank">I took a pic of the circuit board and induction coil from a Samsung wireless charging pad</a> for anyone that wants to see what they look like.</p>
<p>The coil on the right is stranded copper wire, about 18 awg (1.0mm), with very thin insulation. The largest IC in the center of the PCB is a <a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Panasonic/NN32251A-VT/?qs=3izLlwrMQ7nBTg64eFEYYQ%3D%3D" target="_blank">Panasonic Qi wireless charging controller</a>. The square SMD closest to the inductor is probably an isolation transformer. The smaller black squares between the isolation transformer and main controller appear to be transistors; probably MOSFETs. They handle more power than the controller can supply. The controller modulates the MOSFETs, which pulse the power through the induction coil.</p>
<p>I haven't hooked it up to a 'scope yet, so I don't know if it supplies pulsed DC or a modified sine wave. That's on the list of things to do some rainy day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question - I honestly don't know. I got it about 18 months ago. The original (black) case was about 4 inches in diameter, and about 1 inch tall. It's the one that looks like a coaster, so I'd guess it's the first generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You sure can! Texas instruments have a pretty good range of inductive charge ICs for each of the two competing standards. This would not be the sort of project you would want to take on as a beginner though, especially when chargers out of China are $5 a pop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you COULD build one, a homemade solution would probably be very bulky, and very inefficient.  </p>
<p>I'm sure there are online tutorials of people who have done it, it would not be as simplistic as &quot;two coils of wire on top of each other&quot; like the description above. </p></div>		</li>
