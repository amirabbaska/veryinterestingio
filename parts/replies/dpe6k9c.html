			<div class="markdown"><p>The Big Bang was the explosion which brought our physical universe into existence, but it's not as if there is any rigid objectively-existing distinction that separates &quot;the Big Bang&quot; explosion from everything that has happened since. The universe is still reverberating with the vibrations of the initial explosion (we can see back to the Cosmic Microwave Background, at a time when they were much higher energy (and thus the universe was a much higher temperature and matter existed only as a fairly homogenous plasma soup), but it's not as if, at some more recent point in time, those initial vibrations just stopped. We now understand that all matter is just perturbations from a minimum base value in various quantum fields (the electron field, the photon field, and so on), and the main difference between regions of spacetime like ours and regions like the early universe is that, as things cool down, all kinds of more complex forms have &quot;precipitated&quot; out of that early dissociated plasma (first stable hydrogen atoms which formed clouds, then stars, then the heavier elements they created throughout their lives and with their deaths, then eventually planets, organic molecules, life, etc.), so in a very real sense, everything around us is made up of the vibrations that originated in the initial explosion. My point is mainly that there was no distinct &quot;end&quot; of the Big Bang. Everything that happens today is essentially part of that same generative, creative process. </p>
<p>And to the person who said that that's not how the term &quot;the Big Bang&quot; is usually used, I know. It's usually only used to refer to the initial moments of the explosion. My point was just that that cut-off is arbitrary and that that explosion never stopped. There's a very good lecture on YouTube by Neil Turok called &quot;The Astonishing Simplicity of Everything&quot; where he shows a model simulation that really demonstrates this in an easy-to-comprehend way, where you see the waves of the initial explosion gradually interfere and diminish and transition to the form that they are in the cooler, more contemporary regions of spacetime. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>What would you consider a non-arbitrary cut-off? If our Universe keeps going as planned, there will never be a cut-off and all of time will be known as &quot;the Big Bang&quot;. I'd argue that definition is certainly more arbitrary than just calling a specific time at the very beginning, t=0, the Big Bang. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on which end-of-the-universe theory you subscribe to. It's currently a bit fringe, but some physicists, like Neil Turok now theorize about a cyclical universe, in which cosmic inflation (which is currently accelerating) eventually slows and the universe eventually enters a &quot;Big Crunch,&quot; getting drawn back inwards into a singularity until it reaches some critical point at which there is a new Big Bang. I don't recall how he rationalizes cosmic inflation slowing, but I do remember him making a fascinating argument. He's definitely no nut-job. (Once again, I recommend his lecture The Astonishing Simplicity of Everything).</p>
<p>Currently the more mainstream theory is that of the Big Freeze: that cosmic inflation will continue forever-- that space will grow faster and faster until every galaxy is receding from every other galaxy so fast that light from one cannot reach another (the speed of light prevents particles from traveling through the medium of space time faster than light, but it doesn't limit the speed at which space can expand). So the universe would grow colder and more empty, stars would have no more sources of fuel and eventually the last ones would die out. </p>
<p>It would take a very long time before there was absolutely NO residual vibration in the universe (in quantum terms, that there would be a 0 value at every point in very quantum field), though theoretically it would eventually happen. But even then, you start to raise some very interesting questions-- like, the ground-state (the minimum possible value) for some (most?all? I'm not sure) quantum fields is not zero. There is some small amount of residual energy even in totally empty space-- what we call zero-point energy or vacuum energy. Does zero-point energy count as a continued vibration of the Big Bang explosion? Will the energy of the vacuum ever fade to zero, even in a Big Freeze scenario? If anyone has an educated opinion, I'd be fascinated to hear it, because I definitely couldn't tell you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a theory by Penrose that he wrote about in Cycles of Time which (its been a while for me so I may get some of the details wrong) essentially said the universe has  the expansion phase and accelerating inflation but ultimately there would end up being many large black holes which would evaporate by hawking radiation and the universe is at maximum entropy-  until another big bang event (a phase change occurs) which starts the process again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hum... As far as I understood, there's 3 main &quot;end-of-the-universe&quot; theories :
1) Big Crunch : for some reason, at some point, Gravity overcome inflation, and the universe start to shrink again until all the universe is contained in a single point (generally, that is followed by a rebound and cyclical model of universes). </p>
<p>2) Big Freeze : At some point in the future, the expansion stops accelerating, the universe is then ruled only by thermodynamics and gravity and you'll be left with cold dead stars orbiting cold supermassive black-holes in a vast cold and dark universe. </p>
<p>3) Big Rip : the expansion of the universe never stops accelerating, up until the moment where the expansion totally overcomes the Strong force and all atoms are ripped into their component quarks... </p>
<p>Highly speculative, whatever the Theory you prefer. :) </p></div>		</li>
