			<div class="markdown"><p>Understand. An S-bend would be required somewhere to keep gas out. But also, if the relief pipe was high up in the toilet just like a sink a valve should not be required.</p>
<p>But also, you would need a way to keep water in the S-Bend. So maybe have a little bit of water flow into the relief pipe every flush. Like 1oz.</p></div>		</li>
