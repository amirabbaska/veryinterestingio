<p>But OP's question is actually a different question: (s)he's wondering why this became cemented even later in life.</p>

<p>Because it's cemented in childhood? The child is the father of the man.</p>

<p>In other words, OP is asking a question about why we stick with those words instead of actual names.</p>

<p>Because mom and pop are constant and straightforward whereas there are a million Johns, Jacks, etc...</p>
<p>If you talk to your siblings and say &quot;mom&quot; or &quot;dad&quot;, everyone gets who you are talking about. If you say &quot;jack&quot; or &quot;mary&quot;, it might not be so obvious. </p>
<p>If you are talking to your friends and say my mom or my dad, they get the idea. If you say &quot;jack&quot; or &quot;mary&quot;, it might not be so simple. </p>
<p>It's linguistically convenient. But I suspect it has more to do with the fact that it's how we grew up referring to our parents.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But then why do I refer to my mother and my father as &quot;mom&quot; and &quot;dad&quot; (and not &quot;John&quot; and &quot;Mary&quot;) but I call my sister and brother by their names?</p>
<p>All your reasons (convenience and clarity) for calling your parents &quot;mom&quot; and &quot;dad&quot; would also apply to calling your siblings &quot;bro&quot; and &quot;sis&quot; rather than &quot;Jack&quot; and &quot;Jill.&quot; I often refer to my siblings by their names yet I really would really never do that with my parents.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because that's what you grew up calling them? You can have MANY sisters and MANY brothers but you only have one mom and one dad. Lets say you ahve 10 sisters and 10 brothers. When you say mom is coming home at 5, everyone in the world understands who you are referring to. If you say sister or brother is coming home at 5, nobody knows who you are referring to. </p>

<p>No it wouldn't. I explained to you why. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Relationships between people were more important in the past to identify who someone is.  E.g. 'I am Steven, Son of Roland of Warwick'.
There's also the whole Scandinavian thing of your surname being your father's name + 'son' (E.g. Ericsson).
Makes sense to call someone by the relationship they are to you rather than a name tag that doesn't mean anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say this too; we most likely had signifiers for close relations and the idea of a single &quot;name&quot; for one individual is probably a later development to make larger social groups easier to navigate.</p></div>		</li>
