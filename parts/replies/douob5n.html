			<div class="markdown"><p>hold up, that's fascinating if I understood you correctly.  Did you say Moths don't have a digestive system?  They don't have a tum tum?  No noms at all?  F'real?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it's the same for humans since we go through a similar but more drawn out process.</p>
<p>But that just seems incredibly pointless and unnecessary. Their final stages are for nothing else except continuing the species. </p>
<p>Just seems strange to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is what every animal on Earth purpose is, to pass on their genes to the next generation. It is strange that a while part of their life cycle is dedicated to mating, but not unreasonable in my mind. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's strange, but it's not pointless. Unless you are implying a &quot;higher purpose&quot;, everything else serves to promote higher odds of reproductive advantage. Reproduction IS the whole point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems strange because it seems almost completely opposite to what we think helps keep us alive.</p>
<p>If anything stops eating, we've learned &quot;It's dying and dying = bad&quot;</p>
<p>pet's stop eating if they get to a certain stage of illness, and so do people sometimes, when the body starts &quot;giving up&quot;</p>
<p>and most animals don't &quot;plan&quot; to die.</p>
<p>You <em>know</em> why it works for moths, but it's still so counter-intuitive to give up on living and for giving up to help survival in any way.</p></div>		</li>
