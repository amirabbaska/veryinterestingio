			<div class="markdown"><p>• What if Mars is already uninhabitable? I guess that's part of my point.  The talk I'm hearing is of &quot;making&quot; it livable... meaning it must not be yet?  What, in logistics, makes it better than the inhabitable (current or future) parts of Earth?</p>
<p>•That does, indeed, sound cool.  I won't argue with that.  I'd go if it becomes an option in my lifetime.  I guess I'm only wondering why it's often posed as being better or more possible or more wise, when it may only be &quot;cooler&quot;.</p>
<p>•That is also a good point.  I agree.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would be nice if Mars was inhabitable already, but it's pretty far from that.  Besides being prohibitively cold in most areas, Mars' atmosphere is way too thin and oxygen-bare to be breathable, and this also renders the surface vulnerable to lots of cancer-causing ionizing radiation from the Sun and cosmic rays.  Plus the relative lack of gravity (0.6 times Earth's) would make colonists vulnerable to health problems like bone mineral depletion, muscle weakness, and probably unforeseen heart issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean uninhabitable and I'm pretty sure that's clear?
EDIT: unless it's not clear, in which case, my apologies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of knowledge to be gained from it.
Knowledge that can be used to save/improve earth as well.</p>
<p>Think of it like developing a fast car.
You build a few with cutting edge technology. For Nascar or formula 1.
This knowledge can then be used in less difficult circumstances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  That makes some sense.  So, in your analogy, it's not so much that we're ignoring our car and any effort to fix it.. we're just starting over in case we can't fix it, and in that maybe we'll learn how to fix it or see where we went wrong the first time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know - we will get tons of knowledge from building first underwater city.<br />
And it will be much-much easier to build, at least from logistical reasons.</p>
<p>P.S. Welcome to Rapture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is already uninhabitable. We would need to work to make it habitable. You're kind of missing the point. It isn't about being better or worse than earth. It's about it not being earth. One planetary disaster can't wipe out a species that inhabits two planets. </p></div>		</li>
