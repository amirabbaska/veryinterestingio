			<div class="markdown"><p>My company's intranet page is only visible from within the network due to the webserver being only on our subnet and therefore inaccessible to the outside world through any means. I wouldn't consider that part of the deep net any more than I would consider a webserver I run on my laptop for testing purposes to be part of the deep net.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that was the point of what I was saying.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I believe this will be the case with just about any company intranet, since that's sort of part of the definition of intranet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference between the deep web and dark net is a little blurry. My personal line of demarcation is do you need special software to access it, TOR or VPN or what not. That puts company intranets on the dark web as well as tor only sites, which seems fine. Of course if your in china that makes most of the internet the darkweb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always classified the darknet as deep websites where illegal activity occurs. That's pretty much how I've seen it used as well. Silk road was a dark net site. My company's internal document sharing site is deep web. Using a VPN to access my company's internal document website from home is still the deep web.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's ridiculously easy. Just download the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en" target="_blank">tor browser</a> and you can access .onion sites. The tor browser has most plugins disabled and you can turn on NoScript, so I'd consider it fairly safe. Not all sites in the dark web are illegal, e.g.  <a href="http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion" target="_blank">http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion</a> is just the address of duckduckgo.com (a search engine with a focus on privacy) in the dark web. </p>
<p>Anyway, as far as I know the NSA puts anyone who searches for &quot;tor&quot; on a list, so it's too late for all of us anyway.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not like google where a wrong link can take you too some odd places, most of the time you have to know where you are going to get there. Which is the catch 22 of the dark web, how are you supposed to know where to go, if you don't know where to go to learn where to go. </p>
<p>Still some darknet sites are pretty public, and there are even reddits devoted to them, like /r/DarkNetMarkets . Looking at the markets isn't illegal, and depending on what you buy, buying might not be illegal either. As for list, come on, you're a redditor, you're already on all of them. </p></div>		</li>
