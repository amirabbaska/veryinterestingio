<p>Rar should never be used</p>
</blockquote>
<p>RAR is still very heavily used on Usenet. There is an article size limit, so to upload a 1GB file people will compress it with RAR into chunks called .r00, .r01 etc. and usually with some parity information to verify and recover damaged or lost chunks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zip will live on as long as WINZIP ships with Windows</p>

<p>WinZip has never shipped with Windows. The functionality to compress/uncompress Zip files has been in Windows for a while now though, although I still remember when it wasn't and everybody had trial versions of WinZip that would tell you they were 640 days overdue.</p>
<p>On Linux you will still find the good old tarball used most often (.tar.gz).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tarballs aren't a compression format.  They just glue files together into one big one.  The utility actually originated as a tool to read tape drives (Tape ARchive).</p>
<p>The .gz tells you that it's <em>also</em> been compressed with gzip, another early 90s compression standard using LZ77 encoding like zip does.  Another common compression standard on Linux and friends is .bz2, for the bzip2 utility.  Files ending in .tar.bz2 are moderately common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also seemed odd to me. I probably download around 90% rar files from the internet, 10% zip files (seeing a zip file makes me suspicious for some reason) and 0% 7zip files.</p>
<p>I'd think if zip or 7zip were better, this would not be the case, right?</p>
<p>Does zip or 7zip not support partitioning? What about encryption?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Zip supports encryption, but you often need a secondary program to encrypt it and few people bother or even know you can use it encrypted.</p>
<p>7z supports encryption and partitioning, but is so much newer that many people just don’t default to it and use what they’re used to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Winzip has never shipped with Windows. Winzip is borderline malware nowdays.</p>
<p>The main Winzip program might be fine, haven't tried it for years but all the other Winzip branded software like &quot;Winzip Registry Optimizer&quot; and &quot;Winzip Driver Updater&quot; are straight up scamware.</p></div>		</li>
