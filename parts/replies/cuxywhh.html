<p>Interesting note- Some people are more controlled by their circadian rhythm than others. The sleep schedule of night owls is almost entirely dictated by their circadian rhythms. The opposite is true of morning people, who tend to not have their sleep cycles controlled by their circadian rhythm. They instead, and much to their benefit in society, get tired when they are low on sleep (ie the end of the day).</p>

<p>Damn, this is so true for me and my gf! When she's tired she's out in like 5 seconds. Literally as soon as her head hits the pillow she's fast asleep. Meanwhile, I can be on an 18 hour workday, tired as a horse and still struggle to fall asleep at like 1 AM. If anything, being tired just makes it harder for me to fall asleep. Being a night owl is a bitch, there are no benefits to it in the modern world :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear about people going to bed at 9pm because they have to get up at 5am and I struggle to understand how that even works. If I go to bed at 9, I <em>still</em> don't fall asleep until 1-2AM. I've been like this since adolescence and nothing I do seems to fix it... I only fall asleep before wee morning when I'm sick.</p>
<p>There are a few small benefits. I like to do my grocery shopping a little before midnight; much shorter lines, less cart crowding in the aisles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a night owl too but since I got work which requires me to wake up at 5:15 I'm already dead tired at 9pm and can usually fall asleep within an hour. A comment above said to reset your schedule you could stop eating 12-16 hours before waking up. I've been doing some 16-20 hour fasts during my transition peroid, so maybe that helped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I regularly go to bed between 8 and 9. People think it's crazy, but I like to wake up around 4 because I love mornings and like to take my time getting ready for work.</p>
<p>I've always been a morning person, though, and come from a family of morning people. Honestly, the latest I remember ever sleeping was once in highschool until 11. Other than that I can't ever remember sleeping past 9, and I normally wake up before 6 even on the weekend. I can't understand the opposite...like it boggles my mind how someone could sleep the day away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sometimes even though your body is dead tired, your brain think, nope i am not tired yet, no sleep, even though you eyes are closing down, still hard to sleep. if you face this shitty situation, try to read some shitty book which you don't have any interest to read. from my experience, you will fall sleep highest on second page, saying from experience.</p>
<p>remember only shitty book, if you find some or good interest on that book, forget about fucking sleep! :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I'm the same way. I feel like my circadian clock is on a delay and/or that my cycle is significantly longer than 24 hours (which may be an actual thing, from listening to people I know who worked in the sleep lab at my old psychology department). My natural tendency is to fall alseep far past midnight and to wake up just before noon. I can force myself into an early-rising rhythm, but it means I get very little sleep, and will start tending towards my &quot;normal&quot; rhythm as soon as it's possible (weekends, vacation, etc.). Even as a kid I stopped taking naps very young, because it wasn't possible for me to just sleep at will, and always spent hours awake at night before falling asleep. I remember my mom just telling me to &quot;close my eyes and sleep would come&quot;, and I had no idea what she was talking about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tip: To reset your circadian rhythm, stop eating 12-16 hours before the time at which you want to wake up. For example, if you want your natural wake up time to be 7am, stop eating between 3pm (more effective) and 7pm (less effective) the day before.
EDIT: Clarity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not. Unless you are the type of person who can reset this way, in which case yeah it's true. </p>
<p>Google 'sleep hygiene rules' for the full list of behavioral tricks. If following these doesn't fix the problem you may have a sleep disorder. (I followed them like a religion for years but it only helped a little.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Circadian rhythm is a bigger factor than most people realize - primarily because most people are on a &quot;normal&quot; 24-hour daytime rhythm. </p>
<p>Other people, however, can be on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder" target="_blank">Delayed sleep phase</a> rhythm, to varying degrees, and it can really suck. Some people's rhythms don't run 24-hour, even. </p>
<p>Left to my own devices, I'm pretty regular, but definitely offset from a &quot;normal&quot; schedule. I feel jetlagged when I try to function on a regular schedule that most people don't think anything of.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes hello, my life.  This is only my fourth year dealing with a 26 hour schedule (up till age twenty I was constantly sick from sleep deprivation) and I'll tell you this much-  I would pay all the money I own and the majority of what I would ever make, put my life at serious risk, and shorten it by twenty years to make this go away. <em>I'd do anything.</em>  Cancer is preferable, because cancer can be beaten, non-24 is lifelong with no cure.</p></div>		</li>
