			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have a regular alarm clock, but the alarm going off would jolt me awake right at the first beep. It also helped that it was a <em>really</em> loud Casio alarm clock. </p>
<p>The jolt awake meant that it also tended to happen right in a sleep cycle, but no more of that. Now with the light, my brain wakes up very, very gently which is great. During the summer, I'm always up early because of the light getting into my bedroom. In winter, I used to jolt awake from the alarm because there was no light to wake me up naturally.</p>
<p>It also helps me to wake up even earlier if I need to. I usually get up around 6.20, but I occasionally need to wake around 5. With the wakeup light, I actually don't notice a difference in terms of feeling tired. It's amazing. It's also very helpful in winter time, when you don't have natural light to wake you up like in the summer.</p>
<p>I was VERY skeptical when I got it; I didn't really expect my brain to pick up on that light and to actually get woken up, much less the marketing which touted 'sleep better, feel more relaxed, wake up less stressed', etc. But it works! I now heartily recommend these things to everyone with sleep or waking up issues.</p></div>		</li>
