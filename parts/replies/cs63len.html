<p>Cancer often has a latency time of 20 years or more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to mention epigenetic effects that may affect subsequent generations - possibly giving a latency measured in generation[s] to non-cancerous effects that would not usually be associated with that sort of latency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a double cancer peak for survivors of the Atomic Bombings in Japan, cases of leukaemia started showing up 5 years later and peaked 10 years after the bombings, there was then a second peak about 20-30 years later involving solid cancers.</p>
<p>310 people died of leukaemia between 1950-2000, out of 86,611 survivors studied.</p>
<p>So it's possible that a drop in leukaemia cases might seen now if the withdrawn chemicals are linked to e.g. childhood leukaemia. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a drastic difference between cancer that comes at the response of heavy radiation exposure and cancer that would come about due to chemicals. For example, someone who starts smoking in their teens typically don't see any cancer until their 40s.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oddly enough, smoking partly increases Lung cancer via a synergistic interaction with radon exposure, radiation. Smoking increases a person's sensitivity to radon by 6 fold. Targeting smoking reduction may be more effective than reducing radon exposure. It appears smoking reduces the lungs ability to repair radiation damage.</p>

<p>So you could look at a cancerous tumor and figure out if it was caused by chemicals or caused by radiation? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html" target="_blank">CDC</a> finds there been a doubling of autism rates from 2000 to 2010. However, there's also been greater awareness, so more people are likely to be diagnosed, and more recently, the diagnostic criteria for autism has changed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The causes of autism and ADD are still not known. No one has discovered an autism virus, like there is an ebolavirus. In this situation any claims about causing autism are suspect. Maybe X causes autism. But, maybe Y causes both X and autism, so they appear together.</p>
<p>But, it's a valid question. Lead in gasoline was shown to cause childhood brain damage that manifests itself as low IQ and violent behavior. Anything obviously neurotoxic would have hard time surviving current regulations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of. I really hope they put an end to lead in aviation fuel soon. It accounts for more than half of all US lead emissions. Baggage handlers at airports have poor health for a very obvious reason. Children living within a kilometer of an airport have elevated blood lead levels.</p></div>		</li>
