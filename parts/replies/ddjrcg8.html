			<div class="markdown"><p>The President can be impeached under the Impeachment Clause of the US Constitution:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Of course you need a majority of the House to decide to impeach the president and then two thirds of the Senate to find him guilty.

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if Congress is unwilling to act towards impeachment?  </p>
<p>When a political party have a majority in both house and senate, they effectively control both the ability to proceed and to convict impeachment proceedings.  </p>
<p>Are they the only legal remedy available constitutionally? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting article on the suit CREW just filed against him...
Basically, the problem is that the only avenue people have open is either to sue the president or impeach the president.  Impeachment requires specific kinds of lawbreaking and as noted by others, Congress isn't interested.  A lawsuit requires someone to prove harm <em>to them</em> and then not settle out of court AND the judge to rule in their favor.  Groups are feverishly trying to find ways to frame what's going on that way, so they can move forward with suits, but so far everything is kinda nonspecific enough that not many have actual standing.  It's kinda fucked up but ultimately, it's bc the system is designed to be fair to EVERYONE, so when someone comes along and blatantly takes advantage of that it seems...unfair. But people who want to hold him to the rules don't want to bend them just to get a win. </p>
