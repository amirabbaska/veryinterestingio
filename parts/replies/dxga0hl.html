			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not entirely sure.  This can go either way.  If you are in a state of learning something new, then your brain will be alert, so that you don't miss something.  This can cause you to take longer to settle down.  I find that once I'm in the &quot;brain full&quot; state, doing something repetitive, monotonous, or not new-to-me can cause me to fall asleep quickly.  So, I guess I would say that the more new stuff you learn in a day, the easier it will be to fall asleep, as long as it is not right before bed such that you are still in an exited, aware, ready state.</p></div>		</li>
