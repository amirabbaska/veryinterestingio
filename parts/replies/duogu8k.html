			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially considering what they ate! Having a second set of teeth must’ve been a huge evolutionary advantage . Also, While “average” lifespan may have been be approx 35years, that includes incredibly high rates  of infant mortality. When factored out, human lifespan in prehistoric times was approx 60-65 years. Much closer to today than most understand it to be.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most human teeth found by archeologists are in better shape than modern teeth, until the last few hundred years nobody had access to refined sugar.
For example and as a reference they have scanned dozens, if not hundreds of teeth from people killed in the mount Vesuvius eruption and they were far healthier than modern teeth at the point where they were fossilised.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not familiar with the teeth from Vesuvius, but teeth in ancient Egypt were in terrible condition. They primarily ate bread that was ground on stone, so there would be pieces of sand mixed in and they'd wear their teeth down to the roots, exposing the nerves. Several mummies have been found with multiple dental abscesses, and infected teeth are suspected as the cause of death for more than one pharoh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. People in Pompeii and the smaller cities near Vesuvius had almost perfect teeth. Their dental health is attributed to a low sugar diet - rich in fruits and vegetables - and to a high concentration of fluorine, the element used to make modern fluoride, in the water supply. The fluorine was deposited into the air and water by Vesuvius. So the volcano gave them the great teeth, and then killed and preserved them in such a way that we could study the great teeth it gave them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.unm.edu/~hkaplan/KaplanHillLancasterHurtado_2000_LHEvolution.pdf" target="_blank">He's a bit optimistic, but not completely wrong. In the paleolithic time, humans had a coin-flip 60% chance of reaching age 15. However, if you reached age 15, the average lifespan jumped to around 54 years.</a></p>
<p>By the bronze age and iron age, life expectancy at 15 had fallen to 28-36 years, however. So it's not entirely accurate to pretend that at any time in human history, making it out of childhood meant you would live to a ripe age.</p></div>		</li>
