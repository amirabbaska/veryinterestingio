			<div class="markdown"><p>To go down the rabbit hole a bit more, there is a universal turing machine, U. That is a &quot;computer&quot; which will simulate any other computer if given the right input.  Since U is, itself a turing machine, there is an input for which U will simulate U.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it should be emphasized (as you briefly mentioned) that no physical computer is actually a Turing machine, but, since they have finite memory, they are equivalent to finite automata. So there is no such thing  as a physical &quot;turing-complete computer&quot;.  It is clear, that there is no universal finite automata.</p>
<p>Thus, the answer to the OP's question is Yes for Turing machines (infinite memory), but No for physical computers. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It would require an unfanthomably powerful computer which might not be possible to build in our universe, but as far as I know, we are not aware of any theory that precludes this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the interesting subtleties of this idea is that beings existing in a simulation wouldn't have a reference as to the &quot;real&quot; time they're living in. So, for instance, if a single second in the simulation took a million years to render in the &quot;real&quot; world, the beings inside the simulation would still experience it as a second. </p>
<p>If the simulation can run forever, the computation power required to run the simulation reduces inversely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you , you still have to worry about memory. Memory would limit the resolution you could have to less than the &quot;resolution&quot; of our current universe.</p>
<p>It is physically impossible for a computer without infinite memory to simulate itself, and infinite memory does not exist. Thus you can't simulate the Universe perfectly no matter how good your hardware is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting! I remember a while back reading about some scientists who were looking for evidence of &quot;resolution&quot; in atoms or something along those lines. </p>
<p>But, also, couldn't you just program the sentient entities within the simulation to &quot;see&quot; the resolution of the world as &quot;normal&quot;? </p></div>		</li>

<p>According to our current understanding, physical reality could in principle be simulated on a computer. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not true. Our best current models of reality (quantum mechanics and general relativity) are known to be incomplete. So, currently, we can't simulate <em>any</em> part of reality without fudging it. And there is no proof that the necessary complete model even exists, or if it does, that it is computable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an important point. None of our measurements of the world have infinite precision. There is new physics waiting to be discoivered at the Planck scale, if we ever get there.</p>
<p>And anyway, If we want to make a wild assumptions being inside a simulation, why should we assume that the rules inside the simulation need to be the same as in the substrate reality? Greg Egan in his book &quot;Permutation City&quot; uses a simplified set of physics laws for the simulations, just because they are easier to simulate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doesn't the fact that the universe exists at all prove that there is some sort of model governing it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No - it could be that the universe at some scales just does what it does, in no fashion that corresponds to anything in primates' brains. </p>
<p>Incidentally, I don't believe this to be true; I would put my bet on a complete model (a grand unified theory) being possible. But that's just my hope as a scientist; there's no proof. </p></div>		</li>
