On hot/sunny days, you usually want to water 3-5hrs prior to sunrise so the soil has time to soak in all the necessary nutrients. Any later, and you risk losing the water through evaporation, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our city has a webpage that claims that it is actually most beneficial for lawns to be watered at the hottest (although, not <em>only</em> at the hottest) part of the day because that is when the grass it most stressed from the heat.  However, the reason not to is because it wastes more water.  Water usage isn't a huge concern where I live, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He is correct because it keeps dew from forming on the grass. The dew breeds disease, it also has alot of sugar in it to support fungal/disease growth. Watering it knocks the dew off back down into the soil. </p></div>		</li>
