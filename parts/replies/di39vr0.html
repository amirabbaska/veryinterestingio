			<div class="markdown"><p>That last part is interesting. In the Morrissey song 'Piccadilly Palare' which is about male prostitution in London there's a part where you hear 2 male voices talking. The first one is hard to pick up but the second clearly says 'No, no. No, no, no. You can't get there that way. Follow me...'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fern Riddel is a Ph.D. historian with a focus on Victorian and Edwardian sexuality. She's worth a follow on Twitter as well, but she wrote a book called &quot;The Victorian Guide to Sex: Desire and Deviance in the 19th Century&quot; that's a fascinating read about that particular period, and covers prostitution as well as the &quot;everyman&quot; Victorian's sexual practices.</p></div>		</li>
