			<div class="markdown"><p>The nebulous part comes from the fact that there isn't like one magical point in a specie's history where they change from one species to another.  This is in part because there isn't one definition of the term &quot;species.&quot;  This is one of the biggest stumbling blocks for biology as a discipline: it doesn't have a clear definition for its most basic organizational increments.  </p>
<p>At some time, it was supposed to separate two animals that cannot interbreed and produce viable young, but we are finding more and more examples of species that break this rule.  Bacteria, plants, corals (don't get me started on corals), and countless other organisms can  produce viable young.  So with no clear definition that works across all life, the definition for species varies depending on which organism is being discussed.  The rules for that organism are determined chiefly by the taxonomists who study that organism and tend to be arbitrarily based on physical characteristics.  </p>
<p>Anyway, this is a long way of saying that because the most basic term &quot;species&quot; is not well defined, &quot;sub species&quot; are mostly applied to suit a particular situation and are one step removed from a &quot;population.&quot;  Intercontinental travel means that humans are now a global population and any reproductive isolation has been long since removed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You asked for it!</p>
<p>Lots of corals readily interbreed between species.  In fact, the genetics of corals are really, REALLY messed up.  Take the genus Porites in Hawaii for example.  Porites was split up morphologically into a number of species (compressa, lobata, evermanni, and others).  When they tried to make a phylogenetic tree of a number of specimens of each, they grouped like this:</p>
<p>compressa
compressa
lobata
lobata
compressa
evermanni
lobata
compressa</p>
<p>In other words, their genetics showed that they were all over the place.  And this isn't just with Porites.  Genetics is playing a huge role in helping to define lines of speciation, but since we don't have a functional OR genetic definition for the term species, how big of a role is as yet to be determined.  At this point, I'm glad you didn't ask about bacteria!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might get a little racially charged, and im sorry if i sound ignorant(because i am).But why arent all the human races (european, african, asian etc) classified as subspecies when we all haave these very obvious physical traits, a lot more obvious than the difference between the 70 species of field mice that exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the physical differences aren't sufficient enough to warrant a differentiation. Yes, there are observable differences, but relative to the entirety of the human genome, they're minute. </p></div>		</li>
