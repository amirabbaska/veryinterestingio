			<div class="markdown"><p>right.
if i understood correctly he means that the diaphragm's contractions are meant to compensate for the forced exhalation that happens during excessive crying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By compensate for the forced exhalation do you mean breathing in?</p>
<p>I thought about it that way originally, but the wording is throwing me off. Long periods of diaphragm contraction in this context would mean you're breathing in really slow. I feel like usually during excessive crying you breathe in fairly quickly, just with a stronger force. Which would actually give shorter than normal periods of diaphragm contraction. </p></div>		</li>
