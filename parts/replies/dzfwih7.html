			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. As an addendum to your last paragraph, I'd like to add that a few different backdrop colors have been used over the years for the purposes of special effects in film. For example, Disney used to use a certain shade of yellow, as you can see in <a href="https://www2.shutterstock.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/05/Mary-Poppins.jpg" target="_blank">this shot from the set of Mary Poppins</a>. </p>
<p>I'll just quote <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/history-green-screen-compositing" target="_blank">the article</a> that I got that picture from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In what is sometimes called the “Yellow Screen,” renowned film innovator Petro Vlahos developed the sodium vapor process for technicolor film production. This process, which utilized a very specific light wavelength as a backdrop, would effectively “key” out certain colors through a very special camera, which Disney used heavily in the ’50s and ’60s.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of a dark, almost orangeish yellow. It also looks like the screen isn't as <del>well</del> brightly lit as the actors, making it seem even darker</p>
<p>Edit: as u/arvidsem points out below, the screen itself was actually white—it was rather <em>cast</em> in a certain shade of lighting in order to achieve the desired effect</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is probably a combination of the lighting and the film the still photographer used. The lighting will be off because the shot was setup to only light the set from the direction of the movie camera and the still was taken from a different angle. In addition the still photographer was probably using a different color film than the movie camera. The way color photography works is that you have to find a chemical that when exposed to a certain narrow region of light it changes color, and there is no guarantee that the color it changes into will look like the original color. In the early days of filming yellow turning into green on film was a common problem, for example on the first day of filming the Wizard of Oz the yellow brick road came out green, and they had to find different yellow paint to get it to come out yellow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, the &quot;yellow screen&quot; they used was not actually yellow. It was a white screen that they lit with a specific type of yellow light. The process by which &quot;Yellow Screening&quot; eliminates the background is different than &quot;Blue/Green Screening&quot;. It's not simply that they used a different color; they used an entirely different technology.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically same idea, but this was before digital when you had to physically cut and paste the film or project it throug color filters (actual pieces of colored glass) to remove the parts of the image that you didn't need. The sodium vapor in the name was not really used for treating or processing the film, it comes from the gas in the lightbulbs that produced that dark orangish color for the back screen, because it was a very specific color that was easier to filter out  without affecting people on the foreground.</p>
<p>Blue and gray screens were also used back in the day and up to the time when digital post-processing became common. Nowadays they use green because it works better with the way digital sensors operate. The important part is being able to produce a solid and predictable color that you can easily remove from the image (with whatever tech you have) but also has the least possible coincidence with the subjects you want to keep, so you don't end up with with trasparent eyes, hair or armpits like in those low-budget bluescreen shots from 80's tv series.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Approximately the same, but green-screen usually refers to an electronic process, while this kind of thing was more of a photographic/optical process. They would use filters to create a traveling matte from the sodium-yellow light at the same time as they were filming the real footage, and then use that matte (a separate pair of spools of film containing the silhouettes/cutouts of Mary Poppins) to combine the right parts of the foreground and background images into the final film.</p>
<p>Green-screen / chroma-key is the same <em>concept</em> but it's happening electronically inside a TV camera (well, these days it's in software of course, but the original systems were much simpler and electronic — they'd just switch between two (frame-synchronized) video feeds based on the color (chroma) of one of them).</p>
<p>Different technologies mean that different illumination choices make sense. The narrow-band nature of sodium yellow makes it easy to filter using physical filters, but once the light hits the camera sensor, all that spectral information gets lost, and it's just another yellow color.</p>
<p>IIRC they also used ultraviolet and near-infrared illumination to produce mattes like they did with sodium yellow. Same principle except that the extra illumination is completely invisible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Superb post.</p>
<p>Many years ago in the late 70s, I had a communications/TV course and the studio equipment we used was all blue for the chromakey's. I don't know if that was the technology at the time or for some  odd reason that was how it was set up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About twenty years I built a science center chromakey exhibit and we used a blue backdrop. The explanation I was given by our SME at the time was that photographers chose it years ago because people and plants aren't blue, and that green screens were introduced much later because TV weather presenters often wear blue suits (and aren't depicted on screen with foliage).</p>
<p>So just because green <em>is</em> a good choice from an image-capture/processing perspective, for all the technical reasons, and no doubt especially so in the highly controlled special effects context of the original question, it doesn't follow that is always the reason green gets used. Coarser practical considerations may take precedence. I'd expect a chroma keying specialist to have a variety of backdrop colours at their disposal. </p>
<p>I must add, getting that exhibit to work under natural light was a huge pain in the ass, we had to run the hue rejection pretty low with sometimes hilarious results. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked in videography for a long time and have done a lot of keying.  People are blue and it effects keying significantly.  Often people will have a natural blue or orange/redish tinge to their skin.  If you use a Blu screen the light reflecting off it onto the backs of the subject, if they have a natural Blu tinge will make it really difficult to key and even if you do you'll have to rebalance the colors for the person's face and edges.  This led to a lot more color spill, which I'd imagine was a large motivation in moving away from Blue screen</p>
<p>This can be especially bad if using natural daylight during bluer periods of the day.</p></div>		</li>
