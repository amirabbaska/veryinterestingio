			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to detract from a good answer regarding the cost of operating the flights, but...</p>
<p>Airline pricing often has little relation to the actual cost of operating the flight. Instead, prices are set based on what people are willing to pay for the flight (and there are huge barriers to entry to the marketplace, so it's not like a new airline can just come in and start offering flights for the cost to fly + a small percentage markup).</p>
<p>This is why &quot;hidden city&quot; 'tricks' exist; where instead of flying from A to B, one instead books a flight from A to C that has a connection in B, and then simply disembark at B, because it is <em>MUCH</em> cheaper to do so. People will pay less to go from A to C (connecting through B), so the cost is less than just flying from A to B, because people will pay more to go from A to B.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically if you are going to do this you book two one ways rather than a round trip, being sure to take advantage of a different A-B-C route on the return home to also get the cheaper flight. </p>
<p>Personally I haven't seen a flight sufficiently different enough in price to justify the hassle, but apparently some do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is. It's quite common (see: <a href="https://www.hopper.com/research/hidden-city-ticket-opportunities-common-think/" target="_blank">https://www.hopper.com/research/hidden-city-ticket-opportunities-common-think/</a>).</p>
<p>With that said, the hidden city 'trick' doesn't work as well anymore (part of the reason for the single quotation marks around the word trick). I used it only as an example of how the price of a ticket has very little to do with how much it costs the airline to operate that route. They'll happily charge you $400 to go from A to C, connecting through B, even though that trip is 2x the distance of A to B and they have to land and takeoff twice, but then they charge someone going from A to B $550 for a ticket. $150 more for something that must necessarily cost them significantly less than going from A to C through B. A perfect example of how the price you pay doesn't have much relation to the cost for the airline.</p>
<p>Why doesn't the 'trick' work very well anymore? The airlines have caught on. They'll definitely cancel any return flights you might have booked, with no refund. They'll sometimes charge you a fee for &quot;missing&quot; your connection, now, too (trying to make up the price difference). And if you do it repeatedly, some airlines will even ban you from flying with them in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Many of the current &quot;budget&quot; airlines in the US are subsidiaries of larger airlines, which means that their costs/profit margins are supposed to be high...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is incorrect.</p>
<p>The current low-cost carriers in the United States are Allegiant Air, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Spirit Airlines, and Southwest Airlines. All of these airlines are independently owned and operated from their legacy counterparts.</p>
<p>You're thinking of the 2000s when Delta had Delta Express and Song, United had Ted, and US Airways had MetroJet. All of these &quot;airline-within-an-airline&quot; products were abandoned for the reasons you cite.</p>
<p>Also, ultra-low cost carriers like Frontier and Spirit in particular have been wildly successful and are exerting <em>tremendous</em> downward pressure on airfares, to the point that legacy carriers like American, Delta, and United have had to introduce new &quot;basic economy&quot; airfares to be able to compete.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What was Southwest's legacy counterpart? Because to my knowledge, they don't have one. I don't think it's fair to lump them in with Allegiant, Frontier and Spirit, because those generally suck ass compared to Southwest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't have a specific counterpart, but they're one of the original low-cost carriers and they've played a major role in the industry.</p>
<p>I would divide airlines into three categories:</p>
<p>Legacies - Primary selling point is that they fly everywhere</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>American</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delta</p>
</li>
<li>United</li>
</ul>
<p>Low-Cost/Boutique - Primary selling point is their service and product</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alaska + Virgin America</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JetBlue</p>
</li>
<li>Southwest</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultra-low cost - Primary selling point is that they're cheap</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Allegiant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frontier</p>
</li>
<li>Spirit</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it's worth remembering that that's the headline price from RyanAir. If you want to check a bag in the hold, you'll pay more. If you want to choose your seat, you'll pay more. If you want to pay with a credit card, you'll pay more. If you want food/drink on the plane... you get the idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um yeah, American airlines is starting to charge $25 for a carry on with their lowest fares soon... It's $50 if you didn't pay before arriving at the terminal. For a carry on. Stored in the overhead bins. Fuck this company.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ryanair is the absolute most disgraceful airline.
If you don't check in before your flight, the fee is huge
Want to check in to your flight? You'll have to <em>pay for the privilege</em> unless you wait until a certain number of days / hours before your flight </p>
<p>Go to the airport 3 hours early to check in? Too bad. You didn't check in online, that'll be €70</p>

<p>I think to avoid any fee, you need a pre-paid Visa Debit Card. They basically have to have one method of payment be free to avoid being sued for false advertising, but they make sure it's one that most people don't have.</p></div>		</li>
