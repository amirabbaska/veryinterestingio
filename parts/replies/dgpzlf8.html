			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I did some (admittedly minimal) research to make sure this was actually a thing, and it... kinda is? It's better and worse at the same time - I feel like you're partially misrepresenting the situation, to match the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; with people's current attitudes better. The &quot;Lost Cause&quot; myth, from the handful of sources I skimmed/checked info on, sounds even worse than what you're describing. For example, it seems there was both active support of slavery as a means to a better society, and the rejection of slavery as the motivating factor behind the war. Also notably, it seems like the North's involvement in manufacturing this narrative is not unanimously agreed upon as the primary driver behind this. </p>
<p>Basically, when I read your summary, I was surprised and worried, because it sounded like some actually believeable conspiracy. After reading up a little bit, it seems like the more unpalatable parts are no longer held by most, with more &quot;acceptable&quot; ones still being taught as fact. Which isn't <em>much</em> better, but it kinda feels that way? I'm still kind of shaken by the fact that &quot;the South mostly wanted state rights, not slaves&quot; is taught without discussing the evidence for motivation of either (in California no less).</p>
<p>Last note - As part of my googling spree, I found data both for and against slaveowning being a big part of Southern lives. Probably a third of the population was slaves, but only 6% of southerners owned slaves, but up to 49% of <em>households</em> owned slaves (by state, average around 25%). Presumably that means the 6% number is intentionally misleading, counting women and children who couldn't own property. There was also something about southerners who didn't own slaves still benefiting from having a punching bag/aspiring to be a slaveowner... I think overall the data makes it undeniable that slavery was in fact a huge part of southern life and economy, and we're definitely being bamboozled to a degree by our education system, but it's not quite a crazy conspiracy.</p>
<p>TL;DR - The post above needs more visibility and people should do some research to confirm it.</p></div>		</li>
