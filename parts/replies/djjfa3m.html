			<div class="markdown"><p>To contradict your statement, you mentioned multiplying 3 and 5, yet 2 is also prime. In this proof it is assuming that you are aware of all prime numbers that have a smaller numerical value than the largest one, therefore 2x3x5=30, and 30+1 would then equal 31, which is a prime number.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That makes OP's case <em>even worse</em>.  You aren't going to discover all primes from using this method, so how are you going to find the rest to be able to use this method?  It's almost immediately circular and therefore impractical.</p></div>		</li>
