<p>Probably also hard to control the mouse and keys before installing (although there's auto hot key). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right, there is no api like that. And I believe unless you try to interact with important system files, the administration popup will not appear at all and the program can be used without authorization.</p>
<p>The mouse can be moved but not 'clicked' or at least I have not heard of an api that can do that. Keyboard keys can be read if the application window has focus.</p></div>		</li>
