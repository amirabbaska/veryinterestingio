<p>But yeah. This is somewhat of a common question, and the most simple answer is that kinetic energy is not conserved when you change reference frames. Since there is no such thing as absolute velocity, velocity measurements are always relative to a reference frame. Thus, any quantities that are calculated based on a relative measurement will not be conserved when you change reference frames. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Energy is the potential to do work. The ball can't do work while sitting on the bus, but if the bus crashed and inertia would hurl the ball on someone's face, it would do work on that face. So energy is not fictitious but you can't feel or touch it. You can only feel the effects that it does, ie. the work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at all! The energy that something has is also, in many ways, how much change the two of you can do to each other while interacting because there is some difference your states.</p>
<p>Two objects of different temperature? That's a difference of energy, something can be fine with that difference. </p>
<p>Two objects of different heights in a gravity well? Yep. </p>
<p>Two objects traveling at different speeds? Of course!</p>
<p>If you want to know if there's energy in a system,  ask: could someone find a way to accomplish some task using some process of equalization. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An important follow-up to this explanation is that the observer's frame of reference was <em>changed</em>. All laws of physics are the same in all non-accelerating frames of reference (according to special relativity), but the manifestations of those laws will <em>not</em> be the same. This is a classic example of frame shifting; another is where a person in a car moving at the same speed as a train sees the train as motionless. </p>
<p>In order to change your frame of reference from &quot;stationary&quot; to &quot;moving at the same speed as the objects&quot;, Neil had to accelerate your frame of reference, and for that time, your reference frame was non-inertial. Because of this, strange things like apparent violations of conservation of energy are allowed, because special relativity doesn't hold for non-inertial reference frames. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Shifting your frame of reference is merely a mathematical change of coordinate systems. We can treat the change in velocity as instantaneous, or incorporate two observers; in either case there is no time period of acceleration. This is often the treatment used in the twin paradox.</p>
<p>As HugodeGroot says, the simple and correct explanation is that energy is conserved but not invariant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding two observers, certainly, but when only one observer is considered (and the relative motion of the objects with respect to that observer is the value of interest), then you absolutely cannot consider the change in frame velocity as instantaneous, since that would imply an acceleration of infinity. </p>
<p>Frame 1: Inertial, A_frame = 0, V_frame = 0, V_objects &gt; 0</p>
<p>Frame 2: Non-inertial, A_frame &gt; 0, V_frame and V_objects changing</p>
<p>Frame 3: Inertial, A_frame = 0, V_frame &gt; 0, V_objects = 0</p>
<p>The single observer's frame starts in Frame 1, is in Frame 2 while being accelerated, and ends in Frame 3, where the initial conditions of Frame 3 are the final conditions of Frame 2. </p></div>		</li>
