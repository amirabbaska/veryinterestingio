			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably worthwhile adding the reasons that some Europeans are light-skinned. This relates to there being strong selection for the genes for light skin due to the lack of pigmentation allowing for more efficient vitamin D synthesis. </p>
<p>People living in hunter-gatherer cultures in northern latitudes (e.g. the innuit or native Siberians) get plenty of vitamin D in their diet. There is no selection pressure to evolve lighter skin. People living in agricultural cultures in northern latitudes often don’t get enough vitamin D in their diet. Humans can use UV light to synthesize vitamin D in their skin to make up for this, so natural selection has favoured light skinned genes for these cultures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inuit are first genetically and naturally bronze-skin.
So your question is really why didn’t they develop lighter skin over time?
The reason is because their diet is so rich in vitamin D, there was no need to reduce the pigmentation in the skin (to better absorb the sun).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, I always make that mistake. I always think it should be &quot;bare&quot; because why would you be thinking of a large woodland animal?</p>
<p>Edit- hang on, I actually did get it right that time. It really is &quot;bear in mind&quot;, it's coincidence that its the same as the animal.</p></div>		</li>
