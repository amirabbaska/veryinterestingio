			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course! But y'know, as much as people love to laud the metric system, it's just as arbitrary as anything else.</p>
<p>I will give it that it has nice interconnectivity and consistency, but it's fundamentally based on the Meter, which is originally this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>30 March 1791 â€“ The French National Assembly accepts the proposal by the French Academy of Sciences that the new definition for the metre be equal to one ten-millionth of the length of a quadrant along the Earth's meridian through Paris, that is the distance from the equator to the north pole along that quadrant.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yeah, all base units such as the meter sort of <em>has</em> to be arbitrary, because means of measuring things is a human invention, not found in nature.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That's the main point with the metric system - and why it's much better. So, it's not as arbitrary as anything else.</p>
<p>Inches, feet, yards - there's 12 inches in a foot, and 3 feet in a yard. lulwut</p></div>		</li>

<p>These are contradictory statements. Arbitrary means there is no backing reason. The metric system - like most abstractions - was developed to address specific issues.</p></div>		</li>
