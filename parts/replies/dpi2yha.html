			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no chocolate scientist, but I definitely eat my fair share of chocolate. I started putting this site together but haven't had the chance to work on it recently: <a href="http://mychocolatereview.com" target="_blank">http://mychocolatereview.com</a></p>
<p>The reviews are very 'simple' - meant to speak to the average person or gift buyer.</p>
<p>But the part you might enjoy is the &quot;Bars&quot; page. It hasn't been updated in months, but I find it fun to scroll through. I've had about 675 bars since Sept 2013, from 125+ different brands. I can't think of anything else in the world that I can name even 50+ brands of!</p>
<p>If you ever need someone to taste your products, feel free to send it my way :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can get kind of tricky when you get up to really high cacao contents because the unique flavor of the beans and how they were roasted is very prominent.<br />
I really like Theo chocolate bars, their high cacao chocolate is pretty fruity and acidic though.  You would probably have to order online though as they are Seattle based and don't have massive distribution (Whole Foods sometimes has them).  Mast brothers is probably pretty accessible on the east coast, although they are decently expensive.  But honestly, there is nothing wrong with a good ole Ghirardelli or Lindt bar.  Chocolate is kind of like wine, just eat what you like, it doesn't matter what other people's opinions are about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure of the full historical context, but as the food industry has grown and evolved the need for clear regulation to keep food safe and &quot;understandable&quot; to the consumer has also grown.  I say &quot;understandable&quot; because I fully recognize that the average consumer does not understand food labeling and what all the different words and claims mean.  But having strict regulations around what constitutes chocolate protects the identity of it and helps ensure that the consumer is getting what they want every time they buy something labeled &quot;chocolate&quot;.</p>
<p>It is very easy to use cheaper ingredients and similar processes to make something that tastes like chocolate, but doesn't contain chocolate mass/chocolate liquor or cocoa butter.  Having chocolate classifications means that there is less variability between products and people generally know what they are getting when they make a purchase.  </p>
<p>Chocolate also isn't the only food item like this.  Many many many foods have what we call a Standard of Identity.  Sour cream, milk, cheese, yogurt, etc.</p></div>		</li>
