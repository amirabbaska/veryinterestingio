			<div class="markdown"><p>Mark Soloski here: It is true, there has been a dramatic increase in the last decade of not just tick borne disease, but also disease transmitted by fleas &amp; mosquitoes. This is from data collected from the CDC. If you look at the maps there is an expansion of the range of where Lyme is reported  both in the Northeastern and Midwestern US. Reasons for this are complicated - probably climate change &amp; land use changes - combined together to increase the habitats that support Lyme disease transmission. </p></div>		</li>
