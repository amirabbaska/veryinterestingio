			<div class="markdown"><p>Most sea level rise thus far is actually due to thermal expansion of water. This is a gradual and predictable change, though. The concern over for example Greenland melting is that it could happen very quickly and cause a lot of sea level rise within maybe a few years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The density of seawater at boiling is about 980 kg/m^3, the normal density is around 1025 kg/m^3, so we're looking at a volume increase of 4%, or sea level rise of about 160 meters. And that's if you boil it. Water doesn't expand <em>that much</em> when heated, there's just a lot of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why can't people understand that no matter how hot it is there's only a finite amount of ice... And it's only enough to raise sea level by 216 feet. Thermal expansion is pretty miniscule by comparison. In waterworld the ocean literally rose like... 28,000 feet. It was a ridiculous concept. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Searching for &quot;sea level thermal expansion&quot; will net a lot of information but here's a fairly short explanation: <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/sea-level-rise/" target="_blank">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/sea-level-rise/</a></p>
<p>Thermal expansion (water expanding as it gets warmer) is currently the #1 contributor to sea level rise, but eventually melting ice will become #1. Note that the sea level will still continue to rise for 50-100 years even if we stopped all carbon emissions today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because it's not huge. The bottom 90% of the ocean will stay at the same temperature it is now, it's only the surface that will heat up, leading to something like 0.1% expansion of 10% or so. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest problem, as you stated and I just want to expand on it, is not the actual rise in sea-level, it’s the economical and political impact. Economically, it would be an absolute disaster. Many financial hubs across the world would no longer exist (New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong, etc.). With that, the millions and millions of people would have to move. Most people can’t afford to do that, which means government assistance. There are so many implications that I can’t cover them all, and lots are unknown. Politically, famine will cause war, unrest, violence, terrorism, you name it. Many nations will no longer be recognizable, and even wiped out (island nations). I know this is an ask science thread, but, the biggest consequences of sea level rise are how people are going deal with it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, that depends on how fast the rise takes place. If it's over only a few months (or less), then yes the impact will be horrendous. If it takes place over a century or two, there will most likely be time to move the vast majority of human civilization inland and/or develop submarine habitats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not hopeful governments have the foresight to plan a century or two down the road (especially when many in Congress don’t believe, or don’t care, about climate change). That’s why it doesn’t matter how long it takes sea level to rise, the impacts will never be avoided.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, no, because it's not like the beach just kind of moves up closer to land. There's all kinds of other stuff that can happen as sea level rises. Storms will whip up the water and send it crashing inland. Like Katrina, but it happens to NYC instead, because now it's <em>NYC</em> that's beneath sea level and not just New Orleans. The sea level rising by say, 6 inches is a lot more dangerous than you might expect because a lot of places that weren't under threat, now are, and a lot of places that were managing their issues just fine, are no longer able to handle what's going on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This seems unlikely. New York, Philadelphia, all of Delaware, New Jersey, and Florida, half of the Carolinas and Louisiana...these places didn't develop infrastructure overnight*. When Memphis becomes a port city, it's gonna be hard to move that infrastructure in a way that's not economically devastating. </p>
<p>And moving it is the best case, economically. Worst case, all that investment is now literally buried under 60m of water. Talk about sunk costs...</p>
<p>[Edit: Yes, I understand you're saying 200 years. My point is, it took over 200 years for these places to grow, and that was with a population that grew with them. The economic costs of flooding is that those investments are now <em>gone</em>, not that there can't be new investments elsewhere. Additionally, the ability to make smart decisions about where to migrate people to won't be easy. Suppose you think the water level rise will stop at ~30m. OK, Tallahassee or Richmond, you're the new port city to the world. Trillions of investment goes into building infrastructure. But the water doesn't stop there, it goes to ~60m. Now all that investment is gone, too. </p>
<p>[If you want parallels, the best places to look wouldn't be where sea levels have risen (not enough data), but where sea levels have vanished: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea" target="_blank">Aral Sea</a>. The region was slowly devastated over decades, even with the knowledge of what was coming.]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not that simple. To move the world’s economy, in NY, to another location would be a nightmare. “Why are we moving it? NY isn’t underwater?” And why would NY want that?? That’s there income and livelihood you’re taking away. Displaced persons is the number one problem with sea-level rise, and why the DoD is so worried about it. It’s not just moving your own people. World leaders would be expected to take on the lion’s share. And if we don’t, we create a climate (no pun) for hate/terrorist groups. There are so, so many implications, and many we can’t predict.</p></div>		</li>
