			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about market share. It's about extortion. MS was in a position where a computer company was total dependent on Microsoft to make their product salable. A computer without windows was worthless in the late 90s. So, you are Netscape and Microsoft decides to come after you and tells all their customers (the computer companies, such as Dell and Compaq, who were also Netscape's customers) to bugger Netscape or Microsoft won't license their operating system... that's extortion. Netscape sees their market share go from over 90% to 50% in less than two years. It forced Netscape to give their browser away for free (the browser was formerly free as a download but OEMs and businesses were paying customers) and their revenue tanked. </p>
<p>Here's an interesting read:

<p>The key aspect of the extortion is lack of options. If Dell (back in the late 90s) had the option of two competing operating systems to choose to load on their computer systems that were equally accepted by consumers, if Netscape were the popular browser and Microsoft refused to license Windows if Netscape were loaded, Dell could just turn to Microsoft's competitor. But, because Microsoft was the only game in town, Dell would have to just acquiesce to whatever Microsoft told them to do, because a Dell computer without an operating system is just a brick. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why it <em>is</em> about market share. Without high market share, you can't meaningfully extort from your customers. When you have a monopoly position, that's when tying amounts to extortion - when you don't have a monopoly share in a competitive market, tying just kills your competitive position, so attempted extortion doesn't succeed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why? This is a ridiculous position. If the product offends your sensibilities, how about you not spend hundreds of dollars to buy it? Funny how that works, right?</p>
<p>You're acting like it's compulsory to own an iPhone. As I said, it's a ridiculous position.</p></div>		</li>
