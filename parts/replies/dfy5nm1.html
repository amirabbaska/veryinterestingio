<p>It appears that you are wrong; after that court decision, new laws were passed to make it illegal again <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1466A" target="_blank">https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1466A</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting how they implemented it. The laws you linked are careful about only regulating media that is not already protected free speech. That's why they qualify with &quot;is obscene&quot; and &quot;lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many parts of the PROTECT act were struck down as unconstitutional.  If you check wikipedia, there seems to be very little prosecution under that specific law given the relatively widespread amount of lolicon in circulation, and the vast majority are either plea deals or cases where actual child pornography was found as well.</p></div>		</li>
