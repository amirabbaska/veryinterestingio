<p>A 1995 article in the Lancet first raised the suggestion that fungal hallucinogens in old books might have been a source of academic inspiration for years, without anybody realising it. 'The source of inspiration for many great literary figures may have been nothing more than a quick sniff of the bouquet of mouldy books,' wrote Dr R. J. Hay, one of England's leading mycologists.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The decay of the paper is part of the smell - chemists are evidently working on ways to determine the condition of books via the scents caused by the degradation of the materials (<a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac9016049?tokenDomain=presspac&amp;tokenAccess=presspac&amp;forwardService=showFullText&amp;journalCode=ancham" target="_blank">study info here</a>).</p>
<p>On a more anecdotal note, I worked in the special collections section of a library when I was in college and odor is definitely something we noted when working with materials, as it could be a sign of mold or mildew. Books get weird if there's too much moisture - nasty red residue, smells, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I thought too, initially. Not everyone thinks that old books smell good. So, there's probably a chance that we associate that smell with a positive memory (ie: digging through Grandma's attic, hanging out in Grandpa's study, going through old boxes, pitcures, etc).</p>
<p>In short, the olfactory center's proximity to the memory/emotional regions of the limbic system could account for the association of the odor and positive mood. (1st year uni student, if I'm wrong be gentle).</p>
<p>All in all, a really cool discussion for AS.</p></div>		</li>
