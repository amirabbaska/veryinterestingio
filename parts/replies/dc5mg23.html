			<div class="markdown"><p>I started medical school in the early 1980's. It was one of the most abusive, deplorable, and inexcusable experiences in my life. I had already committed so much time,effort and money to getting accepted to school little did I know what was in store. Not until my clinical years beginning my third year did it begin. By that time I saw no way out.
It wasn't just the narcissistic attending physicians(who probably couldn't get a job in the real world because of their psychopathology)but the fraternity of abuse carried on by the interns and residents. &quot;Do unto others as done unto you&quot; was the golden rule. I decided I would never treat another human that way.
I know things have changed but it has not stopped. I still see many students and residents in my practice who endure abuse.
Thank you UAB!
Thx to some of you from CMMC. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer: yes!</p>
<p>Slightly longer: takotsubo (literally octopus pot) cardiomyopathy is likely a reaction to extreme stress where your body floods with adrenaline and the heart doesn't handle it.  It goes into extreme weakness and you can easily end up with shock and death.  Also when the heart is weak it can form clots inside the chamber.  This can be spit out and cause (super massive) strokes which can kill as well.</p>
<p>Source: I got good at passing tests so I became a cardiologist.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to ask the same thing. It seems to happen (or at least, the stories we hear about) to people who are the spouse of someone who just died and they had been married for like 50 or 60+ years, or to parents who lost a child. So from that it would seem that having an incredibly strong emotional bond with another person who has just &quot;always been there&quot; for as long as you can remember and then suddenly they're not there anymore, has a stronger effect on the surviving person. But this is just me speculating. I hope someone with more knowledge can answer or speak to this!</p></div>		</li>
