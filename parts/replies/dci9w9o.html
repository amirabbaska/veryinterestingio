			<div class="markdown"><p>What about for kids around the age range of 6-11 ish? I don't know about most kids, but I felt insulted during that age range if someone talked to me like a kid. And now that I'm an adult, kids around those ages seem more comfortable when I talk to them as if they were 20+ (minus the swearing). It could be just a coincidence, but those are the signals that I've noticed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Treating 6 year-olds like toddlers is, as far as I can tell, a recent phenomenon. Barring developmental disorders, children that age have acquired complex language skills, and they're starting to really develop their social skills and the nuances of interacting with others. </p>
<p>In my opinion, they should be spoken to as adults, because that's how they learn to talk like an adult. Obviously, you're going to make accommodations for a 6 year-old's lack of vocabulary, and you want to stick to topics that a 6 year-old is capable of discussing, but they still need to be challenged by words and concepts that they don't yet understand, because that's how they learn. Kids that age are a lot smarter than people give them credit for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My cousin is 6 and I just talk to him normally (but without swearing). I've got a pretty big vocabulary I think and I'll say something to him and he'll ask me what it means and then he'll use it in every sentence he can for a few hours. As the youngest in my extended family I had never dealt with children before him and I always thought you had to dumb everything down right up till age 9 but upon meeting him when he was 4 I found that wasn't so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We went to a friend's house for the fourth of July one year. Their daughter was about five at the time. My friend's sister in law was there. She spent the entire time with the five year old, speaking to her like a newborn baby. </p>
<p>I hate to say this, but I thought she was mentally handicapped. She was legitimately speaking as if she was developmentally challenged. </p>
<p>I went home thinking that they had a handicapped person in the family, and didn't think about it again. </p>
<p>A few months later, we ran into her again, this time without any children nearby. I was told she was coming into work and was impressed she could make it in alone. She marched in, had a conversation with my friend, and left. </p>
<p>It was then that I realized that she was just talking baby talk to a very much too old child back when I had initially met her. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That all makes a ton of sense. A couple years ago, I nannied a six year old boy over his summer break. I didn't realize I was talking to him like he was an adult, but I guess I was, because he told me, &quot;Ileocecal, I like you. My teachers treat me like a baby, but you treat me like a real man.&quot; Ever since then, I've made a point to not baby talk to older kids. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Around that age, kids start to shift into a higher plane of cognition, where they are able to think about sequence and logic and concrete ideas. So by that age, they are learning independence and therefore desire to be spoken to in a more mature manner. But we still have certain patterns of speaking that we use with younger children, like using lower-level vocabulary in conjunction with higher-level which does the same thing as when we do the &quot;choo choo train&quot; thing with babies. It gives them an extra connection to link the meaning of the higher-level words. Around this age, we also start asking kids what they would prefer out of a list of acceptable options, which gives them some agency and is something we wouldn't do with younger children, but also not how we treat teens. It's subtle compared to baby talk, but these little things we don't really notice are hugely important to cognitive development and most people do it almost automatically. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kids in the age of 6 - 11 are hopefully building solid first language skills in grammar and vocabulary.  Speaking normally to them allows them to practice vocabulary, decoding (linking sound and written word), grammar, conversation, etc.  While there are times to elongate vowels and enunciate consonants (sounding out words while writing), these kids will mostly want to break away from the baby-talk.  </p>
<p>It also has social cues for them. They feel older, more mature, more included in the powerful adult society.  If you stop speaking in high-pitched/soft voice, they hear that as well.  </p>
<p>And kids seem to gather a wide range of vocabulary quickly depending on where they are.  I teach in the farmlands but live in the city.  The kids in the city have internet and everything, they've developed large varied vocabularies by the age of 10.  The kids in my farmland school have zero internet outside of school, they have an obvious lack of varied vocabulary compared to the city kids in my complex.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that when you talk to the kids they are probably not getting what you are saying.  They are trying to.   There may be a lag while they self-translate or figure it out.  But they appreciate it.  There is a point where they will tune it out.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. /u/YourWormGuy is correct that not all cultures talk to babies like this, but the vast majority do for the reasons described above. However, it has been found that speaking in the slow, high pitched voice does improve language acquisition, which is why the majority of cultures instinctively speak in motherese to infants.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally, I'm friends with two different parents who have kids with amazing vocabulary to the point where their 2 year old daughter can have a full conversation about what she did that day with her 4 year old brother. It can even creep people out a little in public when their 2 year old is doing something like articulating to the waiter what they would enjoy for lunch. Perhaps they naturally have high IQ's I don't know, but I do know the parents are the kind of people who can talk for hours non stop. Since they both work from home they are constantly talking to their children and they do it as if they were talking to an adult. </p>
<p>Ever since I became friends with these people I've been giving new parents the idea that they should talk to their child as often as possible even if they are just saying what's on their mind without any regard whether the child could understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a whole movement now that is similar to what you're saying except more specific to describe what you're doing with the child. </p>
<p>Like, &quot;I'm going to pick you up now,&quot; wait a second, and a 3 month old may tense their neck in anticipation since they've heard the same thing since they were born. They even begin to participate in care activities in the pre-verbal stage, like diaper changes. </p></div>		</li>
