			<div class="markdown"><p>Small correction. Alcohol dehydrogenase oxidizes ethanol into acetaldehyde - the toxic compound responsible for most hangover symptoms - and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase further oxidizes acetaldehyde to acetic acid, a much less toxic compound.</p>
<p>Nasal congestion is commonly caused by inflammation of blood vessels in the sinus. Acetaldehyde is directly responsible for this inflammation due to stimulation of mast cells. You may know mast cells as the immune cells responsible for an allergic reaction (another common cause for nasal congestion). Well, acetaldehyde also stimulates these mast cells, causing release of a powerful inflammatory chemical called histamine. Additionally, alcohols produced using yeast (i.e beer and wine) contain histamine as a byproduct of fermentation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're probably aware of many ways to prevent hangovers. Drinking lots of water, good sleep and eating a big breakfast are some common ways you're probably heard of.</p>
<p>One way to attack hangovers directly at the cause (acetaldehyde toxicity) is with Vitamin B1 supplementation. Vitamin B1 reacts with acetaldehyde to form acetyl-CoA, a coenzyme directly involved with respiration (more specifically, it is oxidized during the Krebs cycle). </p>
<p>Another supplement that may decrease acetaldehyde toxicity is N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). This is cysteine (the amino acid) with an additional acetyl group added onto the amino group. In the body, it is converted into glutathione, an enzyme that contains high amounts of cysteine. Glutathione, along with acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, oxidize acetaldehyde into the less toxic substance acetic acid. While acetaldehyde dehydrogenase is not consumed in the reaction of converting acetaldehyde to acetic acid, glutathione is, so over time its levels decrease. By supplementing NAC, supposedly we will fight off high acetaldehyde concentrations more quickly because there is a higher glutathione supply, and therefore it will not be depleted as easily. </p>
<p>I'm sure there are more things that will help hangovers, but these are a few things I've learned from my biochem courses at school. Keep in mind though that nothing really counteracts a hangover as much as we'd like (short of not drinking)!</p></div>		</li>
