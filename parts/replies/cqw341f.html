			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. The momentum of the generators isn't the same kind of buffer. That would only affect the frequency of the power generated. Currently there is still a human at the power plant ramping up production based on the measured draw. Supposedly  with this battery that person has to do a lot less since all the small changes don't erupt in a form of thundering herds.</p></div>		</li>
