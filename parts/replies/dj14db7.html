<p>Japans attempt at making an empire came from within and were considered more clean. </p>

<p>It really was different, for all of Japan's atrocities (I mean what they did in China was insane) they weren't in it to eradicate a particular group or for some racial ideology. They just wanted an empire, thought they deserved one by divine right, and frankly that's nothing new in the history of the world. Thwarting elements of your own war effort because you're so hell-bent on the mass extermination of specific groups was something else.</p>
<p>In essence, we're used to people raging across the world trying to gain power, but not ethnic cleansing of the whole world. </p></div>		</li>

They just wanted to cleanse the entire Germany (which included Austria and other German speaking areas) of any non-German and also extend Germany to the east to give them some living space and not be dependent on foreign imports. Japan were more ambitious then the Nazis in terms of areas they wanted to conquer. This does not make the Nazis any less evil though. However the idea that the Nazis had plans to conquer the world were Allied propaganda.</p></div>		</li>

Rising sun with lots of red stripes is the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rising_Sun_Flag" target="_blank">War flag of Imperial Japanese Army</a>&quot;, that's the offensive one.... which is different from the &quot;big circle on white&quot; background you see (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Japan" target="_blank">Japan's national flag</a> )</p>
<p>Why the Japanese navy still uses a naval ensign variant of WW2 war flag is beyound me.  Atleast Japanese army made it look more cartoony</p></div>		</li>
