			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't say I'm 100% certain, but I don't believe infective endocarditis is an autoimmune condition. It was my understanding there is actual colonisation of the heart tissue by the pathogen (hence 'infective').</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not he explained it poorly. Rheumatic fever is an autoimmune condition (M protein in Strep pyogenes mimics cardiac tissue) and it damages the mitral and aortic valves in some cases, which can predispose you for infective endocarditis. Strep viridans group bacteria hang out in plaque and since blood returning in the venous system reaches the heart before it reaches the liver or spleen, people with damaged valves can get IE from dental work. This is why those people get prophylactic antibiotic treatment before dental work gets done.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For people who do not understand the above comments here is a real world example.  I lived in a very poor family that did not value proper oral care (ie brushing and flossing) and also had an abusive father so I had a few teeth knocked out during beatings.  I used my fingers/nails or my shirt to scrap off visible plaque and I did not learn or care about proper oral care until my 11th grade year.  I did not even go to a dentist for anything other than emergency surgery (having the roots from knocked out teeth removed) until I was 20.  Luckily for me, everything from the k9s forward are still decent, but everything behind it is either in bad shape or completely gone.  You can imagine what that feels like.  I have random pain from the remaining teeth and chewing food can be difficult.  If you do not properly chew your food you can end up with digestive issues (which I have) as you stress out your digestive system.  On top of that I now have a mitral valve prolapse.  Think about that, if you do not properly brush your teeth, you CAN and WILL end up with heart issues.  My issues are severe enough that I can no longer do heavy physical activities like running, jogging, or biking.  Mitral Valve Prolapse is something that normally occurs to people over 50 and I was in my 20s when first diagnosed.  Just think about being 23 and being restricted from so many activities.  On top of that, I have had to remove many foods from my diet (including alcohol) as my digestive system is messed up now.  Many things like breads including pizza crust etc, leafy greens, alcohol (really sucks), beans, oddly seafood (no idea why), and heavily processed things like sausage or hotdogs.  As if that was not enough, I always end up with random heartburn whether or not I have eaten or drunk anything recently.  Brush your teeth!  It saves you from so much: disgusting looking teeth, tooth pain, missing teeth, heart issues, digestive issues, and of course all of the money you now need to spend on dentures or replacement teeth (I am looking at around $40,000 USD which I am saving up for now).<br />
TLDR: Brush your teeth!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hamboner said everything right, but for those who are interested in a couple of points</p>
<p>-Not all IE results from autoimmune conditions (IV drug users can get a nasty form of the disease)</p>
<p>-Not all IE is actually infective (&quot;marantic&quot; endocarditis aka NBTE acts the same way but is caused by blood products, not bacteria. Often associated with cancer)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>good answer. pretty much how we learned it in dental school</p>
<p>edit: as people pointed out the bacteria can also directly colonate the heart tissue causing damage that way as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it not direct colonization of the valves by bacteria? What you are describing sounds more like rheumatic heart disease, not endocarditis. The vegetations on the valves in are actual bacteria and reactive fibrous tissue, which is why you need a long course of IV antibiotics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s what I thought. The reason why it’s difficult to treat at times is because of the protective biofilm that surrounds the vegetation which makes it difficult for antibiotics to penetrate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's the way I learned it too. I've even seen pictures of these colonies on a &quot;screenshot&quot; of a cardiac ultrasound.</p></div>		</li>
