			<div class="markdown"><p>GPS satellites are one of the few times we had to take into account both special and general relativity for the clocks. They're high enough above the earth that their clocks tick faster, and moving fast enough that their clocks slow some. We needed to take into account both of these factors for it to work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>General relativity shows that time is relatively slower in gravitational fields. The satellite is higher up -&gt; gravitational field is weaker -&gt; time travels quicker.
Special relativity shows that time travels slower for objects traveling quicker. The satellite is travelling quickly around earth as it orbits -&gt; time runs slower for it.
Look up time dilation if you want a good explanation as to why special relativity effects time, general relativity is more complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Elevation means that gravity is ever so slightly weaker. Since gravity warps spacetime, slowing it down,  there is a differential in the warping. Same effect could be observed if you lived most of your life in a basement vs at the top of a skyscraper. The difference in the building is almost too insignificant to matter, but GPS orbit in MEO at about 20,000km. Which is about halfway around the earth but vertically. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to general relativity, the more curved the spacetime you are in is, the slower time passes for you. This means that if you are near a massive body, time passes slower for you. I'm not sure how this was derived though (it's really complex).</p>
<p>Special relativity, on the other hand, means the faster you move, the slower time goes for you. This can be derived pretty easily using the Pythagorean Therom and assuming that two things moving near the speed of light are sharing information over, say, radio. Essentially, the light appears to be traveling different distances to a stationary observer and an observer moving with the objects communicating. If we assume that the speed of light is constant, this means time must be passing differently for the stationary and moving observer.</p></div>		</li>
