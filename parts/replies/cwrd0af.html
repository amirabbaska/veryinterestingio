			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why vertebrate (= fish and their descendants) eyes sees the frequencies they do is they are not strongly absorbed by water, and so penetrate deep into the ocean. So, you don't observe much absorption in rainbows, and what absorption there is is weak and flat, not enough to make observable lines. </p></div>		</li>
