			<div class="markdown"><p>There is absolutely no need for an evolutionary advantage to be socially desirable. Think about nose and ear hair: those have a well defined function and represent an evolutionary advantage (lesser chance of infection/diseases), and they're still widely considered as gross or at least a symptom of decrepitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last study I saw had a 50/50 split for women liking full heads of hair or bald... and historically speaking, we're most likely to have children before baldness kicks in, so even if balding was seen as a negative, it wouldn't be bred out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not necessarily high testosterone though, it's the hair follicles having high sensitivity to it. </p>
<p>Plus, hair loss can be caused by poor health, so it doesn't always make sense to prefer balding partners. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the plates was more responsible, topical minoxidil would not be expected to be beneficial. That site of action is the follicle and there is no change in cranial growth (or measurable lack of cranial growth) with minoxidil. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What regulates the amount of hair each part produces? Surely they are seperate, as you can often have men who grow very little facial hair, who have a full head of hair. You could have men who grow a lot of hair on their arms, who have very little hair or no hair on their chest/back.</p></div>		</li>
