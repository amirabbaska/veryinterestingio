			<div class="markdown"><p>As a PC user since the 90's (TSR-80 and original 386) the transition from programs to apps is still something that throws me to this day. When im troubleshooting a problem on a computer over the phone with the end user, i'll absent mindedly ask them to open a certain program. If i use the term &quot;program&quot; i will often have to go into more detail on how to open said program BUT if i use the term &quot;App&quot;, the reaction is the opposite and the end user will likely know what im talkng about. Its been a very strange change over the years and its even stranger to think that such a small change could result in such confusion at times. </p>
<p>In my experience, the term &quot;app&quot; has superseded portable computing and is used almost exclusively in place of the word, &quot;program&quot;. Being somewhat old school (im only 35) i think program is more accurate to PC usage so thats typically what i use which is why i have to correct myself when speaking to younger end users. I dunno...shits crazy.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird, I guess I'm the opposite. When I hear app I usually just think of some tiny, generally single use thing that's probably not super useful vs a program that sounds much more robust and capable of doing what I would want it to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what i was getting at is not so much what is technically correct anymore but what has become layman. Marketing likes to use new words because new is better that old. People are excited about new things and updates things so apps is one of those words that the less savvy have grabbed on to and understand now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you here. When I think 'program' I think of a word processor, audio/video software, etc. </p>
<p>The word 'app' makes me think of some mobile device thing-a-majig</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At this point I think the term &quot;App&quot; has a different connotation than the term &quot;Application,&quot; even though app is just an abbreviation of application.  Applications themselves are a subset of the class of programs, which is just anything a computer can execute.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Correct. I remember hearing someone call themselves an &quot;Applications Programmer&quot;. A friend who is also a programmer said &quot;That is kinda dumb. Of course he is an <em>applications</em> programmer. We almost all are, except for people who write operating systems.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm only 29. I grew up hearing both and Program still feels more natural to me. I always use it to explain something to someone.</p>
<p>I refuse to use the word &quot;App&quot; as well. It's either Program or Application. App just makes you sound dumb as hell, at least to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel dumb having to use it but its become layman at this point. The time i would waste trying to clarify what i mean by using program or application isnt worth it anymore. You can fight the good fight but it'll wear on you eventually and sometimes you just have to give in to the new stupid. In fact...as ive gotten older ive learned that part of getting older the living life in general is about dealing with the new stupid things to come along. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting - I can't help but automatically think that an &quot;app&quot; is a shitty program designed for mobile - which is obviously the original use.  Thinking of Autocad as an &quot;app&quot; torques my brain a little bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now that I think about it, I’d refer to AutoCAD or Photoshop as an “application”- or even an “application suite” (spelled out in the full) as opposed to, say, the Starbucks “app” on my phone.</p>
<p>“Program” has a more technical connotation for me- an application consists of the entire runtime environment, resources, and state: so an application includes programs, but it also includes e.g. graphics, data files, documentation, and libraries.</p></div>		</li>
