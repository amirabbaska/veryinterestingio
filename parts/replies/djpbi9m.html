<blockquote>
<p>Due to his perception that children with Down syndrome shared facial similarities with those of Blumenbach's Mongolian race, John Langdon Down used the term &quot;mongoloid&quot;.[56][120] He felt that the existence of Down syndrome confirmed that all peoples were genetically related.[121] In the 1950s with discovery of the underlying cause as being related to chromosomes, concerns about the race-based nature of the name increased.[122]</p>
<p>In 1961, 19 scientists suggested that &quot;mongolism&quot; had &quot;misleading connotations&quot; and had become &quot;an embarrassing term&quot;.[123][124] The World Health Organization (WHO) dropped the term in 1965 after a request by the delegation from the Mongolia People's Republic.[123] While the term mongoloid (also mongolism, Mongolian imbecility or idiocy) continued to be used until the early 1980s, it is now considered unacceptable and is no longer in common use.[123][125]</p>

<p>There was a period when people believed, basically, all Mongolians  had Down's Syndrome.  Kind of.  Because the eyes and facial structure had some outward similarity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a children's book when I was younger that said there were three types of people, Caucasoid, Negroid and Mongoloid. I was old enough though to know that this book was probably from a different time and should not be distributed anymore. </p></div>		</li>
