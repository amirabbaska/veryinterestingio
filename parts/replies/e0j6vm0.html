			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how we test that a theory is correct (or &quot;correct enough&quot; I should say).</p>
<p>Coming up with a model to describe phenomena that we observe is pretty good, but it does not tell anything behind the phenomena themselves. Instead, if you are able to observe some phenomena, come up with a grand theory that describes them and also describes phenomena we never observed, <em>and then</em> you observe them, you conclude that your base hypotheses are pretty good.</p>
<p>There were plenty of other phenomena like that. General Relativity predicted a ton of stuff, and all of them were observed much later: gravitational waves, gravitational lensing, gravitational redshift, black holes, expansion of universe, and so on. </p>
<p>The Higgs Boson was also first mathematically predicted, and only afterwards observed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The class of objects and phenomena that were accurately predicted before they were actually observed is one of my favorite things. I love that we can take some stuff we've seen, use math, logic, etc. on it and predict a whole new thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is it bent away if gravity is pulling it closer to the sun? I am not a smart person, FYI. Black holes have huge gravitational pull thatâ€™s why they absorb light, but how does light bend around the other celestial objects with lesser gravitational pulls?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The original post's wording is a bit confusing. The light is bent towards the sun, not away.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought the first observation of this came in 1919, and was done specifically to verify Einstein's calculations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes - you're right.  i had thought there was experimental evidence that disagreed with Newton: there wasn't.  Einstein's calculations differing from Newton's was seen as opportunity to test between the two.  direct observation of light bending confirmed Einstein's calculations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There was the precession of Mercury's orbit. Newtonian mechanics predicts precession, but not as much as was observed with Mercury (the other planets were too far from the Sun for the difference to be noticed).</p></div>		</li>
