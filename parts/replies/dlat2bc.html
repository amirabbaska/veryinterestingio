			<div class="markdown"><p>Diamond's is less than sound when it comes to its attempted explanation of history. The book applies a biologically-based explanation (Diamond isn't even a historian, he's a biologist!) to a vast range of issues to which it doesn't apply. He presents his theories as a definite, end-all explanation, when much of it is even based on disproved science. It's very easy to take the book at face value (as you have done, which is not really your fault) as the one true explanation of history on this subject, especially when the book doesn't even cite any sources... and it's similarly easy to take your answer at face value too. (It's not a particularly good question being asked here, but that's another story.)</p>
<p>Anyway, don't take my word for it, I'm not a historian either. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6pm3he/whats_the_issue_with_jared_diamond/" target="_blank">Here is a recent question about the book's issues,</a> and I recommend you search for similar questions on r/AskHistorians and r/badhistory as well. edit: like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/historians_views#wiki_historians.27_views_of_jared_diamond.27s_.22guns.2C_germs.2C_and_steel.22" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From one of your links, I think <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6pm3he/whats_the_issue_with_jared_diamond/dkqxr1i/" target="_blank">this</a> is the best critical breakdown of his book I've seen.  It takes both Diamond and those who criticize him to task.  The fundamental problem with his book is that it's not scientific.  But that's also the fundamental problem with the criticisms of his book.  There's no scientific theory large enough to encompass his arguments.  So what's left to criticize are the individual trees while the forest gets lost.  But because it's not formally grounded in theory his thesis doesn't contribute much to a generalized understanding of human evolution either.  So what value does it have?  Well, it's stimulating idea that's worthy of more rigorous pursuit.  You have to give him that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And lets not forget that the general public doesn't read scientific papers.</p>
<p>There is a pressing social problem of racism fed by the success of Europeans and GGS provides a plausible, non-racist, theory for why that was the case.  It is necessarily an exceedingly broad topic and if Diamond was in fact an acronym for seven world leading experts in the different fields necessary to advance this theory in a scientifically rigorous and well cited/researched way the end product would be completely impenetrable and no one would read the thing.  It would be summarized in an article in the Guardian, then forgotten.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That said, most of the domain of GGS is where history literally doesn't apply. I feel like the central question of Diamond's was &quot;given people seem basically capable the world over, why did these pasty white guys from one section of it dominate so much?&quot; It's a hypothesis that is difficult to test (do you happen to have a few spare Earths with primitive humans on them to see if it keeps happening?) and rapidly loses all power once you see regular global interaction.</p>
<p>Going &quot;but Spain this, but the Aztecs that&quot; disregards that the stuff he is asking was largely set before we had a Spain, and before we had Aztecs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; by Jared Diamond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Criticizing Jared Diamond is like shooting fish in a barrel, his theories are so full of holes.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Maize vs. wheat: both grains were domesticated at about the same era, 9000 years ago. It doesn't matter how long it took before that, the fact is that 9000 years ago people in Eurasia and Americas were starting at the same stage, with a domesticated grain.</p>
</li>
<li>Domesticated animals: the lack of domesticated animals doesn't mean &quot;domesticable&quot; wild animals didn't exist. Note that turkeys, for instance, were domesticated in some regions of the Americas but not in others. Why did Americans hunt mastodons to extinction, while Eurasians domesticated elephants? There is no doubt that ancient Americans had a large set of potentially domesticable animals, they just didn't see the advantage of domesticated animals, different from Eurasians.</li>
</ol>
<p>There isn't such a strong argument for environmental causes as Diamond tried to present in his book, the true answer is probably more related to the cultural/social environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For #2: Diamond does address a large chunk of that in the book. Basically, he says that in Eurasia and Africa, humans lived for millennia with animals. As humans got better at hunting, local large animal species evolved a fear of humans and other ways to avoid them. In contrast, large animal species in Australia and the Americas lived for millennia without being threatened by human hunters, so they never evolved defenses to humans. When humans with advanced weapons sailed into Australia and crossed land bridges into Polynesia, they quickly killed almost all the local large animals, who had no defense or instincts for not getting killed by people. </p>
<p>It wasn't that ancient Eurasian and African hunters could see thousands of years into the future and think &quot;well, eventually we'll want to domesticate these guys, so maybe we shouldn't kill all of them.&quot; It was that they <em>couldn't</em> kill all of them, which later turned out to be lucky for their descendants. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't imagine anyone trying to domesticate N.A. megafauna either. The animals that were on this continent compared to Eurasia is day and night. Gigantic animals that dwarfed in comparison is completely ignored in most cases or is reduced to simply overhunting. Not to mention the ice sheet that was miles deep for many parts of the continent. I've read Diamond's book and frankly, it has more holes in it than a colander. </p></div>		</li>
