			<div class="markdown"><p>when a large amount of matter collapses due to gravity, its temperature due to gravitational collapse is often quite high.  For a time, a lot more of the early earth would have been liquid, and so these heavier elements would be free to sink within the inner, hotter layers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In planetary science, planetary differentiation is the process of separating out different constituents of a planetary body as a consequence of their physical or chemical behaviour, where the body develops into compositionally distinct layers; the denser materials of a planet sink to the center, while less dense materials rise to the surface. Such a process tends to create a core and mantle. Sometimes a chemically distinct crust forms on top of the mantle. The process of planetary differentiation has occurred on planets, dwarf planets, the asteroid 4 Vesta, and natural satellites (such as the Moon).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a water balloon half full of a heavy liquid and half full of water floating in space with no outside gravity affecting it. The heavy liquid will sit in the middle of the balloon because it is more dense. </p>
<p>Now imagine someone hitting the top inch of the balloon with a baseball bat and it explodes and maybe half of the contents of the balloon depart from the mass of liquid that remains after the hit.</p>
<p>So the balloon is the Sun, the bat is some unknown event and the droplets that escaped are the planets. As the droplets recover from the hit, most are sent flying far away, but some stay close enough to recover and merge with other droplets. Maybe some water drops combine with the heavy liquid. If that happens, well the heavy liquid becomes the center of mass. Maybe if left alone for long enough that liquid becomes solid. Planets!(TL;DR- the iron was always the core) </p></div>		</li>
