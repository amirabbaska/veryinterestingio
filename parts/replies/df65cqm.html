			<div class="markdown"><p>You remember the ball because you almost drown so it is etched in your emotional memory so you wouldn't make that mistake again. As you were disappointed by having to let go of the ball, that emotion went along for the ride. </p>
<p>Memory is changeable. Every time you remember something, you rewrite the memory. </p>
<p>I suggest you take bisque' advice and think of it as returning the ball back to the sea being happy about. </p>
<p>However, you should start thinking 'remembering' about the almost-drowning event as a pure returning the ball to the see where those people around you he'd you as you let the call go. </p>
<p>Do that once a day for a couple weeks. If you have the dream again, and the emotion has lessened, you know it is working so do it some more. Rinse and repeat until haunted dream is gone </p></div>		</li>
