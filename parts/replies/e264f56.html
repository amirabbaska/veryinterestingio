			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  I would have expected that the fish without a circadian rhythm would actually use more energy by being up all the time.  </p>
<p>What exactly do you mean by gearing up?  Just the process of waking up burns that much energy for those fish?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, pretty much. Surface-dwelling cave fish are more active during the daytime, busy hunting and what not. Under laboratory settings, this results in an uptick of about 20% in their metabolic rate (measured as oxygen consumption; see the <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0107877" target="_blank"><em>PLoS One</em> study</a>). Now, it's not the fact that they're busy that results in this <em>overall</em> increased energy use (this is controlled for in the experiment) - but rather the <em>anticipation</em> that they'll be busy. </p>
<p>In the very early hours of the morning when the fish is still relatively inactive, there's an awful lot of quite expensive upregulation of gene expression and enzymes involved in energy metabolism, digestion and other physiological processes - to make sure there's plenty ready for when the fishy is hungry. This anticipatory cost, controlled by the circadian cycle, remains fairly constant day-to-day regardless of whether it's 'all utilised' - like a baker baking the same number of loaves every morning, whether customers buy them or not.</p>
<p>Under conditions of perpetual darkness, there isn't this surge of anticipatory production at any point - the fish just runs continually on a lower default setting. The baker is baking every hour, and only enough to replace what peeps have just bought, so overall the process is more efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. There's even a cortisol spike (and other glucocorticoids) just as you're waking up. In fact waking up is one of the most stressful things most of us experience on a daily basis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But they aren’t up all the time. They catch sleep quickly in small amounts. This seems highly physically advantageous to pre-set large chunks of off/on time. Intuitively, if you’ve just run a marathon, you sleep 10 hours and are back to 100%; if you’ve just run a 5k you sleep 4 hours to return to 100%; if you’re just lazing around and barely moving then you can go 36 hours before wanting to sleep to recover energy. Obviously the scenarios and numbers I’ve listed are baseless, but that point is: why can’t we sleep to return to 100% rest whenever we want? Out circadian rhythm means for the most part, whether we’ve run a marathon or done nothing all day, for the most part we still fall asleep that night, in a way putting off recovery until later when logically it would make the most sense to recover immediately afterward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im kinda drunk, so I’m not gonna find sources, but I thought there were studies on people where they sleep 3-4 hours with several 30 minute naps throughout the 24 hour day, as opposed to the ~8 hour sleeping cycle and after a while their bodies grew used to it and as a result were more rested at all waking periods because their bodies would put them into REM immediately during their 4 hour sleeping period. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, we can't because that's the way we've evolved(obviously). I probably out of my depth in this discussion, but I think the circadean rythm is more efficient in pratical situations. Before electric lighting was invented, you couldn't really do too many productive things at night. Better spend the dark time recovering and use the daytime for hunting, gathering, etc. </p>
<p>I'm sure it would be beneficial to fully control our sleep rythm. Like many things with evolution, what we have isn't the perfect solution - but it's <strong>good enough</strong>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a recent study that found that jellyfish, which don't have a brain, appear to sleep. On the other hand I would assume filter feeding animals like sponges and coral don't sleep. Or perhaps it would make more sense to say that they are never awake.</p></div>		</li>
