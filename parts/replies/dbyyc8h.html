			<div class="markdown"><p>It completely depends on the type of glass used. Glass with iron in it will appear green in mirrors and when turned on edge. This is one of the cheapest kinds of glass, and is fairly common. But there is glass with yellow hues, blue, and really any shade is possible. The shade comes from impurities, and you can purposefully introduce impurities if you're after a specific shade. Or if you're after exceptionally transparent glass, that too is possible.</p>
<p>Vsauce might be entertaining, but don't take his word as gospel. That video was very misleading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what he is asking. He's asking why do we THINK of mirrors as being silver in colour. As in why do we draw them as silver when they're not reflecting things? Or in video games when they don't function? They usually default to a silver-whitish colour. </p>
<p>He's asking a cultural question... not scientific. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconded- and the answer is because historically mirrors are a pane of glass backed with silver, and before that, polished silver</p></div>		</li>
