			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a wavefront of light entering a medium where it travels slower, and imagine it entering at an angle.  The part that enters first slows down first, while the outer part travels fast for longer.  It's sort of like having a small wheel on one side of your car and a large wheel on the other - it causes the direction to turn.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the link! A few of my friends have shown me similar animations to illustrate the bending, but I can't really wrap my head around it. Treating a column of light as a rigid object that changes direction based on the speeds of its boundaries makes me uncomfortable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another wat to look at it is that light travels the path of the shortest time. Like in the example with the lifeguard that needs to rescue  someone at sea. The fastest path is to run a certain distance at the beach and swim the rest. Same goes for light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does fluid or gas density play a big role? Or is it more attributed to the absorptivity and reactivity of the partials (materials)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The density of a fluid is much higher than that of a gas, so it bends light more, but the principle is the same. </p>
<p>Refractive indices of mediums tend to increase with something called permeability, which is the energy it takes to form electric and magnetic fields within the medium. I would assume that because the reactivity of a compound is related to how much stability each particle gains after some change to its internal electromagnetic field (like forming a bond), it would be related to its permeability, but I don't know enough about the topic to give you a definitive answer. </p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p></div>		</li>
