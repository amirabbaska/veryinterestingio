			<div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear Deterrent submarines, aka Trident/Boomers go out on deployment on a rotating schedule and location. Usually a large cube of ocean in which to hide. We will sit out there for several months with minimal contact with the rest of the world. When another boat comes to relieve the current boat patrol area the boat returns to port for crew turnover, repairs, preventive maintenance and upgrades, and then it is back out into the deep blue. No foreign ports, minimum communication with family, the only entertainment available is what you could bring with you or could burn a flick on the mess decks. No internet (sometimes emails are okay, but is unreliable and thoroughly vetted). On my boat we put together a small LAN and had Quake tourneys, and shared a bunch of DVDs. That kind of isolation isn't easy. So to keep true to the mission, for the safety of the crews and the rest of the world the ship has two crews that alternate their watch. While one crew is out to sea the other crew enters a training period.  Off crew was nice, it was a temporary sea duty while our brothers, and now sisters, stand their watch. The dual crews are called Blue and Gold respectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, My personal experience would tend to directly contradict yours. Former USS MARLYAND (SSBN 738 GOLD) sailor here, and the only times I've ever felt rolls not actually on the surface, was at periscope depth. I have felt very minor 'sway' I guess (which would probably be something like a 5 degree roll maybe?
basically you could see the liquid slow creep up one side, then the other, of your glass on the mess deck) submerged during a tropical storm, but it wasn't even close to enough to make me nauseous, and I'm pretty prone to seasickness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is very interesting. I have experienced some very funky wave forms during my time as a ship's navigation officer on cargo ships, and I am jealous of your ability to just ballast down below the surface and ride perfectly. 35 degree rolls and pounding hard enough to snap radio antennas off is not fun. We could save so much fuel, and the crew comfort would be amazing. Just need several hundred millions of dollars in modifications...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The downside to subs is you absolutely get those 35 degree (or more) rolls on the surface because without a keel you're basically a cigar in the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wanted to be in the Navy's nuclear program. It was not that big of a price to pay in my opinion.</p>
<p>It's only a factor in rough seas, and I was a submariner, so it was even less of an issue since at anything below a hundred feet you barely feel a thing. I probably was seasick around 5 times total in the Navy, and of those probably only 2 were <em>really</em> bad, and I was on patrol 7 times, each for around 45-80 days, and 3 other times on brief shakedown cruises that lasted a few days each.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there were a lot of studies. You &quot;could&quot; roll if you had enough force on the sub, but it would be an unimaginable amount and it would have to be continuous. Something that would almost be non-existent on this planet.</p>
<p>However, the worst case I know of is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Hartford_and_USS_New_Orleans_collision" target="_blank">USS Hartford LA Class Sub</a>. It was run over by the USS New Orleans (an Amphibious landing craft ship, a big ship). The New Orleans hit the sub almost exactly broadside and mostly on the sail (the little tower where the periscope is kept). That created the biggest moment arm the sub could have experienced.</p>
<p>The official account said the sub rolled about 85 degrees to starboard. The collision extensively damaged both vessels, nearly tearing the sail off the submarine. However, the nuclear and engine components of the sub were unscathed and logs and analysis later on showed the nuclear reactor didn't do so much as hiccup during the event.</p>
<p>That collision happened while I was still an officer in the sub community and it was terrifying to hear the &quot;black box&quot; recording of the event. It's all normal watch sounds and then BOOM! and a lot of screaming while people fall from one side of the ship to the other. And the crunching metal sounds... ugg. It was like listening to a nightmare. I can't imagine what it was like to live it.</p>
<p>Okay, but in theory, if the sub rolled all the way over, the ballast in the bottom, which is mostly tons and tons of bolted on lead, would almost immediately right the submarine. It would unlikely be a &quot;mud dart&quot;. The crew would hurt, lots of shit would fall everywhere, water tanks would drain out their vent holes and get water over everything, but the submarine itself would be righted almost immediately. </p>
<p>Think of this experiment, take a sealed pipe that floats. Put it in a water. If you roll it on the long axis it'll roll for a while. Now, bolt a little weight to one side. The weight will always want to hang at the bottom, so it'll always impart a righting moment to the pipe. If you spin the pipe so the weight is on top, the weight will still roll the pipe over and the weight will still end up at the bottom of the pipe. That's effectively a submarine. They are designed to right themselves immediately if rolled over. </p>
<p>If it went completely over, water in boilers, condensers, and the reactor could get messed up badly, which would cause the reactor to shut down, but that can be pretty quickly recovered once the boat ends back up at a mostly upright angle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A regular ship would sink when it rolls because at some point, water would come over the side of the ship. A sub is already submerged, has no side railing and won't take on water that way.</p>
<p>BUT, a sub has lots of electrical, possibly nuclear and surely chemical bits. Batteries could leak when turned upside-down. Diesel.generators would likely fail as they're not supposed to work upside-down. A reactor? No idea, but it also comes with pumps and stuff that might be allergic to being flipped over. So the machinery might be damaged. but the sub would not sink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The air chambers that keep the submarine bouyant are open on the bottom. If the boat flipped upside down, the air would leak out with nothing to stop it, and yes, the sub would sink.</p></div>		</li>
