			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually pick good stuff up from the curb on trash day specifically to donate for the tax write off.  Plant stands, working printers, wine racks, ironing boards (weirdly common), small pieces of furniture, aquariums, vacuums, all kinds of stuff.  I check the electric things and make sure they work first and take them down to the local thrift shops about once a month.</p>
<p>I try to be fair. Most people put things out the night before and I give it until the morning so everyone gets a chance before I scoop up for donations.</p>
<p>I did keep the 90-year-old sewing machine, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't sound legal to claim deductions on that. To deduct I believe you need to show that you donated a certain amount/percentage of your income. Donating items you received for free and writing them off doesn't make legal sense as the point of tax write offs is to give some relief to those giving away part of their income. You're not losing any income donating property you didn't pay for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I <em>think</em> you're mostly right, though not for the right reason.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6leunc/eli5_how_do_rich_people_use_donations_as_tax/djue30c/" target="_blank">another comment</a>, I posted a fairly long analysis of why, at least by my reading of the IRS pubs, if you buy something at a yard sale for 25 cents and then donate it within a year, your deduction will be limited to 25 cents.</p>
<p>In short: The IRS has a rule that generally limits the amount of a deduction to your &quot;basis&quot; in the property if you've held the property for less than a year, and your basis in something you buy for 25 cents will generally be 25 cents.</p>
<p>So -- if you pick up abandoned junk, what's your basis? I actually couldn't find anything explicit about this, which surprised me, so <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/6lk5bu/whats_the_basis_of_foundabandoned_property/" target="_blank">I asked over on /r/tax/</a>. That post has only been up for a short time, but there's one reply saying that your basis is $0 in that property. If true, that would limit your deduction to... $0.</p>
<p>If you hold the property for more than a year, this limit goes away and you can deduct full market value.</p>
<p>But I doubt /u/scoby-dew is picking stuff up on trash day to put in his or her attic for a year and <em>then</em> donating it, which means that, at least from what I can tell [IANA CPA, etc., but I read IRS pubs for fun so take what you will], taking the deduction in this case is incorrect and should be disallowed if the IRS were to audit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So lets turn this around, lets say I spend every weekend for 2 months going to garage sales, and spend 1000$ buying good quality clothes by the bag full for lets say .25 a piece (End of the day, I'll take it all off your hands for a quarter a peice). thats 4000 pieces of good quality clothes. </p>
<p>Using the good will donation guide <a href="https://goodwillnne.org/donate/donation-value-guide/" target="_blank">https://goodwillnne.org/donate/donation-value-guide/</a> we can average cloth donation value to between 3-9$ so lets be generous on the low end and say 5$ an item.</p>
<p>4000x5 = 20000$ in deductions. </p>
<p>so if I donate 400$ worth of goods twice a week for 25 weeks. I could deduct 20000$ worth of income from my taxes?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you store the clothes for more than a year: yes. If you do not: no.</p>
<p>(and cc /u/notaMech because you explicitly asked about this in another reply.)</p>
<p>IANA CPA, lawyer, etc., but I have spent an inordinate amount of time reading IRS publications for fun, because I have some kind of mental illness that's not listed in the DSM. :-)</p>
<p>First I have to define a couple terms and explain some tax stuff in case anyone is unfamiliar. See the <strong>TL;DR</strong>s before each hrule if you don't want to read all of it.</p>
<hr />
<p>The first term is &quot;basis.&quot; Your <em>basis</em> in a piece of property is a measure of the tax-relevant value of that property. If you sell something above your basis, you've realized a gain and may need to pay taxes on the gain. If you sell something <em>below</em> your basis, you've realized a loss and may be able to claim the loss as a deduction.</p>
<p>(Not really relevant for this discussion: The reason the IRS uses a dedicated term &quot;basis&quot; instead of just saying &quot;your cost&quot; is because (1) it handles scenarios where you didn't actually buy it (e.g. it was a gift or inheritance) and (2) there are some things other than purchase price that can change your basis. For example, if you put an addition onto your house, the cost of that addition will likely be added to your basis. Basically, that improvement is counted as part of your house's price even though you paid for it at a separate time. There are other things that can make you reduce your basis. Again, this isn't really relevant here.)</p>
<p>(Another side note: incidentally, these things put together show why yard sales basically never would have any tax implications even if you were 100% a stickler. You virtually never sell something for more than you pay, meaning you take a loss on everything, meaning no tax is owed. However, basically everything you are selling is &quot;personal use property&quot;, which you're not allowed to claim a loss on, so you don't get a deduction either.)</p>
<p>When you buy something, generally your basis in that thing is the price you paid, plus transaction costs (like shipping).</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: If you buy a shirt for 25 cents, your basis in the shirt is 25 cents.</p>
<p>^(Relevant IRS publication: <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p551.pdf" target="_blank">Pub 551</a>)</p>
<hr />
<p>The second and third terms are &quot;ordinary income property&quot; and &quot;capital income property&quot;.</p>
<p>Suppose you sell something at a gain, e.g. you paid $100 for something and sell it for $500. You will owe <em>capital gains tax</em> on the $400 difference between the sale price and your basis. However, there are a few different possible kinds of capital gains tax you might owe. For a shirt (expensive shirt) and most other yard sale stuff, I <em>think</em> the two possibilities are the usual short-term and long-term capital gains taxes. Short-term capital gains are taxed exactly the same as ordinary income -- so in the example, it's like you made $400 more at your job. (Exception: social security and medicare tax aren't owed on capital gains, but that's not really relevant in this discussion.) <em>Long</em>-term gains are taxed at a favorable rate. (This is the government trying to encourage investing.) If you are in the 10% or 15% ordinary income bracket, your capital gains rate is 0%; if you're in anything below the 39.5% ordinary income bracket, your capital gains rate is 15%; if you're in the top bracket, it's 20%. (I'm ignoring the Obamacare NIIT in these.) You have long-term gains if you owned the property for more than a year; short-term gains are a year or less.</p>
<p>Something you are donating is called &quot;ordinary income property&quot; if you would owe short-term capital gains rates (equal to ordinary income rates) had you instead sold it at a profit. Something you are donating is called &quot;capital income property&quot; if you would owe long-term capital gains rates.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: If you stored the purchases you made at a yard sale for more than a year and <em>then</em> donated them, it's capital income property. If you donated them soon after buying, the stuff is ordinary income property.</p>
<p>^(This analysis is the part I'm most shaky with. Relevant IRS publications: <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p544.pdf" target="_blank">Pub 544</a>, and less so <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p550.pdf" target="_blank">Pub 550 ch 4</a>)</p>
<hr />
<p>OK, now we can get to the rule:</p>
<p><strong>When you donate ordinary income property, your deduction is [generally] limited by your basis.</strong></p>
<p>^(The [generally] is there because the exact formulation is more complicated, but it's equivalent in normal situations. The IRS even tosses a &quot;Generally, this rule limits the deduction to your basis in the property&quot; line <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p526.pdf" target="_blank">in Pub 526</a>, the publication describing the charitable deduction.)</p>
<p>So, the overall <strong>TL;DR</strong> is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you buy a shirt for 25 cents, your basis is 25 cents, and</li>
<li>If you donate it a year or less from when you bought it, it's ordinary income property; thus,</li>
<li>By the above rule, your deduction is limited to 25 cents in this scenario</li>
</ul>
<p>This rule does not appear to apply if you are donating capital income property. In that case, the deduction you can claim is generally the fair market value. (FMV limits the donation in the ordinary income property case as well.) So hold it for more than a year =&gt; it becomes capital income property =&gt; your deduction is the FMV of $5 or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To support the donation you would need to have a donation receipt from the charity to support the amount donated and the receipt must include the registered charity number.  Since donation receipts are effectively revenue to a charity, it is unlikely they would over-inflate the value of donated goods received by the amounts you're proposing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My parents did this too and Goodwill never put a value on the receipt, they left it blank and my parents could fill it in themselves. My parents could possibly get $50 for a huge bag of used kids clothing if they spent the time to wash, sort, and advertise the clothes. But you could also claim that $50 as a donation and then save all that time, using it for other things. Rich people just do the same thing at a larger scale. </p></div>		</li>
