			<div class="markdown"><p>The Left is the safest place because of that. People merging Right look right at the left part of the Right lane. Just a quick glance will catch a cars fender but a motorcycle in the middle has often been missed.  Also the middle is where most of the cars oils drop. Especially when it rains that all comes up and is dangerous and smelly. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not as obvious until you get a light rain but the middle can be slick as snot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also because if there's a rock or other debris on the road, the car in front will typically avoid hitting it with its tires, so I always tracked behind their tire line.  If something is in the road, they usually swerve, giving a sign that something's up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bikers are also taught to ride in a <a href="http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/handbook/motorcycles/section5-16-0.shtml" target="_blank">Staggered Formation</a> if they're riding with others.</p>
<p>People who group ride regularly may become more comfortable hugging a particular side of the lane.</p>
<p>Also, I tend to hug the side of the lane furthest from other vehicles to give me more time to react should someone decide to change lanes suddenly.</p>
<p>I also telegraph lane changes by hugging one side of the lane and signaling as I do the &quot;over the shoulder&quot; check.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't the most complete truth though. The motorcycle will grip better to the tire treads of the previous cars, and there is more likely to be fluid spilled in the middle. Thus they drive essentially in where a cars tire would be </p></div>		</li>

<p>Right is right, so I ride in the right wheel track, more grip, closer to centre of road to give me a buffer from danger.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Oil = death, I try not to ride in middle where oil drips</p>
<p>Left = death, I try not to ride where idiots will open doors into me (Australian - left is death)</p>
<p>Left = pedestrians,dogs, kangaroos, gravel all things I do not like when riding.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Riding on the road is a lot different from track riding or thrill seekers on youtube. It is 99% trying not to die.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>There are still dangers in the right wheel track, but I watch for those like a hawk.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another point, oncoming traffic can see you better if you're on the right side of the lane if you're in the centre of the lane or on the left (reverse these for Americans) you might be obscured behind the vehicle in front and an oncoming car might go to turn into a driveway/side street assuming that behind the car is clear. Even though there should be several seconds in which they can see you before they make their turn (unless you're following insanely close) if they have already assumed that the road is clear they could look straight at you and not notice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best answer. Not just fluid, other stuff as well. stay in the tire tracks. I once pulled up to a toll booth, and was between the tire tracks, it was total greasy sludge about an inch deep, I came close to dropping the bike</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its amazing how little oil is needed to do this. also because all the oil drips more at the intersections/stops, so don't want to brake in that funk. </p></div>		</li>
