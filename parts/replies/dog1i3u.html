			<div class="markdown"><p>The total energy released in gravitational waves was likely greater than about 2% of the sun's rest mass. That's a huge amount of equivalent energy ... equivalent (E=mc^2) to more 10 times that seen in a normal supernova. There have been theoretical predictions for black-hole mergers - if they gave a disk of material sitting there (effectively cold and dead) thee disk might be perturbed by this energy release and fall onto the merger remnant (massive black hole) and may give electromagnetic radiation. </p>
<p>If rocky planets exist around neutron stars (and they have been seen) they are probably too dense for even this energy to perturb their internal structure. They would probably remain intact. </p>
<p>On the BH horizon - first of all we need to work out what was left over. The best guess it that it is a black hole, but that remains unconfirmed. Better estimates of exactly what was ejected (above the event horizon) and what was swallowed (below the horizon) will come out when all the data are analysed carefully by the theorists. </p>
<p>Bear in mind, it is just in the last few hours that everyone has seen all the data - will keep the theoretical astrophysicists busy for several years ! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravitational waves are actually very weak, and so you need to be very close to the source before they had too much of an effect on you. In particular, for planets that had been anywhere near this system, they would likely have been destroyed or thrown out from the system, either in the supernovae that formed the neutron stars, or as the neutron stars spiralled together. So certainly, you wouldn't have wanted to be anywhere near this system, but not necessarily because of the gravitational waves. </p></div>		</li>
