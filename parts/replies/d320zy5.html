			<div class="markdown"><p>But. Womens pee doesn't do that, we still have a urethra, so it should do the same. </p>
<p>I found this...</p>
<p>&quot;The spongy urethra runs along the length of the penis on its ventral (underneath) surface.... This produces a spiral stream of urine and has the effect of cleaning the external urethral meatus. The lack of an equivalent mechanism in the female urethra partly explains why urinary tract infections occur so much more frequently in females.&quot;

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4egt3z/what_are_lesser_known_biological_differences/d208yu1" target="_blank">This comment</a> says it's due to the navicular fossa which is the <em>&quot;spongy part of the male urethra located at the glans penis portion. It is essentially the part right before the external urethral orifice&quot;</em> (which obviously relates to your link &quot;spongy urethra&quot;).   </p>
<p>Of course both males and females have urethras. The difference is the physical shape of the exit point.  </p>
<p>And by the way, where are the sources for that last statement about UTIs? I have always learned that females have more frequent UTIs because the female urethra is much shorter and because it is very close to the anus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've also heard the same thing.. One reason we're more prone to UTIs is bc our pee doesn't spiral. I've always equated it to the same idea as when the waiter twists the wine bottle at the end of a pour. Without that rotation, you'll get more drips. Supposedly, if you wipe back-to-front instead of front-to-back, you'll also be more prone to UTIs. Bathing habits (i.e.  bathing in dirty tubs or not bathing frequently enough) can also impact prevalence of UTIs. </p>
<p>TLDR; Spiral urine streams are where it's at. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a common theory but, in my opinion, it doesn't truly explain it. UTIs only become common in women after 16-18. If the short urethra was the cause, girls would have a more even rate of UTIs throughout their lifetime, in fact, UTIs might be more common in children as their urethras are shorter than adults. Furthermore, it does not explain why the rate of UTIs is higher in male than female neonates. Epidemiological studies seem to indicate that sex is the primary risk factor and genital hygiene plays a roll (lots of folds and crevices in a warm, moist environment, perfect for bacteria). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh god thank you. I came to this thread expecting a sea of &quot;wat&quot; instead found a bunch of agreement, and was utterly bewildered that my own pee does not spiral. You saved me hours of paranoia that maybe I've been&quot;doing it wrong&quot; my whole life! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not pronouced how you think though, it's spoken as &quot;Me, <em>ate</em>, us&quot;. It's also hardly unique to the penis, you're body has dozens of them. You have a nasal meatus, and esophageal meatus, an inferior meatus, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is a good answer, it is mainly due to the navicular fossa. The shape is not a slit but a bulb, which causes the stream to spin. This is only present in males, females do not have a spin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of fluid physics. If it flows through a bulb it will follow that shape and create a spiral. If it just flows out of a straight tube it's not going (or at least is extremely unlikely) to create spin. I also think this because it is how it's explained in biology.</p>
<p><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0047133" target="_blank">This paper</a> seems to do more with basic physics, but physics is affected by the shape of the container.</p>
<p>Females essentially act as a negative control to support this.</p></div>		</li>
