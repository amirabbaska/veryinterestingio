			<div class="markdown"><p>Some facts, some not. Head is not the main heating element of the body, in comparison, cooling down any limb will do the same effect as cooling your head. Face has other mechanisms that help you feel cooler, it has good circulation near the skin but that is mostly the effect: a feeling. I suggest for next heatwave, get yourself a tube bandana. Keep it wet and try different parts of your body, where does it cool you and the result is : armpits, back of your knee, anywhere that major arteries are close to surface and they are way, way more effective than using it in your head.. I mean, the difference is: in your head, you feel cool but need to add more water and keep the bandana cool. Use it on the back of knee, around the neck and in about 20 minutes, you are shivering.. Cooling down the main bulk of the liquid, your blood does not create the satisfying feeling of coolness, it just drops your core temperature.</p>
<p>Cool water on face has also an effect, mammalian something response (can't remember now..) that slows down your heart rate, there are evolutionary benefits to it (if submerged, we use less oxygen. we can trigger this by submerging our face in cold water, this same effect is behind a lot of the feeling of relief when cooling your face, stress is reduced, blood pressure drops, endorfins released, all to make us feel less discomfort and make us relax, which helps a lot on how we feel.. ;) )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe there is the additional effect that your head acts as a thermostat for your body. It is why when you have a fever you get the chills even though your body is very hot in general. The reason is because your body isn't cold, but your head is so hot your body feels cold to it. (and also why its both bad and dangerous to try to counter the chills by warming the body further rather then by trying to cool down the head)</p>
<p>In this context in a cool room you will feel hotter under the blanket while still maintaining a comfortable temperature. In a hot room though under the blanket is physically hotter, but feels cooler, so you get far less benefit but much more of the physical responses like sweating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why our face is hotter is due to the bloodvessels being close to surface. But as a volume of liquid, it is tiny. You are most likely right on that it is one part of body that is sensitive and our body can use it as thermostat but it isn't the major heat regulator. As effective as your hand or chest of equal area. Psychosomatic response is also something to belittle, how we feel affects a lot how our bodies actually function. Feeling cool slows down heartrate and metabolism, which in turn slows down heating.</p>
<p>Our head is also the most exposed at the majority of the time, one more argument for heat sensing and thus more effective to control our other responses. It has been handy way for our bodies for most of our life to use our heads like that.. Quite sure that if you had your buttocks exposed instead of your head your whole life, your ass would be the major regulator and handle most of sensing.</p>
<p>This is one of those myths that have just handle of truth but when we look at it using science; how heavy the head is, what volume it has, what surface area and compare to other parts of the body, we find that there is no strong difference on your core temperature. But what does make HUGE difference really is to bring the coldness as close to your bloodstream as possible. Cooling your major arteries is REALLY effective way of actually cooling you down. The funny thing is, after you have cooled, it starts to feel really hot quite soon and applying moisture to your face helps; you are not hot yet but your bodytemperature is getting hotter than it was just moments ago.. It passes but cooling your face really feels great.. Oh, i also take 92C sauna twice a week, if that makes any difference, at least i got a LOT of experience on heating my core up and then cooling it down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I knew about the main artery thing from playing soccer (learned to put ice cubes on our necks/wrists when overheating) but felt it wouldn't have been an ELI5-tier explanation. I just know our head's comfort tends to guide our overall comfort</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I keep my head and feet out of blankets usually, but everything else covered including hands. If my feet are under a blanket, it feels a THOUSAND DEGREES. If my head and feet are both under a blanket it feels A MILLION DEGREES.</p>
<p>But feet out, head out, it's perfect.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Without getting into the science behind it, your head is the main body part that regulates body temperature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You really <em>should</em> get into the science behind it, because that statement just <a href="http://www.livescience.com/34411-body-heat-loss-head.html" target="_blank">isn't true</a>. The research that created that line of thinking has been supplanted.</p>
<p>The great thing about science is that it tosses out accepted &quot;truths&quot; as new information becomes available.</p></div>		</li>
