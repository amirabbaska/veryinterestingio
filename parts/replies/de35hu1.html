			<div class="markdown"><p>We would have to measure the atmospheres (attempts are in progress) to get a better temperature estimate. <a href="http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog" target="_blank">Here is a collection of good candidates</a>, the TRAPPIST-1 planets are not included in the lists yet. Proxima Centauri b will be hard to beat, but expect 2-3 of the new planets to appear in the upper list.</p>
<p>Edit: They got added to the list, and exactly as predicted. 3 in (e,f,g), with the best one (e) behind Proxima Centauri b.</p></div>		</li>

Proxima Centauri is more active (stellar flares, varying intensity of the star), if that is taken into account it gets more interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would we go about measuring atmospheres? Sorry if I seem uneducated, but to determine something like that from so far away... how would it be done? Thanks!</p>
<p>E: Thanks everyone for the great answers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a word, spectroscopy. All atoms and molecules emit electromagnetic radiation at characteristic frequencies, we call them emission spectra. If we can manage to not be blinded by the light from the star (because the star is FAR brighter than the planet), we can measure the composition of the atmosphere of an exoplanet by taking the light we see reflected off it and putting it into a spectrograph and seeing which lines are present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spectography. Basically, you split up light into its constituent wavelengths and look at it. When you look at the spectrum of light you're getting from a black body (basically, an object whose illumination is produced by the energy it is radiating into space), it will appear to be relatively continuous (well, it follows a set curve depending on temperature), but there will be what are known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_lines" target="_blank">Fraunhofer lines</a>, which are caused by photons being selectively absorbed during their journey. Different atoms and molecules absorb photons at different wavelengths. You can determine what elements are in an atmosphere by looking for these lines.</p>
<p>It is easier with an object like the Sun, which produces virtually all of its visible spectrum via blackbody radiation; objects like planets will both reflect light from their star off their surface <em>and</em> emit blackbody radiation, which can make things a bit trickier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the planet passes in front of the star, the atmosphere will absorb some of the light from the star. We can detect these absorption lines and figure out what chemicals are present in the atmosphere, and even their relative concentration.</p></div>		</li>
