			<div class="markdown"><p>To branch off from this, if we assume that there are 3 generations per 100 years (most likely an underestimate). Neanderthals went extinct roughly 40,000 years ago.
So, there have been 1,200 generations since then. There are 2^1200 unique trees branching off (the meaningful ‘uniqueness’ is gender). So that means <strong>1/(2^1200)%</strong> of the offspring has an unbroken maternal line.
This doesn’t represent the chance of having Neanderthal mItochondrial DNA only an unbroken maternal line for one individual.</p>
<p>While there are some pretty important generalizations within this argument (we’re looking at one individuals offspring and were ignoring that the mates of their offspring could introduce Neanderthal genes), the probability of an unbroken maternal line is so staggeringly small that it is improbable to find Neanderthal DNA.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That sounds very convincing.<br />
On the other hand it's obvious that <em>every</em> human on earth has an unbroken maternal line. </p></div>		</li>
