			<div class="markdown"><p>This could be it. Dimmer switches are essentially voltage dividers which means there's a resistive metal coil and a lead that presses against it whose position along the coil is controlled by the dimmer switch. The quality of this contact is often poor (because it's just pressing two pieces of metal together rather than a solid solder joint). This can produce considerable electrical noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. Dimmer switches do <em>not</em> divide voltage, instead they turn it on and off. The circuitry is usually controlled by a voltage divider which has its imperfections. But the major interference happens when the circuit cuts power on and off rapidly. </p>
<p>One example would be 120 times a second, each time the AC power would switch between + and - polarities, it is interrupted for a certain amount of time. This is slow enough old-style incandescents will flicker and vibrate in response to it. With LED bulbs you can see the switching on/off happen and perceive it as flickering. Fluorescents hate this and can die quickly. </p>
<p>Or, it could happen more rapidly, interrupting as many as thousands of times every second. The second method creates less visible flickering or buzzing from lights. They don't have time to cool down and stop glowing, nor to physically move in response to the change. But the higher frequencies involved are more likely to interfere with radio signals. </p>
<p>The device you describe (to the extent they're ever used) would be a &quot;Variac&quot; or variable transformer. These are expensive, but they're used in recording studios and similar places because they <strong>don't</strong> produce <em>as much</em> interference, despite the imperfections you mentioned. A simple resistor is rarely used, as it would eat a lot of power and wastefully heat up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair enough. The cartoon picture in my mind was indeed the Variac.</p></div>		</li>
