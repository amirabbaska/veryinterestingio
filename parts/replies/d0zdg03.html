<p>Basically just get a computer to continue this for a long time. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The longer you loop the series the more accurate it is.
4-4/3-4/5 is 3.466 which is not exactly close to Pi. 4-4/3-4/5-4/7-4/9 is 3.339 which is already closer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Define &quot;needed&quot;. There are calculations that require pi to arbitrarily high precision, either because the goal is to compute some extremely large or small number, or because the numerical algorithm one uses is ill-conditioned. For example, some integer relation searches require tens of thousands of digits of pi. In the complex analytic method to compute class polynomials, which can be used to certify that elliptic curves have suitable properties for cryptography, one also needs pi to thousands of digits. Computer algebra systems may be using thousands of digits behind the scenes when you input a simple formula to evaluate, without you even noticing.</p>
<p>I might hold the record for the largest number of digits of pi ever used to compute some other object: I needed over 11 billion digits to determine the exact value of p(10^20 ), the number of partitions of 10^20. Of course p(10^20 ) is just an arbitrary number that served no purpose to compute other than (just like pi itself) checking that such a computation was possible, so this was not &quot;needed&quot;. But the point is that you need all those 11 billion digits, just to determine whether the number of partitions is 10^20 is odd or even.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Planck length is the smallest length with any meaning, where classical gravity / space-time cease to give sensible numbers and we should instead use a quantum theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is assuming that you're restricting our pi usage to physical measurements and calculations. There are definitely some algorithms that are purely for mathematical considerations that use far, far more digits of pi than 60.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, Quantum effects begin to appear at nanometre scales, and govern pretty much everything that happens at sub-nanometre scales. Planck scales are the scales at which it's no longer possible to perform measurements of both momentum and position with any amount of accuracy.</p></div>		</li>
