			<div class="markdown"><p>As an 'about to become an expert' (or hope so), the blood that needs to be 'pushed' by contracting muscles is in the veins and this blood is the blood that does not contain oxygen and nor much of the 'nutrients' you are referring to as it has lost it in tissue fluid back when it was in the arterioles and capillaries. So I don't think it feels better because of the 'nutrients' getting into the tissue fluid in those parts of the body. But the blood in veins does have some proteins called plasma proteins.</p></div>		</li>
