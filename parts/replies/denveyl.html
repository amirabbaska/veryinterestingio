			<div class="markdown"><p>Heidi here: For me, it was staying 'in bounds'. It was 2 days to cross the Drake Passage, which is a long time for those of us who get sea sick easily. We got to our first landing on Half Moon Island, all of us eager to step onto an Antarctic Island. There were penguins - everywhere. We could walk amongst them. But...as a scientist/explorer, I wanted to walk over the hill and see what was on the other side. So, I did. Then, I, the social scientist and physicist with me chose to walk up that shoreline to peak around cliff. A gentle voice  from one of the Argentinian guides asked us to return back to the area where we needed to be. In an icy land that was so inspiring and so different than where I'd been before, I wanted to learn as much as possible. I began each landing thereafter by asking where I could go, then often asking for an exception to go to one area, closer to a glacier or up a hillside, that was just beyond that area. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, it was having no down time/alone time. With the exception of our shore landings, there were 76+ of us crammed together every minute of every day on a relatively small ship for 3 solid weeks. As someone who lives alone, the constant togetherness and constant noise was a bit overwhelming and exhausting. I really do love people and love connecting with others - especially connecting with so many amazing women who are scientists - but the complete lack of alone time and down time was probably the biggest challenge for me. (That being said, I ADORE all of the women I shared this experience with! ) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, it was one of the challenges central to many working women - It was the challenge of being away from family. I've travelled a fair bit and worked in remote places before, but it was the first trip away as a mum. I couldn't just pop home if my kid broke out in a rash. It was tough.</p></div>		</li>
