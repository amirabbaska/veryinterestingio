			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually that is only partially true. You can still read scrambled words if they retain the general shape of the original word. If you intentionally butcher the shape then even if the first and last letters are the same you'll have difficulty reading. Long words are affected much more.</p>
<p>Let me try writing that paragraph again.</p>
<p>Adrniccog to raeercschh at Cbgdmiare Utiienrsvy it dsneo't meattr in waht oedrr the lrttees in a wrod are, the olny intemorpt tihng is the fsrit and lsat lteetr be at the rhgit pcale. The rset can ve a ttaol mses and you can slitl raed it whuitot a pelborm.</p>
<p>It's still understandable since many words don't change but it's much harder to understand when the shape isn't there (at least for me).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't like this example. Most of the words aren't that mixed up (e.g. &quot;wouthit&quot; is &quot;without&quot; and maintains the &quot;th&quot; and &quot;out&quot; we expect in the word, &quot;bridge&quot; remains almost entirely intact in &quot;Cmabrigde,&quot; not to mention the Ts staying together in &quot;mttaer&quot; and &quot;ltteers&quot;) Many of the other words are only 3, 4, or 5 letters long. Following the rules of leaving the first and last letters in the correct place limits the number of letters available to mix up to just 2 or 3 for most words.</p>

<p>is incomprehensible, because now every word is truly scrambled, with the first and last letters being an insignificant proportion of the total. So sorry all of you that thought you had academic backing to your poor spelling and grammar skills. They do matter, because baseball players performing similarly absolutely deserve comparable treatment.</p>
