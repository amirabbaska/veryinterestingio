			<div class="markdown"><p>I do both. Sometimes I'm slap happy (but I have no filter left to not say things I'm thinking). Sometimes I'm grumpy (but I do have a filter left but all it can do is just not say anything). </p>
<p>The two different tiredness feels differently. I think I tend to be slap happy when I'm tired from a long exhausting day physically and grumpy when I'm tired cause lack of sleep/mentally exhausting day/just tired cause it's that time.</p></div>		</li>
