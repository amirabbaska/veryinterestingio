			<div class="markdown"><p>The main advantage of timekeeping technology for smartphones is that any stable clock is also a precise frequency reference. In smartphones, the advantages are mainly for radio communication and for navigation via the global positioning system (GPS).
Imagine that your smartphone is trying to download a document over airport wifi at the same time as thousands of other people. To prevent the signals interfering, it has to keep precisely tuned to the frequency of the transmitter. Present-day smartphones have quartz crystal clocks to provide the reference frequency they need. A more accurate clock could let more phones use the same network, and keep track of weaker signals.
For GPS, all the users are downloading the same signal, so the problem is different. The challenge here is that the signal is extremely weak - roughly equivalent to one light bulb illuminating an entire continent. A stable clock lets the user look for this tiny signal in the narrowest possible frequency range, where it is most likely to be found.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>after everyone has an atomic clock on their phone, couldn't you then create a mesh network for indoor navigation? for instance, GPS doesn't work well indoors, but all the people who are outside of the building within (some range) could then serve as a local GPS that is in range of the people inside of the building?  the idea is that the people outside would know their location because they have a clear line of sight to the GPS network, giving them known locations that other users could triangulate off of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. But why wouldnt you be able to that now? Youd need two other phones to triangulate position, though.  Im guessing its not that practical for the general public to need. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could already be done theoretically- GPS doesn't just tell you your location in space, but time as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, if you wanted to drain the battery of everyone involved <strong>computing where and when people are moving</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like this would greatly increase Spectral Efficiency if im not mistaken? Have you guys considered using this in Fiber Optic networking gear? Or do they already utilize this technology?</p></div>		</li>
