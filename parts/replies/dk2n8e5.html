			<div class="markdown"><p>Even an ambitious font designer wouldn't duplicate characters that are truly identical in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. The font doesn't need four 大's. If the font designer makes a package of separate fonts tweaked for each language, 大 can be added to each font as is. So that greatly cuts down on the character design work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the case of the major pan-CJK efforts, a foundry from each country does the work for their script and then the divided work is merged at the end. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed in many cases you <em>cannot</em> have multiple variants in the same font, because the same Unicode code point is used for all 4 sets: Hanja, Kanji, Hanzi (Chinese simplified, traditional). As far as I know there are no characters+variants for which 4 unique code points are used. Some have 3: traditional, Japanese simplified, Chinese simplified. Many characters have just traditional and simplified (Japanese uses either traditional or simplified, depending, for example some Chinese simplified character shapes were reimported from Japanese Kanji). Some only have one form. Additionally Japanese has a couple dozen unique characters that don't appear in Chinese, but that only means those characters only have one code point.</p>
<p>Essentially this means the combination of the 3 languages' glyphs needed for a font design is at most 3 times the number of total characters, but in reality is between one and two full sets of all common characters (approx 30000 characters) plus the handful of single-language-unique characters.</p>
<p>There are also many defunct characters that are mainly used in e.g. classical Chinese. Most fonts don't need to define all but the most common of these. </p>
<p>Sometimes between the different languages/scripts, the characters have variants where the same strokes are used but are positioned somewhat differently, shaped differently, dots rotated differently, or extend longer or shorter. These variants generally share the same code point and simply vary font to font depending on the target language. This is where a font designer designing a Japanese font will prefer Japanese styling, and that font will look strange to a Chinese speaker for those characters. I don't know much about Hanja, but they will be using whichever of the code points most closely represents the character design they are using and add their own variants which will potentially make the character look weird to readers of the other languages.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I omitted that part because I don't know how many letters would repeat themselves in the each set. It may be a lot of letters, say 20%, or maybe it's just a few, say 5%. Still, since there's a tons of works to do, 5% cut off wouldn't be trivial! Thanks for pointing that out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually you don't have to. Because I'm pretty sure each language would have their own comic sans... For Korean, it's Gulim(or Gulimche).</p>
<p>To the graphic designers out there: if you are ever going to put some Korean letters in your work, do NOT use Gulim or Gulimche. That makes your design looks like a crap to whoever knows how to read Korean. Use Myeongjo, or Dotum, hell even Gungseo is okay, please no Gulim.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>圆体 (yuanti; literal meaning: round form) for Chinese if you are interested. </p>
<p>It's not exact like Comic Sans in the way of imitating handwriting style, but it's the most popular one as it's Microsoft standard of Comic Sans equivalent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is very valuable information! I've worked with Korean companies before on making some book covers and every time I had to ask them 'does this font look serious or childish to you?' Because I had no context of history, design trends or anything. Also very hard to know if I can adjust a character or not. If I remove the horizontal line in an 'A' people still read is as an A. But do people still read 'ㄹ' as 'ㄹ' if I remove the middle horizontal line for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can you leave out that Korean's the only alphabet of them and doesn't primarily use Chinese characters? It only uses extra Chinese characters sparingly, like French terms in English.</p>
<p>And why leave out that the Korean alphabet was designed scientifically (rather than evolving from hieroglyphics like Latin/English letters) and the letters resemble the vocal organs/part of the mouth making the sound!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul#Letter_design" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul#Letter_design</a></p>
<p>Numerous linguists have praised hangul for its featural design, describing it as &quot;remarkable&quot;, &quot;the most perfect phonetic system devised&quot;, and &quot;brilliant, so deliberately does it fit the language like a glove.&quot;[28]</p>
<p>The principal reason Hangul has attracted this praise is that the shapes of the letters are related to the features of the sounds they represent: the letters for consonants pronounced in the same place in the mouth are built on the same underlying shape. In addition, vowels are made from vertical or horizontal lines so that they are easily distinguishable from consonants.</p>
<p>The consonant letters fall into five homorganic groups, each with a basic shape, and one or more letters derived from this shape by means of additional strokes. In the Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye account, the basic shapes iconically represent the articulations the tongue, palate, teeth, and throat take when making these sounds.</p>
<p>Bilabial consonants (&quot;labial sounds&quot;):
ㅁ m [m], ㅂ b [p], ㅍ p [pʰ]
Basic shape: ㅁ represents the outline of the lips in contact with each other. The top of ㅂ represents the release burst of the b. The top stroke of ㅍ is for the burst of aspiration.</p>
<p>Sibilant consonants (&quot;dental sounds&quot;):
ㅅ s [s], ㅈ j [tɕ], ㅊ ch [tɕʰ]
Basic shape: ㅅ was originally shaped like a wedge ∧, without the serif on top. It represents a side view of the teeth. The line topping ㅈ represents firm contact with the roof of the mouth. The stroke topping ㅊ represents an additional burst of aspiration.</p>
<p>Velar consonants (&quot;molar sounds&quot;)
ㄱ g [k], ㅋ k [kʰ]
Basic shape: ㄱ is a side view of the back of the tongue raised toward the velum (soft palate). (For illustration, access the external link below.) ㅋ is derived from ㄱ with a stroke for the burst of aspiration.</p>
<p>Coronal consonants (&quot;lingual sounds&quot;):
ㄴ n [n], ㄷ d [t], ㅌ t [tʰ], ㄹ r [ɾ, l]
Basic shape: ㄴ is a side view of the tip of the tongue raised toward the alveolar ridge (gum ridge). The letters derived from ㄴ are pronounced with the same basic articulation. The line topping ㄷ represents firm contact with the roof of the mouth. The middle stroke of ㅌ represents the burst of aspiration. The top of ㄹ represents a flap of the tongue.</p>
<p>Dorsal consonants (&quot;throat sounds&quot;):
ㅇ ng [ʔ, ŋ], ㅎ h [h]
Basic shape: ㅇ is an outline of the throat. Originally ㅇ was two letters, a simple circle for silence (null consonant), and a circle topped by a vertical line, ㆁ, for the nasal ng. A now obsolete letter, ㆆ, represented a glottal stop, which is pronounced in the throat and had closure represented by the top line, like ㄱㄷㅈ. Derived from ㆆ is ㅎ, in which the extra stroke represents a burst of aspiration.</p>
