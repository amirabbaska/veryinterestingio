			<div class="markdown"><p>I've gotten the impression over the years that I keep seeing people refer to other methods of dating as carbon dating, either out of carelessness, ignorance, or for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<p>Have you found this to be the case? What are some other forms of dating that can go further than the limits of carbon dating?</p>
<p>Does carbon 13 eventually decay to carbon 12? How does this play in to the process?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Carbon dating is often the best dating method when it comes to human history. That is, its time frame and uses fit very well with what we are trying to discover about our past. Most geology uses different kinds of radiometric dating, as C-14's limit of 100,000 years is way too small to be useful for the entire span of earth history.   </p>
<p>Samarium-neodymium and rubidium-strontium were some of the first methods to really take off, since they can provide ages for rocks that are billions of years old. Nowadays, U-Pb is preferred by most geologists when it is applicable, as there are two different isotopes of uranium that both exist with sufficient abundance in nature and decay to lead. This allows more sophisticated analysis of ages, and leads to a very impressive accuracy for some very old materials. There have been zircon crystals over 3 billion years old dated with a margin of error of less than a million years.</p>
<p>Other isotopic systems are often used, such as argon-argon dating, rhenium-osmium, uranium-thorium, lutetium-hafnium, etc. Other systems have been used for very specific investigations, such as the use of an extinct isotope of tungsten--tracked by looking at concentrations of its daughter product--in determining how quickly the earth's core formed. Wikipedia actually has a very good run-down of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating" target="_blank">radiometric dating</a>.</p>
<p>While carbon 13 is a stable isotope and thus does not undergo radioactive decay, your instinct is correct in that scientists must be wary of other elements that can decay into either the parent or daughter product in question. In such cases, care must be taken to either use these finicky methods where the third element will not be present to come into play, or to conduct further analysis in order to separate contributions from radioactive decay from populations initially present.</p>
<p>Hope that makes sense. Good questions!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This to me is amazing.  A million years seems like a long time but it is a less than 1% margin of error.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can we quantify the accuracy of these methods? Like in your example about the the zircon crystals? Wouldn't we have to know the know the true age of the sample by some other method in order to say for certain what the margin of error is?</p>
<p>Or is it more of a confidence interval type thing? Like we're a certain percentage sure that its age falls within a range of 10 million years?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>spot on with zircon dating for geology: oldest zircon dated is 4.3 billion years old, oldest rock was formed 3.6 billion years ago. zircon dating also resists metamorphism which is very useful since most isotopes &quot;reset&quot; when metamorphosed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that Carbon dating is not reliable if you are going to date anything after 1940s due to the atomic/nuclear bomb testings. This has resulted in changes in the concentration of C14 deposits in living organisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That only makes it unreliable if you don't account for the changed C14 deposition. We have quite reliable and complete data on C14 levels since 1940, so we can just plug those in (well, it does make the math a bit more complicated, but nothing a first year student couldn't handle) and the method is as good as ever.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>You think there's a need to carbon-date something that's just 80 years old?</p>
<p>Better to state that carbon-dating will be unreliable in the <em>far, far</em> future due to nuclear testing of the 1940-60 period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nuclear bomb tests have actually worked in favor of carbon dating. If you know how to account for it, you can date young items much more accurately. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Carbon-14 is only good for relatively short term dating. Carbon-12 and Carbon-13 are stable and last for a really long time. They’re not useful for determining dates, but they do tell you other sorts of information about the organism it came from. Varying rations of those in fossils can be used to get an idea of what the first of an ancient animal was like. </p>
<p>There are <a href="https://education.jlab.org/itselemental/iso006.html" target="_blank">other isotopes of carbon</a> that decay, and <em>could</em> be used for dating, but their half-lives are very short, which limits their practical use. </p>
<p>Carbon-14 has a decently long half-life, which makes it great for measuring relatively recent things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that this process doesn’t work as well with marine animals because they don’t exchange carbon with the atmosphere in the same way. This includes things like mollusks that can incorporate already-depleted carbon from the sea floor into their shells. </p></div>		</li>
