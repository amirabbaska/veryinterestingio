			<div class="markdown"><p>The laws were specifically created to hurt the union but worded like they were increasing freedom. Mainly focused on the new guys joining and not wanting that chunk of union dues taken off their paycheque. They were banking on them not knowing what they were giving up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only person that benefits from right to work is employer's.  Right to work laws are 100% union busting laws. Unions guarantee a fair and liveable wage for employees and usually have great benefits while the members of the union pay dues and pool retirements and benefit packages.  When works are allowed to work union jobs without paying dues they are legally required to get the same benefits FROM THE UNION as the people paying their share.  </p>
<p>Say you are a union worker and you make  $30 and hour.  Most unions, especially construction unions, on top of the $30 an hour paid to you there is a certain amount paid to things like retirement and health insurance.  This money is pooled.  So when a state goes right to work people start getting hired on union jobs that aren't in the union. As there get to be more and more of these people they start to drain from the pool without contributing which causes the union to go into the red and eventually crumble.</p>
<p>So now that the unions are gone instead of having alot a union jobs that pay a good living wage the employers can instead hire people at $15 an hour without having to pay the benefits they were before, forcing the employee to pay for their health benefits and into their own retirement, which turns the $15 an hour into more like $10-$11.  These workers also don't get the required training that union members get throughout their apprenticeship, both on the job and in classrooms which most unions require.  </p>
<p>So a company that was making good profits paying their workers  $30 and hour plus benefits, for a total package of about $50 an hour instead gets to pay $15 an hour for people to do the same work they were doing before, while at the same time taking away an organization that fought for there fair treatment.  </p>
<p>TL:DR  right to work laws are designed to make the rich richer while fucking the little guy.</p></div>		</li>
