			<div class="markdown"><p>While a lot of what you said is relevant, addicts arent put into prison for years because of their addiction.  Mostly addicts are left alone to do their thing.  When they resort to crime to perpetuate a drug habit they cannot afford, typically stealing or trafficking, or rarely as a justification to incarcerate someone politically problematic is when they get imprisoned.  I would say that probably less than one percent of one percent of one percent of the time do people get caught and incarcerated just for using drugs.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you kidding me? Do you know how large  the percentage of people convicted of simple possession (not trafficking or dealing amounts) is? In my county alone over 50% of the arrests are due to simple possession. This leads to probation if it's their first offense (which leads to jail) or jail time past their first offense. It's not even close to .000001% of incarcerations. </p>
<p>Did you even think your response through?</p>
<p>And as an example, in my county possession of an 8th of marijuana on average lands you a 6 month stint past your first time. </p>
<p>It's not just crimes committed by addicts and drug users. Using the drug itself carries a very heavy handed punishment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can vouch for this in Australia too, at least anecdotally.   My brother was addicted to meth, got arrested (for a crime he did while high not for the drug use) and ended up in jail with therapy &amp; treatment to help him get clean.  He was paroled into a treatment/halfway house set up then given help to find a job.  He has been clean a year now &amp; is slowly repaying debts &amp; getting to know his daughter again.  He still gets therapy once a week to help him stay clean, as well has having to stay clean to stay out on parole. None of this would have happened if he hadn't gone into a jail system that was designed to rehabilitate &amp; help people instead of simply punishing them.  </p></div>		</li>
