			<div class="markdown"><p>Isnâ€™t the long term average just under one?  If N people have the disease, then there is a Patient Zero and N-1 people who have had the disease passed on to them. So the average rate is (N-1)/N. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please don't crucify me if I'm wrong about this, but with a sustained disease like the common cold, there would be no patient zero in the population no? Every person who is infected with the virus had it passed on to them by another person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The common cold is a collection of a very large number of different conditions.  Some strains may be so old that patient zero is long since dead.  But for a new mutation, there is always a patient zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also here its questionable as what counts as the same disease.</p>
<p>If there is a new virus, its total average will be less than 1, even if everyone in the world caught it. To go over one, someone would need to catch it multiple times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an outbreak, it can be much more than 1.  Because each person, during the course of the disease, has contact with many people who aren't yet immune.</p>
<p>You don't count someone in the calculation until they're no longer infected.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, blanket statement but, Statistically, the average is always 1 other person.
If the average were less than one, the virus would eventually die out.
If the average were more than one, eventually everyone would have it. </p></div>		</li>
