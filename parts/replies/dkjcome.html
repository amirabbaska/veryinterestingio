			<div class="markdown"><p>Flavor packs are made from orange by products. They extract the oils and such from the pulp and rind, then use that to flavor the orange juice. Since the ingredients are still technically 100% oranges, they don't need to change their labels.</p>
<p>I understand why some people are bothered by this. But, in fairness it gives you access to great tasting orange juice year round, and with a high degree of consistency. Best of all it is pretty cheap, barely more than concentrate. In my opinion concentrate tastes awful. </p>
<p>Personally I am glad companies figured out how to preserve orange juice like this. I am far more concerned with the fact that pulpless fruit juice is almost as bad for you as soda. Similar amounts of fructose, with its only redeeming qualities being some protein and fat. It tastes good and I enjoy it, but even fresh squeezed + strained is not very health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great response.  I am lucky enough to have a grocery store within biking distance (heavy backpacks but worth it!) that squeezes their own oranges in this awesome machine in the store.  I can get a half gallon for $4 and it is honestly worth $10.</p></div>		</li>
