			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very true. People were not as individualistic in those days, and considered the family the unit of society, not the person. The idea was that the husband would decide which candidate to select (as the outward-facing representative of the family to society), with the wife's consultation.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It was the same thing with property. People sometimes erronously state that women had no property rights in those days. That is not really true, in reality women were perfectly able to inherit and to own property. If they were unmarried that is. Thing was that when a woman got married, her husband was automatically legally considered the manager of her property, since it was now <em>their</em> property, and he was head of the household. Even then, there were some restrictions, like for example if she was wealthy and brought in real estate to the marriage, he could often not change who that property would be willed to in the event of her death, and if they divorced she would still be entitled to what she had brought into the marriage, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also important to note the way these gender roles were viewed at the time. It wasn't like it is today where we still have gender roles in society but they're seen as being completely arbitrary and even optional. In the 19th century and earlier gender roles were the very foundation of society, themselves having their foundation in biblical scripture. It's not really accurate to consider women of the time oppressed, even if there is some truth to that statement it wouldn't really be comparable to how we view oppression today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, I've not heard of it described like that before. Could you elaborate on why you think women of the time were not actively oppressed? Thanks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think its different for every woman. Not all women felt the need to be liberated. We know for a fact a great many historic women DID feel oppressed, particularly those with the drive to pursue roles and professions that were completely blocked from them, and who would be forced to work as maids if they could not marry. What a shitty lack of choices. But that shitty lack of choices didn't effect women who were happy to get married, have children, and live the traditional female role. </p>
<p>Let's please remember: Feminism is about choice (or it should be, but has been twisted). The new choices aren't going to be preferred by all women, and we shouldn't force them to embrace them. It's okay if you DON'T want to be a career woman. Choice is the point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not the person you replied to, but I think oppression depends on feeling like you've been treated unjustly, or that you're being mistreated in some way. The social norms were different, so it's not quite a one to one comparison. If both men and women of the day agreed on their roles, then that's not active oppression. It's unfair to the past to paint it with the same brush as the present, or the future we'd like to see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems a lot of the replies you got from others answer your questions pretty well but I'll reiterate it comes down to the differences in how people viewed themselves and their place in the world and the ways in which they lived their daily life. It's subjective, in a sense.</p>
<p>It's important to understand as well that these societal gender roles were established during times where most people were living their lives based almost entirely on survival. Having specific roles for each person in a family, from husband and wife and firstborn to last lastborn, meant there was an orderly labor system and you became far less likely to starve to death. Over time subsistence living became less and less common and certain mentalities that came with it made less and less sense, but that doesn't mean they didn't have an important place once upon a time.</p>
<p>This is also not to suggest that women weren't oppressed or discriminated against during that time, but that doesn't mean the gender roles themselves were oppressive and discriminatory, they were simply the norms of the time based on a system that evolved over generations of families trying to survive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, women at least had a place. Today, being a woman is dizzying and the idea of being female is demeaned by the idea that the role of wife/mother isn't &quot;enough.&quot; Feminism provided freedom but also devalued the value of the traditional female role. </p>
<p>That being said, all you have to do is read the texts of the great female authors of the 18th and 19th century, who describe the feeling of entrapment as a woman. Many women did indeed feel oppressed, but did not have a platform or language to talk about it, except in subversive ways. Source: Jane Eyre. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a big problem with the perception of the homemaker as a lesser role is that it isn't. Some people are pretending this is a second class job function. I don't think those people would have a chance in fucking hell to keep a household together for a week if they were blasted back to 1905.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The arguments about gender roles are basically arguments against change, not against women themselves. There are a lot of men to this day who do not believe that women are inferior, but simply do not want society to change. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's absurd. If a woman doesn't go to college and the man goes to a strong technical school, then as a household they should have ample resources to get by happy and healthy without too much luxury.</p></div>		</li>
