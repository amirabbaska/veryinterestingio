			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it kind of depends what &quot;do the math&quot; means to you. It doesn't do the math like a pocket calculator, but ultimately, you have an image projected on your retina that is processed to identify and recognize objects and their position and speed, and that information is used to control muscles to move your hand to the predicted position of the object to catch it.</p>
<p>So some sort of calculation had to be happening, and it is describable using math. You can work out a solution using trig, and your brain will work out the same solution. But yea, not using trig.</p>
<p>Although neural networks can approximate any function, so there could be some paths in your brain that do resemble trig functions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not completely true. When is studied this it's a form of prediction. Which our brains do on a regular basis in many different forms.
It's also in part of a survival instinct. Which is why even young children are able in most cases to block things moving at them even if they can't catch them.
Our brains predict flight paths based on the starting point of the throw..the relative speed and arc. At first we simply aren't that good at it cause as you said we lack experience..so it becomes more a defensive reflex with the goal of protecting ourselves..as we see this activity more and more our brains are able to more accurately predict flight paths reducing margin of error. The brain does a shorthand version of the math involved just not in a way we understand or able to comprehend cause it becomes a reflexive action and done at such speed we are simply unaware. The moment we come to the idea of catching a flying object the brain takes over..even predicting the most likely place the object will be thrown.
This is the reason why deflecting shot in hockey are such nightmares for goalies in hockey. Cause the sudden change in direction was outside of the parameters of prediction our brain is using.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah isn't it crazy how your brain and body just do stuff by themselves, like catching a ball, breathing, moving your hand, coming to an idea. Isn't it amazing that pretty much every part of us is totally unconscious? It's almost like the only part of us that's conscious, is the one part that can't actually directly, <em>consciously</em> control any part of the body or mind.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! Absolutely fascinating how we have all these autonomic systems in place. Our mind does so much we aren't even aware yet without it we seriously don't exist. It's incredible to know that we are self aware yet so much of what makes life for us possible is done on a level we aren't even aware of!</p></div>		</li>

But for sure it is making predictions &amp; awaiting rewards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about someone like an outfielder who is covering a large area, is not running predetermined routs, and has to deal with variables like a fairly random velocity and trajectory post-hit, (changes in) wind and running over a long distance.  Are there really no mathematics being done here -- beyond our perception? Are things like heuristics not emergent from some subconscious maths? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If that guy is 25 years old, he has spent 25 years, minus time spent sleeping, observing the motion of objects in the physical world. If you had a neural network and it spent 25 <em> 365 </em> 16 = 1,635,200 hours observing something, it would probably be pretty good at predictionsâ€¦</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been told that outfielders watch the bat make contact with the ball to get some idea of where the ball is going, so they can start moving at the same time. They aren't doing math, just using experience combined with knowledge of how fast the pitcher is likely throwing; how &quot;powerful&quot; the batter is; what the wind is doing; and how squarely, and how far from the batter's hands the bat and ball make contact, to know without thinking about it which way to start moving - and sometimes they are still fooled. Plus they start out in the more likely locations, for example for a left handed batters, the right fielder moves closer to the 1st-base line, the center fielder is on the right-field side of 2nd base, and the left fielder moves further away from the 3rd-base line to bisect the remaining space, whereas for a right-handed batter, the left fielder typically plays much closer to the 3rd-base line, the center fielder is to the left side of 2nd base, and the right fielder is further away from the 1st-base line.</p></div>		</li>
