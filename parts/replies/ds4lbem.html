			<div class="markdown"><p>Well first, in stead of lines, let’s think roads that are the fastest ways between two points. In flatland, those are straight roads. Euclid, a city planner, said that from his observations: for every road and a given address not on that road, there is one and only one road that contains that address so that there is never an intersection with the original road. That is to say, they are parallel!</p>
<p>The , a later city planner, named Riemann, loved Euclid. Obsessed about Euclid. But, he noticed that in Euclid’s city planning books the idea of this parallel road idea was completely dependent on the assumption that all land was flat. Instead, Riemann spent time planning cities on infinite saddles, on spheres, on cylinders, on cones, parabolas, ellipsoids, etc.</p>
<p>What he found is that what is more important than flatland, is that every road is the fastest route. For places like spheres, these were the roads like the lines of longitude or the equator! If you stare at a globe long enough, you'll notice that any two roads always have an intersection. Hence, Riemann showed that all roads intersect somewhere on a sphere! No matter what, there will be a crossroads. That is, given any road and any address that road doesn’t contain, you will only ever find roads that intersect the original road. So, no roads are parallel on a sphere!</p>
<p>For a saddle, it was the opposite. Given any road and any address it doesn’t contain, you can find infinitely many roads that will never have an intersection with your original road. Not 0, not 1, but infinitely many!</p>
<p>Now Riemann took a look at a cylinder. When defining possible roads, he found something weird. He could lay out the addresses on the cylinder and fastest roads precisely like how he could lay out the addresses and fastest roads of half of flatland. You might be thinking, “how!?”, and the answer is complicated. But he did it, and published it. Think of it like this, if you take all the numbers between 0 and 1 without containing the number 1, and you multiply each by two, then you will get every number between 0 and 2 without containing 2. This stretchiness is important and allowed Riemann to cut flat land in half, compress it, and roll it. So a cylinder is half of flatland! Now, flatland is flat, so half of flatland is flat, and hence it must be that a cylinder is flat!</p>
<p>Edit: I should add, it is unlikely Riemann proved this for cylinders himself. Hell, I would also doubt that provided he did, that he was the first. I just didn't want to flood a five year old with name drops.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, but the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn do not intersect with each other, or the Equator. What gives? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, so if we draw a line, then pick a point that isn't on that line, how many lines can we draw through that point that don't cross the line? With Euclidean geometry, this is 1. In other geometries, it might not be. </p></div>		</li>
