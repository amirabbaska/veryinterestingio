			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not necessary.  I have discovered the most comfortable way to sleep on your side.</p>
<p>Whichever side you're sleeping on, extend that arm perpendicular to your body with your elbow on the mattress and your palm face down.  Place one pillow below your forearm/wrist to give it a bit of elevation, and keep the elbow slightly bent and relaxed.  Now place another pillow between your biceps/shoulder and the side of your face.</p>
<p>Your opposite arm can rest extended (parallel to the body), or bent (in front of your chest).  Keep your knees slightly bent, one leg resting on the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am being serious and i've seen that cuddling bed before. It looks like it squeezes the arm while its in there and looks like is still made for sleeping on your back but with your arm out. I think i would prefer my arm to dangle. </p></div>		</li>
