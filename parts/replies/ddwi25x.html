<p>Today, families demand homes twice that size with two car garages and a standard Ford full size sedan like the Fusion (at $30k) feels more luxurious than a Cadillac or Packard from the 50s. &quot;Comfortable&quot; has changed.</p>

<p>That's the decreased cost of production and increased ability to offer at affordable/competitive pricing though. With the 2017 Mercedes S-class, you have a lot of stuff and creature comforts that is effectively beta tested and then eventually introduced into lower models. A/C was once an upgrade. Now, it's standard on virtually every car. I'm not even sure manual windows still exist on any consumer car in 2017.</p>
<p>I think by 2020 or 2022, all cars will be required to have backup cameras --- that used to be an upgrade on high-end luxury cars.</p>
<p>It would be fascinating to compile data and look at top-of-the-line loaded/equipped Bentley's, Rolls-Royce, Mercedes, etc. over the decades and see how basic Toyota's and Ford's today have said features as standard.</p>
<p>Even computers and dial-up modems for BBS were a pricey thing in the 80's... eventually PC computer costs came down and AOL really kicked off the home internet revolution (IMO) with $20/month unlimited dial-up. Now, busy signals were another battle...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I said some of this too. Its amazing how Americans think of the 1950s Golden era as the &quot;norm&quot; even when its obvious that it was never the norm, it was the fallout of a world war. And now the US themselves have been through a few economically devastating wars they've had to finance, making what would have been a predictable and unavoidable decline even worse. I think we'd all be better off if we'd just accept that the 1950s wasn't normal and stop romanticizing it as how things should be. I mean, even then a lot of people couldn't afford the single income and the house and white picket fence. We need to forget that as a norm and move on to making two-incomes and reasonable quality of life affordable...not all this other unsustainable frilly stuff we've gotten it in our heads we need. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Point three doesn't get talked about but it is a big factor. Since 1960 the proportion of dual income families has gone up by 35%. <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/ft_dual-income-households-1960-2012-2/" target="_blank">http://www.pewresearch.org/ft_dual-income-households-1960-2012-2/</a> not only does that impact inflation it has also contributed to depression of wages.</p>
<p>In 1960 61% of married people with kids were in the workforce. In 2012 it was up to 78.5%. That is a 28% increase in people competing for jobs. More people competing for jobs the less companies have to pay candidates.</p></div>		</li>
