			<div class="markdown"><p>In October, my friend had a seizure (which he had never had before) and hit his head on his dresser, which knocked him out.  He lives alone and woke up almost 2 days later with his dog sitting on his chest.  When he fell, he fell with his arm pinned behind him.  When he came to, he didn't know what had happened to him.</p>
<p>He called 911.  His arm almost died.  He ended up getting &quot;compartment syndrome&quot; (don't google this!) in his arm.  He was in and out of consciousness at the hospital when a Dr woke him up and told him they were going to have to amputate it.  </p>
<p>My friend cried and begged for any kind of alternative to losing his arm.  They decided to cut it open on the top of his forearm and on the bottom of his forearm. They had to let it drain and kept it open for days.  </p>
<p>As a result from the toxins from the arm, his organs started shutting down.  His kidneys failed and he was put on dialysis.  After 2 weeks, his kidneys stated functioning again.  He also had trouble breathing and was put on a respirator.  He ended up with 200 staples in his arm.  It was horrible.</p>
<p>He got out of the hospital after about a month and has hardly any feeling/use in his arm.  He's going through therapy now, but can you imagine how scary all that was?!  He can now touch his index finger to his thumb, but that's about it.  </p>
<p>You never know what's going to happen in your life from one day to the next.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>paramedic here, goes without saying your friend is extremely lucky he is alive. in his case the prolonged pressure form the compartment syndrome caused a crush injury releasing broken down muscle proteins, potassium and other inflammatory and toxic markers into his circulation. He is extremely lucky he didn't die from complications. did they identify the cause of the seizure?.. Unfortunately in non-diabetics teens/20's - brain tumors are up there as a cause of first time seizures in the absence of drugs , alcohol or trauma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, when all was said and done, he had almost died 3 or so times once he got to the hospital.  He had a fasciotomy on the top and bottom of his arm.  After his liver and kidneys started shutting down, it didn't look good.</p>
<p>I have texted him recently and am waiting for a text back, but I know he's got to be in a lot of pain still.  I don't know about the seizure, but am anxious to find out and will post back here when I do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>What Happens in Compartment Syndrome?
Groups of organs or muscles are organized into areas called compartments. Strong webs of connective tissue called fascia form the walls of these compartments.
After an injury, blood or edema (fluid resulting from inflammation or injury) may accumulate in the compartment. The tough walls of fascia cannot easily expand, and compartment pressure rises, preventing adequate blood flow to tissues inside the compartment. Severe tissue damage can result, with loss of body function or even death.</em></p>
<p>It usually happens in your limbs through a crushing injury, maybe a break, sometimes by a burn....it's a pretty traumatic injury and many people lose their limbs due to this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fell down a flight of stairs on July 4. I fractured 4 different bones (forgot the names - basically my cheek bones and eye socket) on the left side of my face. That was the initial impact. I'm 6'1&quot; - There were 13 stairs. Oak. No carpet. I went end over end and smashed my head against the granite landing. I was out cold for three and a half minutes. My sister thought I was dead. I pissed my pants, woke up, got seven stitches on the left side of my left eye. Be careful of stairs people.</p>
<p>Edit: Forgot to mention I broke my left clavicle (collar bone) and two ribs on my left side also. It was a bad day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jesus. I'm surprised you're still alive after that, it's essentially down to pure luck in how you landed.</p>
<p>I used to have chronically low blood pressure as a teen, nothing that would impede function except for when standing up, where if I got up from a sitting or lying state I could get spots in my eyes or go blind for a few seconds.</p>
<p>One time I got up from my chair, walked across the house, said hello to my mother, opened the fridge and then realised my mother was shouting at me, my head hurt and I was looking at the ceiling. Apparently when I opened the fridge I just collapsed and banged my head on the tiles. Luckily I'd just felt a little dazed, no concussion or fracture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stupid stairs. I had a similar incident. Left the top step and made contact with the bottom step straight on my tail bone. It broke in a few places and hurt like hell. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I rolled down the stairs when I was 8 in the same fashion. Luckily for me it was all carpeted and while I could have broken pretty much anything, I didn't. The weird thing is I don't remember why I fell down the in the first place. I was sitting at the top of the stairs then I was at the bottom of the stairs. No memories otherwise.</p>
<p>My brother watching tv against the wall the stairs were built in to obviously thought it looked hilarious watching my summersault down the stairs though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was hit by a car back when I was 11 years old. I was in a coma for 4 days. I don't remember a thing about it except feeling very groggy as I &quot;woke&quot; up. Just saying, it's weird to think that my brain needed 4 days to get a handle on things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, our brain is a bunch of jelly that sloshes around in a confined space, and how all the bits of jelly interconnect are important to how it functions. It's kind of amazing to me that it still works after an enthusiastic nod.</p>
<p>Source: I don't know much about how the brain actually works. I'm just easily amazed.</p></div>		</li>
