			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm...metal lid?  How is the inside exposed to metal?</p>
<p>The two part lids have a coating and rim of sealant material on them, you shouldn't be touching any metal.</p>
<p>I guess I've seen full, one piece metal lids.  But those wouldn't be for food use, I don't think.  Like you wouldn't can with them, it's more like a lid for...I don't know...some kind of craft use or something.</p></div>		</li>
