			<div class="markdown"><p>If I may add a more ELI15 tidbit to this very good answer:<br />
While Nitrogen (N2) is very inert, it may react with oxygen at high temperatures forming Nitrogen oxydes (NO, NO2).<br />
This could happen within combustion engines of various types. The problem is that these compounds are very toxic, so a great care is taken to manage the combustion in order not to let them form, and/or filter them as they exit. An example of this are the catalytic mufflers that are put on cars.  </p>
<p>EDIT: I love how this discussion expanded! Also this is my most upvoted comment, nice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US EPA regulations for gasoline vehicles take into account NMOGs (non-methane organic gasses) and NOx emissions, while the Euro6 gives no consideration to NMOGs.</p>
<p>The EPA allows for 0.64 g/km of NOx+NMOG while Euro6 allows for 0.6 g/km of NOx.  It's disingenuous to say that one is more strict than the other because the US allows for more total emissions, but measures more pollutants.</p>
<p>The major difference between standards is that the US EPA treats diesel and gas engines the same vis-a-vis NOx while Euro# standards allowed for diesels to emit more pollution than petrol engines.  </p>
<p>This has been changing; Euro5 allowed diesels to emit 3x as much NOx, while Euro6 allows diesels to emit only 33% more NOx.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is mostly a diesel vs petrol issue. Petrol engines have no problem adhering to US standards and are built with that in mind. Diesel engines on the other hand have the benefit of lower co and co2 emissions but also emit more nox and particles (smog) that are bad on local level. US regulations are primarily focused on reducing smog, which is a problem due to the high concentration of cars in cities. European regulations focus on co2 emissions as smog has traditionally not been such a big issue. That's why petrol is the no 1 fuel in the us and diesel in Europe.</p></div>		</li>

Being an engineer I only studied how those compund could form, and basically only learned that NOx = VERY BAD. I never studied what their actual effect on the human body are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding a few details to make your answer even more complete:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what plants and other organisms use to incorporate nitrogen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Namely, every single organism that can't fix atmospheric nitrogen by itself needs to get their nitrogen from another source. Nitrogen is one of the most important elements for life, it is present in all proteins and in the DNA, which are two of the most important biomolecules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(...)organisms use to incorporate nitrogen into other compounds (it's required for many amino acids)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nitrogen is present in <strong>ALL</strong> amino acids, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine" target="_blank">amine chemical group</a> always has nitrogen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These bacteria typically live in the roots of Legume (plants like soybeans and peas)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The specific structure is called nodule and <a href="https://www.gardenbetty.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-29-01.jpg" target="_blank">it looks like this</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the ability of plants like soybeans to fix nitrogen is the reason behind crop rotation. In the old days, before commercial fertilizers were available, people would plant crops that needed nitrogen from other sources into fields for several years, and then plant soybeans one year to revitalize the soil. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soybeans became popular in the western world way after commercial fertilizers were widely available on the market. Things like peas or lentils would be the legumes in the crop rotation back in the day.</p>
<p>Even with fertilizer, it's still incredibly useful because it reduces pest population and disease problems. A nematode is sitting there happily chewing on soybean roots when all of a sudden, the only thing to eat next year is corn.</p>
<p>The more specialized the pests are, the better crop rotation works at starving them out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI You also do crop rotation to reduce insect and disease pressure.</p>
<p>Little known fact; soybeans give a nitrogen credit of ~40 lbs/acre due to fixation and low carbon to nitrogen ratio in the residue. Reason we need nitrogen fertilizers is because corn typically requires around ~150 lbs of N (varies with yield). This is little over 300 lbs of Urea or 2,500 gallons of swine slurry.</p></div>		</li>
