			<div class="markdown"><p>To follow up, in animals like geese, hyper-aggression is an intimidation tactic, which is basically all-or-nothing.  Backing down will mean you get eaten, so you need to commit 100% to that kind of display.  Ducks are simply too small to use that against common predators like foxes, raccoons, etc., but geese are big enough that, evolutionarily speaking, it’s generally an effective tactic.</p>

<p>If they did manage to clamp on, unless you pull away thier bills couldnt penetrate flesh, just keep clear of the wings and eventually they will tire and leg it honking triumpantly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Morning runs have taught me the best tactic to deal with a canada goose on the trail is to increase my stride to a full sprint, put my hands over my head and commit to charge at it with a loud throaty roar. They will fucking clear out. </p>

<p>It's very true that a lot of behaviour is all-or-nothing in the animal world - by nature of natural selection, a lot of <del>poor</del> less successful behaviour doesn't &quot;catch on&quot;, whether passed or learned or the other ways behaviour is shaped.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I imagine this is actually a good thing to some extent. </p>
<p>I know when I am asked direct about my behaviour it can change on so many factors. I think we don't account for the lies we tell ourselves. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have both ducks and geese. About three years ago one mama duck flew into mama geese’s nest, lay her egg, and flew away. The baby grew up an adoptive goose and was much more rambunctious than the other same age ducks. Mama goose loved her weird small baby.</p>
<p>My geese aren’t super aggressive so we didn’t see a huge amount of aggression from the baby. But things that the geese would do like hiss at you when you walk past them, display up more threateningly when you were close, etc. the baby was 100% into. It was absurdly cute and would not be a useful tactic in the wild for such a small duck.</p>
<p>I feel like the duck/goose aggression divide is largely learned from their bird parents, and it’s simply standard because being more aggressive only works if you’re bigger like you say. But that is just from anecdotes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obligate behaviour, in this context, would be behaviour that <strong>must</strong> be carried out. The siblicide is part of the &quot;growing up&quot; process (a bad definition, I'm sure someone from /r/askscience is going to correct me and explain it better)</p>
<p>Contrast with <strong>facultative</strong>, where the behaviour is not necessarily &quot;mandatory.&quot; The siblicide that the fostered heron chicks exhibited was <strong>facilitated</strong> by the parenting mechanism that the egret parents use.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another bird example, Brown-headed Cowbirds are obligate brood parasites, meaning they will only lay eggs in the nests of other birds to be raised by them. They don't make nests, they don't brood eggs, so if they are going to reproduce, they are obligated to parasitize the nest of another bird.</p>
<p>The opposite would be a facultative brood parasite, such as North American Cuckoos. They will occasionally lay an egg in another bird's nest but they can and will make nests and raise their own babies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is one of those times that looking at similar words helps a ton.  This looks a lot like &quot;Obligatory&quot; right?    Well, if obligatory is an adjective (Drivers licenses are obligatory),  and obligate is being used as a verb, you could deduce that the DMV obligates you to have a driver's license.  </p>
<p>I know that isn't exactly what you were asking, but this kind of concept helps a lot.  Sometimes it steers you wrong, though, so don't rely on it when it's very important. </p></div>		</li>
