			<div class="markdown"><p>Might be worth noting that they are all from the same pepper plant, but at different stages of 'ripening'.</p>
<p>It would be pretty easy for someone to assume they where each entirely different species of pepper.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I stand corrected below. The full spectrum isn't necessarily produced from the same plant. While they are all the same species, some types may just ripen from green &gt; yellow &gt; red and some might go straight green &gt; red. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true actually... different varieties give different colored peppers. Red peppers will go from green directly to red. They are, however, all the same species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah man.</p>
<p>There are different varieties that ripen to different colors.  Yellow, orange, red, purple, brown.</p>
<p>Bell peppers do not progress from yellow to Orange to red.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that that’s the case.. but srsl it’s sometimes still so hard to believe bc they taste so extremely different especially the green one.
It tastes like different kind of peppers not like different ripening states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth mentioning that the difference between green peppers and the other colors, is that green peppers are not &quot;ripe&quot; yet, meaning they have a lower sugar content. A fully ripe pepper will have a shorter shelf-life, which is another significant factor in their pricing.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/justthebloops" target="_blank">justthebloops</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Sugar content is just part of it though. The 3 colors are actually caused by different nutrients that increase as they ripen. Chlorophyll (green) is converted to lutein (yellow), beta-carotene (orange), and lycopene (red). </p>
<p>Doesn't that seem convenient? Nature made these nutrients color coded for us!</p>
<p>...Except it actually happened the other way around. We evolved color vision to distinguish these nutrients in our environment, because they helped us survive. Interesting that these particular nutrients (carotenoids) are thought to be important for eye health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking your comment to spread the news: I found an independent grocery store in my town that sells what they call &quot;sunrise peppers.&quot; They are bell peppers that are inconsistently ripe, so green and yellow and red, and they are cheap as shit because they're ugly! I've only ever seen them in this store though... Anybody else ever see these?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only seen the like in farmer's markets. No &quot;sunrise&quot; marketing; just a tray of peppers. I like them because they have more character than fully-ripened peppers, but less bitterness than the greens. Also, cooking for one, I can put the red half in my red sauce, and the green half in a green salad.</p></div>		</li>
