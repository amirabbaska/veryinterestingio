			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Also, FaceTime uses H.265 (mainly used for 4K UHD video), and it's about 40% better at compression, and Skype uses H.264 (standard codec for 1080p), so if they use the same bandwidth, that alone would cause a noticable difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, don't know why there is a difference. You can Google it and see many sites stating it does use HEVC.  </p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> On the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding" target="_blank">Wiki page for HEVC</a>, they state that FaceTime does use it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment is as wrong as it is correct. It depends on the source and receiver screen sizes, video resolution, video codec used, network conditions which quantify as bandwidth available to the app.</p></div>		</li>
