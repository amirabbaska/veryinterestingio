			<div class="markdown"><p>It was a lot of putting together all of the information I'd learned throughout my undergraduate education.</p>
<p>It included a lot of heat transfer, coupled with reactor design and process control. The idea was to use hot gasses to heat up the reaction chamber, so I tried to estimate the rate of pyrolysis at different temperatures using data I could find on the subject, do the heat transfer calculations, and optimize the design. The sawdust would be entering the reactor at one end, with a ball mill inside the reactor spinning, a nitrogen purge preventing oxidation, and hot gasses circulating around the chamber to control the temperature.</p>
<p>The product would be carbon black powder.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lots of other posts have said that although the resulting substance can't be exactly 'liquid wood', melting it is possible</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;At atmospheric pressure it has no melting point as its triple point is at 10.8 ± 0.2 MPa and 4,600 ± 300 K (~4,330 °C or 7,820 °F), so it sublimes at about 3,900 K.&quot; </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you heat carbon up at atmospheric pressure- it goes straight from a solid to a gas- it never becomes a liquid.</p>
<p>We've all seen solid CO2- i.e. Dry Ice. Well what happens when you leave dry ice out on a table? It doesn't &quot;melt&quot; (as in turn into a liquid)- it simply becomes a gas. That's because CO2 doesn't melt at atmospheric pressure- it undergoes sublimation instead.</p>
<p>Does that mean we can't have liquid CO2? Of course we can- anyone who has worked in a restaurant and lugged a new 20lb CO2 tank into position has worked with liquid CO2. The difference is- the CO2 in the tank is under high pressure so it ends up in liquid form rather than gas. When you open the valve- the liquid immediately becomes a gas due to the lower pressure. (Same idea with propane).</p>
<p>If we wanted liquid carbon- we would need a LOT of pressure and a high temperature. Temperature alone isn't enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks and that helped somewhat but I was more meaning what this specific part meant</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't know what a triple point is</p>
<p>Nor do I know what 10.8 [funky symbol] 0.2 MPa means</p>
<p>And guessing that 4600 [symbol] 300 K is the temperature range for......something</p>
<p>Though I do know what C and K stand for at least </p>
<p>I do appreciate your help</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically carbon is kinda like dry ice.  It transitions directly from solid to gas if you heat it at atmospheric pressure.  To make it into a liquid you have to put it under pressure.  We see something similar with a standard butane lighter.  Butane is a gas at room temperature and pressure, but if you put it under a little pressure like you find in a bic lighter it will be a liquid.</p></div>		</li>
