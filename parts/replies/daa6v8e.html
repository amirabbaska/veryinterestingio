<p>Instead of &quot;they can and will look at anybody's internet activity, with or without suspicion&quot;, it's &quot;they can and will look at <em>terrorists'</em> and <em>paedophiles'</em> internet activity, and they will be able to catch them&quot;. Of course that's ridiculous, but that's what a lot of people will understand and attack any line of questioning with &quot;if you've got nothing to hide, you've not nothing to fear&quot; (and yet they tend to get very defensive when you suggest installing cameras in their toilets and bedrooms, to do with the footage as you wish)</p>
<p>If that doesn't float your boat for morality, then there's also the idea that with this the government will prevent people from seeing or doing things that are 'amoral', for example certain types of porn (see the list of things that were 'banned' in porn in the UK although not much happened as far as i can tell), drug use, criminal activity etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to understand a fundamentally different attitude between the UK and the US (which I mention specifically because of the number of Americans on this site). The UK, by and large, is far more trusting of the government than the US. We haven't had a revolution since 1688, or a civil war since 1745. Countries have come and gone, but the UK government has just kept on going quite internally peacefully, and the overall trend has been to gradually expand the liberties of the British people of its own accord.</p>
<p>We don't even have a constitution and have never had a significant public drive to create one. Successive governments have done things in certain ways because it's either <em>the done thing</em> or because the laws are so old and complex that genuinely no one in government even knows where to begin on repealing certain aspects of the &quot;unwritten constitution&quot; that don't mesh well.</p>
<p>The idea of the UK becoming a police state is, despite the hysteria inevitably present over issues like this, unthinkable. And as worrying as this is, as much as it absolutely does need to be fought against and as rife with potential for abuse and gentle power creep though it is, this new surveillance law is not the emergence of such a police state or a one-party state.</p>
<p>Thus, along comes a spider who says she'll spin a web to catch terrorists and paedophiles, and the public are okay with it because the idea of it being used as a weapon against the common people is unthinkable. About the only argument left intact against it becomes that of a nebulous sense of liberty or privacy that doesn't actually does any tangible good; to be able to Google bomb-making instructions out of genuine academic curiosity or the odd bit of extreme BDSM porn without feeling at all watched. To which proponents would retort (not without merit) that such things cannot come at the potential cost of lives or the perpetuation of child sex trafficking.</p>
<p>Honestly (and I'm playing with downvote fire here), it's difficult to find a coherent and non-emotional counter-argument. It makes me uneasy as fuck, but there's no way to know how justified my unease is, or even how important the work of the security services is. I don't like it at all and would absolutely vote against it if it were for some daft reason put to referendum, but my dislike is emotional and I must admit that. I've never seen an argument that fully satisfies me that I'm <em>right</em> to dislike it so much without resorting to ideas of what the government could do that don't realistically apply to our politics or the capacity of our government to change the amount of power it has.</p>
<p>And so, when the ranks of those against it are filled with people like me, it's no surprise that the population at large aren't convinced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may be able to help you out with that argument that you need in order to feel justified in your gut feeling and to convince your fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>We have a lot of laws on the books that don't need to be laws. Whatever it is, there isn't really anything wrong with doing it. But we leave them with the reasoning is if you are being a nuisance or disrupting people around you, then there's a law the police can use to arrest you. If you aren't bothering people then they won't actually know you've broken the law. For instance weed is illegal in most US states. If you are minding your own business, smoking in a non public place like inside your own home. Then the police would never know you're breaking the law. But if you are out in the street blowing smoke into peoples faces like a jackass then the police can arrest you for smoking pot. They enforce the law to the best of their ability.</p>
<p>So what happens when the police invent a new type of radar that can see inside peoples houses? Or see inside their computers?</p>
<p>When these laws were written their ability to be enforced was a factor in how they were written. Suddenly these laws can now be enforced much more easily. So the balance is lost. When you put a camera on every street corner, suddenly jaywalking tickets are getting sent out like crazy because the government didn't budget properly and now wants revenue. When you see inside peoples computers, their copy of Mein Kampf triggers an arrest. In Germany it's illegal to own. And the reason it's illegal to say Nazi things in Germany is because it so dramatically upsets people. But you're not out there upsetting people. You own a banned book. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kay: A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it. Fifteen hundred years ago everybody knew the Earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat, and fifteen minutes ago, you knew that humans were alone on this planet. Imagine what you'll know tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A legal equivalent of that is five hundred years ago being non-Christian was illegal. Fifteen minutes ago smoking weed was illegal. Right now, owning the wrong book is illegal. Imagine what will be legal or illegal tomorrow. And now imagine the police have omniscience. </p>
<p>It's important that the police be unable to know whether you break the law unless other people are affected. All the shit you do that's illegal, that shouldn't be, is impossible to keep to yourself even though you haven't harmed anyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think because its a hard thing to argue against. A lot of MP's are for it because of two reasons. 1) Not many of very libertarian 2) It extends the power of the state. Its quite hard to argue against the rhetoric that it will help stop terrorists, child molesters and other hardcore criminals. Where in reality the bill may help catch low level criminals but the vast majority of professional criminals will go unscathed as they know how to circumvent these laws. Leaving the general populace vulnerable to abuses of these laws and further surveillance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As much as I hate to have to up-vote this comment, it's the absolute truth.</p>
<p>For me personally being a child of the 80's (born 1980 for anyone who cares) I have voted in several recent elections and none of my votes seem to have made the blindest bit of difference; There are a select group of my &quot;Intelligent&quot; (Facebook) friends who, along with myself voted against the &quot;BREXIT&quot; lies earlier this year but it all seems in vain. The majority of people I speak to online were sold on the lies that the CUNTS involved in peddling BREXIT were selling and it seems they &quot;aren't for turning&quot; - if I may quote our last female Prime Minister.</p>
<p>I'm not mentioning the name of the CUNT-in-charge* because I believe she's a liberty-stealing-cunt who has found her way into office because the previous incumbent proved himself to be a spineless CUNT when the vote he tabled didn't go his way after the &quot;majority&quot; believed the lying bastards that sold this country down the river.</p>
<p>If David-fucking-Cameron had done his job &amp; presented clear and undeniable facts to the population debunking the lies that the leave campaign were peddling we wouldn't be in the &quot;Failing to plan is planning to FAIL debackle&quot; we find ourselves in.</p>
<p>Instead of that though, they devolved into the usual house-of-commons bullshit of sneering/jeering at &quot;the opposition&quot; which everyone in this country hates with a passion and thus we find ourselves with a bunch of know-nothing TWATS involved in steering the future for the next generations when the majority** of the current populace (who have benefitted most from the current arrangements) seem dead-set on fucking it up for future generations.</p>
<p>*To be clear, I am all-for a woman Prime Minister provided she is all-for the people of this country, privacy, fairness and liberty for all. Not some tired, old dinosaur who wouldn't know what the internet is for if it stood up and slapped in her tired face.</p>
<p>Hell, at this point I'd even vote for Nicola Sturgeon if I thought it could make a difference.</p>
<p>** to be clear, although the vote was 52/48 % it wasn't a clear representation of the country (you can look it up if you don't believe me)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The UK does not have the same tradition of libertarian fear of government that the US does.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Though in general, as an Australian, I find Americans always tend to be less pragmatic and more principled. Which is admirable, but not always workable.</p></div>		</li>
