			<div class="markdown"><p>The main effect on ultimate droplet size is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Taylor_instability" target="_blank">Rayleigh-Taylor instability</a>. In which gravity is a factor, because it sets the acceleration and velocity of the falling droplet. The velocity caused drag forces effectively pushing up on the liquid. Beyond a certain velocity the droplet breaks up into smaller droplets. So gravity and atmospheric density (not just pressure) are the two main factors in droplet size.</p>
