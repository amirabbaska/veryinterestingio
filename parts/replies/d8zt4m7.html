			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass" target="_blank">Glass</a> is amorphous, a random arrangement of molecules. There isn't a regular bonding pattern with glass like with crystals. This is the defining characteristic of glass. </p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, and this is far more the reason for its smooth cutting properties than simply the thinness.  On a microscopic level, metals all get jagged and just rip and tear. The blade edge of obsidian is much smoother.</p>		</li>

			<p>No... it doesn't have a cube like lattice.  In fact, it doesn't have any structure at all, because it's glass, which is amorphous and doesn't have a regular crystal structure.<br><br>Also, obsidian is not a material with definite chemical composition.  It is merely volcanic rock that has cooled VERY quickly.</p>		</li>
