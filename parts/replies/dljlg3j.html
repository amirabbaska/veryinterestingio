<p>Don't mock.  Log tables (and trig function tables) and slide rules got us from the Old World to the Moon.  Pocket calculators weren't a thing until the 1970s, and electronic computers didn't exist prior to WWII.  Navigators, Surveyors, Engineers, Scientists, and all sorts of other professionals used log tables until quite recently.  They built bridges, and dams and sky scrapers; they discovered elements and split atoms; they built ships and airplanes , launched satellites charted the entire world without a single computer using the power of log tables and slide rules.</p></div>		</li>
