			<div class="markdown"><p>I use it for organizing events and groups often, which involves lots of names/descriptions. I'm 16 though, so maybe in the future I'll use it for taxes or something and use numbers a lot more.
Thanks for the answer :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep using it for everything. Watch YouTube videos, and google how to use formulas. Maybe at 16 you are not using it &quot;correctly&quot; or to its full potential, but if you use it often you will learn to master it. I first started using excel to organize information for a student organization. Now I use it every day at work, and those skills have helped get me several promotions. Really knowing how to use excel will set you apart--and make many tasks much easier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is good. You should give us a &quot;how to fuck up a spreadsheet in 10 steps&quot; list so we can be sure to avoid those common mistakes.</p>
<p>One thing I learned recently: seperate data from the presentation of said data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something that I often feel like people don't really get until they are told about it. The idea is called <em>Separation of Concerns</em> in the software development world and its pretty obvious and simple once you realize it. The problem is that people often don't realize this until after they've compiled and visualized some dataset and then someone asks &quot;So can I use this for XYZ also?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>The logical endpoint of that is to use databases (such as Access) and views rather than spreadsheets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>99% of the time users are using Excel because it's easy to manipulate (sort, filter, transform) the data and the underlying schema.</p>
<p>You often lose that flexibility when you go to a db and offering views.</p>
<p>Power Query is the best compromise I have seen so far.  You get to keep your data safe in a DB and not on someone's desktop; they get to submit queries via Excel instead of SSMS and manipulate the resulsets all they want with actually less chance of choking Excel.</p></div>		</li>
