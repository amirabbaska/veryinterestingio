			<div class="markdown"><p>At 80 degrees latitude, you would still be going at 180 mph.  At 82.5 degrees, the latitude of Alert, Canada, the highest latitude town in the world, you would be going 136 mph.  At 87.5 degrees, you would be going 45 mph, which would probably be survivable in most cases.  Since there are no research stations in Antarctica between 82.5 and 90 degrees latitude, the only place on the ground where you would be safe is the Amundsen-Scott South Pole station, where you would barely feel anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, assuming you're in Antarctica and it's just a bunch of smooth snow or snowpack, I'd wager that you could survive a speed much higher than 45mph, you'd just be sliding along the snow or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about being in a transportation vehicle.i would assume any land vehicle wouldnt have time to decelerate before hitting something, but what about boats, ships, submarines, airplanes, would it be possible for these to come to a halt after some time.</p></div>		</li>
