			<div class="markdown"><p>I work as an electrical engineer (my master was in power electronics, so I've taken courses in high voltage engineering as well), and this is the best answer I've seen yet in this thread. </p>
<p>I'd also like to add something my professor told me: apparently lightning acts as a constant current source. This means that even if you try and &quot;outsmart&quot; the lightning by increasing your resistance, e.g. wearing rubber shoes or whatever your best idea is, this will only increase the voltage, and therefore the power, that goes into your body if you get struck. </p>
<p>I always found this very fascinating. Anyway, I thought it was good that you included the &quot;not enough to cook you&quot; concept in your post. The power in lightning is tremendous, but the total amount of energy in lightning is relatively low, due to the very short time it flows through whatever it strikes. It's this fact, that the total energy transferred by the lightning bolt is low, that makes it so it doesn't &quot;cook you&quot;, as you put it :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of people don't understand the neurological damage that occurs. I was hit by a side flash when our church got struck by lightning. I was holding open the front door and the current went down the metal doorframe, through my fingertips and back into the doorframe near my elbow.</p>
<p>Beside losing about 10-15% feeling in my arm, mainly in my fingertips, my arm was all pins and needles for 6 months. My arm muscles locked up for about 2-3 years after that any time I had to use it for anything like heavy lifting. That was the extent of physical damage.</p>
<p>But I did have a slight change in personality and lasting issues with muscle spasms during sleep and insomnia that plague me to this day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, getting hit by lightning isn't a once and done deal. There are a lot of lasting issues you get to deal with for the rest of your life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait wait wait. The voltage is the weight of the car and the amperage is like the speed of the car? If this is correct then it is by far the best analogy for it. Thank you sir.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A better analogy is a pipe of water. Voltage is the pressure, amperage is the volume.</p>
<p>A huge volume of water slowly sheeting over your head (waterfall) could be harmless. A tiny, high pressure stream (waterjer) could kill you in the right spot.</p>
<p>In this case, a true lightning bolt (not a streamer) is like a flash flood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more like a huge, high pressure water jet that could go straight through your chest and leave a hole.</p></div>		</li>
