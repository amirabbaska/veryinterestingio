<p>Having so much energy on a naval gun makes me wonder if potential targets like other ships might just behave like piece of paper. Or maybe the projectile deforms and manages to transfer the energy anyway.</p>

<p>Even for conventional guns this is true. Naval armor is essentially counterproductive in modern naval combat - you slow your ship down and make it more vulnerable. It is better instead to build our ship with an eye toward <em>containment</em> of damage rather than invulnerability to it. Any hit on a modern naval ship results in casualties, full stop. </p>
<p>The key competitive attributes for railguns in an anti-shipping context is their long range, high rapidity, low detectability, and deep magazine. A navy equipped with them would be able to engage targets outside the range of their weapons, engage them rapidly and incapacitate them, and move on with a low probability of being detected. </p>
<p>In other words, a railgun Navy would be practically <em>unstoppable</em> and <em>without peer</em> until other navies are similarly equipped. Think ironclads in the 19th century. </p>

<p>Additionally does this type of artillery have the potential for precision anti-aircraft / missiles / drones?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be showing my ignorance here. But do navy ships even engage other ships?</p>
<p>My understanding was that navy ships mostly served as weapons platforms that engaged air or ground targets. </p>
<p>I think I also recall hearing that the US navy is so much larger and more powerful than any other navy in the world that we don't really have a rival. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Navies aren't really for fighting other ships anymore, a lot of the future of railguns will be hitting land-based targets from hundreds of miles away. Missiles, torpedoes and aircraft attack are plenty to handle other ships. The main goal of the Navy in a future conflict would be transport and attack while remaining hidden.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They are not, and that's been proven again and again.  It's a warfare truism just like the need for infantry.  </p>
<p>At sometime in the future, the USN will be utterly dependent on the Surface Navy to secure or hold a strategic objective, when subs, planes, missiles, and torpedoes just won't do.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So that's why, in all sci-fi settings, railguns always have hypervelocity projectiles in common! But this scattered projectiles thing is new to me; any detailed explanations of railgun damage I have read/heard have assumed that it's a single, small, solid projectile that does all its damage thanks to its basically-infinite penetration and the shockwaves it causes. Is that a feasible method of exploiting this &quot;without limit&quot; energy delivery, or is the scatter shot always going to be more useful?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that depends on your target: is the maximum damage effect going to be caused by penetration? </p>
<p>Think about two problems the railgun can solve: long-range fire support and rapid aerial target interdiction (essentially, AA.) Is it useful, in operational context, to expend one round to defeat one target? </p>
<p>Consider the following scenario: a Navy cruiser is dispatched to provide fire support for ground operations with a limited contingent of Marines. The Marines engage heavy resistance, including armor, and call for support. A singly-penetrating round would destroy, at most, one enemy unit; it would almost certainly incapacitate it, but would that be sufficient fire support? Most of that energy would be wasted, as a single armored unit probably requires much less to defeat. Instead, spreading the projectile energy over <em>multiple targets</em> would be more effective.</p>
<p>What about single targets, like a single inbound ICBM? Railguns provide a major advantage over rocket interceptors by rapidly closing to the target. This <em>minimizes uncertainty</em> in the location of the ICBM, which will attempt to defeat countermeasures by making its trajectory difficult to predict. In that case it is still ideal to use submunitions to expand the effective radius of the railgun projectile - you don't have to expend hundreds of megajoules to break an ICBM. </p>
<p>The only conceivable circumstance I can think of where maximizing penetration is desirable is when defeating armor or cover. Railgun projectiles will simply move too quickly to build effective armor against, so you are left with deep penetration of underground targets. This would nevertheless not be very effective, since the projectile will rapidly lose energy as it passes through the ground. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think railguns are the best solution to armor anyway. At that rate you may as well opt for cluster munitions dropping shaped-charge bomblets on the roofs. They are much better suited to strategic targets, like engaging static headquarters deep in enemy territory, engaging capital ships, maybe attacking missile installation or damaging airfields? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would we predict the location of an IBM, anyway? You say that the IBM is designed to product location ambiguity, and that the railgun is superior to the traditional countermeasures because it closes the gap much more closely, but how do we determine the location of the IBM to begin with? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atmosphere and guidance.</p>
<p>Truly limitless kinetic energy per round only makes sense in vacuum where projectiles are not going to melt, slow down, or instantly explode from air resistance. For non-space ships there will probably never be railguns throwing projectiles much beyond 6 km/s. </p>
<p>The Navy's guns were originally imagined as having a marginal cost of a few dollars per shot. Now it's $800,000 per round because they needed a guidance system on the projectile which would survive being thrown out of a railgun. Hitting a target from hundreds of miles away without guidance turned out to be hard.</p>
<p>There's a physics simulator game called <em>Children of a Dead Earth</em> which I recommend if you want to play with speculative railgun designs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To be fair, these are still experimental systems, not deployment systems - they are expensive. Though I don't expect modern contractors to produce anything cheap. Its a problem really with defense contractors rather than the technology itself.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The $800k per round you're referencing was for the AGS for the Zumwalts. That whole subproject was a mess, and the price reflected a massive R&amp;D budget amortized over a small number of rounds. Unsurprisingly the Navy opted to <em>not</em> buy the system and rounds at that pricing. The number doesn't have any bearing on the railgun or HVP projects.</p>
<p>We don't know the final pricing on the railgun rounds, but it's safe to say they won't be $800k. The navy, army, and marines are interested in the version of the railgun round adapted to conventional guns precisely because it promises a lot of capabilities in a low cost munition.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Scale that up to as many projectiles as possible that will still punch through a target, and you are turning a large/powerful rifle into a large/powerful shotgun. </p></div>		</li>
