			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone else alluded to, the shape of the lens (in the front of your eye) is changed by using the muscles in and surrounding the eye, enabling one to focus the light that reaches your retina in order to better be able to see. This process is achieved through squinting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No. A pinhole camera can render distant objects clearly. </p>
<p>The aperture size has an inverse relationship on resolution (you'll never see man-sized craters on the moon with a pinhole camera), but no effect on focusing distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In geometric optics, yes. But in real life we have to consider wave optics. In the limit of a small pinhole, the image degrades entirely. This is why lenses get softer as you stop down from the middle of the f/# range: the small aperatyre has erased all the aberrations and so stopping down more just degrades the image.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, a whole lot of almost-right things here, but mostly very wrong.</p>
<p>A smaller iris doesn't allow sharper vision. What is actually going on is that your eye's lens has aberrations that increase towards its edges. Block those edges out by making the iris smaller, and you see sharper (but less light gets in). So, what makes &quot;stopping down&quot; or looking through a small hole in your fingers work is simply that you are blocking the most blurry light rays from the edges of the lens.</p>
<p>In fact, a larger iris would allow a sharper image, if your eyes had lenses that weren't worse at the edges. This is limited by the Rayleigh Criterion, which in turn is due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The least-resolvable angle is proportional to the inverse of the aperture:
theta ~= 1.22 D / wavelength</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The size of the lense, on the other hand, makes no difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dead wrong, as the previous paragraph points out. The size of the USED PORTION of the lens impacts both the aberrations allowed through (which, for simple lenses, increase with radius) and the Rayleigh limit on the resolution a perfect lens could achieve.</p>
<p>Now, human eyes are very, very far from having perfect lenses. Obviously - there are animals with better vision than we have, and many of them (eagles) have smaller eyes (which have larger Rayleigh limits on their resolution - bigger openings allow finer detail through a perfect lens). And human eyes vary widely from person to person. I am diopter 12 nearsighted without correction, which means (in layman terms) I can't see shit beyond my nose (pretty much). The correction for this actually demagnifies (reduces) things on my eye, meaning what would cover two rods on your eye might only cover one rod on mine. Rods and cones are the two types of light-receivers in your eye; they are the equivalent of pixels on a camera detector. Ergo, my ability to see detail - even after I put on glasses to correct my vision - is half of a normal person's.</p>
<p>Now, suppose an animal evolves rods that are one-half the size of human eye rod cells. That animal could, if its eye lenses were good enough (and the diameter of the eye wide enough), see things twice as well as humans can.</p>
<p>OR... the animal could evolve eyes with more curvature. That's the equivalent of having higher-power binoculars. It would see more sharply... but less widely. Maybe it could see a mouse a mile away... but not a predator just to the right of its field of view. Pretty ugly tradeoff.</p>
<p>HOWEVER... biological lenses aren't made of glass; they can flex. Muscles in the eye can actually change that curvature. Typically this is used to adjust focus - which is called &quot;accommodation&quot;, something people under 40 have more of than I do (sucks to be me). But if used to an extreme, it can be used to change eyesight from seeing pretty much everything all around you (but not sharply) to seeing extremely well (but only in a small area). I honestly don't know if animals like eagles do this, but it would make sense. The odds of someone sneaking up on an eagle in midair are somewhat low, after all, and once it lands it can revert to seeing all around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am physicist working in optics and in my opinion this person has it right.</p>
<p>I would add that the Rayleigh criterion you cite is that way because we cannot, contrary to what one might have learned in school with geometric optics, image a point to a point. Because of an aperture (pupil/camera objective) in the system cutting off some of the electromagnetic field of the source point, we cannot put it back together to a point. Part of the field gets lost and the result is diffraction at an aperture, with which a theoretical point on the object gets imaged into this so called Airy disk. This fundamentally limits the resolution of an image and if this is the only source of disturbance in or image, it's the best optical system we can have (a diffraction limited optical system). So, an image is made up of the sum of blurry spots and how blurry they are is dependant on the ratio between wavelength and diameter of the aperture. The more of the electromagnetic field from the object we gather, the less blurry the image of a point can become and the more detail we can resolve.</p>
<p>Someone hit me if I made a mistake as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is there a biological limit to the curvature of an eye's lens?  And can a smaller, more curved lens be adjusted as readily?  It would seem to me there is a volume to circumference ratio involved, so that it wouldn't scale linearly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In theory yes, but in practice this isn't possible. Don't forget, that simple lens objective (like eye is) is riddled with optical aberrations. In photographic lenses these are minimized by complex designs that contain many lenses (having more than ten isn't unusual).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, at the extreme that's true, but a minor telescopic ability might still be possible.</p>
<p>IRDK if such a magnification has any real-world survival benefits. I DO know that my myopia was so extreme I basically have 3x vision up close - my near point is so close that I can focus on objects 3x closer than most people, allowing me to see 3x as much detail.</p>
<p>But now I have ICL implants, and can no longer due that. As an optical engineer, seeing small defects was occasionally handy - but a $10 magnifying lens worked equally well. It was useful for seeing small splinters. But mostly... useless.</p>
<p>Now, my curvature PROBABLY has nothing to do with survival adaptation (one in a million humans need magnified vision in order for the species to continue? Unlikely) and more to do with maladaptation (I would be effectively blind without modern glasses). But the mechanism is possible for 3x up-close &quot;microscopic&quot; magnification. It might be possible for telescopic vision as well. </p></div>		</li>
