			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a beauty on my head from being hit with a pool cue, it has definitely calmed down over the last 20 years, it was very obvious at first but not so much now, the lack of hair in that area ofc helps to show it more, what's going on?
Bonus question, I burnt myself quite badly on the underside of my forearm with hot fat, the area that received the burn produces more hair( at least darker thicker hair)
How can this be explained?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Head Scar smoothing - When you were first injured your body did several things to help heal that wound. First, it opened the blood vessels and started pouring out certain kinds of cells (macrophages in particular, to eat damaged and dead cells), the mechanisms of inflammation and granulation (redness, swelling, clotting, forming scabs, beginning to lay down collagen fibrous tissue) all caused a raised and very vascularised (heavy bloodflow to the area) scar. As it healed, your body will have rerouted many small capillaries to the area. This leaves you with a bright, raised scar. Over the years, your body has slowly (as needed) closed off or increased blood flow to some of those capillaries as they are no longer needed in such numbers, or can be normalised in the scarred area and some of the collagen fibers have been supplanted with your normal skin cells (mostly along the edge of the scar). This flattens and removes much of the colouring from the scar making it far less obvious. This is also why some smaller scars disappear altogether to the naked eye.</p>

<li>Your burn scar - Scars do not actually grow hair as they don't have hair follicles. Any hair which appears to be growing out of your scar is actually growing from a nearby hair follicle and coming up through the scar tissue making it look like the hair is growing from your scar. As for why it is thicker and darker, it's possible that nearby hair follicles were seriously damaged in the burn, leading them to produce different hair than the other follicles in the area. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scars are not wounds that have healed correctly, otherwise we would be covered in scars from every scratch we get. Scars are the body's quick-fix to get a breach repaired, at the cost of not being made of the original organ's tissue, thereby decreasing the efficiency of the organ the scar is on.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically you are covered in scars from every scratch you get. Not all wounds require enough scar tissue to leave a visible scar, but all wounds heal in essentially the same way. While not ideal and certainly not the same as the original tissue, scarring is absolutely the way your body is designed to heal. When I said &quot;correct&quot; and &quot;proper&quot; I meant only that the body was functioning as it is designed and not that it was the most perfect solution to an injury. Biology is messy and imperfect unfortunately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you there.</p>
<p>We just seem to have different definitions of what &quot;correct&quot; and &quot;proper&quot; mean. Intended, yes, correct and proper, no. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why can't you just slowly work on a bigger scar then? Can you remove a small amount, let it heal properly and then remove another small amount until it's fully gone?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With a bigger scar you would just be making a bigger and bigger hole, it works with a smaller scar because the two ends of skin can be drawn together.</p>
<p>With larger scars it is possible to remove them, but you're getting into more advanced plastic surgery techniques like putting a small saline balloon under the skin to help stretch it, making more skin to fill the deficit or even skin grafting. Both of these methods are how larger scars are dealt with to make them much less noticeable. </p>
<p>The last few years have given us various research projects into stem cells which theoretically could be used to fill the gap and heal without a scar, but again that's a pretty serious form of medical intervention and it would only really be used in situations where the wound is so large your body won't survive unless it's closed rather than left open to granulate (e.g. large full-thickness burns) </p></div>		</li>
