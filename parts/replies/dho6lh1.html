			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh right. Correct my thinking.</p>
<p>If we know the momentum of an electron really well and we then stream photons at the atom, we'd still get Compton scattering regardless of how well we know the electrons instantaneous position.</p>
<p>So I think there's no way to get a shadow the &quot;size&quot; of an electron on a screen with resolution smaller than the frequency parameter of the incident photons.</p>
<p>I.e. Atoms are always fuzzy</p></div>		</li>
