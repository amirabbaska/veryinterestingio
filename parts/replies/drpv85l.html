			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I’ve only tried taking it twice, and never bothered again. It puts me in this weird half state, where I’m drowsy, but still mentally awake. It gets irritating af because I’ll be stuck in that half drowsy state, but can’t get past that, so eventually I get a minor headache and mental irritation (similar to how you feel if somebody wakes you up abruptly in the middle of the night), and my brain starts racing and thinking about incoherent random shit, the sort of mental effects you get when you’re on the verge of falling asleep and right before you lose consciousness... and I’ll just lay there awake in that half state for fucking hours before I finally get a few hours of shitty sleep, and wake up in the morning feeling as if I just blinked and hadn’t slept at all. </p>
<p>I don’t know how common that it is because my roommate says that those drugs knock him the fuck out and gives him the best sleep of his life lol and as an insomniac, I can only wish that were the case for me. </p>
<p>I prefer ashwagandha if I need some help getting to sleep. Not only does it make you physically tired and sleepy, but it shuts you up mentally and actually lets you get to sleep, instead of keeping you in some half awake/sleep state limbo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I completely agree. I've heard many people say melatonin doesn't do anything for them but it pretty much always puts me out like a light. The only disadvantage I've noticed is that if once it kicks in and you feel sleepy you don't immediately go to bed it doesn't work to get you to sleep </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, melatonin is my first step on sleepless nights and it handles sleeping problems most if the time for me. I also don't feel weird the next day after using it. The only issues I've had were before I found the dose that works for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My circadian rhythm slips out of whack when it gets the chance, but what I've found helps is to just never sleep in. Set your alarm for a reasonable hour and throw yourself  out of bed before you doze off again, even if you only got 3 or 4 hours of sleep. Then later at night rather than your brain thinking &quot;I've been awake for 'x' amount of hours I must sleep now&quot; it thinks &quot;i should go to sleep now to get up the same time I did this morning&quot;. Do not ignore that sleepy feeling whether you're in the middle of a game or watching a movie or anything, that's what causes the circadian rhythm to shift.</p></div>		</li>
