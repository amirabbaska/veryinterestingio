			<div class="markdown"><p>To put in modern terms, if you are a redneck from TN and decide to move out to a big city, even close by Nashville, the way you look/dress/speak/act will all impact what kind of job you get, what housing you can rent, what friends you have, etc.  Also, rednecks are usually happy people who love the woods and 4 wheelers, why would they want to move to a city and work in an autoshop?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for pointing out my error.</p>
<p>I just learnt that I used the correct term Indentured servitude instead of self. Also the indentured servants were from Europe and not just England. </p>
<p>Deleted my previous comment because I don't know how to strike out on  Reddit on my tiny phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indentured Servitude is different from serfdom. If you're an I.S. you've made a deal with someone to sponsor your trip over and you would work for a certain number of years and then you were free to live your life. As a serf you were born, lived, and died on the same plot of land your forefathers were born, lived, and died on. You were bound to the land, unable to move away. The lord of the manor had total rights over you and your family. He could do to/with you whatever he wanted, including raping and killing. You couldn't do this to an I.S. This practice was eliminated in most of Europe during the Renaissance, but did continue in the Russian Empire until the late 19th century.
America never had serfdom. SLAVERY yes; but serfdom? No, America came after serfdom was extinguished.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you're raised poor, used to being commanded, it will be very difficult to reverse that. Some people can do it, but most will soon give away tells about their &quot;true&quot; nature. </p>
<p>And go back 50 years, when there was no internet, almost no tv, and radio was not enough to make you aware of the fact that most of this system was not something in your blood. Most of these people didn't get education I guess. Everything in their life and upraising has programmed to being low-caste, not only you yourself, but your parents, your friends, family, colleagues, everybody confirms this one way or another. Very few people will be able to beat that. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: I'm not Indian and don't know much about the caste system. This is based on general assumptions about human behavior. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've kind of experienced this. My family didn't believe in the caste system. My grandpa was a community organizer in a large city, and often worked on helping poor people get access to government services. He often called people home. They would squat on the floor, and be very uncomfortable if asked to sit next to my grandpa on the couch. My grams would serve them food in the kitchen, and it scared them. </p>
<p>Some of those people of lower castes got with the program, but some others badmouthed my family for being weirdo pushovers. Some others considered this a license to ask for more and more and one lady actually yells at my grandpa, 'you have a fucking large house, what, you can't loan me a few thousand rupees for my new business?'. I think that was the first time I heard my grandpa swear..</p></div>		</li>
