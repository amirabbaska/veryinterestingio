			<div class="markdown"><p>Master Chocolatier, here. This is actually the correct answer, though it's somewhat more complex. Flavor perception happens entirely in your brain. External stimuli (sight, sound, through-the-nose smell) cause your brain to recall/construct a mental model of the flavor experience, then internal stimuli (taste, spiciness, through-the-through aroma) augment and update that model. Finally, your brain projects the the result into your mouth (sort of like ventriloquism), where you perceive it as flavor.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of research work in this field over the past decade or so. Search for multisensory flavor perception or neurogastronomy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is that so different than any other sense? It's a receptor being stimulated by an outside force (chemical composition, heat, radiation, pressure) and sending it to your brain you interpret.  We compartmentalize these senses because of the different functions they serve in our existence.  I can recall the face of a friend, how it felt when I touched a hot pan, the sound of my wife's voice, the smell of fresh cut grass, and the taste of my favorite dessert.  I don't see how they are that different other than the methods used to generate a stimulus to a specific external condition.</p>
<p>If you're arguing that taste intermingles different senses with more complexity, I'd still disagree. Does the feeling of being at the beach only make you recall the image of waves crashing on the shore, or is there also sense memory of the heat of the sun, the wind blowing in your hair, and the sound of seagulls?  When you smell a perfume don't you also recall the face of your ex who wore it and the feelings (not a part of this but still tangentially relevant) you had?  We're constantly intermingling all of the senses into our memories every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good question. All your other senses work by a set of receptors sending messages to your brain. Done. Flavor is different--it incorporates <em>all</em> your senses and blends them into a single model.</p>
<p>Don't confuse the mental model with the senses that create the model. You feel the warmth of the sun on your face, which recalls a mental model, but the warmth is still just the warmth, not all those associated memories and concepts of the beach. Flavor <em>is</em> the model. A food can actually taste bad to you because you last ate it with your ex, or can taste saltier because you last ate it at the beach and the smell of salt in your nostrils is part of your mental model.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't even remember where I heard of it, bit for some reason the question is triggering the phrase &quot;mirror neurons&quot; or something?</p>
<p>I think it has to do with how your brain responds to recalling something like a taste or smell or pain. It sends the same signals as if you had actually done it. </p>
<p>But I just googled it and found this &quot;Mirror neurons are a type of brain cell that respond equally when we perform an action and when we witness someone else perform the same action.&quot;</p>
<p>So maybe I'm wrong about it's relation to memory. I thought there was some kind of loose connection. </p></div>		</li>
