			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, a HUGE amount of the stuff that Congress votes on does not actually matter in any way. For example, in the 112th Congress (Elected 2010, serving 2011-2013) there were over 1,600 &quot;votes,&quot; but only 15 major pieces of legislation passed. There are lots of procedural votes, non-binding resolutions like Congress thanking the Red Cross for existing, votes on minor things like renaming post offices (which does indeed require an act of Congress), etc. </p>
<p>So in the 112th Congress, you could have voted on every major piece of legislation that passed, and all nine major items that did NOT pass, and you'd still have been present for 1.3% of the total votes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of post offices don't really have specific names, rather being referred to by where they are. However, sometimes a post office will be renamed in honor of a person from that town or area who's done something interesting or worthy of note. When it comes to Congress changing names, that's almost always a soldier from that town who was killed in action being honored for bravery. Congress changes probably 100 or so post office names a year. </p>
<p>(I should correct what I said earlier; it IS possible for the Postal Service to change a PO name, but only in cases where the person being honored has been dead at least 10 years. It's not common though.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of them are named, usually after some local hero or historical figure. </p>
<p>For example, the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-105publ162/content-detail.html" target="_blank">Public Law 105-162</a> designates the post office in Paterson NJ as the Lary Doby Post Office, after the first African-American to play baseball in the American League. </p>
<p>Lary Doby lived in Paterson NJ for a while, and that was one of the ways they wanted to honor him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look them up at USPS.gov (or .com), yes, sort of. Every Post Office has a unique 'name' of sorts, although the vast majority of them are just place names. It's a great way to learn about villages, though, as only a minority are 'central' or 'main' POs and most of the rest are various 'stations' that carry the name of the village or neighbourhood they're in. (The 'station' nomenclature is inherited from the older rail-oriented mail system, where most smaller POs were literally located at rail stations.)</p>
<p>Traditionally (meaning here more accurately historically), satellite Post Offices follow the human-scale geography that USPS grew up in. Those names reflect that historical geography.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;High concept&quot; actually means the opposite of what it sounds like. It doesn't mean literary or high-class... it means &quot;striking and easily communicable.&quot; For instance, &quot;Snakes on a Plane&quot; is high concept, because you get the whole idea from the title. So most Adam Sandler movies are actually pretty high concept. (i.e. Happy Gilmore is &quot;An angry hockey player takes up golf to save his grandma's house&quot;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. </p>
<p>Sometimes a vote will be crucial enough that the Congressional  leaders and their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip_%28politics%29" target="_blank">whips</a> make sure that everyone will be there to vote, and vote a certain way.  It also allows a candidate to avoid going on record as supporting X or voting against Y, so that they can cast the widest net for potential supporters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A real world example of this would be the Affordable Care Act. The bill itself is made up of a bunch of smaller bills. Republicans, knowing it would pass, framed much of he smaller bills, bills that were passed by unanimous consent or by other unreported procedural votes. Then, when the big vote came, they all got to vote &quot;no&quot; even though they voted in favor of the individual segments of the bill. That's right, big bad obamacare is full of irrelevant provisions that benefit republican states, policies, and politicians directly. </p>
<p>This happens constantly in Washington. Senators and Congresspeople tag bills that benefit their electorate (like funding a local project) onto larger bills they know will pass. In the opposite way, a senator could appease a constituent by adding special provisions to a bill they know will never pass. </p>
<p>Basically, it's all a bunch of bullshit. Dozens of bills are passed every year that don't get reported on. Democrats and republicans are guilty of political price fixing, where they choose the debates they will fight, and respect the issues they agree to ignore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Legislation is more like a poker game than many might think.  If I, as a party leader, say I have X number of votes for or against, it may take some cajoling and coercing to produce those votes.  I have not seen House of Cards but I do understand that Underwood starts as Majority Whip in the House.  For a real-life analogue that you might already know something about, look at Lyndon Johnson's career in the House and Senate - he was a minority whip and a majority leader before he became Vice President.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most work of Congress (debates, amendments, etc.) does not require a quorum. That being said, the chair of either chamber can, with a vote of the present members, order the Sargent at Arms to compel the attendance of members who are not present. (This obviously happened in House of Cards) This can include arresting them and forcing them into the chamber. But that is really usually not an issue. If everyone has to go back to their districts for something, they will cancel sessions. And even if 13 Senators are running for President and never show up, 87 are still there so they don't hurt Quorum. </p>
<p>This is really a bigger problem in the state legislatures. A group of them could leave the state, and thus escape the jurisdiction of their chamber's arrest authority, in order to stop the passage of a bill. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partially correct.</p>
<p>Another reason--the moment that someone gets elected to Congress, one of their main jobs is <strong><em>to get re-elected to Congress</em></strong>.  This involves meeting with supporters, donors, <strong>courting potential donors and supporters</strong>, hosting fundraisers, meeting with lobbyists, and similar activities.  All of which leave precious little time for legislating for all but the most controversial bills, or bills close to the congresscritter's heart/wallet.</p></div>		</li>
