			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, is this in New York only, or is it a widespread thing for all phones and their local areas? I'm in Vancouver, BC and never once received one of these.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Florida has an Amber Alert system that is broadcast to phones. Really unnerving the first time I heard it. </p>
<p>Really unfortunately; the alerts often contain little information. I'm all for the system, but &quot;Look out for a grey sedan!&quot;  Just isn't as helpful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just had my phone give an Amber Alert for the first time last week. Both my phone and my husband's started making an alarm that sounded like the National Weather Service alerts. Scared the bajeezus out of both of us.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the child was located with her captor less than 40 minutes after the alert was posted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had one go off at passport control in SF airport, it was deafening having hundreds go off in one area nearly simultaneously. People thought it was an airport alarm till we realized it was just each of our phones going crazy.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes indeed they do, my smartphone went off as well as my dads old flip phone! That was a stunner to see that even the old phones receive them. Here is an example of one that recently happened near me( and it makes an alarm sound). <a href="https://cdn.ampproject.org/i/s/i1.wp.com/www.gottabemobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Android-Amber-Alerts.jpg?resize=720%2C540" target="_blank">Picture </a> </p></div>		</li>
