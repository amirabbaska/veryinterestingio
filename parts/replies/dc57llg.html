			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add to your citrus comment by pointing out that in many cases even the seedlings of a citrus are clones of the mother plant.  Due to a quirk in citrus seed development many breeds make a zygotic ovum and then keep making &quot;ovums&quot; out of the mother plant's cells.  As such if you plant something like a Ruby Red grapefruit seed you can be relatively certain that any seedling you get is a clone, however other citrus like a Meyer lemons will almost always be a ordinary two parent hybrid.</p>
<p>Of course the down side is even with the clonal seed you still have the multi year juvenile period, which makes grafting the better option even for varieties that come true from seed.</p></div>		</li>
