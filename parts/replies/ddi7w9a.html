<p>This one family of over 10 people liked me on the first visit, so I got to know them. They'd drive about 20 miles after church on Sunday to go there.</p>
<p>About the fifth visit, they started complaining. By the 10th visit, they had gotten comp'd about $500 (gross) in food. My manager asked them to never come back as they weren't welcome, as it was always nit picks. Our food was fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I work customers are free to berate us until the cows come home. I've been yelled at, physically threated, insulted, and more but I couldn't do more than ask them to stop and even then the company went out of their way to appease them and then it becomes an issue of what I did to them. I'm not trained in proper de-escalation, how is it my fault that the customer threatened to beat me up once I left the store? So I get in trouble because the customer was an ass hole to me and the customer gets whatever they want. It's really shitty. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you brought up the fact you 'weren't trained in proper   de-escalation' I think that says a lot about your self consciousness. The thing is, from the companies point of view there is an expectation of aligned vision toward the customer, and that includes common sense de-escalation tactics. Good companies esteem training and coaching when the expectations aren't met. Communicating your lack of alignment or understanding to a good employer shows courage and commitment to equalibrium in employee employer relationship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment is absolutely brilliant. The only thing I'd like to point out is that large retail stores actually typically make less per transaction, but the large amount of transactions enables them to turn a profit. That's why they need to worry a lot more about retaining customers. </p>
<p>Otherwise, a very thoughtful &amp; insightful post, thank you.</p></div>		</li>
