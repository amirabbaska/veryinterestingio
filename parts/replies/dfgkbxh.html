			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking on top comment:</p>
<p>I work at an inpatient psych hospital so maybe can provide some insight.</p>
<p>If a pt comes in late on a Friday night, they will not be meeting with their assigned treatment team until Monday. The normal psychiatrists, therapists, and social workers work a standard Mon-Fri schedule. The pt may only be evaluated as needed by the weekend doctors/practitioners.</p>
<p>For us (in Minnesota at least) the <strong>72 hour hold will not begin until the pt has start receiving their individualized treatment</strong> which in this case would be on Monday.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As the hospital have no legal basis for holding her?</p></div>		</li>
