			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why glass technology is pretty cool. You can dope ions into the glass surface which put it into compression so each time the crack tries to grow it gets pushed shut, and it takes a much higher stress to actually make it crack. See gorilla glass and ceramic knives (yttria stabilized zirconia). </p></div>		</li>

<p>This volume change during transformation is also what gives quench-and-tempered steel its strength.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mechanical Engineer here-The volume change is not what gives quenching and tempering steel it's strength and there is no volume change that causes a material in tension to act in compression. In fact it is impossible to make a material entirely behave like that, there have to be tensile forces resisting the tension. </p>
<p>Quenching-You heat it to a temperature that forms a crystal structure(Austenite) that when cooled very rapidly(quenched) it forms a crystal structure formed of very small crystals(Martensite).</p>
<p>When a metal is composed of much small crystals it's hardness, strength, and the amount of force needed to break the material can increase multiple times.</p>
<p>This is entirely what gives steel it's strength.</p>
<p>The crystals inside metals are uniform and slip easiest along certain planes within themselves. As you increase the number of crystals the planes that they slip on easiest line up less and less, and it takes a higher amount of energy to cause the slipping to occur.</p>
<p>Tempering- You can hold steel at a certain temperature and cool it at a certain rate to create different types of crystal structures with different hardnesses, strengths, and workability among other things.</p>
<p>Neither quenching nor tempering causes steel to increase in volume and act in compression when under a tensile load. It simple changes the crystal structure. These crystal structures all stretch and deform even under the slightest loads, always in tension, unless under a compressive force of course.</p>
<p>Cold working the metal can cause a large number of dislocations inside the crystals. These dislocations repel each other and can cause very small compressive forces inside the material, but they simply negate some of the tensile forces. They don't increase the volume of the structure itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just curious, because it appears you were incorrect with your final point, did you presume that final point, or misinterpret it when originally hearing it? It seems like something you would have had to explicitly learned to make that claim. Many threads on here follow this exact trend; answer, more in depth answer, answer that disproves more in depth answer, etc. The majority of us are left reading and taking time to think about these answers only to have to &quot;un-learn&quot; them seconds later, or we're just left with two answers and no way to know which is correct, etc. Not saying this is your fault obviously, I just wish we could get to a point where people only present things as facts when they are sure they are, indeed, facts. Otherwise, present the thought as a possibility, or a question to others.</p></div>		</li>

Unlike at least half the people I know who have or have had iPhones, though they probably managed to just do more damage to theirs than I did with mine but still. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I put a tempered glass screen protector on my Galaxy S3.  The screen protector was sticky, it didn't just stick by friction/static electricity.  It never shattered and I dropped quite a bit.  I feel like the screen protector held the screen together by &quot;pulling&quot; it in a way preventing it from shattering.  Is that possible?</p></div>		</li>

<p>What happened is that your cheap fifteen dollar protector broke. That's it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way in which it lands will also influence the amount of force that is transmitted to the screen, and therefore its likelihood of breaking. Landing just the wrong way from a fairly low height could cause much more damage than a longer fall that lands in a better way. </p></div>		</li>
