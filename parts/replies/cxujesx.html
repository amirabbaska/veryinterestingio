			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why glass technology is pretty cool. You can dope ions into the glass surface which put it into compression so each time the crack tries to grow it gets pushed shut, and it takes a much higher stress to actually make it crack. See gorilla glass and ceramic knives (yttria stabilized zirconia). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love the gorilla glass screen on my Nexus 4, over two years of use and even accidentally being drop kicked with my steel toes and not a single scratch or blemish. Unlike at least half the people I know who have or have had iPhones, though they probably managed to just do more damage to theirs than I did with mine but still. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's really more to the person than the devices, I have had Nexus 4, Nexus 5, iPhone 4, iPhone 6 (which I'm still using), and none have broke or crack on me, and I'm not even the most careful person (dropped my iPhone 6 while camping on a sandy ground, and my N5 has dropped from my pocket onto concrete floor)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen this said way too many times. The fact that your screen protector cracked does not mean your screen would have broken if the protector had not been there.</p>
<p>What happened is that your cheap fifteen dollar protector broke. That's it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've serviced thousands of phones with those protectors in perfect condition and the display glass cracked. I'm sure it works to a degree, but I've seen way too many cases where it did clearly nothing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point I wonder if it would help bond the cracks together a bit, or hold them in place , like laminated glass. </p></div>		</li>
