			<p>Adblock does add to a percentage of users who are getting web content without the return that the people who paid for it want - the attention to and possibly clicks on their ads. However the website provider has already been paid so its only the sponsor that suffers, marketing networks.  <br>Adblock can keep loud audio ads from playing, keep pop-ins from covering the content, and can even crowbar commercials out of videos. A secondary benefit is that pages load noticeably faster when using it.  <br>I recommend a second measure on top of Adblock: in your browser's settings, under Plugins, set them only to play once clicked. This affects most video/audio ads, and while it adds an extra click to any video, there's nothing like finishing a page ten seconds faster and seeing all the animated ads waiting to be clicked to play. Knowing that some of them might have been audio, or thrown animations over the main page body.</p>		</li>

			<p>Some sites detect it and you can't view content.   Sometimes Hulu does it. </p>		</li>

			<p>You can disable it with only a couple of clicks for that site though, then refresh like nothing happened.</p>		</li>

			<p>It breaks an unspoken contract that you have with the website.<br><br>You are consuming their content and the price for that is having the ad present on the page. I'm a strong believer that if the content is good enough for me to want to visit the page, the price of the ad is worth paying. However if the ad is TOO obtrusive, I will stop visiting the site as the price is too high. I take my clicks (and therefore my virtual business) elsewhere.<br><br>If you follow.</p>		</li>

			<p>I sort if agree, however pop up ads and ads with loud volumes, etc have broken that trust, plus as another poster points out, some advertisers attach malware in secret to their ads. </p>		</li>
