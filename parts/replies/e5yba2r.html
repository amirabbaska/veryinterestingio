<p>It think the dropped ball would quickly reach terminal velocity falling in an air filled shaft.  As it falls deeper, this terminal velocity should <em>decrease</em> as the net gravitational force decreases while the air density increases.  </p>
<p>I expect there would be very little overshoot of the center.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a very good point. I suspect that even with an atmosphere that has a constant density, the system would act like an overdamped oscillator due to the high damping constant. </p>

<p>Small correction, the gravitational field strength there is zero, not the gravitational potential.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From p=dgh the air pressure near the center of the column should be roughly 76 MPa or 755 atmospheres. </p>
<p>Oxygen, nitrogen, and argon are supercritical fluids. You could get a submarine through this atmosphere soup, but your trip will be easier and faster if you keep the tunnel near vacuum and don't have to swim through air.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pursuant to this, wouldn't the ball end up crushed by air pressure only part of the way down the first descent?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as we're discussing the practicalities of the tube, pumping the air out of such a tube in order to make it vacuum-filled would be a near impossibility. If you attach a vacuum pump to the tube at the surface, you'd only get a small fraction of the tube to be vacuum, while most of the air would be towards the center of the earth. You'd have to somehow get a vacuum pump near the Earth's core. Then you'd have to find someplace to store the air you pump out (there would be a LOT of it, and being so hot down there would make it hard to compress, too), and THEN you would have to have a tube that's strong enough to withstand the pressure at the Earth's core compared to vacuum... at super high temperatures. Just, everything about creating a vacuum-filled tube gets super hard when said tube goes through the Earth's core.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If youâ€™re going through all the trouble of making this pipe and then trying to create a vacuum inside it, why not extend it just a little farther and out of the atmosphere so both open ends would already be in a vacuum. That seems equally as feasible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am very curious to know if this would work, or would residual air molecules inside the tube collapse in to the center (until pressure matches the outside of the tube) and create a marginally stronger vacuum at the ends, sucking in as many particles as possible until equilibrium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doing this wouldn't remove the air from the pipe; you'd still have to pump it out. Just making a tunnel from e.g. six feet in the air to the vacuum of space wouldn't do anything - vacuum doesn't suck. To continue the thought experiment, widen the diameter of said tunnel until it reaches the diameter of the Earth. Our atmosphere is touching space all the time, and yet it stays stubbornly attached to the planet! Gravity: Not just a good idea, it's the law.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if the whole does not pass the centre that means it is not directed downwards to the centre of mass and thus gravity. Wouldn't that mean that the ball would hit the sides of the pipe/hole eventually during fall?</p></div>		</li>
