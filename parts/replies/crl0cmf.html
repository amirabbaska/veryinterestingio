			<div class="markdown"><p>Not completely correct on the New Coke thing.
&quot;New Coke&quot; was introduced after repeatedly losing taste tests to Pepsi. Coke Company decided to slightly change their product to have a sweeter taste (similar to that of Pepsi). After this change, they dominated taste tests, but their sales took an enormous plunge and the public opinion of it was overall negative.
How was this change negatively affecting their sales if it caused them to do so well in taste tests? The answer is because they forgot the most important aspect of their product. They forgot how the product was consumed in the real world,... Instead they focused on how it worked in a testing environment. In the testing environment, you drink a couple sips and rate it based on that. In the real world environment, you drink an entire can in the comfort of your home while you snack on some chips and eat a sandwich. Coke's original and &quot;less sweet&quot; version was much better at performing in the real world, which is where it mattered most. </p>
<p>On a side note, it is ridiculous to think that Coka Cola would change their original coke product to match its diet coke product that they released after it. You have to be a whole new level of stupid to think any company would ever do that. Some companies make some pretty amazing mistakes, but that is so next level stupid I don't think anyone could do that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite is that new coke was designed to be a failure from the beginning. It only existed so people wouldn't balk when they switched the original recipe from sugar to HFCS in the return of coke &quot;classic&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I came to say this, I'm pretty sure they introduced coke zero because they found a way of making it taste the same as normal coke  and still be zero calories, but the market for diet coke is so big that they couldn't just change diet, so they made a new product entirely.</p></div>		</li>
