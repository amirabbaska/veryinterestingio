<p>Edit: and before anyone asks, yes this is also true for massless beams, the weight of the beam is not dictating this relationship, though it would add to the force that is generating this bend in the first place. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i love going on wiki-walks as i like to call them, just clicking through articles and reading the linked articles.</p>
<p>I recently learned about the first crimean war and its effect on public health in britain, really fascinating stuff. A wartime nurse (Florence Nightingale) developed new sanitation techniques that were eventually spread to all the homes in the UK. From there I learned about the london sewer system, and the public works on the banks of the Thames as a result (they reclaimed some marshland from the riverside). </p>
<p>It's amazing how vast the subject matter is on wikipedia</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well now I'm down into Newton rings and cold-welding. What's crazy to me about these guage blocks is that apparently, we only have theories about why they adhere, but don't actually know for sure. Crazy. There's a lot of &quot;it's thought that...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. I work for CNR and rail is often transported in 1/4 mile long pieces and has a natural flex to it. This flex enables the train to easy move around corners while in transport.

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also how oil and gas pipelines are laid. It's hard to imagine a 36&quot; diameter inch-thick carbon steel pipe bend like a wet noodle across several hundred yards, but that's exactly what it does. Straight, 80' sticks of pipe are welded together, creating on long, continuous line, which is then gently lowered into a ditch and covered with dirt. The line itself follows the contours of the Earth quite well over long distances.</p>
<p>I worked on a line that crossed the Mississippi River using a drilled hole that was 150' deep at its deepest point, but at its two end points were 8' deep. End to end of the drill was just over a mile. Once the drill was completed we physically pulled a mile of straight pipe back through the hole, and it curved naturally. Unrelated to the question but still kind of interesting, bentonite clay was pumped into the hole to serve as a lubricant for the pullback, and as it dries it creates a solid protective boundary around the pipe.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when a tight curve is necessary, bends are needed to be made manually, either on a factory floor or using a pneumatic tool on site.</p></div>		</li>
