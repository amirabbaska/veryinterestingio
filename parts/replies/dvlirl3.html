			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not strictly speaking true. You're forgetting the square-cube law. Volume gets very big very fast. And more volume means more cells which means more food that needs to eaten. Calories per pound come greater as pounds pack on, not smaller. If that were true, we'd have planet sized organisms not needing to eat per millennium. Right now, we have teeny tiny spiders that need a gnat every other month. </p>
<p>Big animals need to eat a LOT more than small animals. Whales are huge because they can eat so much. Same with elephants. Elephants are forest destroyers. Landscapers on 4 legs. Why is size inversely correlated with children? Because if elephants had a dozen children there'd be nothing left for anyone to eat. They gotta have one at a time. </p>
<p>Herbivorous dinosaurs got real real big because they likely weren't as warm blooded as mammals/theropods/birds/pterosaurs. They were able to thrive as slow moving browsers because there no fast moving browsers who could eat their food out of their mouths.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's actually where the efficiency comes from. </p>

<p>You're forgetting the extra dimensional efficiency of fractals. Adding a fractal (like the ones present in respirations and cardiovascular pathways) adds an effective 4th dimension. </p>
<p>Heres a paper on it:

<p>Yes that's actually the trend. Oxygen packing is the limitation and it's why there was megafauna when oxygen concentration was higher. </p>

<p>Because oxygen concentration is lower. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're misinterpreting things. Your link wasn't about how bigger is more efficient, it was how about bigger lasts longer. Which is absolutely not the same. </p>
<p>And no, oxygen actually was lower than modern times in many Mesozoic periods and yet the animals were larger, generally. It has to do with how complex their metabolisms were rather than atmospheric oxygen. </p></div>		</li>
