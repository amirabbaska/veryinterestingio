			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s cheaper to run it in a different kind of facility, though. We’d have to start building them, but they can process most of the rest of the power out of nuclear waste:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Know what, I'm not excited about any &quot;new&quot; spent fuel processing tech until it's at an active facility I can tour.  I did some metallurgical analysis for some UREX+ machine/process in college and it seemed like it worked great.  Found out later the tech hasn't changed a lot since the 70s and never went into operation .  Ditto several UREX spin offs/improvements.  </p>
<p>I will add that I don't know how efficient various UREX processes are.  I tried to run the numbers but no one at the lab was interested (god forbid we do some science), so I couldn't get the information needed to get started.  I know it has to run a lot of units in series so it would be expensive start up cost.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You linked to a graph of a shutdown decay rate.  I think you meant to link to spent decay rate which reduces to 10% power per ton after 10 years.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oops, haha. 10% of the initial ambient power, which is aready much lower than the amount of power produced in a reactor, so fortunately my post still makes sense. Thank you for the correction.</p></div>		</li>
