<p>This is all true but there is more: GoPros are notoriously color-unbalanced. It's a nightmare matching two or three to each other or to other cameras used on a set (GoPro is trying to address this with their Protune but ask anyone who worked on the Martian how complicated using that footage was and you'll get an earful). They also don't deliver the same 4k footage - their footage has lower data throughput and resulting file sizes. (Comparison: I've shot on cameras that produces half a Terabyte from less than 25 minutes of footage and that is without special sound. A GoPro, no matter what setting you choose, will come in nowhere near that.) The dynamic range is another issue, resulting in essentially fine footage as long as the sun is behind you but washed-out shit when shooting into the sun and unusable stuff at night. (This makes me want to talk about LUTS but that's a whole other rabbit hole...)</p>
<p>When you look to excellent cameras like the Sony FS7, which comes with a base ISO of 2000, you automatically get internal ND filters so you can use it during the daytime. That's wonderful. It outputs 4k ProRes and RAW and records in SLOG 4:4:4, which gives you an insane amount of details in highlights and shadows to work with. This kind of footage is essentially unusable until you take it through the grading process (see Blackmagic DaVinci software videos on youtube) but you can do anything you can do to an image in photoshop with it, which is huge for professional filmmakers. Did I mention that the data throughput is also intense? A Sony FS7 will shoot 4096×2160 at up to 60fps, something your GoPro will not do, but it will easily write 100MB/sec and more if you set it up right. It also has all the connections to work with a proper external mic and a whole lot more things to play with.</p>
<p>(sidenote: Philip Bloom has a very detailed review of the FS7 on youtube. It's FIFTY minutes long. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ibWoMiLyX8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ibWoMiLyX8</a> )</p>
<p>And this is just one camera we're talking about. You can get yourself a Red Dragon, which will shoot up to 8k or 120fps windowed, which is awesome. You can go for higher framerates using a Phantom but that will cost you the price of a very nice Porsche. Or the amazing Arri Alexa, still my favorite (I will not talk about Canon and their low-fps unergonomic shit anymore). And now we could talk about lenses. The Sony cameras, and for starters look at the new F5 because it's cheap and a real stunner in terms of footage it produces, comes with an E-mount. Add a speedbooster adapter and you can take EF-Canon lenses, PL-professional cinema lenses of whatever else you want. I believe they have a Nikon adapter. That means supertelephoto, macro, tilt-shift ... all that is possible. Your GoPro can only shrug at those requests. </p>
<p>I think at this point you're probably getting an idea for how much is going on in the motion camera market at the moment. It's really exciting, it's overwhelming, it's mind-boggling. And this is before I even tell you about amazing new products like the Blackmagic Ursa Mini, which brings this cinema-level 4k to consumer-level prices (but is as of this writing delayed and not shipping in numbers worth mentioning). But if you want to have a laugh I'll heartily recommend a click on this link where they'll tell you about a camera that used to cost $250,000 just a few years ago. How much do you think it's worth now? Well, I saw one on eBay last week for under $8,000.  <a href="http://www.eoshd.com/2013/01/sony-f35-reaches-12000-on-ebay-from-250000-in-2008" target="_blank">http://www.eoshd.com/2013/01/sony-f35-reaches-12000-on-ebay-from-250000-in-2008</a> </p>
<p>back to my main topic: I believe there are two markets for cameras in the world: </p>
<p><em>(1) I want a small camera that produces wonderful images/footage</em></p>
<p>That's a GoPro now but the iPhone is already eating its lunch. All the point and shoots, all the GoPros, all the cheapo-shitty cameras will be gone in a few years. Remember Flip Cameras? Yeah. This will all be iPhones and other smartphones. If you own GoPro stock this should really worry you. Listen carefully when they say &quot;We want to be a media company&quot; because this is why. Another wakeup call should be the &quot;shot on an iPhone&quot; campaign out of Chiat/MAL with all the huge photos. Sure, they are professionally retouched and often light quite beautifully but they are actual iPhone source files and that is pretty amazing. It's also the reason Canon's Point-and-Shoot market is going south like Val Kilmer's career has.</p>
<p><em>(2) I want the absolute best source footage for my film project and I don't care what it costs or weighs.</em></p>
<p>This is where the exciting stuff will happen first. I don't think an iPhone will ever have huge data throughput, 12bit motion files or SLOG 4:4:4, which is super grey and flat and unusable for people just wanting to record their lunch but makes pros lick their fingers, and believe me playing in this league is expensive. I spent $900 renting a single lens for a single day recently. But the stuff that comes out is what makes clients go &quot;oooh&quot; and &quot;aaah&quot; and my girlfriends panties go &quot;ping.&quot; no wait, she doesn't give a shit. I just wished I wasn't the only one excited about this. </p>
<p>This was fun writing but I must go to bed. I'll probably dream about shooting with a Cine lens on a Red Dragon tonight. Did that last month, cried a little when they took the rental back. But trust me, the footage was insane. </p>

<p>You've misidentified GoPro's niche. They're not the &quot;The best camera is the one you have with you&quot; market, they're the &quot;You'd have to be an idiot to put a camera you care about here&quot; market. They're focusing on features like durability and remote control/capture over image quality, and targeting pricepoints where you won't feel too bad if you actually do manage to lose or destroy the hardware.</p>
<p>The whole point of a GoPro is to be the best cheapo-shitty camera possible. Of course the iPhone eats its lunch... but who in their right mind would strap their iPhone to their helmet while skiing, or leave it suction-cupped to the side of a building to capture a week of time-lapse footage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think I misidentified the niche. Sure, there are some people who are into extreme sports but that's at best a tiny fraction of their actual consumer base. What you think is their niche is their halo much in the way the R8 is a halo for Audi when half their sales are in actuality A4 Diesels or whatever. </p>
<p>(I've also seen people do beyond idiotic things with iPhones.)</p>
<p>Anyway, they're both playing in the sub $1,000 range. At that price point I consider both disposable and thus similar, at least as long as we're talking 4k camera prices.</p>
<p>One more thing: when the GoPro's started coming out they took off because the iPhone 3 had shitty video capabilities compared to it. They still kicked the butt of the iPhone 4. Now that we have reached the iPhone 6S that advantage is gone and with that the reason to purchase a GoPro for anyone who isn't going to mount it on the outside of a car, etc. — ask yourself how many people are actually going to do that and how many customers they will lose. </p>
<p>I read in some recent 10k that half of the customers GoPro currently has are in school or college. That's a finicky customer base. College kids don't buy a camera they don't need to get their job done, they have to turn every buck over twice. They will jump pretty quickly if the iPhone can replicate what the GoPro currently still has an advantage on: high frame rates. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post. I bought myself a panosonic LUMIX GH4 last summer and I'm really loving it so far - lilts light but also produces beautiful Images so it's really flexible.  It can shoot at decent frame rates too, the fps cap is at 96fps which isn't the best but is still great and writes at 100mbs, plus it has 4K at 100mbs or 200mbs. I study architecture and create a lot of mostly abstract film and photography so it's been perfect for that so far. Although I made a mistake buying it as a package with a panosonic lens as its a bit of a bottle neck.
I'm not professional so I haven't tried any of the cameras you've mentioned which sound incredible. I wish I was loaded so I could just buy them all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I haven't looked recently, but there's no technical reason why you shouldn't be able to pull the raw stream off a smartphone's sensor and apply a log colour profile and high bit-rate encoding yourself. If you can't already do it now, then it'll happen within a few years. </p>
<p>Of course, there won't be the same dynamic range then and it'll be obvious... I found this out with stills 5-6 years ago when I installed the hack for Canon's compact cameras to record RAW, but the actual DR of the sensor fit within JPEG anyway so it was pretty useless. (Unless you were stacking them in post or something like that.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, I am impressed what the iPhone can pull off with the tiny lens and sensor allocated to processing what's coming in but there is a reason the larger cameras have more physical glass and flange distance and processor power allocated to creating a rich image. Like I said, producing half a Terabyte in Data in less than half an hour is often no problem. These things are data monsters. While an iPhone should be able to compete somewhat sooner or later I wonder if the masses ever really want to. It's just a pain in the butt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me expand on the point about image quality. A lot of people get hung up on the idea that: resolution = quality. It doesn't, but it plays a part. </p>
<p>To actually ELI5, let me compare it to a painting. </p>
<p>Resolution is the size of the canvas. If it's big, you can put more detail into the picture.</p>
<p>Color depth is the quality of the paint. A cinema camera like an Arri Alexa or Red Epic has higher quality paint that's more accurate rendition of what it says on the bottle. The Alexa's Forest Green is Forest Green, but a go pro will give you just Dark Green #3.</p>
<p>Bit rate is the fidelity of the strokes. Cinema cameras have a higher bit rate: more and finer strokes, so the images can be more accurately detailed. Go Pros have lower bit rate so the images can often appear blocky when you look close up, even on a large canvas / high resolution. </p>
<p>Dynamic Range is how many shades of gray you have to paint with between the whitest white and the blackest black, starting with your middle gray. Cheap cameras will only give you 5 shades either way, so your image might be very contrasted and lack accurate depiction of the brighter or darker scenes. </p>
<p>Edit: To expand on this thanks to a few additional comments below. </p>
<p>If your camera is more customisable in lens choices and the options of additional accessories like a matte box or external recorder, these are sort of like the tools you use to paint. Better quality brushes will give you more control over your painting and consistent results. Having only a fixed wide lens like on a go pro is like trying to paint a landscape with only a roller. </p>
<p>The different settings to choose from will be more numerous on a higher end camera, allowing you more control over the image.</p>
<p>Then you have lots of other bells and whistles such as ISO and frames per second. High end cinema cameras have really great bells and whistles that cost a lot of money to develop and produce, so the cameras are more expensive to purchase or hire.</p>
<p>I may have missed a few things or others may be able to add more to this metaphor.</p></div>		</li>

Not sure how to really use this in the metaphor, but a dedicated cinema lens is <em>far</em> better than a GoPro.

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could kind of equate the lens to a paintbrush. Cheap paintbrushes will cause paint to glob, blur in unwanted ways, and leave loose bristles in the paint. Much like a cheap lens can cause issues with focus, clarity, and distortion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ISO is the measure of sensitivity given to the chip inside a digital camera, basically its a multiplier applied to the light value as its changed into voltage and used to produce an image.</p>
<p>So a DSLR or &quot;pro movie camera&quot; can detect smaller differences in light values as they have a variable ISO value so you can adjust to very dark or very bright conditions whereas a go pro has a static ISO value that works in &quot;normal conditions&quot; but tends to crap its pants when values look too similar. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The level of darkness a camera can pick up varies by camera. Certainly, there are some cameras with excellent nighttime performance. However, cinema cameras may even perform worse than your phone at night.</p>
<p>Getting lots of detail in an image takes A LOT of light. Even in the human eye, at night things will look fuzzy and you won't be able to see color.</p>
<p>If you ever see a nighttime movie set, they still use lots of lights to illuminate the set, and will often darken the shot in post-production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong on a few points. Okay, just to be an asshole:  bit rate is not &quot;more and finer strokes&quot;. I think the fine-ness (size) of the strokes is resolution. Bit-rate is the number of colors the camera can paint with. It doesn't mean the camera will paint accurately - or in a wide range of colors- but just that there is a larger number of colors available. Range of colors (gamut) and color fidelity are separate really. Okay, you know, being technical. Okay and dynamic range is not &quot;how many shades of gray&quot;, shit I feel like an asshole here.  Number of shades that the camera can paint with is the bit rate. The dynamic range is the range of brightnesses in the outside world that the camera can perceive during the exposure of one frame. So if you want to shoot an interior and still have the bright mountains outside the window show up as anything other that a shapeless white blob, you need a decent dynamic range. Without that, you gotta light the living shit out of the interior, which is a bitch for your actors. How bright is your resulting image ends up: that's dependent on your viewing situation. So a great monitor will be able to display a deeper range of colors and brightnesses. But most monitors are 8-bit (I think), so if you have a lousy 8-bit camera but you might it perfectly, you know what?  It might look half way decent on the monitor. But a great camera - you can be off by a stop or stop and a half and still have enough data in that high bit rate that you can mess with it and end up with a great image. But it will still end up shown on an 8-bit monitor and look awesome. The extra bits are really there to give you options to adjust in a very fine way later - in post. There's just too many parameters to adjust, so it would take too much time to perfectly tweak while shooting. You save it for later.  Source: Alexa and Amira owner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a common misconception. Given a lens of a particular focal length, a larger pixel only gathers more light because it subtends a larger solid angle. In order to keep the number of pixels the same, you have to increase the size of the entire sensor chip. </p>
<p>You could achieve exactly the same effect by simply decreasing the focal length of the lens. Think about this another way: the amount of light that hits a given solid angle of your senor is determined <em>ONLY</em> by the lens. </p>
<p>So why are larger pixels better? Noise variance. Simply put, every pixel collects noise in proportion to the area of the pixel. Larger pixels collect more noise, but they also collect noise more uniformly. </p>
<p>If every pixel collects 10 +/- 10 units of noise, the dark parts of your picture look noisy. If each pixel collects 100 +/- 20 units, then it doesn't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's not very many numerical specs that are specifically &quot;better&quot; on one sensor or another. Aside from resolution and sensor size, the only one I can really think of right now is how much gain (light amplification) a sensor can provide... and even then, it's not an apples to apples comparison. Two sensors might both be able to shoot at say... 9dB gain, but one might be pretty good quality and the other is noisy garbage. </p>
<p>Sensor size makes a difference in how an image looks (depth of field/framing) and interacts with lenses, but those are really physics equations- a full frame sensor from 10 years ago will theoretically act identically to one made today when it comes to framing. Bigger IS usually considered better, as a shallow depth of field is more &quot;cinematic&quot;, but there are many good reasons for using a small sensor. Most obviously is that it takes less physical space, but also the lenses can be significantly smaller. They are also easier to focus because their depth of field is larger. </p>
<p>Back to the quality of different sensors, though, the camera's image processor plays a huge role in the quality of the image. They do the noise reduction, encode the color profile, encoding, and many other things. All these will have an impact on how the sensor's product looks in the end... and what is best is a subjective judgment.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Does it make a better looking image? Then it's a better sensor.</p>
<p>Edit: Oh, and dynamic range! That can be whittled down to a single spec (<em>x</em> stops of DR, ect). Dynamic range is how well a sensor can distinguish between a light object and a dark object in the same scene. Less dynamic range means more dark spots will become black and more bright spots will over-expose, so a larger DR means you can take in higher light detail. Again, though, if the image quality sucks, a high DR isn't going to make a camera good.</p></div>		</li>
