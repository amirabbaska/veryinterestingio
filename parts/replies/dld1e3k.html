			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Everyone is up for preserving telomeres but No one is really considering the fact that the DNA has errors during replication (even after proofreading and mismatch repair) and having inexhaustible telomeres or too long telomeres would essentially mean (possibly) getting cancerous mutations before you die. So if you can't die of old age, you will die of cancer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Animals that are 'immortal', like some jellyfish and flatworms are primitive creatures that can control the vegetative state of their being. (some) Jellyfish can return to their polyp stage and regrow again in the event of damage. Flatworms can be cut into two and become two flatworms. But all of that id primitive. Like how cells divide. </p>
<p>Then we hear about lobsters and some turtles being immortal. And that's just misinformation. It's true lobster and shrimp do not age in our sense of senescence, and they continue to reproduce and move about and grow each year; but they do get old in the sense that eventually they run out of energy to redo their exoskeleton and eventually contract diseases and die. </p>
<p>You can read about lobsters here <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dont-listen-to-the-buzz-lobsters-arent-actually-immortal-88450872/" target="_blank">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/dont-listen-to-the-buzz-lobsters-arent-actually-immortal-88450872/</a></p>
<p>At some point creatures do get too tired to continue (maybe that's old age for them) and get eaten by predators. But all we see is them being eaten, and not the giving up part. In a nutshell, the definition of senescence (aging) is different for each species, so biological immortality depends on your definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not how telomeres work. Long telomeres are important because they provide a lot of opportunities for mutations to hit the telomeres instead of the usable genome. Mutations in the telomeres are unlikely to ever be read so they would more likely than not be &quot;silent&quot;. The question of mutation is inevitable. Cells are always under a barrage of attack on their genomes from errors in replication to high energy particles running through like a wrecking ball. They cell is normally pretty good at repairing these issues by sewing the genome back together in the correct order or proofreading its replications. However, sometimes this slips though. </p>
<p>If you have a bunch of junk you don't care about and it can get harmless, non-cancerous mutations you'd like for there to be more of that around just to increase the probability it will be hit and not the vital parts of your genome. Telomeres are more like if you imagine London in World War II several times larger in size with all of the extra space totally and unused, unoccupied, and inaccessible to the occupied parts of the city. Air raids meant bombings were a near certainty somewhere in the city, but our telomere London is probabilistically much less likely to have those bombs hit anywhere useful.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Long telomeres are present not because it acts as a useless dump for mutations. Telomeres may be non expressed genetic material, but it's because in the end of DNA replication, there is no DNA in front of the RNA primer. That part gets 'left out' because it cannot be continued. And so telomeres being at the end, get cut a little during replication. And its better than cutting out genes thanks to telomeres. </p>
<p>Since we're on metaphors, consider sewing. You don't cut the thread right where the fabric ends or else it will unravel. You also don't stop sewing before the end and just leave un-sewn cloth at the end. No. You take extra thread and then cut it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, would it be more advantageous to use things like CRISPR to directly repair damage to DNA? I've heard that this would be (I believe the scientific term is hecka) complicated, though not theoretically at least, IMpossible. How would we know what's damaged? would we need some undamaged version as a blueprint? Should I go out and sequence my DNA now so that I can have a snapshot of my DNA at my current age to revert back to once I'm 870 and the technology hits the market?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd have to repair the damaged DNA in every cell so thats not super practical. You shouldnt need to have a snapshot of your DNA taken because DNA in cells that don't divide will be relavitely undamaged, but even if not, you can always take DNA from different tissues and take the consensus since you won't get the same mutations occurring in every cell.</p></div>		</li>
