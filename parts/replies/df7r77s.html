			<div class="markdown"><p>I split my head open on a street sign while riding my bike as a teen.  It makes me wonder if the severity or chance of a concussion is lessened if it ends up opening a wound?  I never lost consciousness or got diagnosed with a concussion even though it split my head down to the skull.  I often wonder how much worse it would have been if it was more of a blunt impact rather than slicing.  The fun part of it was that it was across the street from an ambulance station so I walked over and rang the doorbell for help.  They said they heard the crash but didn't see any cars on fire so they didn't investigate further.  Luckily my handlebars hit first and I was propelled into the sign.  The sign made it halfway through the handlebars.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So my medical experience is admittedly limited, as I'm only an EMT, but the presence of a laceration likely had little to no impact on whether you got a concussion or not. It has more to do with the G forces experienced by the brain during a sudden, rapid deceleration (like when your dome impacts something solid). </p>
<p>Now if you're talking a direct impact vs a glancing blow, sure.</p>
<p>I'm sure a doctor can tighten me up on this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always assumed that the slicing of the scalp acted to reduce the blunt force of the impact, compared to say just hitting a wall.  Now that I think of it though, it is probably negligible and maybe I just got lucky some other way.  It was interesting though for me to finger my head down to the bone.  Probably the first time in my life at that point where I contemplated my mortality.  </p></div>		</li>
