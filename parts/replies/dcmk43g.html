			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the question. So far we have made little progress but we shouldn't be disheartened by this. It is not too late and we know there are things we can do to combat climate change. To combat climate change unprecedented action is required. We can be optimistic because we (globally) haven't <em>really</em> started trying yet.
What frustrates me the most is investment in fossil fuel exploration, we already know and have shown that if we use the fossil fuel we currently know about then we will be in trouble. We should invest more in renewables and legislations that make companies / individual accountable for how much carbon we are using. This will help avoid loss through gas leaks for example.

<p>I know you're coming at this from the climate change perspective, but you're discounting the trouble that we would face immediately by not investing in fossil fuel extraction. Energy needs, especially in developing countries, cannot be met without increased fossil fuel use in the coming decades. </p>
<p>There are two major disruptions that must be balanced at the global scale - the decrease in fossil fuel use must happen in order to manage climate change impacts, but that decrease must be managed effectively in order to manage geopolitical stability. It's a trade-off between near-to-medium term disruption and medium-to longer-term disruption.</p></div>		</li>
