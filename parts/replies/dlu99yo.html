			<div class="markdown"><p>I work with 5 Latin American guys who speak very little English, but can understand a decent amount. I myself, having grownup in New Jersey &amp; attended the public schools, speak very little Spanish but understand a decent amount. </p>
<p>We'll talk all day in our native languages, with mostly positive results. Weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how I picked up Spanish. When you work in kitchens there are a lot of immigrant workers and you have to learn a certain basic vocabulary. You end up talking Spanglish to each other. It's actually kind of fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same with me on Duolingo.  I'm a lot better with reading/interpreting written Spanish than I am with understanding what I'm hearing and being able to speak it, because that's what I mostly practice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm having the same experience on Duo. I can translate all their written sentences no problem, but boy, I just wrote my first few Russian emails this morning to a guy I had been seeing. I had to confer with Google on just about everything. Though part of that may be insecurity in my ability as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandparents and father speak Spanish about 95% of the time. I can completely understand them and I can read Spanish but it is extremely difficult for me to write. But speaking it is very difficult. If I can manage to say a complete sentence without thinking too hard on what I'm saying I'm amazed at myself. But usually once I have to stop and think of how to say a word in Spanish I lose the momentum. But more recently I've been trying to speak it more with my dad and some of the people I work with. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm Spanish myself and I have the same problem with English. I used to read a lot of forums, blogs and websites written in English but I really had problems writing English. Reddit changed this, cause my written English have been improving since I started commenting, I know I make mistakes, but people is really nice here :)</p>
<p>Mucha suerte con tu espa√±ol, pregunta si tienes dudas :D</p></div>		</li>
