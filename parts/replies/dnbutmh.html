			<div class="markdown"><p>The crucial barrier to freezing and thawing a living organism is that the larger the organism, the harder it is to do so without ice crystals forming.  Put a tiny thing like an egg in liquid nitrogen, and it will flash freeze solid without forming ice crystals.  Do that with a whole human, and the skin will quickly freeze, but the rest will slowly cool, and when it reaches its freezing point, will form ice crystals.  When these grow inside of cells, it's like sprouting billions of tiny knives that cut their way through everything.  When something that froze that way is thawed, it's a dead duck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The future may develop ways to repair the cells damage by freezing. Cryogenics I think is just a gamble that medical technology evolves to a point to reanimate them essentially. I mean they're already dead when they are frozen, so they have more than one problem that modern medicine can't solve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i don't think anyone cryogenically frozen was done so alive.<br />
pretty sure they got frozen very soon after death, and from memory they pump a version of antifreeze thru the body similar to what artic fish that get frozen solid have in their blood that stops the crystal formation that kills cells.<br />
The theory being that once medicine catches up to whatever killed the person they can be thawed and restarted the same way ppl who have been in frozen water can be saved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's wrong, they can. The problem is water in our cells crystallizes and expands, breaking lots of cells in our body when frozen. If we could freeze people without the water in our bodies getting all pointy stabby, we could go into stasis and wake up fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please tell me if you know of some advance I don't.  I am aware of mammals, small rodents like rats, being revived after being cryogenically suspended, <em>but not entirely frozen</em>.  Their brain activity never ceased and restarted.  The rats appeared ok... but there's lots of nuances to mental health that can't be measured by simply saying &quot;oh look, it walks and eats and poops again.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm also aware of larger mammalian brains (just the brains, removed from the body) being totally frozen and recovered using chemical fixation.  This preserves the physical structure of the tissue (as far as we can tell), but the process would have killed a living creature, and no brain preserved this way has been &quot;restarted&quot; afterwards.  The company's stated aim was to preserve it in a way that could be &quot;read&quot; and downloaded digitally in the future.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of any actual experiment showing a mammalian brain being totally stopped (brain dead by medical standards), frozen or otherwise, for more than a handful of seconds, and being revived successfully.  There's a few news stories about people being declared dead and recovering after several days, but those seem to be cases of misdiagnosis (e.g. person was taken off life support on the assumption their brain was too damaged to continue, but brain activity never fully ceased).</p></div>		</li>
