			<div class="markdown"><p>It is indeed about overlaps, but not about the Coulomb repulsion between electrons. The orbitals have the shape they have because they form an orthogonal basis. If there was no electron interaction, they would still look the same. In fact, they would be the exact description of the electrons in such a case. The orbital picture is only approximate in reality because of the electron repulsion.</p></div>		</li>
