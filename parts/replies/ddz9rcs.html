<p>Why did or do people associate words with gender?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nobody really knows, but here's a possible way it could have happened.</p>
<p>Begin 6,000 years ago with the Proto-Indo-European language in its very earliest stages. We don't have any record of this language, so we can only guess, but the oldest Indo-European language we do have records of was the Hittite language, and that had two classes of noun: animate (for people and animals) and inanimate (for everything else).</p>
<p>This might be evidence that Proto-Indo-European originally had the same system; but later, it had three classes of noun. Somewhere along the line, the animate category split into two: masculine and feminine.</p>
<p>It might have happened because animate nouns had two different forms: one if the person or animal is doing something, and a different form if the person or animal is having something done to it. But this wasn't true of inanimate nouns. Why? Because inanimate nouns don't actually do anything, they can only be acted upon, so there's no need to tell the difference.*</p>
<p>So, if PIE had an animate word like &quot;foo&quot; (it probably didn't: I'm just making this one up), it would appear as &quot;foos&quot; when it's doing something, but as &quot;foom&quot; when it's having something done to it. An inanimate word like the totally-just-invented-by-me &quot;bar&quot; would only ever appear as &quot;bar&quot;.</p>
<p>This meant that PIE had three forms for a noun: one with an extra &quot;-s&quot;, one with an &quot;-m&quot;, and one with no ending at all. And this meant that the animate category split into two new categories.</p>
<p>And then, for some reason, the categories got a bit mixed up. How this happened is anyone's guess, but suppose you had some inanimate nouns ending in &quot;-s&quot; and some ending in &quot;-m&quot; -- those being part of the word itself, not a grammatical ending. Maybe speakers started putting them into the wrong category, because they looked or sounded as if they should go into that category.</p>
<p>So a lot of inanimate nouns ended up in the two animate categories. The bit nobody can explain is how nearly all of the words for women, girls and female animals ended up in just one animate category leaving nearly all of the words for men, boys and male animals in the other, but somehow... that happened.</p>
<p>And then it became logical to name the category with all the male animate nouns in it &quot;masculine&quot; and the other animate category &quot;feminine&quot;, and to name the third category &quot;neuter&quot;.</p>
<p>The words themselves, though, aren't really associated with biological sex. &quot;Masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; are simply names for the categories, that's all.</p>
<hr />
<p>* In some cases it gets complicated. For example, water can be considered an inanimate object when it's just sitting in a puddle, but it can be animate when, for example, it's rushing through the valley in a torrent and sweeping away all the houses. PIE had two words for these different states: the inanimate *wed- gave us the English &quot;water&quot;, while the animate *akwa- gave us the Latin &quot;aqua&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good explanation. What's missing: </p>
<p>A prevalent theory on how the feminine developed is from collectives, so basically ‘neuter plurals’. For example, dawn (etymologically a collection of sun rays) was personified into the Goddess of Dawn (Roman Aurora, Greek Eos, Indian Uṣas – it may not be apparent, but these three names all come from the same *h^(2)éwsos via regular sound changes) and the collective word ‘stuff that was left behind’ came to mean ‘widow’ (and in fact, the English word stems directly from this). These were then taken to be animate singulars.</p>
<p>Once a connection between feminine nouns and female gender was established, the suffix became productive and spawned lots of new words of this type.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, it makes sense. Look at how we categorize things now. We use things like colors, numbers, and symbolic imagery. The blue team, team 4, the Red Sox. Gender is an easy two or three group categorization based on a biologically reinforced cultural universal as old as humanity. Makes as much sense as&quot;the blue team&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, there are some insightful comments about HOW grammatical gender is used, but not WHY. </p>
<p>My (incredibly subjective and not at all researched) guess is that it is a way to introduce further redundancy into a method of communication (spoken language) that is inherently lossy and prone to corruption in the form of mishearing or misspeaking.</p>
<p>For instance, say you have two similar nouns, <em>blumpo</em> and <em>blumpa</em>. If the only feature distinguishing them were the final sounds of each word, it might be easy to mistake the one for the other. But say you put them into categories where they affect words around them in distinct but consistent ways, so for instance to say &quot;I have a <em>blumpo</em>&quot; you can say <em>hoopy blumpo</em> but if you wanted to say &quot;I have a <em>blumpa</em>&quot; the <em>hoopy</em> has to become a <em>soopy</em> instead. So <em>hoopy blumpo</em> and <em>soopy blumpa</em> are valid, but <em>soopy blumpo</em> or <em>hoopy blumpa</em> are not. Now when you are talking to someone and you hear &quot;<em>soopy blump...&quot;</em> and you don't quite catch the end of the last word, you can reasonably guess that it was <em>blumpa</em> and not <em>blumpo</em> from the other words around it that you did catch. Having a word affect the words around it in systematic ways means that you reconstruct it more easily in its absence from the words around it. </p>
<p>So why do we call these categories gender, then instead of any other categorization system (&quot;light&quot; vs &quot;heavy&quot; words, &quot;left&quot; vs &quot;right&quot; words, &quot;major&quot; vs &quot;minor&quot; words)? I think it's because a.) we are good at anthropomorhizing nonhuman objects, and b.) gender roles is something that have been part of &quot;being human&quot; since pretty much forever. It's easier for us to have a little mental image of a &quot;boy fork&quot; and a &quot;girl knife&quot; than, say, a &quot;minor fork&quot; and a &quot;major knife&quot; because we're really, really good at keeping track of individual &quot;persons&quot; and personalities. (Yay social apes.)</p>
<p>So just by remembering that &quot;<em>blumpo</em> is a boy,&quot; which isn't that hard, and &quot;boys go with <em>hoopy</em> and not <em>soopy</em>,&quot; you get all the error-corrective benefits described above, and your language is more robust and hence more useful for communication, so it gets passed on more to other people. And here we are with grammatical gender. </p>
<p>Of course there are lots of completely different strategies to making a language more fault-tolerant than just employing gender, which is why not all languages have or need it. But a certain level of redundancy and error-correction is something I'd wager is present in all extant natural languages, and since the error-correction stuff should have minimal impact on the actual meaning, I would also wager that many of these error-corrective schemes are, semantically speaking, abstract and almost nonsensical. A girl knife is surreal and pretty meaningless, so it's not likely that gender the grammatical construct and gender the social construct are going to interfere with each other in the course of using the language, even though they both are making use of the same human facility with keeping track of individual personalities in a large group. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's pure association.<br />
Like, in Russian mother is, obviously, a female word. So is family (family is where you were born). Motherland is a female word too (this land gave birth to you). Earth/soil is female too (gives birth to plants and so on). Things related to affection  — care, tenderness, love — are female too.<br />
Masculine words are not so easy, but mostly it's referring to &quot;solid&quot; or &quot;strong&quot; words, like table, floor, house, forest, frost, sword, shield, horror.<br />
Neuter words are usually ethereal/abstract or adopted from other languages, i.e. Sun, knowledge, time, respect, coat (russian &quot;coat&quot; — пальто — is taken from french, so it's neuter)<br />
Sure there's a ton of exclusions, but there's certainly some logic to ancient words.</p></div>		</li>
