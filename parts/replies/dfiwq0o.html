			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the biggest things that irks me about this surgeon is that he touts PEG as a &quot;magical adhesive&quot; that will make the procedure successful. While it's a simple and magnificent hydrogel that can be tuned and modified to all sorts of uses, it's still just a hydrogel scaffold. If a hydrogel scaffold is all it takes for this to work, then why hasn't it been done (or attempted) for the decades that collagen has been available? Maybe they have a spectacular formulation doped with all the proper growth factors, but even then it's just a mess of hydrogel that could get the ends to grow, but not even necessarily connect to the right opposing ends. [Edit: This bit is drawing confusion. It may draw proper regeneration in severed animal models, but this is connecting the nerves of one individual to those of another. While the mapping may likely be highly conserved as a species, it is incredibly hard to say if the mapping will be close enough, especially counting effects of existing disability mapping, for the patient and donor nerves to connect in proper configurations (even assuming ideal regeneration on each side).]</p>
<p>Biomaterials and hydrogels especially are amazing platforms for medical products, but they only perform specific functions as parts of complex systems. This doc either has the most optimistic outlook for his procedure or a deep misunderstanding of the potential of this specific material.</p>
<p>While I certainly hope the surgeon has a better vantage point than me (actually knowing the exact formulations and such) to give such confidence, this is only one of many reasons why I'm very skeptical of the outcome of this procedure.</p>

<p>Edit: You can glue a nerve to a nerve from another man using a hydrogel adhesive but that doesn't mean the PEG adhesive will magically make them compatible for ideal fusion, despite what it may do for the regeneration within the microenvironment.</p>
<p>Edit2: For completeness I'll just link to my comment further down where I went into a greater detail of why this operation is ill-advised at best:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately the surgeon is just dumbing down the message for laymen to understand. </p>
<p>It's not just PEG being used here, it's PEG with  polysaccharide ECM material to encourage cell migration to the incision sites. The actual procedure will involve a lot of ECM manipulation via proteoglycans and other ECM molecules. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702108700889" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702108700889</a></p>
<p>We also know that manipulation of the ECM works to regenerate simpler tissues (such as regrowing the tips of fingers). So yes the PEG will only do so much but it's not the only part of the procedure. </p>
<p>I really think the opposition to this procedure is incredibly overblown. This is a terminally ill patient with a debilitating form of muscular distrophy. If he is willing to die and shell out millions of dollars for this procedure then he's probably fine with essentially being euthanized if the procedure goes awry, which it very well might (something he must be constantly informed of). </p>
<p>If anything there will be a lot of good data gleamed from this procedure, if the reports about the research staff that will be on hand are accurate. </p>
<p>So it's more than just PEG and growth factors. They are targeting the extracellular matrix itself and isolating the connection of individual neuron bundles, to no more than the amount of neurons in a rat's sciatic nerve at a time. Most PEG based axon regeneration research has been done on rat sciatic nerves, and they are largely successful procedures. </p>

<p>It's a huge leap from rat to human but the basic mechanism for this procedure is proven. The real complications will come from the sheer length of the procedure and medical complications that come with trying to initially move the cardiovascular system of the patient's head to the new body.</p>
<p>Also this procedure has essentially already been done on dogs. Except the dog never changed body and they were only fixing spinal cords that were around 90% of the way cut through. The dogs with these injuries successfully healed and exhibited normal motor function, all thanks to the chitosan-PEG therapy on the spinal cords. In fact these procedures have been done for nearly a decade, only on non-human animals though. The reasons for why it hasn't been done on humans are largely regulatory. </p>

<p>This is the part that facinates me the most. Aside from difficulties with the actual biological processes of rejoining the nerves, it seems impossible to know that the nerves (if they do connect) will connect to their correct partners. Will a nerve intended for the heart end up connected to the leg? Of course it is not as simple as that, and there are many nerves to each function, but if the act of walking sends stray signals to the heart (for example) then that cannot be a good thing. Even if the effect is less pronounched (say nerves for the toes ends up connecting to a nerves from the calf) it seems like that would make relearning to walk incredibly difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've worked with all 3 neural cell preps: dissociated cell culture, organotypic slice culture, and acute slice. The latter of which is most like what is planned to happen in this transplant procedure. Acute slice neurons are by far the most difficult to keep alive. Even under ideal conditions they survive only for a few hours. I cant imagine a scenario where you could sever a bunch of axons and then coax them to reattach to their severed end. Granted neural regeneration is not my focus - I'm just saying I would be awe struck if someone demo'd cutting an axon in an acute slice prep and showed that it could spontaneously re-attach. Mind you, this is still lightyears away from what needs to happen in this transplant. They want these neurons to attach to axons that are from other neurons, from other people. </p>
<p>How did this get approval? At minimum, they should have to demonstrate head transplants can be done reliably on rats or mice. Until then you'd be better off gathering up the organs vital to hormone secretion and metabolism and a few blood-producing bones and packaging them into a small host system with a fake heart and wait for bionic technology to catch up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you are right. Degeneration towards the body is retrograde degeneration and isn't something neurons can normally recover from (because recovery always proceeds from the body which can synthesize new structural molecules - the axon can't do that). This transplant is using PEG-fusion to prevent/reduce Wallerian degeneration.</p></div>		</li>
