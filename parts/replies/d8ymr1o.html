			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I'm not keen on all the circumstances, but I know that one of the early US reactors (non production) had control rods stick and melted down.  It took 40 years to get things somewhat cleaned up.</p>
<p>Also 3-mile island melted down and had small liquid pools at the bottom of the pressure tank.</p>
<p>Of course Fukushima had real good melt downs.  Fortunately the design kept it from getting out of the tanks but there are some debates as to whether the tanks cracked.</p>
<p>There are also a couple submarines ... I'm thinking of two USSR/Russian subs ... but I don't quite recall if the second one was a melt down or simply inability to handle the pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about the first one you mentioned, or the subs, but the rest (TMI and Fukushima) did not suffer runaway criticality; they scrammed and shut down properly. So would any American nuclear sub, because once the water boils away the reactor becomes sub-crtical.</p>
<p>That's not to say they didn't melt, bit they melted from the heat of decay products. It's still bad, but it's a linear rise in temperature, not exponential.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All, your point is runaway criticality.  To me any criticality that either is not under control or is in a state that the operators don't realize is melting the fuel is a meltdown of sorts.</p>
<p>One of the sub cases as a misdirected cooling line which resulted in no cooling even though they thought it was.  The other was an explosion in the torpedo bay that emitted toxic vapors and forced the humans out of the control area.  In that case it might be that none of it melted, but the sub did sink and eventually all lives lost.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Remember how I mentioned that neutrons leave the system by, well, leaving without hitting anything? The chance that they do that has to do with the ratio of mass to surface area. If the mass is very spread out, or has a lot of surface area, it's easy for neutrons to leave the system without reacting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that true or is it a different property that is super important for the neutron economy in a nuclear reaction?</p></div>		</li>
