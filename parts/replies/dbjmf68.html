			<div class="markdown"><p>His answer is not correct.</p>
<p>He is correct in saying that spectrum is limited. However, that justifies restrictions on bandwidth - which already has to be done per the very nature of bandwidth, it can't be unrestricted. </p>
<p>It does not justify restrictions on data usage in total.</p>
<hr />
<p>Data caps are 100% arbitrary. There exists no technical justification for them. Spectrum limitations are limitations of bandwidth and have absolutely nothing to do with the total amount of data that can be transferred. Spectrum limits only the <em>rate</em> of data transfer, which is bandwidth. </p>
<p>Data caps exist solely, both on cable and mobile, to make you pay way more for way less.</p>
<p>People will tell you congestion is a valid reason - it is not. Congestion is, even if extreme, still granting you much more data in a month than most capped connections would, so in essence, data caps are not a solution to a problem, but replacing that problem with a much much worse problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Data caps allow them to oversell bandwidth and artificially &quot;guarantee&quot; (increase the likelihood of achieving) higher transfer rates. </p>
<p>If everyone on the network was subscribed to a 100mbps download speed and they were all using it at once there's no way any of them would get that speed... But by using data caps they can make it more likely that a large portion of the users are not currently using their service for intensive things, so the few that are are more likely to get the maximum advertised speed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.  To put it eli5: data caps are used to get more money from you and get you to use the product the way the provider wants you to, rather than how you want to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Data caps are because the vast majority of customers don't know what it means. So the telcos get away with it. If they sell me a T1 and I get 1.544Mbps, then every second I should be able to transmit 1.544Mb for the entire month. If they sell 100Mbps, then I should be able to send 100Mb for the entire month.</p>
<p>Sure they oversubscribe the link. So I may only get 10Mb or 40Mb or 80Mb depending on the time of day and use of others sharing my path.</p>
<p>But there should be no &quot;cap&quot; on what I can do for a month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Telecom is an example of an industry where an additional customer costs the company almost nothing. People used to complain that a text message &quot;is 99.9% profit for the company.&quot; </p>
<p>They're not wrong, but the issue is that <em>building and maintaining a network</em> costs billions, regardless of how much it's used. </p>
<p>So the companies charge what they can, where they can, when they can. By creating a cap, they charge most people a fixed fee, and high users more. That seems to work well. </p>
<p>They could offer open internet to everyone, but the issue would be that they would have to charge everyone more to get to the billions of revenue they need, which means gramma who uses her internet to check the weather is now paying 20% more. </p>
<p>There's also an issue with peak times - using almost infinite data at 3 am doesn't affect anything, but if everyone is on Netflix while downloading movies and updates at once, the network gets bogged down. So data caps help them manage that.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk, I manage a network for a medium sized business and there not change in the cost of data at 9am or 9pm. It's all 1s and 0s. If I charged every worker like $20 a month to use our infrastructure, I'd be able to upgrade my entire network a thousand times over. A switch is a switch is a switch and it seems to me that the entire industry has invented virtual costs. I walk into some of the LECs and Central Offices I've seen for AT&amp;T and Verizon you'll find the same decade old switches and ISRs. If they're spending this money on maintenance, they skipped Charlotte and WashDC.

Plus there's the bit where Voice bits cost more than Data bits, but to the layer 1, 2 and 3 devices, it's all the same bits. How is this not a rip off? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Charging for texting is 100% profit and complete bullshit. Setting a cap also lets them milk more money out of users, the networks would work just fine without caps. </p>
<p>They have very high (government subsidized) costs, but they're also greedy as hell. These companies have more money than god and get it by overcharging for everything due to their legal monopolies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was not a good answer. Don't feel bad. There are data limits because companies realized they could make more profit that way. Plain and simple. Here in the us there is more than enough bandwidth installed to support every American using a Tb a day. There is no technological reason for caps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I was an ATT person for 20 years - unlimited data and they tried EVERYTHING to get me to drop the unlimited part - raising my rates to over 180 a month for 2 lines (the other line almost never used). When I finally had enough I left for Google Fi - and the next week they came out and said that all DirecTV AND ATT customers would get unlimited data. So basically F*&amp;% the loyal customers - let's bundle - and also screw net neutrality to boot. </p>
<p>My DSL is so old and so slow they rarely hit 50% of their advertised speeds. I have filed 2 FCC complaints with them and they refuse to upgrade the switch. It's our only option in the country and they know it. More $$ for them - slow speeds for us (at $80 a month for about 5MB speeds). </p>
<p>Screw TDS telecom and SCREW AT&amp;T. Now that Trump is going to clip the FCC - it's lights out in terms of getting fast reliable internet - forcing us to get DirecTV bills forever (there are no cable suppliers in my area - no internet fast enough to cut the cord). This is why people in rural areas are so underserved with information. It's too expensive and the monopolies are unchallenged for the most part. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now let's look at this from a business stand point. </p>
<p>People are cutting TV and phone service let and right. 2016 is the 1st year that Netflix subscriptions outnumbered cable tv subscriptions. Cable company's are losing money and its a trend that will continue.....unless.....they change a couple things. </p>
<p>To combat a loss in profits cable company's will no have to expand their service into more rural areas to get more subscribers. They will also have to upgrade their infrastructure to be able to offer faster internet. Faster internet in which they can charge more money for while being more competitive.</p>
<p>I too live in a area without cable internet. Here lately I've seen the cable company on my road. So I asked them  &quot;hey, what are you guys doing out?&quot;, &quot;well we are looking for areas to expand with our 2017 budget&quot;</p>
<p>Now the funny thing is about 5 years ago the same cable company told me I would never receive service due to living on a dead end street and wouldn't be worth running lines unless more homes were built, but no new homes have been built. So that tells me they are desperate for new subscribers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really - One company has the &quot;monopoly&quot; for our area in cable TV. Since there is DSL in the area - they don't want to bring out cable. There are million dollar estates on our street. I called and forced them (per their monopoly agreement with the county) to give me an estimate to run cable to our home. It was 88,900 for me to pay for them to expand their network. Even though they have the sole exclusivity to the area - they don't want it. Yet a few miles away they are laying new fiber lines to the subdivisions. I get supply and demand - the issue is that this is not a &quot;free market&quot; when they have basically no competition - I can't get the phone supplier to upgrade their DSL switch because &quot;they don't care&quot; - because not enough people complain enough to run the upgrade. They are basically committing fraud by advertising one thing - and supplying another. There should be regulation to force them to live up to their agreement - the free market has not supplied anything on this street since the invention of dial-up. </p>
<p>Massive corporations don't think like a small business - they are only pandering to shareholders. They don't care about customer service or even the services that they are paid to supply. They only care about share price. You are injecting logic into an illogical situation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Must it though? Couldn't thy pay for it with access fees and charging customers speed tiers to control congestion (the heaviest users would thus be paying for their heavy usage), and give everyone unlimited broadband? I hear so many kids talk about data usage, or being told off for updating their apps or backup if up their phone at friends houses etc. Seems like America as a whole is paying the price for these data limits and non investment in &quot;non competitive&quot; areas, meaning Comcast's competitor hasn't set up in area yet so there's no need for Comcast to set it up either, because competitive and profit making is more important than delivering Americans quality broadband.</p></div>		</li>
