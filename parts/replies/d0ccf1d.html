			<div class="markdown"><p>The density of nebulae is, like, 20 orders of magnitude less dense than the Earth's atmosphere at sea level.  It would do nothing to life on Earth, irrespective of what the Sun was doing (which would be clearing away all that material through the solar wind).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gas isn't glowing due to how hot it is, although it is also quite hot; rather, it is ionized/excited, and what you're seeing is spectral line radiation from that.  With your eye, mostly the OIII doublet, which is blue-green in color.  The absolute main component of light from emission nebulae like Orion, though, is the red hydrogen alpha line.  The rods in our eyes are not very sensitive to red light, hence why we see the weaker oxygen line better.</p>
<p>Collisional excitation isn't very significant until the density climbs to about 10^3-10^4 particles per cubic centimeter, as I recall.  Rather, the gas gets very hot because it's very difficult for it to cool down (nothing to exchange that energy with!), and because young, massive stars are very hot and put out enormous amounts of radiation.  Much of the interstellar medium hovers at around 10,000 K, the temperature at which hydrogen ionizes, for exactly this reason:  it gets heated up and ionized in a variety of ways (radiation, turbulence, etc.), recombines, and then has no way to cool further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I was trying to say the nebula itself might not do anything, but they tend to be associated with nasty things like new forming systems, stars freshly birthed, nearby stars that can wreak havock, condensing planets--the gas itself is not too bad but the stuff it associates with? You don't want to live there.</p>
<p>Edit: apologies if I was confusing, that is not my goal though I do sometimes manage :S.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want your eye balls and your imagination. Orions belt is not a nebula. Below the left star of the 3 in the belt is orions nebula. Which Is not In or called orions belt. Also it is not visible with the naked eye. If you see anything in that general area it is just a dim star not orions nebula</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did I say belt? I mean the bit in the sword. In the middle. It appears to our eye to be a star, but is actually not. I edited, thanks for catching it.</p>
<p>Edit: with even the smallest binoculars or optical camera 'zoom', it comes out something like <a href="https://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im0349.html" target="_blank">this</a>. The better your glass, the better your view--your average binoculars would never give a view like in that link, of course!</p></div>		</li>
