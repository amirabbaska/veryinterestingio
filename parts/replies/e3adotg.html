			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not a true statement. Objects with mass like say a proton, are made up of quarks which also have mass.
Also, you are not considering mass in the terms of relativity. Light, does not have mass by itself, but because it has energy it exhibits momentum and many of the properties associated with mass. The energy of light deforms space in the same way mass does. Look up “kugelblitz” if you don’t believe me.</p>
<p>A charged battery will actually weigh an imperceptible amount more than an empty one because it has energy. This difference is very small though do to the relationship of E=mc^2</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the words of Brian Greene, to Stephen Colbert:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So Einstein says that spacetime is a four-dimensional differential manifold on which a metric tensor is imposed that solves the Einstein field equations, and that metric tensor gives rise to geodesics and objects that are not experiencing any other force move along the geodesics described by that metric.</p>
