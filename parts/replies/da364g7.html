			<div class="markdown"><p>That might be part of the reason it started, but it has mostly stuck because British newspapers had cartoons that made fun of him by depicting him as extremely diminutive and comically arrogant.The French (eventually) lost, so the propaganda stuck around and later students learned a lot from the old propaganda and the &quot;Napoleon was so short!&quot; meme got a life of its own.</p>
<p>In reality, Napoleon was of an average height for the time period and I doubt anyone at the time thought he was actually short. They were mostly just scared of him. Britain were really the only ones that openly mocked him because they figured that they were safe with the English Channel and the British Navy in his way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was probably one of the main reason for Germany to introduce the metric system. </p>
<p>Until the 19th century there was a huge chaos of different weights and measures. Germany consisted of many small independent states and territories. The bigger ones (Prussia, Austria,...) each had their own 'unified' measures. Only few people had to do conversions because most trade was on a local base (local markets, neighboring territories). Mostly merchants had to know the different measures, weights and currencies of their specific markets.</p>
<p>So in 1871 Germany not only became a united nation state. It also was one of the main participants of the Industrial Revolution. The railway network expanded making 1 day distances a 2 hour ride on the train. In the beginning there wasn't even a single time zone which made railway time tables extremely hard to manage. At that time, Germany also made many advances in fields like engineering or chemistry. So the necessity for a common means of measurement was immanent and the metric system was practical, coherent solution.</p></div>		</li>
