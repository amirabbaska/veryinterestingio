			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the biggest challenge of a parasite, or any disease, is stable transmission. This is why extremely virulent diseases are bad, evolutionarily speaking, because if you, as a bacteria or virus, are so deadly that you kill off all your host before it can pass the pathogen on, you die as well.  AIDS is 100% deadly without antiviral treatment, but it takes so long to kill, while all the time being virulent and transmissable, that it has an effective strategy.</p>
<p>This is why most, if not all, cellular parasites (so ones that are made of a cell or cells, not viruses) have evolved to be transmitted by a vector species.  Some human-human transmission is documented, usually by blood transfusion or organ transplant, sometimes sexually, but the main mode of transmission is through a bite or scratch.</p>
<p><em>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</em> and <em>rhodesiense</em> are transmitted by the bite of a tsetse fly, and the parasites are delivered via the saliva.  Interestingly, as u/noonana said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/71nhdy/are_there_any_challenges_for_parasites_living_in/dncc8nh/" target="_blank">above</a> the surface glycoproteins that are used for host immune evasion are not expressed inside the vector's gut.  So when the worms are in the fly, they don't have the glycoproteins on their surface, they only appear when the parasite is in humans.</p>
<p><em>T.b. cruzi</em> is a different subspecies of trypanosome, and it is transmitted slightly differently.  The vector, a sandfly this time, bites the host, but the parasite isn't delivered via the saliva and bite directly.  The fly drinks some blood, and then takes a poop on the animal it just bit.  The animal, a wide variety of mammal including humans, will then scratch the sore bite.  The parasite is in the poop, so it's the scratching that rubs the poop into the wound and allows transmission. </p>
<p>I have to go now, actually have to go to my class on Medical Parasitology, so I hope this is understandable (and correct lol).</p></div>		</li>
