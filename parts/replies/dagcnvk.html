			<div class="markdown"><p>This, for me is the <em>2nd best</em> best answer.</p>
<p>It describes how the environment and in this case the availability of resources at a particular time shapes the evolution of systems, and how once a particular solution has been implemented the environment is changed and the savings in duplicating that existing solution can often outweigh any benefits of competing solutions. </p>
<p>EDIT: demoted to 2nd best answer due to its <em>truthiness</em>. But is still fooled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_moron_in_a_hurry" target="_blank">a moron in a hurry</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI, this is a good story - but a made-up one.</p>
<p>As others have pointed out, the connector has nothing to do with medical equipment. Guess why it's commonly known as a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kettle+plug&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=984&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix95n2lsjQAhWKx4MKHch2A7QQ_AUIBygC" target="_blank">kettle plug</a> in the UK.</p>
<p>If you like stories like this, here's another one:</p>
<p>The founder of IBM, Thomas Watson Jr., was British. When he was inventing the PC, he had to make a choice about which plug to use for the PSU. He decided to think about it over a cup of tea, and as he was plugging in the kettle, he had the Eureka moment: why not make a plug that would be compatible with the most common household item, the electric kettle? It was a great idea, save for the fact that the kettles were far more common in the UK than in the US where the machine was marketed. Nevertheless, the plug was chosen for the original IBM PC, which made history and set the standard henceforth. </p>
<p>(Disclaimer: the story is about as true as the one in the parent comment).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've let yourself down by using an easy to check claim and then provide a link to help undermine your story. Kettle connectors (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60320#C15.2FC16_coupler" target="_blank">C15/C16</a>) have a nub / notch that prevent you plugging a typical computer lead (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60320#C13.2FC14_coupler" target="_blank">C13/C14</a>) into a high temperature appliance. </p>
<p>So here is another IBM &quot;fact&quot; for you.</p>
<p>The first hard disk of modern design was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM_magnetic_disk_drives#IBM_3340" target="_blank">IBM 3340</a> &quot;Winchester, is so called because it was developed at IBM's Hursley labs near Winchester. </p>
<p>Enjoy!</p></div>		</li>
