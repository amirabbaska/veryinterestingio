			<div class="markdown"><p>How interesting, I only really asked because I'm researching the overland telegraph line in Australia, which was connected to the rest of the world by an underwater telegraph line between Darwin and Indonesia in the 1870's. However with Australia being invaded so late by the west it's totally unsurprising that they were doing this much earlier in other parts of the planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't mean that the first underwater telegraph was 100 years earlier, I was referring to the first telegraph at all (short distance, not in the sea). However they had 100 years to further advance the technology before going for the underwater long distance</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a tour guide in Central Aust so I'm learning the history of the area, which includes the OTL between Port Augusta and Darwin. Found myself curious about the underwater lines when I read that they connected Australia to the rest of the world by a line from Darwin to Java. </p></div>		</li>
