			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok how is it this has not been made more mention of in articles about amazing discoveries? I read all these &quot;look at this amazing old thing we found in the dirt&quot; articles linked on reddit and anywhere else and I had never hear of this. I was always thinking how do they know someone didn't dig a hole and bury that there decades or even hundreds of years later? And now you, a mere student, comes along and nonchalantly explain there is, in fact, a scientific way to know that dirt is undisturbed. I feel like I have to ask this, though, sorry. Source for complete information on this technique? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you go to scholar.google.com there are literally hundreds of articles on OSL dating, and it's cousin TSL dating which someone else has explained in another comment (more of an archaeological technique, I'm less familiar with it)</p>
<p>If it helps, I'm more than a &quot;mere student&quot; I did a semester long research project that directly involved OSL dating (and begging for grant money for OSL dating) and I'm a senior with one semester left, I've completed all the required Geology courses for graduation.</p>
<p>It's a common technique, though fairly new technique in Earth Science, you may not have heard it directly, but these kinda non-scholarly science.com style articles don't normally go much further than the interpretations of data, rather than full explanations of how data was aquired, let alone the specific method that grains were tested using.  There are about a dozen other methods that could be used, and the scientists wouldn't make their determinations from an OSL date alone.  They would take many cores from the area, consult relative ages of rock units, stratigraphic and structural evidence, look for evidence of events that would have disturbed the soil (earthquakes, sand/salt flows, uplifting events) and tried to draw a complete picture.</p>
<p>OSL isn't a magic instant perfect date machine, it's a cog in the wheel, people just wanted to know how you would date the hammer instead of it's materials, I suggested OSL as a method of knowing an approximate date of burial, which when you're talking about millions of years, is pretty good. :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if you used a soil probe and had the sample collected into an opaque tube (what we do for river meander dating in my Geomorphology lab) the sample wouldn't be exposed to light.  OSL samples are processed in a darkroom style lab, also.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep,  also osl works better in some depositional environments than others. Rivers can be crap for it since they tumble sediments around and don't fully expose all sediments.  That's where taking multiple samples at regular intervals thought the profile comes into play - you can assess if the sediment has been turbated and if the dates are accurate or not once you have a whole column of then that should be youngest at top and oldest at bottom. </p></div>		</li>
