			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also important to remember that while it's obviously Bad if code is leaked it's not quite as catastrophic as you might think. Most code actually doesn't contain any particularly clever algorithms that aren't general knowledge.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The code is still under copyright, so you'd get into trouble if you were found to be using it. If it's a big company like Microsoft, they would CRUSH you if your &quot;windows-compatible&quot; OS was actually windows.</p>
</li>
<li>often the code's not that useful without other stuff, like if you stole gmail's code, what would you do with it? Start a new gmail? But a fair chunk of the cost of that would be building hardware infrastructure, then getting people to use it etc.. and then how are you going to make any money off it? And then... as soon as you get popular and noticed... the legal side gets you!</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good points, but keep in mind that the people who might value the leaked code the most are hackers.  It can be a lot easier to spot an exploitable bug if you have the source.</p>
<p>edit: as I replied to someone below, I phrased this poorly.  I didn't mean pawing through thousands of lines of source to find a bug to exploit, I mean using the code as a reference when you've found an interesting flaw via some other means.  Also keep in mind that there are automated code analysis tools to automate the pawing through source just like there are tools to automate finding exploits.</p>
<p>one more edit:  Also think about the fact that while your automated tools are trying to find flaws that can be exploited you could do queries against source code like &quot;find all the places where the word 'secure' is used&quot; &quot;look for all TODOs that were never solved&quot; &quot;find all references to object X, and cross reference w access to lock L&quot; &quot;find all comments with the phrase 'race condition' or 'hack'&quot;.  These are useful pointers to questionable code and anyone trying to break a program w access to the source who isnt doing this sort of thing is throwing away information and costing themselves time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, though open source advocates would actually say the opposite is true... the bugs would be resolved quicker too.</p>
<p>(edit though closed code that was &quot;accidentally&quot; open wouldn't really get the white-hats looking at it for fear of getting into trouble!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  I'd say 99% of compiled apps do not go through any intentional process to lower that code's visibility/exploit-ability.  It's just compiled.</p>
<p>While you can't get back to the actual original code (important for code-reuse), you can absolutely get the underlying algorithms.  That is 99% of what you need to crack/exploit it.  Ironically, most people writing cracks/exploits have little to no problem following decompiled assembly.</p>
<p>Back before they treated hackers worse than terrorists, I wrote a couple private cracks for a few small programs.  Not having the source code is REALLY not much of an obstacle.  In fact, I'm not sure access to some of the source code would significantly affect the effort of finding the right JMP statements to short-circuit in the compiled code to get in.</p>
<p>The same is kinda true to someone wanting to exploit a product.  If it's an online service you probably don't have the running binary, which is a thing...but it's still 1000x easier to run a black-box security suite on a site than it is to dig through the source code and see what they might've screwed up on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great point. I work on software, and while we certainly have security our biggest defense is the the software is useless without the hardware it's supposed to run on.
Great you stole the source code, you still need a 100k machine for it to be useful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I interned for a company and a senior dev told me about how someone tried to sell us our main competitor’s source code - we just told the police had them setup a sting operation on them. The kicker was that we wouldn’t even <em>want</em> their source code. Our architectures are fundamentally different anyways, and any feature they had that was interesting we could just copy with our architecture more quickly than we could adapt their source code anyways. What makes code valuable is not the implementation, it’s the resources necessary to create it, and big companies have plenty of resources. The only real risk is foreign companies in countries with lax intellectual properties just literally ripping the source code and selling it as their own complete product, and in that case we sell an OEM version of our software to disincentivize that (just pay us a fee and we’ll <em>let you</em> claim our product is yours).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One way is to not let everyone access to the full code. Your job today is to write a function that draw a square on the screen. For this, you do not need to have access to the full program.</p>
<p>Then you can see who added what code, how many lines they added and removed and what exactly. Basically, it's a log that show the changes. &quot;User Bob added 17 lines, removed 2, changed 7, changes are this:&quot;. To code a backdoor, you would have to usually change alot of lines, or change stuff that would be weird...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but those changes would be easy to spot, and that's where everything is the most checked, so harder to hide.</p>
<p>The other solution is to code something unintended in another function and that require more lines.</p>
<p>Sure, you could always go &quot;If user == hackme then open a root telnet on port  1337&quot;...</p>
<p>But point is, you have to modify key elements, which will look suspect, or have to do some other changes, that look like normal edit and will pass incognito even to whoever review the code.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Limited code access is cool with Jr. devs, but doesn't really scale as well as it sounds.  It's very easy for a developer to write code that seems correct, but fails to jive with peer code in a way that's not immediately obvious and creates an exploitable bug.</p>
<p>Everywhere I've worked, I technically had at least read access to pretty much everything within 2 levels of indirection from my projects.  In the Agile world, we're expected to make smart educated guesses on things that seems small...you can't do that if everything around you is <em>completely</em> sealed up.</p>
<p>Service Oriented Architecture encourages a &quot;black-box&quot; approach where each service is documented and their communications controlled...but in the real world, developers can usually read the source code of those peer services because it's never usually that cut-and-dry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But those read access can and is most likelly also logged. So if there is a leak, they can narrow down who did it by looking at who pulled up the source code, comparing the leaked copy with the revision it was at at that time, and see who it can or can't be.</p></div>		</li>
