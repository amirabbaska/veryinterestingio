			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;OK; now that everyone has a hold on the outside of the donut, let me tell you about our next challenge. We're going to spin the station so you experience 3 Gs of force. The last person left hanging on will receive The Station Key this week. They will get to decide who eats what and when, and who sleeps where. Also remember that we had a secret drawing to give one person the opportunity to wire explosive bolts to someone's tether. That extra control has been activated in their EVA suit. Ready? <em>Ignition!</em>&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was actually a really shitty reality TV show here in the UK where some morons were tricked into believing they were on a space craft in space (&quot;but not far out enough that there isn't gravity&quot;).</p>
<p>They sent the people to what they were led to believe was an actual astronaut training camp before putting them on the craft and had an ultra HD tevlevision acting as a window on the &quot;spacecraft&quot; that showed the Earth.</p>
<p>The grand reveal that they were actually in a TV studio the entire time was really crappy but I can't even remember exactly why.</p>
