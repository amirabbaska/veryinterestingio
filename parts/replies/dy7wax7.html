			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you are correct. You can get arbitrarily large (angular) momentum by just approaching near luminal velocity if using special relativity formulas for (angular) momentum. Combining relativity with quantum mechanics creates other problems though. It's getting into Theory of Everything area. Relativistic Quantum Mechanics is sometimes a separate course in graduate school, if covered at all. Also, my personal conjecture is that admitting the electron is a relativistic flywheel, among other things, may open up pathways of inquiry into somewhat secretive areas of physics. There is then perhaps some disinformation thrown around in various areas of physics. If not exactly intentional, at least the people who could best speak with authority are often busy or bound to some nondisclosure agreements, or at the very least wish to publish their own conclusions in venues that will progress their careers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically special relativity says nothing can travel <strong>at</strong> the speed of light.</p>
<p>There is no problem with something traveling faster than light <em>as long as it doesn't approach that threshold</em>!</p>
<p>(Yes there is a pretty huge problem in that the object has to have always been going fast than light).</p>
<p>Pop-science example: tachyons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omg I have so many questions now. </p>
<p>The tachyon wiki page says there are massles particles that <em>only</em> travel at the speed of light so &quot;nothing <strong>can</strong> travel at the speed of light&quot;  ...can kind of mean if it has no mass (is nothing)  then it could go light speed?  Or is that still like dividing by zero or those graphs where you can't ever aproach zero (asymptotes)?  Can we make something with mass into pure energy to cross over to the faster than light speed side?  Does or can a massless particle still have/carry &quot;information&quot;? </p>
<p>Oh man. I wish I was good at math because then I'd just read the sciency papers that explain these things in numbers :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re that interested, you could probably work through the math. It would just take a lot of time, and a lot of patience, and a lot of determination. But you’d probably find it rewarding in the end.</p></div>		</li>
