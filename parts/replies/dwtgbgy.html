			<div class="markdown"><p>One part of the ponzi scheme? Dupe the German worker. Volkswagen was at the heart of this. They came up with a monthly payment plan where every worker could own a car. The only problem? There was no way they could actually get cars to all the people that enrolled in the program. Yet all these workers were dutifully allowing deductions from their paycheck for a car that would never be delivered. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ponzi scheme, if well managed, can last a long time barring major disasters. Bernie Madoff managed to keep his Ponzi scheme going for 40+ years and it could have lasted longer if it wasn't for the GFC. </p>
<p>In hindsight the third Reich was rather poorly managed and they were barely staying afloat through a series of conquest and plunder. Annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia happened because, at least in part, so Germany could absorb their relatively intact gold and forex reserves. By the end of 1939 these money had run out again, and thus war became inevitable as the only way out.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another &quot;cash infusion&quot; came from seizing property and companies owned by the resident jewish population.  Even with that, it only had to last until he could start looting and pillaging neighboring countries.</p>
<p>If Germany had &quot;won&quot; WW2 (defined in this case as continuing to exist), the post-war era would have seen either a truly massive economic and industrial reorganization to an underpinning not based on flagrant theft, or total economic collapse, likely followed by civil war as various Nazi strongmen fought for control over the scraps, as Hitler was not long for this world regardless.</p></div>		</li>
