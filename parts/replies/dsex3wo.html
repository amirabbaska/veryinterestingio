			<div class="markdown"><p>I was pretty pissed off when I noticed a really nasty cyansish cast on all my photos with my DSLR's new &quot;kit&quot; lens.</p>
<p>Apparently, they hadn't used enough coating on the lenses, and the light was actually bouncing off the sensor (which has a color similar to a solar panel) and then back onto the lens, and then hitting the sensor again, getting embedded as part of the image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which lens and camera was it? Internal reflections between the sensor and the lens rarely affect the image, especially in DSLRs with longer distance between the lens and the sensor. </p>
<p>Wrong white balance is a much more likely culprit for bad colour. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My glasses certainly make things look any darker when I put them on, so I don't think you'd see that as a perceptible shadow.</p>
<p>I assume that 3% is the total, with most of it being reflected at low angles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was well written, but I have one small correction: glasses don't work differently depending on &quot;which way round you hold them&quot;. The refraction is the same in both directions. </p>
<p>(EDIT: I don't mean it's necessarily identical in both directions, since asymmetrical lenses do exist --- and most eyeglasses are --- but you won't get the &quot;dark shadow&quot; effect one way and the &quot;bright spot&quot; effect the other way.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is right so far that the focal length will remain about the same, but reversing a given lens is not identical simply because most lenses are <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Lens2.png" target="_blank">purposefully not symmetrical</a>.</p>
<p>Most eyeglass lenses are convex-concave, so those with corrective lenses can observe this yourself by flipping your glasses in front of one of your eyes. The center will be in focus, but you'll see aberrations around the edges.</p>
<p>If you have an astigmatism-correcting lens, the lens won't be rotationally symmetric either, as there will be different focal points for different axes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. For asymmetrical lenses, the reverse won't be exactly the same. But I don't think any lens will actually be converging in one direction and diverging in the opposite direction, which is what the original write-up was suggesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. If a glass was able to be 100%. It would look invisible, due to all light not being affected. Even if dust was on it. The debris would look like it's floating on nothing.</p></div>		</li>
