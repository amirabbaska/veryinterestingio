			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct, but there is also a historical element.  The Morrill Land Act (1862) called for the founding of large agricultural universities to be built across America; it was around this time that institutes of higher education began to spring up across the country (and especially in the North, considering the civil war was still ongoing).</p>
<p>American higher education also saw two huge boons during and after WWII.  Before the war even started, lots of Eastern Europeans migrated to America.  We got countless great minds as a result; for example Einstein moved to America in 1933.  Then after the war, German scientists who didn't want to work for the USSR also moved to America.</p>
<p>The GI Bill was another important factor.  With millions of young troops returning home and given college education, schools needed to be invested in.  The early 1950's saw a huge influx of money towards public and higher education.</p>
<p>At this point, America was seen as &quot;the place for higher education&quot;.  Most of Europe and Asia was wartorn and in the process of rebuilding, so the US became a hub of learning, and continues to be, although online universities are taking a larger share of students and there are certainly more schools growing outside of the US. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, the term is called Pedigree. Asia has a lot of great universities with fantastic professors and technology but were founded very very recently. China lost all its great universities during the Mao era. Not to mention all the devastating wars in SE Asia. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>China didnt just lose universities. Intellectuals were &quot;reformed&quot;. Beaten, tortured, etc. They didnt just discourage you from thinking like an academic, they physically hurt you if you did. This was part of Mao's cultural revolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer just isn't clicking for me, do you have any sources on this? Harvard is significantly older than the United States, I'm having a hard time believing that its reputation is a mostly modern, post-war creation. An education from Harvard was a big deal long before &quot;American higher education&quot; was a thing. The school has been around since the 1600s and had been minting US politicians, lawyers, and diplomats for a very long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right, Harvard has been around for a while.  But nowhere as long as some European schools like Cambridge or Oxford.  Honestly, education in the colonies was seen as very much &quot;second tier&quot; and schools like Harvard and Yale which seem old now were still seen as very young as far as schools go for a long time (and still are, somewhat).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard something similar before. The point of the story is that today's ranking can only tell you how good a school was in the past. The rankings or people's opinions and experiences of the school can't tell you anything about what is happening at the school today.</p>
<p>So today, some college no one knows about might be doing something ground-breaking in teaching or research. We might not know about it for a long time. So if you want to know how good a school was 30 years ago, you should check today's college rankings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, can't speak for American universities but Oxford and Cambridge are most certainly demanding universities to study at and hold the expectations of students ability far higher than most others in the UK. It is likely only imperial college and lse come close in UK. The students that go are normally truly the brightest minds, this will most likely include a pool of students from Asia aswell. </p>
<p>Whilst on the whole Asia may value education as it is the focus of parents and society for a better future, the students that apply to these universities have both an incredible natural ability and work ethic to match. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I may add, some of the Korean universities hold incredibly high prestige. You may not have heard of them because Americans (me as well) lack the information of universities outside of USA. Among Koreans, the SKY trio, Seoul University, Korea University, and Yonsei University, hold prestige on the level of Harvard. The competition to get into these universities is fierce. They call it &quot;college-entrance exam hell.&quot; If you graduate, you'll be set with your choice of career.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not American but I see your point. Another example is Hong Kong - within the territory, competition for entry to any of the universities is fierce (there are only eight meaning places are limited). However, Hong Kong University and Chinese University are held in very high regard locally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It goes beyond that though. I can't speak to Oxford, but Harvard doesn't do the same things as other schools. We could talk about how it's scholastic program is different and somewhat unique, but that's not even the biggest factor. </p>
<p>The most valuable part of a Harvard education, perhaps even more important than the name on your CV, is learning how to wear uncomfortable clothing and talk to incredibly important people about interesting things while not getting too drunk. Seriously. It feels like half an undergrad at Harvard is spent schmoozing with highly influential people. You get very, very good at it and make incredible connections. </p>
<p>There's a reason why consulting firms and finance gobble up Harvard undergrads. This is it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxford / Cambridge are 100% similar, the people I know who have gone to either don't find the academic aspects extremely challenging (Only the first year mind), since most of them are some of the smartest young people in the country / world, evinced by where they've ended up.</p>
<p>With the concentration of incredibly intelligent people at universities like that, people are bound to go on to be extremely successful, and when you know a lot of successful people you can set up a lot of business links and become even more successful yourself, then it's just a perpetual cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know quite a few kids that went to ivy leagues and none of them are even close to the top ten percent smartest people I've met. In my experience the kids that make it into ivy league schools are generally kids who are nearly devoid of social intelligence as they spend their entire high school career trying to build the perfect college application. </p>
<p>Almost universally all of the unbelievably smart people I know got chewed up and spit out by an extremely shitty public education system. </p>
<p>Succeeding in basic education is about being just smart enough to do the work, but not smart enough to think for yourself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other contributing factor, I think, is how much controlled freedom we are given. </p>
<p>Oxford student, just finishing up my degree. In my time, I've organised a whole host of events and societies, some with huge budgets that I was solely responsible for a large part of (£30k+). I mostly left to figure it out for myself but if you do get stuck, there are people there to help. So I've learned how to manage those things without having to worry about the consequences falling only my head. Even in my degree, we are encouraged to do projects because they are interesting/we can see a need for them -- much more so than friends on courses at other unis. </p></div>		</li>
