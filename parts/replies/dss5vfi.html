			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it really though? Pinning them in place could easily be seen as a request for analysis of a single instant. Obviously pinning a black hole in place is impossible but analyzing a single instant would still give a meaningful answer about the forces acting on a body within the system and any potential for escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how meaningful the answer would be. Although stationary, single instant analysis makes sense when dealing with Newtonian physics, on this scale the velocities and positions of the black holes play into the results, because the speed of gravity must also be considered. This is because black holes may be moving at significant portions of the speed of light when merging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that you're introducing an impossibility into equations. The more you delve into the question the more it becomes as rhetorical as an irresistible force meeting an immovable object.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is analyzing a single instant introducing an impossibility? I'm not talking about <em>actually</em> trying to pin two black holes in the process of merging in place, I'm talking about taking 2 black holes that are already in the process of merging and looking at whats happening in 1 instant. </p>
<p>The answer to the question, explained above by people far smarter then me, is that when two black hole's event horizons touch they become a single larger black hole, and nothing ever escapes a black hole. How does looking at a single instant make that rhetorical?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking that it allows for a lot of simplification to the problem without changing the idea much. I also feel that if the situation were possible, then it could also be extended to specific instances of binary black hole mergers. I also think that generally it is easier to answer a simpler case, and then extend it to more complex cases. </p></div>		</li>
