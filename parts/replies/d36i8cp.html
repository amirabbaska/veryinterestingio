			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Occasionally, people use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradian" target="_blank">gradians</a> insteads of degrees, which break the circle into 400 grads. This means that right angles are 100 grads which has an appeal. This is also what the deg/grad/rad button on a calculator would use. Apparently it's mostly used in surveying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(geometry\)" target="_blank">turn</a>. Where 1 turn is 2π rads, 360°, or 400 grads. This is handy for large angles &quot;such as in connection with electromagnetic coils and rotating objects&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Converting between π radians and turns is done simply by multiplying with a factor of 2. This is where I see the appeal of using tau (τ) instead of pi, with τ = 2π. Then you could say that 1τ radian is the same as 1 turn, so 1/2 τ radians are half a turn. The would make radians much easier to understand. Many people think radians they are something complicated, something only scientists use, even though the angle in pi radians is simply half a turn. I am not saying the tau is &quot;better&quot; then pi and should replace it, and that tau should be taught everywhere, but I believe that in some situations substituting 2 pi with tau might be useful for understanding.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's natural when you're talking about slicing a cake or pizza - eg &quot;do you want a quarter slice? &quot; or &quot;do you want half of my pizza?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But also, you can estimate angles quickly using your hands, and for small angles you can skip trig entirely by approximating the edge of a circle to be a line - two targets 1 mil apart at 1000 yards are ~1 meter apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, snipers too. It's gaining some popularity in the civilian shooting sports world as well, my target rifle's scope uses mil turrets and a mil reticle (some mil dot scopes still use MOA turrets). Calculations are fairly easy since a mil is one unit at a thousand units range (so a thousand meters out, one mil is one meter; at 100m, 0.1 mil (one click on a typical mil turret) is one centimeter), but it can take a little getting used to if you're accustomed to yards and inches and MOA (where 1 MOA = 1 inch at 100 yards). </p>
<p>The use of these scopes is pretty neat too, without a rangefinder or any other technological assistance you can compute ranges or the size of something if you know the other item. I had to use a calculator app since I'm not 100% up to speed on the math (I just do it for fun every once in a while), but I was able to measure my range at 127m last time I went shooting just by seeing that my 5x5&quot; steel plate was one mil. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>400 is not divisible by 3, so it's inferior to degrees unless you know that you'll only ever be working with right angles. The moment you have to divide any angle by three, you're stuck with infinitely repeating decimals. Being repeatedly divisible by 3 is part of the point of using the number 360.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The purpose of gradians is that there are more subdivisions of the circle, and therefore more accurate approximations can be made. </p>
<p>If you're an artillery commander, adjusting the angle of your cannon by 1 grad is a more precise operation than adjusting by 1 deg</p></div>		</li>

<p>If your primary goal is simplicity of numerical representation, sure.  That often doesn't matter at all though.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the Mesopotamians that gave use this. Same reason why there are 12 hours in a day.
When they counted, they used their fingers but not in the way we're used to. On the  inside of each of your four fingers you have 3 creases from your knuckles.  4 fingers x 3 creases = 12.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The knuckle crease thing is not actually why they used base 12.  We don't know for sure why base 12 developed, but &quot;advanced knuckle counting&quot; definitely developed later as a smart way to do the b12 math they were already using.  </p>
<p>One common idea for how b12 developed is that in proto-human society, as language was formalized enough for counting, the first obvious division was the 1-2.   Two hands, two arms, etc.  </p>
<p>Counting to 2 with both hands, then adding fingers makes each fist a &quot;1&quot; and an open palm a &quot;6&quot; and all fingers on both palms a &quot;12.&quot;  (With no zero)</p>
<p>This follows better what we know and <em>infer</em> about both the evolution of language and the invention of numbers &amp; number theory.  </p>
<p>But unless we find some crazy random ancient cave paintings or something, we'll never know for certain why base-12 was the early leader.  It may have actually begun <em>because</em> it devides a circle, to loop this back to OP question. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's where it came from, but the reason it stuck was the high divisibility. All the numbers that people like the Egyptions and Babylonians used, 12, 24, 60, 360, have lots of divisors compared to other numbers in the same range. There may have been many number systems that were based on 5 or 9 or 11, but they didn't survive because they were not as useful as the ones where division was easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but a much of our current numbering system can be contributed to the Babylonians. They used base 60 because it was easy to divide, which is were we got our 60 seconds, 60 minutes, 360 degrees, etc. But perhaps more importantly, they were also one of the first to use a positional numbering system. That's were our placeholder 0 comes from. For example, in numbers like 10, 101, 1000.. The zero is just a placeholder. It's kind of crazy to think how this seemingly simple concept was one day invented.</p></div>		</li>
