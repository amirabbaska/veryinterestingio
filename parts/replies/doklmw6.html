			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok I tried this and it didn't really work. The ring goes on the proximal phalanx or the last third of the finger which is the widest part. This is what needs to be the most stable when pushing it in or pulling the ring off as once you pass the proximal phalanx, the rest of the finger is too narrow to have any significant effect.</p>
<p>When pulling off while braced against a wall or table, the lower third is still not stable enough since it is not in direct contact with the wall. It's indirectly braced via three joints - the two on your finger and the makeshift one between the tip and the wall which makes it all wobbly or if you push it against the wall strong enough, distorts your finger this making it harder to pull off the ring.</p>
<p>Hope that makes as much sense as it did in my head!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I guess you should try using butter or something like that to ease the way out instead of forcing it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really don't think this is the correct answer. It might be a factor but I think it has something more to do with the skin/tissue-swelling in the comments below.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, my answer is quite wrong. It does, however, explain why a properly fitting ring is more awkward to take off than to put on, despite your finger being tapered/skinnier in the off direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wanna add that the blood in your finger can rush into your hand while you put a ring on, but in the opposite direction, the blood flows towards the tip and compresses to have an inflated effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, i’m very wrong.</p>
<p>Somehow missed the “tight” part of your question, which, as others have explained quite thoroughly, has more to do with the circulation in your finger getting stopped up.</p>
<p>My explanation is for why a properly fitting ring is easier to put on than take off.</p></div>		</li>
