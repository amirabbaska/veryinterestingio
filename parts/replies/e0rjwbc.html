			<div class="markdown"><p>Because this cycle is not exactly 24 hours. It's 24 hours and 50 minutes. About once a month there is a calendar day with only one high tide. We just say the tide cycle includes 2 low/high tides a day because 95% of the time, there is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the Earth turns in 24 hours (23 hours 56 minutes actually because the same effect plays with the Earth-Sun). But the moon also turns around the Earth in 28 days, so exactly a day later and the Moon is not at the exact same location. So for the moon to be at the exact same location it takes 24 (Earth day) + 1/28 * 24 (moon movement) = 24 hours and 50 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lunar month is actually 29 days. The rest is correct enough. The moonrise is about 48min later every day, as are the tides. </p>
<p>I started noticing this the most obviously by taking my dog for a walk at 9pm every night. Every night, the Moon was about one outstretched hand farther to the east at the same time. Yâ€™know, you grow up indoors with clocks and stuff, and one day you learn how pre-industrial people did things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He did, that's what he meant by the force of gravity being higher on one side than the other.</p>
<p>The water is like a layer over the earth, gravity (opposite the moon) is pulling on the crust harder than it's pulling on the water. So there would be a slight bulge on the opposite side. </p>
<p>Yes, the side closest to the moon would have the higher tides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a superb explanation, but I want to add a little bit more detail.</p>
<p>The Earth isn't just a perfectly smooth sphere with a layer of water on it. There are continents and islands that the water has to go around. Sometimes the water has to take a long path to get somewhere, and sometimes it takes a short path. Sometimes it moves through open ocean, sometimes through a narrow channel.</p>
<p>Plus, water has momentum and doesn't just turn on a dime because the moon moved from here to there.</p>
<p>So what it all means is that really the oceans are just sloshing back and forth on the Earth and it's a big, very complicated motion. It's almost more accurate to say that the moon's pull pumps energy into the system.</p>
<p>I took oceanography for a while in college, and a lot of research goes into mapping not just the islands and things we can see, but the actual shape of the sea bed, which also affects the sloshing of all of this water. I actually spent some time working on computer models that would predict wave height and such.</p>
<p>This is why some parts of the world have crazy high tides, and others have very gentle tides. Why some places have more or less than two tides per day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To amplify that a bit: If there were no continents, the tides would be a matter of a few inches. Most of the variation we see is a sloshing effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it's that sloshing that causes a braking effect on the Earth by the Moon.  As the ocean sloshes against the continents, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_acceleration" target="_blank">the gravity between the ocean and the Moon cause the Moon's orbit to speed up and the Earth's rotation to slow.</a>  A similar but opposite effect caused the Moon to be tidally locked to the Earth (the same face is always facing the Earth).  The Moon is also <a href="https://futurism.com/a-rocky-relationship-is-the-moon-leaving-the-earth/" target="_blank">spiraling away from us at a rate of about 4 cm per year.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In about 50 billion years, the Moon will stop moving away from us and settle into a nice, stable orbit. At this point, the Moon will take about 47 days to go around the Earth (currently, it takes a little over 27 days). When this new stability is achieved, the Earth and the Moon will be tidally locked to each other.</p>
