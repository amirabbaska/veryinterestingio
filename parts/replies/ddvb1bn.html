They could never be kept in eachothers company again after that day. Literaly the day before it happened they were eating and sleeping and playing together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These dogs were raised together. One was a few years older. But the other. was raised from a newborn with our dogs (we had about 6 adults and sometimes litters of a dozen or so). Everything was fine untill one day they just started to fight. There was nothing out of the ordinary up untill that moment. I still have a scar on my finger from trying to seperate them.</p></div>		</li>
