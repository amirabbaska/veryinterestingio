			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Most people who survive getting hit by lightning don't get hit by the main bolt since that would basically make you explode instantly since it has such a high amount of current during that fraction of a second when it strikes. It's either the hitting something very near them which can still most definitely kill you, or its one of the smaller streamers which can kill you but you might escape alive. Even then if the bolt goes through the area of your heart you'll very much still die.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work as a technician servicing home telecom equipment.  About once a day I'd get a repair as a result of a lightning strike to nearby phone or power lines.  The fault descriptions were always very dramatic.  For example, the telephone being blown off the wall.  The worst one I remember is that all the electrical wiring in the house exploded out of the walls.  The amount of energy in a lightning strike is unbelievable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fellow electrical engineer, I think there is confusion in the way we talk about current and voltage in these cases that makes it confusing. The difference between the door knob and the power lines is the amount of energy (charge) that can be delivered. Think micro battery versus mega battery. The static electricity built up on the door knob just doesnt have enough energy to sustain a current. Instead the capacitance of a persons skin dissipates the energy delivered. While that high voltage line can sustain that 10,000V overcoming the capacitance in your body and making you smell like burnt toast. </p>
<p>I think it helps to think of it as voltage and the amount of energy/charge that can be delivered, which ends up determining the current. </p></div>		</li>
