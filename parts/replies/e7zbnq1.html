<p>Not really. The spinal cord is mostly a big highway of cables from the central to the peripheral nervous system. Almost no computation whatsoever takes place there, except for a very small amount of in the form of reflexes, where a sensory neuron connects pretty much directly onto a motor neuron, thus computing a very simple &quot;if X then Y&quot; operation. But to call that &quot;thought&quot; would be a huge stretch of terminology. Indeed, a definition of &quot;reflex&quot; might well include the condition &quot;occurs without thought&quot;. </p>
<p>Decisions, by and large, are made in the central nervous system, while the spinal cord just carries the result of those decisions to the periphery. </p></div>		</li>
