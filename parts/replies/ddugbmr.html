			<div class="markdown"><p>It's honestly really amusing; people imagine the 50s and 60s as 'pure' television, where people were innocent and that was reflected in their entertainment.</p>
<p>The reality is quite different. The 50s and 60s had stricter laws because one of the first things ever broadcast had full frontal nudity. They combated this by making excessive censorship regulations. As a result, you now have people looking back at a 'purer time', when in reality there never was a more pure time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The extremely religious are the only ones that really follow it as well. I remember when I was 12 or 13 I was hanging at my friends when his cousin invited us to go see some extremely tame family comedy. It was rated PG and his aunt wanted me to call my parents to see if it was ok. I laughed and then just looked at her in shock as she was being serious. I told her it wasn't necessary but she wouldn't take us unless I called. I dialed my mom and gave his aunt the phone because she didn't trust me since I &quot;challenged&quot; her authority. My mom laughed at her and said its fine. I think she's still mad about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh yes, every answer except my one must be true.</p>
<p>Excluding, of course, all the other countries which have had Christian majorities but still showed sex scenes and considered them to be less worthy of high rating than violent scenes.</p>
<p>This is the same mentality that Anti-Vaccination people have when they sift through the thousands of studies that show no negative affect and find the 1 out of those thousands and proclaim that only that ONE study must be true since it conforms to their world view.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The OPs question is about the MPAA ratings specifically, which are unique to America. The reason we have them in America is due to religious reasons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because religion didn't motivate people to do something in one country doesn't mean religion wasn't the motivation for actions in another.</p>
<p>The puritan movement in the US <em>was</em> based in religion and is largely to blame for the US's weird cultural hangups about nipples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh I think that the older shows have be acquired by Audible Channels and are being remastered for release there....that might be why they are not available yet...</p>
<p>I'm not really sure to be honest. Bullets and Blood I notice is available in itunes, and that's awesome.  Might give you a feel and it covers the pre-code era as well, just not specifically about it.</p></div>		</li>
