			<div class="markdown"><p>its actually really simple what he did, it was just the perfect alignment of luck in the programs he was running + his own terrible security.</p>
<p>for starters without dyndns he would have never found his computer again because he would have had nothing to track, but since dyndns was constantly keeping records of the IP address associate with the computer, he could get an address.</p>
<p>then the guy was using dial up instead of a router, which gave hackerman the raw connection information, he didn't need a local forwarding port which also would have made it impossible.</p>
<p>then because the hacker had terrible security, he was able to SSH (think remote desktop, but all you get is a console) into the computer (but again only because he knew the login information already and the SSH wasn't in a secure configuration which only allows connections from certain IP addresses).</p>
<p>lastly, even with a keylogger that he could only plant knowing all the connection information, he wasn't able to collect the guys passwords because of the keychain, which luckily he already knew the password to.</p>
<p>so this is largely a demonstration on how with a mix of luck and a basic understanding of tools, you can log into a system you already own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was able to follow along with what he was doing, I just wasn't familiar with some of the programs and things. I have no idea what dyndns is, for example.</p>
<p>What I REALLY don't get is...how the fuck did the thief get into the keychain? It was a desktop so the keychain couldn't have been sitting open. The computer must have been turned off when it was stolen.</p>
<p>I also don't get how he was able to see the desktop, or whatever it's called on mac. I'm basically familiar with SSH and that it's just a console, so what was the deal with the visual? The pictures he could have just pulled back to his new computer, but the desktop confused me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but the very fact that you do know that makes you much less likely to be a person who physically steals computers.  Most thieves are not smart individuals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He thinks a $20 deadbolt would have prevented the loss of his 1.5k+ computer?</p>
<p>I can break a $20 deadbolt with a drunken kick. Fun fact: Your door's frame is not as strong as your door in a <em>lot</em> of situations.</p>
<p>Note: Otherwise, excellent talk. :D</p>
<p>EDIT: This should not have included the people who contacted him. That's scumbaggy. That person was trying to contact someone through legitimate means, and now she is featured on a relatively successful hacker speech.</p>
<p>That's actually kind of fucked up, and the speaker should not have included that.</p>
<p>Also, defcon needs to work on their audio set up. This is shit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The other thing no one ever seems to think about.  You get a house with a security door, and security windows... at that point the easiest means of entry is through a wall.  (Unless you're dealing with a brick or cinderblock exterior)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The deadbolt is just to high light the issue of hackers often overlooking physical security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deadbolt prevents opportunistic thieves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a 5 year old Defcon talk.</p>

<li>I have no issues with the audio on the video, you may just have a bad setup for listening.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Posting the nudes of your thief for shits and giggles is one thing, but not uninvolved third parties who likely have no idea that a bunch of hackers have seen their private photos.</p></div>		</li>
