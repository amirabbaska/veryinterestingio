			<div class="markdown"><p>Opossums are literally resistant to anything on earth. Saw one get run over at work, and it laid there clinging to life for hours. (I wanted to kill it but others were watching over the scene).</p>
<p>A buddy tells a story of an opossum that lived by his house; he shot it twice, the thing shrieked, bleeding, and ran onto his roof. Lived for hours.</p>
<p>If the entire surface of the earth were littered with nuclear bombs tomorrow, opossums would wake up the next day thinking, &quot;Hey, what happened?&quot;</p></div>		</li>
