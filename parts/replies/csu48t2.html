			<div class="markdown"><p>If you read the blog post, you'll see that's what they were doing at first, as a way of asking the picture what it thought an object looked like.  </p>
<p>They asked the picture to make anything that looked even barely like <an object target="_blank"> to look more like <an object target="_blank"> about a zillion times so they could fool the picture into basically drawing <an object target="_blank"> for them.</p>
<p>Later they got bored and started giving it real computers.</p></div>		</li>
