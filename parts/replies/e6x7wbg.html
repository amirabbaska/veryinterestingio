			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in TV in the UK, so I can answer this.</p>
<p>US stuff is 25fps. UK is 24. It's literally just that..when it's encoded, you get a weird blur effect.</p>
<p>The cameras they shoot with affect what it's encodable at.</p>
<p>Edit: got the numbers flipped, and my info is a few years out of date from modern standards - but the principle is the same. Just differing frame rates </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You got it flipped a bit. NTSC broadcast standards (which is what the US uses) is 29.97fps. The UK uses PAL which is 25fps. 23.98fps is typically used for film. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be misremembering, but I think it's to do with the frequency of the mains - USA is 60Hz, thus 30fps.  UK is 50Hz thus 25fps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, certainly in the past there was always a somewhat, falseness, to the way the picture looked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Older shows might have been shot on film but only the most successful ones get a full HD restoration for re-runs (e.g., Two and a Half Men, Star Trek TNG). Some were shot on videotape.</p>
<p>I don't know what to say about talk shows the ones I watch are gorgeous. Of course in the old days they were shot on standard definition tape I assume you mean current airings of Colbert, Kimmel etc.</p></div>		</li>
