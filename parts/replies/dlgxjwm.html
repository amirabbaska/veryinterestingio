			<div class="markdown"><p>The nervous system of insects is much less centralized than that of vertebrates. Besides the &quot;brain&quot; (controversial use of the word here), the central nervous system consists of several ganglia or nerve clusters/centers that control or innervate a certain aspect of the insect's functions, and are all part of a ventral nerve cord that for the most part runs through the length of the body along the underside of the insect. However, centralization varies between orders of insects. In grasshoppers, this system is most decentralized, while in flies, many ganglia have fused together.</p></div>		</li>
