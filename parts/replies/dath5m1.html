If you've had the pleasure of spending any time in Anbar, you'd know even right along the Euphrates, it's not very fertile at all.  I've heard that since this was the birthplace of agriculture, the land was just overworked to the point that it what it is now, but I'm not sure how true that is.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.9_kiloyear_event" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.9_kiloyear_event</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 5.9 kiloyear event was one of the most intense aridification events during the Holocene Epoch. It occurred around 3900 BC (5900 years Before Present) and ended the Neolithic Subpluvial and probably initiating the most recent desiccation of the Sahara.</p>
<p>It also triggered human migration to river valleys, such as from central North Africa to the Nile, which eventually led to the emergence of the first complex, highly organized, state-level societies in the 4th millennium BC.[1] It is associated with the last round of the Sahara pump theory.</p>
<p>A model by Claussen et al. (1999) suggested rapid desertification, associated with vegetation-atmosphere interactions following a cooling event, Bond event 4.[2] Bond et al. (1997) identified a North Atlantic cooling episode 5900 years ago from ice-rafted debris as well as other such now called Bond events, which indicate the existence of a quasiperiodic cycle of Atlantic cooling events approximately every 1470 years Â± 500 years.[3] For some reason, all the earlier arid events (including the 8.2 kiloyear event) were followed by recovery, as is attested by the wealth of evidence of humid conditions in the Sahara between 10,000 and 6,000 BP.[4] However, it appears that the 5.9 kiloyear event was followed by a partial recovery at best, with accelerated desiccation in the millennium that followed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>tl;dr ice age cycles create deserts, and they don't always recover when the cycle moves on</p>
<p>Apparently the modern climate/anthropology theory is that the beginning desertification is actually what triggered civilization, as prehistoric humans were driven into the remaining fertile areas, usually around rivers.  Scarcity made agriculture necessary, and increased human density drives specialization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand, much of the remaining current day arable land is being ruined by human farming and a process known as desertification. This process is pervasive because of either lack of knowledge of proper farming and irrigation techniques or lack of available water. Essentially, when someone digs a well they are bringing up salt that is embedded in the lower soil levels and depositing that salt in the upper soil levels. This kills plant life that isn't tolerant to high sodium levels. So if nothing will grow in the soil, you remove the natural processes that create soil such as the depositing of minerals and nitrogen from composting organic matter making the more susceptible to weathering.</p>
<p><em>edit</em> Improper irrigation causes salt deposits to be moved up the soil table.</p></div>		</li>
