			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually answers the question. An interesting thing to note with indexes like the ftse100 which is the index of the biggest 100 companies on the London stock exchange is that the index &quot;self selects&quot; successful companies because if a company shrinks and is no longer in the top 100 it is dropped from the index and replaced with another. </p>
<p>Not all indexes start at 100. The FTSE was set at 1000 in 1984. </p></div>		</li>
