			<div class="markdown"><p>Water molecules in gas have more kinetic energy (speed) than water molecules in liquid. When the temperature is higher, the average speed of the particles is higher so more water molecules can be above the threshold where the water molecules can remain in a gas form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Warm air contains warm water molecules, which have a higher levels of energy than cold water molecules. Water molecules with higher energy levels are more likely to move freely and less likely be overcome by the weak inter-molecular forces that pull them together (condensation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when it is warm, it is little expanded. When it is cold, it shrinks . This applies for all materials with very few exceptional cases. So , when it expands, it can hold more water as it occupies more space. Imagine a fully stretched towel soaked in water. Now, squeeze the towel and it starts releasing water as its area decreases. </p></div>		</li>
