			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking this too and likening it to mixing diluting juices with water.
If I start with my concentrated juice and add a little water I have a high concentration of juice reacting with minimal water so maintain a high concentration of juice. But if I start with water and add the concentrated juice I just make a super weak juice mixture initially.
In this context I have understood my own question from childhood. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but the real thing that is important here is the fact that when you mix strong acid and water, a lot of heat is released. So I don't feel like your analogy is really on point. But if you have understood that concentration is not what is dangerous, then it's good! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have a layer of mucous in your stomach that protects you from the acid. Also, there's a bicarbonate layer between the mucous and the actual wall of your stomach, so if the acid somehow penetrates the mucous, it'll be neutralized by the bicarbonate.</p></div>		</li>
