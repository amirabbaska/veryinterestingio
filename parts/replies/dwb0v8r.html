			<div class="markdown"><p>Go to saturn and accellerate some ice chunks into colliding with Mars. Surprisingly few icechunks will be needed. However it might not be that comfortable on the surface of Mars for a while.</p>
<p>Also it's incredibly expensive and we don't know yet how to accurately maneuver rocket engines strapped to ice chunks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bah, no need for rockets.  Just drill most of the way through the ice chunk, then flash-melt the ice around the shaft really quickly.  The outgassing out the hole at the far end will slowly accelerate the chunk in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Or, set up some way to accelerate actual ice chunks out the back at super fast speeds.  Giant slingshot?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Bobiverse books do this. One of the Bobs uses small pusher motors attached to comets to steer them through the upper atmosphere of planets. The speed they enter the atmosphere causes them to break up and melt, resulting in weeks of rain over the planet. A few comets fills in the seas and thickens the atmosphere enough to begin terraforming. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mars currently loses 100 grams of its atmosphere per second. Earth loses more than ten times that (because its atmosphere is thicker). If we brought gases to Mars and built a thick atmosphere, it would likely stay that way for billions of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like a lot (losing atmosphere on earth). Does the atmosphere get replenished somehow (through asteroids, etc) or will earth lose its atmosphere over time (from this factor alone, not counting earth losing magnetic field or sun turning into a red giant).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably lichens first rather than plants. They can survive some of the most inhospitable environments on earth and have been shown to photosynthesize under martian conditions. I would provide a link but I am on mobile. I doubt any higher plants could survive the wildly swinging temps, near vacuum, and high radiation on mars.</p></div>		</li>
