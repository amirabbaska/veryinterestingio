			<div class="markdown"><p>Asking how much information a neuron can store and process is quite different from asking how much information could be stored as DNA sequences. Each cell in your body has the same DNA sequence. Different cell types only express a subset of genes and regulatory sequences, that's what makes one cell different from another. </p>
<p>Yeah, the human genome has about 3 billion base pairs. Don't forget each sequence has three possible reading frames so that 3 billion is really 9 billion. But that's not true either. Only 1% of the genome codes for protein, most of it is regulatory, can be modified by methylation or acetylation, or act as a scaffold for proteins that do many things. There is no way to say what the ultimate storage capacity of DNA is. To me DNA is highly compressed information, like a zip file, and we have no idea to what extent it can unpack and how much it can ultimately represent. </p>
<p>And we can easily store digital information as DNA sequences. But the actual physical chemistry properties of the arrangement of the atoms that make up a nucleotide sequence are used for DNA activity, who knows how much more information is stored as potential in those interactions? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you'd expect every neuron in your brain to have the <em>same</em> DNA (discounting random noise of mutations, which doesn't carry useful information), so it's misleading to look at what 1 gram of <em>arbitrary</em> DNA could store if you really have the same 3 picograms repeated over and over again, and with almost all of it being the same as any other homo sapiens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be interested to see your evidence on why DNA within the brain is not used to hold information.  Everything I've found on the subject seems to say otherwise.</p></div>		</li>
