			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, the separation of hot and cold is required thermodynamically for any system of this type to produce usable work. Whether it's a Stirling engine on your coffee mug, a solar cell under the hot sun, or a thermocouple radiating heat into cold space, a temperature difference is there. </p>
<p>For one, the pistons of a internal combustion engine expand into the cool outer air, cooling the contents by that expansion while also slightly squeezing the world's air (before dumping the rest of the useful heat-difference by venting exhaust).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One clarification, a solar cell is generally not considered a heat engine. Its maximum efficiency is derived from the energy of each photon striking the solar material and the band gap energy of the solar cell material being used, whereas a heat engine's efficiency is derived from the temperature of the hot and cold sides of the engine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a weird example, but I chose it to illustrate the universality of the argument: <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pssa.200880460/abstract" target="_blank">this paper looks at it more explicitly as a heat engine</a>, but you are right that the specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley%E2%80%93Queisser_limit" target="_blank">33% limit on solar panel efficiency</a> is hit before the 95% <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_engine#Efficiency" target="_blank">Carnot efficiency</a>. (1-300K/6000K=95%)</p>
<p>As you raise the ambient temperature around any of these engines, first the engineers hate you, then the physicists, and by the point of dunking solar cells in the sun the mathematicians hate you, and you know you've gone too far. The engineers still hate you of course, but that's beside the point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate on why a heat gradient is needed:</p>
<p>Kinetic energy is easy to harvest when moving in any one direction but thermal energy is moving in every direction. For the same reason that water rapidly switching directions in a stream is bad for the function of a watermill, the particles' kinetic energies composing thermal energy is useless when random. </p>
<p>With a heat gradient made, the thermal energy pushes outward from the hot area to the cold area and that energy can be used. This is true for Newtonian physics with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot_heat_engine" target="_blank">Carnot Engine</a> but also true for RTG's using the Seebeck effect to have parts only moving at the atomic level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really like the stream and water mill analogy.  If you put the water mill in a stagnate lake the wheel won't turn.  The heat difference gives the heat a controlled path to take.  And we place a thermocouple in that path. </p></div>		</li>
