<p>Example, take two high school. Both are same height, same relative weight, assuming neither are pregnant since their in high school, but one has ungodly DD's and the other one has a cups. </p>
<p>Why is this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hormones and genetics, extra estrogen and your boobs can get bigger, extra testosterone (during puberty) and your penis can get bigger (it's a regular cure for micro phallus, they give you testosterone and hgh when you are going through puberty). Birth control can make your boobs bigger because of the extra estrogen it dumps in your body, I've witnessed this over the years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess estrogen. For instance, as a steroid user, a big concern is estrogen levels causing breast tissue to grow. I have a little bit. The more estrogen gets out of control the more breast tissue you will grow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different people have different weight distribution. Just because you're the same height and weight as someone does not mean you will have the same shape. Different people store fat in different places, like thighs, hips, butt, stomach, and boobs. It's really just a matter of where your body decides to store its fat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But nowhere near as much as breasts. You can find an A and a DD cup in nearly any random group of women but most guys fall in a pretty average range. It's probably at least partly because of the way breasts size follows weight. Sadly weight gain won't give me a giant dong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Standard deviation (or coefficient of variation, if you want to be precise) is not nearly as large as with breasts though. Specifically, CV of penis size is 13.9 which means that 68% of males have a penis size within 14% of the mean.</p></div>		</li>
