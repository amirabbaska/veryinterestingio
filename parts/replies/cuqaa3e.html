			<div class="markdown"><p>The UK case you cite is wildly misrepresented.</p>
<p>The man (Tony Martin) hid, in a dark room with a loaded shotgun and fired on the men as they tried to flee. He premeditated the attack and fired upon them with no warning and continued to fire into their backs as they fled. Had he stopped at the intial shot he would have been perfectly fine but as he moved from one room to another (something he lied about to police claiming he was upstairs) to pursue them it stopped being self defense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I didn't just want to focus on that one case, but then again there might be even more to it than what you've added.</p>
<p>As I recall, wasn't this man (Martin perhaps) targeted multiple times by the same home invaders? I thought he lived somewhere remote, and the police failed to stop or catch the people who kept breaking into his home. The question I would still ask, even if he was angry and lying in wait (which I'm fairly certain he was), did he invite them in? I thought they still, without dispute, broke in to his home.</p>
<p>Now, place yourself in that man's shoes. Your home is repeatedly broken into. You live there. It seems like the thieves are targeting you specifically, and the police haven't stopped them. He didn't hunt them down, and I don't think he lured them in. If you had repeated home invasions, and the cops aren't protecting you, wouldn't you perhaps stay up waiting for the burglars rather than going to sleep so you're helpless when they break in? I don't think waiting for them with a gun <em>in his own home</em> where personally I'd expect privacy and security, is unreasonable actually. But the fact he was waiting for them rather than sleeping seemed like it was evidence against him, and I disagree with that.</p>
<p>Now, as to the extent of how far he should have gone, I agree there is a limit. Chasing them with a gun outside, or shooting them a mile away after a chase, isn't something I'd justify. But wasn't all of the shooting contained to in or around his house? Is it reasonable to say that if someone breaks into your house, you should remain in a single room? Do you somehow lose agency within the entirety of your own house? Not if you <em>would</em>, but are allowed to. If you shoot at an intruder, and they turn around, are you prohibited from making sure they leave your house? Are you that responsible to consider their lives over your own at that point? What if you stay in one room, and instead of leaving they go to another room in your house waiting for you to come out? You just shot at them, maybe they want payback?</p>
<p>I'm not saying I would necessarily take the man's side if I was on the jury. There are certain facts that put into question his actions on that night. The gun he had was illegal (though, again given the fact this was a series of home burglaries, I wouldn't be too surprised he got the gun after having his home invaded over and over) and his account of the events weren't entirely held up by forensics. He also had motive, since he was clearly angry that people were targeting his house over and over to rob. But, why isn't that also a mitigating circumstance? The people who are robbing him are showing an incredible lack of concern for his own security by invading his home over and over. While he was home, nonetheless. I would say that should give him some leeway, since the burglars had to cross the line pretty far before they were in jeopardy.</p>
<p>That was kind of the point I was initially making. There's a difference in setting an indiscriminate trap that could hurt or kill people who have a right to be in a house, and being ready for when someone breaks in. I'm not sure HOW ready should be a bad thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry for going on that long about it. It's a complex issue for sure. Since Martin only served a few years of a potentially decades long sentence, I suppose someone did believe there were mitigating circumstances that made it significantly different from murder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;how far should you go&quot; when chasing thing I think is answered in that the killing shot was as the man was exiting the window. The men in question were clearly intending to leave the home and the shot that killed the second burglar occurred as he was half way out the window. At that point he wasn't defending himself or the home.</p>
<p>Had the shooting occurred with the men face to face I wouldn't have any issue with it. If he was in genuine danger or believed he was I again would agree with lethal force but no one, or their property, is in danger from someone fleeing out a window.</p></div>		</li>
