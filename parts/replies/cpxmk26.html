			<div class="markdown"><p>Just yesterday I gave a presentation on different multiverse theories for astronomy and Brian Greene's book was my number 1 source.  Fantastic book, although I did have some issues understanding some of it at first.  Thankfully I got an A on my presentation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Congrats on your presentation. Check out the Elegant Universe. He builds off of it quite a bit in Hidden Realities and it will put a lot of Hidden Realities in a better perspective.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At this point, there is no empirical reason for preferring this interpretation of quantum mechanics over the assortment of other interpretations.</p>

<p>I don't know that I fully agree with this statement. I think there is some evidence to indicate that the idea of reducing a state vector (collapsing the wave function of an individual particle) is incorrect. You should look at spin recombination experiments as performed by Summhammer (Summhammer et al. 1982). These experiments give indications that although a state vector can be separated spatially (and seemingly lose its coherence), it will still give rise to interference effects once the beams are recombined. This hints that the &quot;collapse&quot; interpretation may not be correct, and instead we should treat the state vector as complete describing an ensemble of identically prepared experiments, and the final state is only the probability distribution of outcomes. </p>
<p>This comes down to not applying the state vector to an individual particle.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wondered if someone who's read Ballentine's book would respond. :)</p>
<p>I appreciate Ballentine's criticisms of the Copenhagen interpretation, but I've always felt that he's still slipping in hidden variables tacitly with the language of his book. Back in the '70s, he more openly endorsed hidden variables, but has since backed off (particularly in his book). Indeed, though he never explicitly states it in his book (and goes to great lengths to avoid stating it), I'm convinced the ensemble interpretation still needs hidden variables in order to survive. So I agree that there are good reasons to think Copenhagen is <em>wrong</em>, but I don't really find Ballentine's alternative that much <em>better</em> since the standard criticisms apply: 1) <em>local</em> hidden variable theories are very likely ruled out (barring loopholes) and 2) <em>global</em> hidden variable theories have no empirical basis whatsoever. So, sure, maybe there are experiments that challenge the Copenhagen interpretation (and I think Ballentine offers a few illustrations in addition to the Summhammer experiment), but any surviving hidden variable theories are just as (if not moreso) empirically shaky. So is there really an empirical basis to prefer one over the other? I'd answer no, and I'd say no because it seems to me like <em>both</em> interpretations are wrong.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why do you think that MWI could be wrong?</p>
<p>It does explain the <em>perceived</em> wavefunction collapse in terms of entanglement, it probably requires some sort of an evolutionary argument to justify the assumption that our brains are operating classically (a good argument would be, what use exactly one's brain could make of perceiving entangled inputs as such, even disregarding the implementation difficulties).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One problem is the Copenhagen interpretation is, itself, subject to some interpretation.  The most mainstream presentation of the CI says that the wavefunction is not a direct description of reality, but rather a description of what an observer can expect to observe.  The reduction of the wavefunction, in this case, would not be physical.  It would merely be the observer updating their info.  The approximate nature of decoherence doesn't pose a problem for interpretations like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add on to this.  &quot;Mulitiverse theory&quot; isn't really a meaningful concept.  It's a little bit like  like &quot;literary theory&quot; which describes a field of thought rather than a particular literary theorists explanation. Multiverse theories include a variety of different propositions, assumptions, and postulations that all attempt to form a cohesive picture of what place our universe may hold in a broader reality.  Many of the multiverse theories are implied by certain empirically derived theories in physics (such as MWI).  Many multiverse theories are developed to explain the so-called &quot;anthropic principle&quot; which, philosophically speaking, explains how our universe could have arisen with the precise fundamental qualities that allow ourselves to exist to observe it.  In other words, if not God, then sheer probability of the universes multiverse would make it vastly more likely that we would exist within and be conscious of our universe (as opposed to this being the only universe that exists).  As other posters have mentioned, Brian Greene's book is an excellent first exposure to multiverse theories.  My personal &quot;favorite&quot; multiverse theory is the simulated multiverse wherein, if it's possible to develop computers that can effectively simulate an entire universe within them, it is vastly more likely that we are nested within a simulation, rather than being the primogenitor universe.  &quot;Proof&quot; of this theory, by that I mean strong evidence in favor, would be if we could create such a simulated reality.</p>
<p>TL;DR: There are many multiverse theories, all with different philosophical and/or empirical justifications, of which MWI is an example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay. But if we are in a &quot;simulated universe&quot; then that doesn't answer the fundamental question does it? Wouldn't the same question just be applicable to the natural universe which contains our simulated universe? There would have to exist at least one conscious being in that universe to program the simulation, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the simulated multiverse theory doesn't make any empirical claims about the nature of the &quot;true&quot; natural universe.  It's merely a probabilistic argument in favor of our universe not being the primogenitor.  In fact, it may very well be impossible to know anything about the natural universe which could be any number of nested iterations above our own.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I call this one The Matrix Theory.  We think we are in a natural reality but are actually in an artificial one.  Instead of being jacked in we are actually just separate programs within a larger one, but without special powers to recode :( </p>
<p>Each of our minds/consciousness are just a subroutine(not a programmer, may be wrong word) running in the main program</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main difference between The Matrix trilogy simulation and standard formulations of Simulated Multiverse theories is that there is no reason to believe that there was more than one simulation between our experience and the &quot;real&quot; universe in the Matrix whereas the Simulated Multiverse necessarily implies nested, recursive simulations.  Additionally, we need not be separate programs but rather a single program simulates the entirety of our universe including ourselves.</p></div>		</li>
