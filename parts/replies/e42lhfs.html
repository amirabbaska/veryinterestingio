			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OC5d9I9.jpg" target="_blank">famous picture</a> of a leatherback sea turtle's esophagus is an adaptation toward eating jellyfish.  Jellyfish can't really swim very well, they mostly float, so the spines on a sea turtles throat aren't for grinding as much as to hold the jellyfish in place as the turtle tries get the jelly all the way down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also an adaptation in terms of how they feed.</p>
<p>Rather than swallow a jellyfish then move it straight into the stomach along with potentially seawater (which is not good) - the turtle swallows lots of jellyfish and keeps them all in their oesophagus. When that's full they squeeze all of the sea water out, and then move the jellyfish into the stomach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pharyngeal teeth in fish are for processing food and are actually attached to the fish skeleton, the &quot;spikes&quot; in a sea turtles throat aren't teeth but rather hardened throat fleshy bits and really only help them not vomit their food back up.</p></div>		</li>
