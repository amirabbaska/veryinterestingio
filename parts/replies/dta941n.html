			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically, when it comes to city vs county, anything inside the city limits is handled by police. Unincorporated areas are ran by sheriff, and usually the jails as well. Depending on what the situation is, they will assist each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Oregon, state troopers also provide security at the capital. </p>
<p>Sometimes Counties can contract for cost sharing with small cities and provide police protection.</p>
<p>In Southern Oregon, there are counties like Curry and Josephine that do not have 24/7 911 or police protection. In that case you call the militia and they can hold you over until the sherrif can arrive.</p>
<p>Lane County (370,000 pop) has only 8 sherrif patrol deputies for the area roughly equal to the state of Connecticut. Of course the city of Eugene and Springfield have their own police force.</p>
<p>They also elect a justice of the peace, which is a weird judicial figure. (3 elected)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Texas constables are interesting. In recent years they have greatly expanded their scope of work. In most places constables are single person offices who handle civil process related work.</p>
<p>In Texas, some constable offices have expanded to include deputy constable staff, who like the actual constable have police powers.  The acquisition of grants to handle work like highway interdiction has primarily allowed this growth to occur.</p></div>		</li>
