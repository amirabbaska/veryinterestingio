			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Some fresheners work on principles of hydrophobicity, and others kill bacteria that produce molecules that you can smell. There isn't a silver bullet for all smells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, you may be on to something there. Colloidal silver is getting a lot of attention in studies for killing bacteria and even in cancer studies. So maybe some kind of ionized spray to kill bacteria and itâ€™s airborne molecules. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nose has receptors for very many different molecules. If a molecule matches that receptor, it'll send a signal to the brain.</p>
<p>Smell removers work by having a class of substances called cyclodextrins in them. They are shaped a bit like a cup, and smell molecules like to bind to the inside of that cup. Once the smell molecule is inside the cyclodextrin it can't bing to the receptors in the nose, and thus no smell.</p>
<p>It does not however actually destroy the chemicals that cause the smell. It simy camouflages them.</p></div>		</li>
