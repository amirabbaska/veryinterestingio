<p>Your body often takes simple input signals to mean specific things, even if they seem useless or irrelevant. E.g. if you have a stomach ache, putting your hand on your stomach seems to help with the discomfort even if it doesn't actually do anything to help with the ache. This is because it does help when you're covering an open wound on your skin; and your body isn't smart enough to figure out which aches can be helped by putting your hand on them and which cannot. It only knows that &quot;covering a painful area&quot; is a good thing to do.</p>

<p>I thought it had to do with your nerves transmitting pressure signals before pain signals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more a matter of incentivization. If you look at it from a more general perspective:</p>
<p>You're a brain. You want the body to do something, let's say you want it to raise the right arm.<br />
When we get to the nitty gritty, it's nothing but an electrical impulse that triggers arm muscles to move. However, there's more to it than that.</p>
<p>Instincts aren't so much focused on <em>how</em> you do something (electrical impulses from the brain), but rather <em>why</em> you'd want to do it (e.g. because blood flow in your arm has been bad for a while). </p>
<p>Your brain incentivizes you to do what it needs you to do, by making you feel better if you listen to what it tells you to do. For the example of raising your arm, it will make you feel considerably more uncomfortable unless your arm is in a raised position, because it wants  you to fix the blood flow problem.  </p>
<p>There's many instances of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our brains &quot;reward&quot; us with dopamine when we eat sugar. This is to steer our bodies to seek out sugar, because sugar is a very good way to get a quick energy boost. Because diet drinks do not have sugar in them (and therefore our brains do not release the  &quot;reward chemical&quot;), diet drinks instead add the &quot;reward chemical&quot; directly to the drink (aspartame/stevia/canderel), so you still get some sort of reward from your body and therefore don't hate diet drinks as much as you otherwise would.</li>
<li>The same happens to us when we eat fats (although I don't know if dopamine is still used, IIRC it's a different reward we receive for eating fats). Fats are long term energy storage (whereas sugar is short term), but the idea is the same. Our bodies <em>love</em> foods that are greasy because it knows that those foods are high in fats.</li>
<li>Don't you feel worse when looking at food (e.g. cooking show) when you're hungry compared to when you're full? Your mind knows that it needs food (since your body is hungry) and therefore makes you crave it considerably more. For the same reason, you can be completely disinterested in food when already full, because your body doesn't need it right now, it would only be a burden.</li>
<li>Your eyes don't <em>actually</em> hurt when you're tired (in the evening, it's still darker than usual, so you can't argue that it's because of excessively high light levels). Instead, your body incentivizes you to close your eyes by making you feel like using your eyes hurts them. Therefore you decide to not use your eyes anymore and automatically give your body the rest it wants.</li>
</ul>
<p>Back to the original example; relieving pain by putting your hand on something. This is very analogous.</p>
<p>Our instinct knows that treating a wound/ache is better, and tries to incentivize us to do so. By reducing the pain <em>only if we treat the ache</em>, our behavior will automatically make us want to treat wounds (because it makes us feel better).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There can be more than one reason to move your legs. The pee dance is another great example of why you want to move your legs. My comment wasn't trying to claim that <em>all</em> leg shaking can be explained by this.</p>
<p>So moving your legs around to improve blood flow would be another (unrelated) reason to move your legs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not well versed on RLS.</p>
<p>If RLS is psychological (your mind wrongly wants you to keep moving them), then it is <em>similar</em> (but not necessarily related).</p>
<p>If RLS is physical (your muscles working when they shouldn't), then I would say that it is completely different as the problem occurs on a different level.</p></div>		</li>
