			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, great question. There are numerous things that anyone can do right now to help prevent entanglements. Reduce the amount of waste that you generate so that less goes to landfills and the environment. Pick up trash or participate in clean-up efforts to remove debris from beaches and rivers. And finally, make sure the seafood that you eat is caught sustainably. You can find more information about safe, sustainable seafood at [FishWatch] (<a href="http://www.fishwatch.gov/" target="_blank">http://www.fishwatch.gov/</a>) </p></div>		</li>
