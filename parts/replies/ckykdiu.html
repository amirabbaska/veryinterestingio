			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. I also transitioned away from PERC to use a hydrocarbon solvent last year. Due to regulatory pressure from local health codes. I was lucky enough to get a good deal on a used machine. No way I could have afforded to sink two years salary into a new one. Just like you said.</p></div>		</li>

<p>90% of the dry cleaning stores around you use that and it can cause cancer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And does this cancer crap stay in my clothes, thereby causing <em>me</em> cancer?  Or is it more of a hazard to the person who is doing the dry cleaning?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer, I have a wetcleaning plant and a hydrocarbon plant, both have their ups and downs. In certain circumstances, wetcleaning cleans wayy better then  drycleaning. I especially notice with white wool coats. Or anything white and is wool. </p>
<p>Wetcleaning machine is just as expensive. A meile machine cost 40000-60000 then you have to have all sorts of finishing equipment. Customers in my area who are high end clientele love the ecofriendliness</p></div>		</li>
