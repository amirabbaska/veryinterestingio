<p>Also white skin will only reflect certain wavelengths, mostly visible.  It won't do you a damn bit of good against something in the 2um range.  Why?  Because 2um is absorbed by water.  Unfortunately for you that's the stuff you are made out of.  I got popped by a 2um q-switched laser near its focal point.  It was only a few watts of average power but it instantly drilled a hole into my finger.  Went right through my nitrile glove without leaving a mark but oh boy did that laser hate water I tell you what.  You had to run it in a dry box while working on it because the humidity in the air would be enough to cause it to devour itself.</p></div>		</li>

Also, if it hates water, I guess it wouldn't work to attach that frickin' laser to the frickin' heads of my frickin' sharks...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I build them.  Was tweaking an optic mount on the table and turned the knob just a little too far and the tip of my knuckle went through the beam.  </p>
<p>You could still put lasers on shark, just not at that wavelength.  There are wavelengths that water doesn't absorb very well.  Every material has it's own absorption spectrum and you can usually find something that will go through it or get absorbed.  Two clear pieces of glass or crystal may look identical to the naked eye but one will pass a laser with 99.99% efficiency and the other will literally explode because it absorbed too much energy.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Look at humans through an illuminated infrared camera and they all look pretty bright-skinned. The colors that get a lot darker or lighter for different races are the visible colors. </p>
<p>Don't have a fancy camera? Then consider this: humans of all races are darker the more hot-sun adapted they are. We all get tanned. The populations from really hot &amp; sunny places just have a higher baseline tan. And all humans have almost-identical internal temperatures. If (visibly) darker skin made you absorb radiant heat more, then it would make no sense for us to develop it in response to the sun! Heatstroke will kill you a lot faster than sunburn or skin cancer!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually false. Darker skin actually DOES make you absorb more heat. Put something black and something white out in the sun, and the black object will heat up faster than the white one.</p>
<p>The reason for this is quite simple - the Sun's peak emissions are in the visible light spectrum. Darker objects absorb more light than lighter ones. IR is actually a lower-energy form of EM radiation, and consequently, objects which are dark in visible light will absorb more heat than objects which are dim in visible light.</p>
<p>The reason that darker skin exists is because it is better at protecting the human body from UV radiation. However, if you don't get enough UV, you suffer from vitamin D deficiencies unless you eat large quantities of activated vitamin D (which most people didn't do historically). Thus, humans in the tropics had darker skin (which prevented UV damage) and humans towards the poles had lighter skin (to help Vitamin D production).</p>
<p>Also, the reason that humans appear bright in IR is because of black-body radiation; we aren't reflecting IR, we're PRODUCING IR. ALL objects shed blackbody radiation depending on their temperature; the hotter something is, the more powerful the electromagnetic radiation it emits. Very hot objects shed visible light - this is why the sun shines, it is so hot that it is shedding lots of visible light from its blackbody radiation. Humans are cooler, so our peak radiation is in the infrared spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All cameras are naturally sensitive to infrared. Most cameras include filters to remove the infrared because capturing light that the operator can't see is generally considered undesirable.</p>
<p>Cell phone cameras generally don't have a great infrared filter - if at all. They will pick up infrared no problem. Unfortunately for this specific situation (but fortunately for most of the situations where you want to take photos) they also pick up visible light really well. One place where something like this is really obvious is taking a photo of a strong infrared light source. This <a href="http://i.imgur.com/XfOF0Wm.jpg" target="_blank">is what an Oculus DK2 looks like with a normal camera</a> and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LcUU6PQ.jpg" target="_blank">this is what it looks like with any typical cell phone camera</a>. The dots are infrared LEDs used for positional tracking.</p>
<p>Any point and shoot or DLSR with an infrared-pass filter (one that only lets infrared light through) will allow you to take photos of only infrared light. A lot of lenses even provide <a href="http://i.imgur.com/b0sVQC8.jpg" target="_blank">infrared focus marks</a> for exactly this situation. Due to the filter inside the camera that <em>removes</em> infrared light, you'll need a lot longer exposure time in order to capture the image. You definitely get some <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YE3Mr4p.jpg" target="_blank">different photos</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wouldn't having darker skin make being in the sun worse not better?</p>
<p>Wouldn't it have made sense for people close to the poles to have dark skin and people close to the equator to have light skin?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but not because he's caucasian/black/albino. It's because he's a people (assuming at least) and has skin instead of metal. The laser is putting out an incredibly large amount of energy, but if it was just shooting out pure energy that would be a huge waste. Pure energy would simply destroy the metal instead of removing the rust buildup and leave behind nice shiny pure metal. (There's a lot more than that going on, but this is the simple version)</p>
<p>What's happening is that the laser is putting out a wavelength of light that is absorbed by the rust more than anything else. When the rust absorbs the light it turns into a gas/plasma state almost instantly. The sparks are the iron and oxygen atoms moving away from the metal surface and do chemical and physics things that don't matter anymore. Then some other chemical stuff happens and the metal is left nice and shiny again. Anything that isn't rust won't absorb much energy at all, so it won't heat up much, including skin and fingernails.</p>
<p>I'm assuming that the worker's fingernails are dirty because they're covered in the rust that's being released by the cleaning process. So when the laser passes over them, they get cleaned for the same reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You missed the part about the laser not being focused on his hand.  Although it is a small difference, as you notice in the video when the laser is not a specific length from the metal it did not clean the rust. The focus is causing this effect significantly more than the color of the object. If his hand were as far away as the metal he would have more issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, its a laser, they tend to not need much focussing.
I think it is possible because it is simply IR and instead of acting only on the tiny dark spots just on the top micrometers of metal and superheating them it is travelling mostly through the fingers, I daresay he would feel a fair amount of heat from doing it but it is not being absorbed on the skin, instead it is heating the entire finger. A decent LED will easily show the bones, similarly this is heating a 10mm  depth of flesh and being moved on.
If you did not move it across the hand I would say it would leave a deep third degree burn very quickly as the flesh heated to damage temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High power laser need A LOT of focussing. They defocus the beam to control it more easily. The high power laser I use is 1cm across and I can put my hand in it as long as I want without problem. When I focus it, I destroy fused silica, steel, anything basically. Going from (in my case)1 cm to 50um turns a harmless laser beam to a mini death star. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Lasers are not focused; they are coherent light, so all the photons move in an exactly straight line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Industrial lasers do have focus, they're not an idealized coherence. For example, we have a laser cutter at work. Focus is hugely important, and very tight. A few millimeters is all it takes to make a clean cut or just warm it up gently, depending on the material.</p></div>		</li>
