<p>14.1k</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last night my car failed to recognize my smart-entry fob (second time this has happened). I was at a store and the fob wouldn't unlock the door. I should have called OnStar to unlock it, but to save time, I pulled the little emergency key out of the fob, pulled off the part of the door handle that reveals the lock, and opened the door that way. Instantly the horn started honking nonstop and the dashboard flashed a message that someone was trying to steal the car. </p>
<p>Then, even after I got inside, the car wouldn't start. The owner's manual says to put the fob in the charging pocket on the console, so I tried that, but no luck. I knew the fob battery wasn't the problem, so I was stumped. (The horn continued to honk and everyone in the parking lot stared at me in annoyance. I was frantic.)</p>
<p>I called OnStar from my cell phone (because the OnStar button in the car won't work if the engine's not running), and someone in India had to start the car for me remotely, and the horn finally stopped. Fortunately, the fob was working normally this morning.</p>
<p>I did a quick search and found out this is a glitch in 2017 Malibus, and a sensor system will have to be replaced. But until we can get an appointment at the dealership, I'm very nervous about the prospect of this happening again. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If the sensor for the key wasn't faulty, dropping it into the little spot in the dash (it's in different spots on different cars) should have let the car 'talk' to the fob, and let everything work well</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Think about it this way,</p>
<p>The hidden key physically forces the lock to open. Pretty much how it would, though a lot more destructive, if a burglar jams a screwdriver in it and turns.</p>
<p>The alarm is <em>supposed</em> to go off then, and the car knows no difference.</p>
<p>And, literally, how the car is able to tell that there is a difference is by identifying the key fob as present inside the car.</p>
<p>And in this case, that system is broken. It failed to detect the key as present.</p>
<p>This behaviour is by design. With the twist that an important car system is broken.</p>
<p>Expecting sensible, and no at all annoying behaviour from a car with broken sensors? No. That is not how it works.</p>
<p>At this point I would be sincerely appreciative that 1) I could get in the car at all and 2) OnStar could turn on the ignition.</p>
<p>If it was my car, without any of them remote monitoring systems, I would have no alternative to towing the damn thing.</p>
<p>And, perhaps I should add, the normal used case for the hidden key in the fob is so that you can open the damn door despite that the car battery is dead, so that you can non-intrusively pop the hood and jump-start the car. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a really cool way of stealing a smart start car by standing near someone with a smart key/fob in their pocket and using a repeater or booster to relay the key/fob proximity to the car using a 2nd person standing at the targets car. The car thinks the owner is right there at the door so it unlocks for you. All you need to do is get inside with the repeater still running and it'll let you start as it would if you had the actual fob. Once you drive out of range the &quot;key not detected&quot; light will come on but it'll never shut off by itself. Obviously it can't be restarted but that's not the point. </p></div>		</li>
