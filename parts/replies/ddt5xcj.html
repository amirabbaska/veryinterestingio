			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, if the electromagnetic properties of whatever you're trying to heat and the microwave walls don't change with temperature (unlike perhaps the grape plasma mentioned above!), then the proportion of energy you put in as microwaves going to the food versus just heating the microwave walls is fixed. 10x as much microwave energy, 10x as much food heating -- making sure the walls and stuff inside doesn't melt or explode.</p>
<p>However, there <em>are</em> some changes with temperature and current:</p>
<p>1) Most metals (copper, iron and steel included) increase in resistance as they increase temperature. So you lose proportionally more energy heating the walls and on the microwave magnetron.</p>
<p>2) Paint, wire insulation and coatings may melt, so you need to improve your microwave ability handle larger currents.</p>
<p>3) Voltages can become so large that materials become non-linear. Electric arcs radiate a lot of electromagnetic energy which is in part absorbed by the walls not your plasma-grape.</p></div>		</li>
