			<div class="markdown"><p>This was my experience exactly. I'm an American who's lived most of my life in Europe, and whenever I go back it really hits me how urban planning <em>forces</em> people to rely on their cars for every trip, because cities simply aren't planned to accommodate any other form of transportation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once while travelling in the U.S. I wanted to take a breakfast at the starbuck located 300m from the hotel.<br />
The only problem was that between the two parking there is an highway and an express way on the bridge over it. So no way to go there by walking (at least to have a chance to survive this experience)
That's how I ended up taking the car for a 300m distance... </p></div>		</li>
