			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconded for this option. People are discussing bio-remediation, which is totally do-able, but it's generally intended for large acreage farming. You could plant sunflowers for a few years and send off samples to check for common heavy metals, but it's not cheap analysis. </p>
<p>The fastest, cheapest solution for the home gardener is to fully replace your growing medium. Aside from avoiding heavy metal contamination, because topsoil sold for food growth had to be tested by the supplier, you also ensure that you have stable, nutrient enriched, water soluble medium. Trying to grow vegetables in your average backyard topsoil is a challenge already, add concerns about heavy metals and you really ought to start from scratch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are disposing or moving large amounts of soil, make sure you don't exceed whatever the local regulations permit for disposal of soil. Amounts above that would require disposal characterization (soil screening) for disposal in a facility that accepts similar soils. Some states/countries have fines by the yard for illegally disposing of contaminated soil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An excellent point, disposal of soils containing pollutants can be a costly process. However, the minimum tonnage/volume before state regulations apply is generally rather large. Unless you're completely renovating a multi-acre property and disposing of all the topsoil removed, you're unlikely to be subject to such requirements. </p>
<p>Especially considering we're discussing a vegetable garden, it's unlikely that the soil removed would need off-site disposal anyway. You could simply create a small bern or water way with the soil removed and re-sod it. You could also just build elevated garden boxes. Though slightly more costly and laborious, there are a lot of benefits to raised boxes including irrigation and pest control, not to mention it's easier on a human back. </p></div>		</li>
