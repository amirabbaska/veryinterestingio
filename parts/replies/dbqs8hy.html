			<div class="markdown"><p>I would suggest you just bite the bullet and learn a li'l calculus!  It could be as simple as watching a crash course video like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di_bzYD0Mkg" target="_blank">this</a>, or going through a series of Khan Academy videos...Or if you're into it enough, you could always take a class at your local community college.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>:P so I graduated from college, where I only ever took college algebra. In high school I took trig and algebra 2 but nothing else. It wasn't until the past year that I decided to try and teach myself a lot of what I missed out on while growing up, including calc. This particular thing I found with the bedrock numbers, however, was just coincidental.</p>
<p>But you know, I took college algebra when I was 18 (I'm 25 now) and I ditched out on my classes, resulting in a passing D. So you're right, I don't meet the pre-requisites for a calc course :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I've learned a little bit of calc using Khan Academy and a few YouTube videos (including the one you shared!) but it was only a few months ago that I started to do so, and I haven't studied it anymore since like late October. I really want to learn more. I had the poorest math education growing up, so I teaching myself this stuff is really arduous. I'm trying though! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just think this is insane - I did this exact process about a week ago, and was super interested by it. I'd never heard about it or even known it existed until this week, and then suddenly I see this post. Coincidence is pretty cool!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When i was in 6th or 7th grade, it struck me that the differences between the squares were sequential odd numbers. Moreso, the difference of two squares came to be equal to twice the smaller square plus 1. Making it into an equation, I realized that I was basically taking (x+1)^2 - x^2 and getting 2x + 1. When you set the equal to eachother and FOIL out the former term, it becomes the right side of the equation.</p>
<p>Sort of a neat little thing I discovered on my own just by thinking about numbers. Not really relevant to your question but I was proud of myself for at least a couple years for that one lol.</p></div>		</li>
