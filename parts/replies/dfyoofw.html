			<div class="markdown"><p>I stopped listening to SYSK a few years ago because as much as I love them, they often sounded confused or like they needed to do another bit of research before putting info into their podcast. Or they'd have conflicting info and wouldn't know it until they were in the studio, and then they'd leave the disagreement in. I do wish more fact centric discussions would do this but this particular podcast is about stuff I should know, not about stuff a couple cool blokes googled over the last few days.</p>
<p>Is it better now?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They frequently sound like a couple of students giving a book report and I generally get the feeling that I'm having a Wikipedia page read to me with some sarcasm thrown in while listening to them.</p>
<p>I still listen occasionally, but not as much as I used to.</p></div>		</li>
