<p>The window placement is dictated by the aircraft structure,</p>

<p>This is true, and the only answer.  Seats are on rails, as you said, and the spacing between seats is <a href="http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/infographic/luxury/how-do-airlines-legroom-compare/assets/legroom-anim-030116.gif" target="_blank">dictated by the airline ($$).</a>  The aircraft manufacturer is <em>not</em> the airline; those are two totally different companies who are often at odds with each other.  Delta <em>cannot</em> tell Boeing to put 50 windows on the side of a 777 at exactly 31&quot; apart from each other.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on to this (from the airlines point of view), the airlines sometimes need to change configurations even after they take delivery.  Sometimes they want to put more seats in first class, or less seats, and the number of seats in Economy would be affected.  So they have to rearrange which can cause the seats to become either aligned or misaligned with the windows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>more specifically, the structure is designed for aircraft performance/cost, and each spar gets one window.  The seat spacing is designed for capacity and the human body.</p>
<p>Aligning the two could definitely be done.  Airframers and airlines do communicate requirements and wishlists.</p>
<p>It's not a question of airlines havin no input so much as the compromises weren't worth it.</p>
<p>Also worth noting that aircraft are often used for different seating configurations (single class, dual class, etc)  so it's not always a one size fits all seating spacing..... but hypothetically if the airlines wanted a certain window spacing, boeing/airbus/embraer could and would do it if the economics worked out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Windows are closer together than seats. It would not be physically possible to fit or move in a seat if there was a seat at every window. Airlines have razor thin profit margins as it is, and taking out seats would mean charging higher prices. I would rather have cramped seating at a decent price than for it to not be an option at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>according to rita.dot.gov the airlines, in the US, on average made a ~7%* profit in 2015. Granted it was a good year due to oil prices, but  I would not say 7% is razor thin.
calculation:</p>
<p>profit: $25.6 billion</p>
<p># passengers: 895.5 million</p>
<p>avg $ per itinerary: $377 </p>
<p>(25,600,000,000/895,500,000)/377 = 0.0758...</p>
