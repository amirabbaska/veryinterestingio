			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I actually automated the reports a couple of months ago (some views on SQL databases) and we're really seeing improvements. Between our previous GA and the current one we've seen a massive reduction in volume of issues - there were a couple of issues resulting in hundreds of reports each time. I'm hoping that we see another reduction in the next one.
It might seem like an insurmountable challenge, but if you don't keep at it you'll never get there haha.
Also just for some background, the code based has been actively worked in for almost 20 years and is over 3.5 million lines. It's also written in a language with no garbage collection (all memory must be managed) so you can imagine the fun issues we've been finding lol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3.5 million lines. Yeah... that's definitely how people used to build stuff after they lost sight of the Unix method. Ouch. </p>
<p>I always break the code into lots of separate parts.  I get some criticism for duplication but you can easily test something that has a problem, or forklift it out of the way and replace it with fixed code very easily. It makes outages smaller and shorter. And less miserable to fix. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have seen that very thing happen before. What's going on is that there was a very long period of bad processes. </p>
<p>Then OP and his colleagues adopted above-average processes to try to fix the historical issue. </p>
<p>But it could take several straight years of the new good processes to fix the damage caused by the previous bad processes. </p>
<p>That doesn't mean OP's better processes are not above-average. </p></div>		</li>
