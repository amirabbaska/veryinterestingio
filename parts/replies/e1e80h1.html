			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. A reason could be &quot;we don't like your shoes today, so you're fired&quot; which is absolutely legal, at least in the US. However a union, using collective bargaining, could force management to sign a contract that would limit the reasons a person could get fired, typically only for very serious violations or criminal acts. So that's another reason why companies hate unions, it limits their ability to fire people for any reason.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We can thank the capitalist billionaires for the anti-worker Right to Work laws. Just today the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Janus, the scab king, to weaken union power across the country, effectively making non-RTW states RTW. Working class power has been so demoralized and our history has been so thoroughly erased that the working class doesn’t even recognize itself as such. We’re all embarrassed millionaires, or whatever that quote is. People don’t recognize anti-union attacks as attacks concerted against poor, working people. It makes me angry!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm missing something here.  Wasn't that ruling just on public-sector unions?  There's a whole different issue with government unions:  there isn't the same natural conflict between labor and management/ownership.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it only applied to the Public sector because that's the limit of the jurisdiction for the case.</p>
<p>TLDR is that Politicians can't force government employees to fork over a portion of their paychecks to a Union that in turn funnels the money to them via donations and contributions.</p>
<p>If that sounds corrupt as fuck, that's because it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Andrew5329 is wrong. In public sector union contracts, workers can choose to opt out of funding a unions political activities. Their dues only go towards representative activities like collective bargaining. Non-unionized workers of a unionized sector must pay a small fair-share fee to the unions representative funds because they reap the benefit of the union despite not joining. </p>
<p>The TLDR of Janus is actually that unions can't extract the fair-share fee, so now everybody gets the benefits of the union and its collective bargaining without paying into supporting it. If you can get the benefit of a union without paying or participating, why do either? This leads to the failure of unions, which is precisely what Janus's millionaire backers had in mind for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>It's still the same issue. Public sectors <em>should</em> function to serve our entire public, without harsh conditions for the employees who do the work. Instead, public sectors are sold off to private hands by our politicians, who usually get kickbacks from said private hands, which funnels public tax money to capitalists and leads to the worse exploitation of workers. We've seen this especially our educational system, using state mandating testing to determine &quot;failing schools&quot; which are then taken over by charters (ran by the likes of the Waltons and the Gates!). Charter schools don't formally allow unions, and overturn teachers so quickly they can hardly attempt to form one anyways. Charter school teachers are paid worse, have worse benefits and conditions than public school teachers in a union, all on the public's dime (and not without again mentioning that dime will go to a private entity to get richer)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Which is blatantly federally illegal.</p>
<p>Not that we bother to enforce that, much. Helps when most of the people in government are also corporate lackeys.</p></div>		</li>
