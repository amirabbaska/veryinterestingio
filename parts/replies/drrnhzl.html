			<div class="markdown"><p>GRBs are very short-lived and would only hit one hemisphere anyway since the Earth would barely rotate in the time it took the GRB to pass.</p>
<p>They are also extremely wide. A GRM close enough to cause a mass extinction event could still be tens of lightyears across, even over a hundred lightyears across. The odds of being caught on the very edge of that are slim.</p></div>		</li>
