			<div class="markdown"><p>In some videos you could see that they have their own cold gas thrusters, so they certainly tested something with them.</p>
<p>SpaceX also has a ship that seems to be designed to capture fairings, but Iâ€™m not sure where this ship is (could be at the East coast).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea there was a pretty cool pic of the ship on /r/engineeringporn the other day. From what I've read, one of the 2 fairings was equipped with thrusters and they fully intend to refuse it if successfully recovered. Apparently there's no news of how it turned out yet</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Rocket launch times are driven by what orbit the payload is going to. This was a set of communication satellites going to <del>geostationary orbit</del> low earth orbit (Thanks, u/kendrome !) and the launch window for it just so happened to be right.</p>
<p>While you could theoretically move a launch time wherever you like, it would cost a lot more fuel to do so and would generally be wasteful in both time and money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this launch only had a one second launch window to get the satellites into the correct orbit. If anything had delayed the launch they would have had to wait a day for the next launch window.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These satellites aren't going to geostationary orbit but rather a low earth polar orbit, that's why they launched from California instead of Florida so they could launch south to cross the poles. This allows them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not going to geostationary. Nothing launched out at Vandenberg goes to geostationary due to its position and the direction of launches allowed from there. It launched to the South, which is why so much of California was able to see it.</p>
<p>The rocket contained a bunch of Iridium satellites, which are going into a low earth polar orbit to join the existing Iridium constellation. They are a network of secure communication satellites that can be accessed all over the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  Just coincidence.  The iridium satellites they launched are basically a web of 66 active satellites that are evenly spaced to provide full global coverage.   If new satellites are needed to replace old ones or add to the constellation, in order to retain that even spacing a launch has to be precisely calculated to the second.  There's no room for manoeuvre when it comes to the launch window.  If they miss it they have to wait days until the next one comes along.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfectly said. I'd add COTS 2 in 2012 was just before dawn and I saw a similar though differently oriented effect as stage 2 went over my head on Hatteras NC. It was one of the most beautiful thing's I'd ever seen. Imagine the point of light near the horizon with the glowing exhaust plume trailing over my head like a giant inverted pyramid. Having no camera that could capture that is a surprisingly huge regret I have. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The coolest thing is how it's so big and high in the sky and yet the stuff happening is moving fast and fluidly, like the spirals created by the tumbling first stage, it was weird seeing something so big and vibrant move around in the sky like that.</p></div>		</li>
