			<div class="markdown"><p>There's actually new research on some alkaloids present in some of the plants traditionally used to brew ayahuasca. Suggesting that possibly there is more than simply the dimethyltryptamine having a psychoactive effect.</p>
<p>Also, it's an intense, long (particularly in relation to other Enthogens) and often frightening experience,  though many seem to come out the other side of the better for.</p>
<p>Not something to be taken lightly or on a whim.</p>
<p>Edit: also MAO Iinhibitors have risks of their own, there's several foods/chemicals for instance that can cause very bad reactions taken with an MAO Inhibitor.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Changed to correct MAOi inhibitor to the correct MAO inhibitor. Thanks /u/CuntSmellersLLP for the catch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the chemical breaks down at a higher temperature than is achieved by smoking it. Just like THC doesn't break down when cannabis is smoked (actually, THC-A becomes THC when heated), and same for the nicotine in tobacco.</p></div>		</li>
