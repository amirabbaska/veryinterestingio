			<div class="markdown"><p>A minor edit: A synaps won't fire, but a long term potentiated synaps will deliver more/less neurotransmitter to the postsynaptic neuron, thereby making the postsynaptic neuron become more/less depolarised, and therefore increasing/ decreasing the firing rate of that neuron. It is also possible for the post synaptic neuron to become more or less 'sensitive' to neurotransmitters through a second messenger pathway. cAMP for example, which synthesizes 'gateway' prote√Øns in the neural membrane through DNA within the neuron it's self, results in longer lasting cellular changes.</p>
<p>But you are spot on in that LTP is key in memory, and also plays a role in other long term behavioral changes, such as addiction. </p>
<p>The large problem is that neurologists have an idea of what's happening on a neuronal level, and psychologists have a few higher level processes figured out, but much of the intermediate level remains a mystery. </p></div>		</li>
