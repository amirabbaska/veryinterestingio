			<p>There's also a &quot;cheaper&quot; version of chefs knives, I say cheap but it a $500 set. I just don't believe they're refined like a surgical blade, however you can create some incredible cuts in harder surfaces, like a <em>perfect</em> castle top potato. The culinary class in college had a few you'd rent out, with a hefty deposit cause assholes would go pawn them!</p>		</li>
