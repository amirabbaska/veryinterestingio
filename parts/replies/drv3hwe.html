			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah definitely, the main difficulty is context switching. CPUs have to flush the registers each time it switches threads and thereâ€™s a little bit of ramp-up time until they are full and the caching become useful. The more you do this the more time you spend on overhead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just context switching, but in general hardware multithreading is highly workload dependent. Two workloads that need to use the same processor resources aren't going to get any benefit from multithreading, but two workloads that use different resources can run together harmoniously.</p>
<p>A processor might only have one integer arithmetic unit but still be capable of supporting two hardware threads. In this case there is no advantage to hardware multithreading if both threads are just doing a lot of integer arithmetic. But, if one thread was doing a lot of arithmetic and the second was doing a lot of memory loads and stores then there would be a big performance benefit.</p>
<p>The whole purpose of hardware multithreading is to highly utilize the processor by feeding it a more diverse instruction stream.</p>
<p>Things like large math or scientific computations tend to get little to no benefit out of hardware multithreading because the bottleneck is the capacity of the processor to do computation, not the availability of instructions. It might help the processor get other, ancillary, stuff done in the meantime, but it's not going to accelerate that one big scientific computation you bought the top-end processor to do.</p></div>		</li>
