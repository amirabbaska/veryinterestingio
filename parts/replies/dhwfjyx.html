			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Ugh</em> I said I knew Google didn't directly sell user data, I wasn't sure about Facebook....the last time I was writing an app using Facebook's api I had no problem accessing user data so you know...they weren't selling it but rather giving it away to third parties who could.</p>
<p>Then if you want to talk about large companies can we talk about ISPs selling people's data?</p>
<p>And then back to your to your example and specifically my question: </p>
<p>&quot;I want my ad to be seen by males, aged 30-50, with high discretionary income, in the US&quot;</p>
<p>How granular can they be?  Can they ask that whoever is located on this and this street be targeted (if that served some purpose)?  With this and this name?  </p></div>		</li>

<p>You can access the data of the one user using your app, and only if they give you permission.  That's an entirely different thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ISPs</p>

<p>There's no evidence that they sell user data directly either.  In all honesty there's no real value in selling e-mail addresses and whatever data you have with a user -- people simply don't engage as much with they do with ads and you lose user confidence (If a company sells my e-mail I actually <em>know</em> about it pretty quickly, I know who sold it and to whom, and I've been pretty damn vocal about it on twitter &amp; FB before to the point of forcing the company to change their policy).</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Google has a &quot;what do you know about me&quot; page, pretty easy to find.  It has hobbies, estimated age, gender, education, income, etc.  You can go create Adwords &amp; FB ad accounts (you don't need to spend anything, just create the account and go through the ad creation process) and you can see how deep their targeting goes.</p>
<p>Google &amp; FB know where I live, they know my SS#, they know my phone #, etc.  But having worked at both companies I'm 100% certain that data is safe and would <strong><em>never</em></strong> be sold.  It simply doesn't make sense in any way shape or form.  They'd lose user trust, they'd lose ad revenue, and they'd open themselves to billions in lawsuits.  Plus the companies actually <em>aren't</em> evil.  Almost everyone at both companies wants to generally do good with their products.  I've never heard a single discussion along the lines of &quot;how do we trick our users&quot;, &quot;how do we manipulate...&quot;, &quot;how do we squeeze more money...&quot;.  To the opposite note I've heard dozens of conversations along the lines of &quot;We're going to lose $200M if we do this, but it's a good thing so let's do it&quot;.</p>
<p>tl;dr -- Large tech companies make money off of ads, and to that extent they collect as much info as possible and make it possible for 3rd parties to <em>utilize</em> this data in as a respectful manner as possible.  None of the Big 4 would <strong><em>ever</em></strong> sell data directly.  I'm pretty confident that ISPs wouldn't either.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An entirely different thing to what, me wanting to know what information is sought after and sold by companies?  And yeah, the users had to give me permission, but I'm not asking if this is legal, I'm asking what information is actually being collected and stored and sold.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Really, you have to relax, I never said they were...and I don't think they are...corporations just are, doing what people built them to do, namely bring in profit. </p>
<p>I just want to know what information is being sold, what info is thought to be valuable, what categories users are split into, what profiles are ads designed to target?  This is being done all the time and I know nothing about the process so I wanted to learn.</p>

<p>Hang on, <em>respectful a manner?  They wouldn't don't that?  I'm confident ISP's wouldn't either</em>  The object of my question wasn't to demonize the amoral entities that are companies but your apologist defense of them (when no attack took place) is a little much...</p>
<p>Respectful a manner as possible - you mean legal perhaps?  or maybe customer friendly?  Or both, at least not while other avenues for profit generation exist....</p>
<p>&quot;I'm confident&quot; - Ok, I'm glad you feel that way, even though I don't share your confidence...regardless, I'd rather not rely on anybody's confidence, honor, or pinky swearing, if that's not too much to ask...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They did spend quite a bit of time and money for that particular rule to be removed though.  What services in particular could Verizon and AT&amp;T offer in their ISP capacity by giving partners direct access that they couldn't by letting partners have indirect access like what you've described Google and Facebook doing? (as the indirect access was already legal, or was it not?)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you send secret messages by making an ad to be seen in zipcode 12345, by women born on February 30, 1773?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, just go open an ad account and check :)</p>
<p>Pretty sure you could just target people older than 200 years in that case though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's ok I was going for an absurd example (Feb 30 also) I almost specified 'attack helicopters' instead of women as well, but figured maybe it's better to not trigger the more sensitive (to that sort of thing) readers.</p></div>		</li>
