			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoever submits the patent application isn't handing over all their paperwork and notes, so in court the pirate patent officer would have copies of a few documents and diagrams but nothing else.</p>
<p>The original applicant would have a vast history of development notes and prototypes.</p>
<p>The case would be a slam dunk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes people can actually win the big prizes.</p>
<p>There was a scandal but it was not McDonald's fault. The company that produced the game pieces was stealing all the high prize pieces before they were shipped out. </p>
<p>When this was discovered, the people responsible went to jail and McDonald's ran a new contest where they essentially gave away all the prizes that the production company had illegally taken.</p></div>		</li>
