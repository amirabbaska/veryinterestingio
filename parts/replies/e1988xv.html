			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a side question, but what turns helium atoms into Alpha radiation? Is it just the fact that the atoms are highly energetic, and therefore moving very fast, that we call them alpha radiation? If you used a particle accelerator to speed up some helium to a high velocity, would it just turn into what we call alpha radiation?</p>
<p>Also, would the same be true of other elements?</p>
<p>Maybe this should be it's own post...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it’s a quick answer.</p>
<p>When the nucleus of an atom decays or is split, it isn’t exactly in half. Think of it as a broken vase with various fragment sizes. One of the smaller pieces are two protons and one or two neutrons. </p>
<p>What makes it dangerous is it doesn’t have electrons associated with it. An alpha particle will aggressively pull away electrons from your skin, kinda like being set on fire (oxidation).</p>
<p>This type of radiation is called Ionizing Radiation. </p></div>		</li>
