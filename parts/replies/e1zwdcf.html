			<div class="markdown"><p>Good luck making a huge ice berg float in sallow water. By floating you may refer to two things, you can ask the practical question if an object in water is in fact currently floating (in which case an object with lower density than water may not be floating because the water is too shallow to lift it off the bottom), or you may ask the theoretical question which essentially means, does this object have lower density than water?</p>
<p>OP and his wife are using different definitions, buth of them are right depending on what kind of floating they are refering to.</p></div>		</li>
