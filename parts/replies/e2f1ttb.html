			<div class="markdown"><p>Theory.  It is well documented and studied, and is essentially regarded as truth.</p>
<p>The disclaimer is just there for me to have something to throw at idiots when they argue that my information isn't complete because &quot;blah blah alternate hypothesis blah blah.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In science (and to a degree in mathematics) a hypothesis is &quot;I think this will happen in my test&quot;. A theory is &quot;my tests have shown that this happens consistently and can be explained by these reasons, but it has not been proven to be 100% universal&quot;. A law is &quot;this statement is so thorough or universally applicable that it is impossible for any circumstances to contradict it&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A slight correction:</p>
<p>Ethanol (the kind of alcohol you drink) does not cause more GABA to be produced or released.  Ethanol increases the activation of GABA receptors (but only type A receptors, particularly type A receptors with Î´ subunits).  Ethanol binds to those receptors at a different location than where GABA binds to the receptor.  The effect of ethanol on these receptors is believed to be essentially a magnification of how strongly GABA activates the receptor.  For instance, if GABA can activate the receptor 100&#37;, then GABA + ethanol might activate the receptor 120&#37;.</p></div>		</li>
