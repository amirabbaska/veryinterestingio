			<div class="markdown"><p>Synthetic minimal cells are, by design, much simpler than natural cells. They're build to model one particular pathway - so, for example, a particular pathway that we know, or suspect, is responsible for specific type of cancer in certain cells.</p>
<p>We can use this single pathway to test drugs, but it will never replace clinical trial with natural patient cells. </p>
<p>The use of synthetic cells might allow cutting down costs of screening, and we might check for great deal of possible non-specific orthogonal interactions with other pathways, but ultimately every drug needs to be tested on a real cell because we cannot predict every possible interaction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are these pathways related to the signal transduction pathways? Sorry, ap bio student just trying to understand with what info i have ^^</p>
<p>Overall very cool work. Best wishes and good luck on research</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is already done for all cancer drugs prior to tests in animals and then finally humans. Cancer cells isolated from tumors are grown in plastic dishes and can be frozen and stored for later use.</p>
<p>There have also been recent attempts of varying success to personalize cancer therapy by growing an individual patient's tumor tissue in a group of mice and treating those mice with various drugs to predict patient response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is already done for every cancer drug very early on as one of the hundred assays a drug goes through before it's even considered for animal models. </p></div>		</li>
