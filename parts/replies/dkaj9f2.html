			<div class="markdown"><p>Originally for sure, but those lines get blurry - Rough Trade, for instance - are they really still an independent?</p>
<p>I just mean that people get very hung up on details and create tribal divisions about what is good/bad rather that look at the similarities and just enjoy the good bits of any sector</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We all want to belong to something, as long as that something is not mainstream popular because, then, we lose our individuality. This is why, ever since I had screws and bolts installed to my joint I broke in a car crash, I now identify as machine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is certainly why people take the distinction so seriously, but it doesn't really explain where the distinction comes from.</p>
<p>FWIW, people I know tend to be very touchy about those categories, as if indie automatically equals 'real artist', and alternative equals 'bad singer'.</p>
<p>But that just goes to your point about them being more similar than different, eh?</p></div>		</li>
