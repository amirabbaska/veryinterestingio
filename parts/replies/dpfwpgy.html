			<div class="markdown"><p>The even crazier thing is that our embryos were biopsied at five days old in the lab. The embryologist took one cell from each embryo and the chromosomes were analyzed. This way, we could discard embryos with abnormal chromosomes and not waste our time transferring those. But it also let us know the genders of our embryos! So we knew before he was even transferred to my surrogate that he would be a boy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PGP is insane! I did IVF and subsequent FETs, but we opted not to do genetic testing (cost factor). The whole process is crazy. I'm pregnant with my second right now, which is technically a twin of my first? They were retrieved and fertilized at the same time, one just chilled in the freezer a little longer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may already be aware of this, but it seems like a lot of inappropriate conclusions are being drawn in this thread so I wanted to help try and clear some of it up.  Just an FYI - the fetal blood/DNA that has crossed the placental barrier (free fetal DNA) does not integrate into the surrogate host. </p>
<p>The top comment right now is misleading in that there may be <em>some</em> small fraction of mitochondrial chimerism in a host or child, but that would be exceptionally rare and essentially inconsequential in terms of genetic makeup of either individual. There may be some epigenetic differentiation (ie existing genes are expressed somehow differently), but in terms of explicit genetic makeup, a surrogate has no appreciable effect on the childâ€™s DNA and vice versa. </p></div>		</li>
