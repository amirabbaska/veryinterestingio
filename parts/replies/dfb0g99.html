			<div class="markdown"><p>That's more or less right, yes.  The interference pattern arises due to the wave behaviour of light, not because any external force acts on the light to push each photon to an interference fringe -- there are just more paths that lead to the fringes than to the areas between them.</p>
<p>Similarly, the behavior of fermionic wavefunctions under particle exchange leads to fermions never occupying the exact same quantum state.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sounds like saying shadows cannot exist under direct/unobstructed sunlight isn't because of a force, it's because of that's how the interactions work out </p>
<p>And that would make sense. </p>
<p>What doesn't make sense, though, is if the lack of shadows were to react <em>with stronger resistance</em> the more you tried to force any shadow to appear under that direct/unobstructed sunlight. </p>
<p>Because that resistance would seem like a force then. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find a distant analogy in hydrophobic force - water is not repulsed by the hydrophobic &quot;force&quot;, it's the disruption of hydrogen bond attraction network that manifests itself in this way. </p>
<p>Phoebe explained it the best: &quot;its not that I do not believe in gravitation, it's just lately I feel like I am being pushed instead of pulled&quot;. Replace gravitation with hydrophobic force, and you got an almost Big Bang Theory level sci pop.</p>
<p>Pushing to even further analogy: there is no centrifugal force either, it's just anothe manifestation of inertia in non inertial system. Coriolis force is another example.</p></div>		</li>
