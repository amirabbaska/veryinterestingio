			<div class="markdown"><p>What you said is fundamentally wrong, not just beyond a simple explanation. You gave the stork answer to &quot;Where do babies come from?&quot;</p>
<p>That's why I pointed out that there are animals with internal symmetry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My embryology class was majority learning about transcription factors, growth factors, where mesenchyme was migrating to, what tubes are merging twisting pushing out of the body, and different genes (including homeobox genes) being turned on and off...ontogeny from conception to birth is embryology...youre wrong... yes it is embryology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it were embryological there would be no animals with internal symmetry, but there are. In this case the processes are governed by the means of genetic diversification rather than the limitations of development.</p>
<p>When you take your other classes (genetics, evolutionary processes, developmental biology, molecular biology, evo-devo, genetic engineering, physiology, biochemistries, etc.) you'll find that there are many intertwined systems that can be easily mistaken for one another.</p></div>		</li>
