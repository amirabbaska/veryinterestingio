<p>That's the only way to put it becuase that's what is happening exactly :).</p>
<p>This phenomenon is used in something called Schlieren Photography: <a href="https://youtu.be/4tgOyU34D44" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/4tgOyU34D44</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if anyone else mentioned it yet, but it only takes about 15 degrees difference between pockets of air to cause that disturbance.</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon happens in liquids called &quot;Schlesinger lines&quot; and it is caused when 2 liquids have different refractive indexes and are mixing together, like an ice cube melting in vodka. neat little wavy pattern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that sort of happens when the hot asphalt heats the air above it. </p>
<p>Sometimes it looks like there is water on the road when you are far away. This happens because the light is bent up by the hot air. </p>
<p>So you could say that the air acting like a mirror or water is making the road beneath it invisible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well strictly speaking light always travels at the same speed, as you might have heard. </p>
<p>But when it is traveling through air, the light particles are absorbed by the atoms in the air, and then re-emitted in the same direction. This proces takes a small amount of time, slowing down the light.</p>
<p>When the air is hot, the atoms are moving more than when it is cold. Because they are moving more, they take up more space, and so in the same volume there are less atoms. Because there are less atoms, the light is slowed down less.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> so some people have commented that the absorbing and re-emitting is not how it works at all. I have been looking around and it seems you are right. I still dont know how it does work though. Can someone explain that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I've just forgotten off the top of my head due to tiredness, but does this just mean that the refractive index is based on the density of the object?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty much not true at all. Light isn't absorbed and re-emitted. The emission would be in a random direction which obviously isn't true since you can see objects behind transparent materials. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light is an electromagnetic wave, when the density of a matter changes, so does it's electromagnetic properties change (permittivity and permeability). The speed of light is dependent on the permittivity and permeability and is therefore changed when the density is changed.</p></div>		</li>
