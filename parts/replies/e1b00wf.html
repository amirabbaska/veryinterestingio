			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had friends tell me I should have an optimiser app on my phone it will make it twice as fast!!! Look, there is an animated dial showing how much faster it is.</p>
<p>These same friends were also convinced that their ebay Chinese knock off batteries were three times as good as the batteries that came with the phone because the people selling them said so.</p>
<p>Actually, these are the <em>same</em> friends who were convinced by a dude in a store to buy &quot;surge protectors&quot; to stop their laptops being destroyed.</p>
<p>I'm noticing a trend...</p></div>		</li>
