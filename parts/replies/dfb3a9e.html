			<div class="markdown"><p>I can relate, just finished my first sleep study a couple weeks ago and am getting fitted for a cpap next week. I really hope it works as well as I've heard! I have also noticed randomly not inhaling during the daytime but it is usually if I am concentrating on something else heavily like reading or a tense scene in a movie. </p>
<p>For those mentioning it's a weight issue, sometimes it isn't because I've definitely had symptoms of sleep apnea since I was a teenager and only 5'10&quot; 150lbs. Sometimes our brains just suck at reminding us I guess. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He was pretty small as a high schooler. He used to wrestle. I never thought to ask him if he had sleeping issues then. However, I know his dad and grandfather have both dealt with sleep apnea their lives, and they were hard working farmers with no weight problems, so yea, sometimes brains just suck at some stuff. lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a friend with terrible sleep apnea that barely 120 pounds, so it's not always weight related. I hope you find some relief. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does he have anxiety by chance? I tend to breathe shallowly/irregularly most of the time as well and sort of reflexively force myself to stop so I can focus on the one thing I'm obsessing about. Being in certain postures adds to the chest tightness and inability to breathe deeply. Occasionally (usually if I've been very fatigued/stressed) it's like my brain is unable to breathe unconsciously as I drift off to sleep and wake up suffocating, but if I force myself to take as deep of breaths as possible for a while I can eventually overcome it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, no, he doesn't. He dealt with some depression for awhile which could have had some ties with anxiety, I'm sure, but after some counselling and a move from a frustrating desk job to farming 2 years ago, he's been amazingly better.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have this issue, but after losing a bit of weight and cutting back on drinking in the evenings I'm &quot;cured&quot; without any sort of machine/procedure. It does sound like your husband has it worse than I ever did.</p>
<p>Best of luck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do think weight has something to do with it in part. He's not big on drinking though. Losing some weight WOULD probably help, but with the brain thing, might not cure it, unfortunately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One bit I forgot about was that in addition to stopping drinking, I also stopped taking a migraine medication. Not sure if that is relevant to your situation, but figured it was worth mentioning.</p></div>		</li>
