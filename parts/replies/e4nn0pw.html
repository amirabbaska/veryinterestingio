If we just release a plastic eating microbe into the ecosystem, what will happen to our plastics we DONT want eaten? Boat parts, car and building parts, infrastructure, wiring and sheathing, etc etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something similar to that is what killed off an advanced civilization in the Ringworld series. All their tech was based on superconductors, and a bacteria mutated to eat them, causing a cascading failure which brought down their entire civilization.</p>
<p>They lived on an artificial world they had built themselves, so they couldn't harvest any raw materials and restart their civilization. They were basically just trapped on an enormous space station with no working technology except a functioning ecosystem/biosphere</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Puppeteers engineered and introduced the bacteria, in order to knock down a potential rival civilization (and with an eye to selling the survivors a replacement superconductor technology).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would just mean plastic would have to be protected from certain environmental conditions the same as we protect metal or wood. Nothing a coat of paint or grease can't solve. Besides, this bacteria decomposes plastics very slowly and only in an ideal environment. A piece of shiny plastic in open air doesn't have a surface a bacterial colony can easily attach to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume that we would develop more than one kind of plastic over time. The inedible plastics for long term use and the single use/short term use plastics made of bug food. Instead of a recycling number they could print an amoeba on it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I'm sure theres variables like that l in which we can exploit but at that point you would have to determine similarities between existing polymers and potential for mutation or evolution in the microbe. I would imagine just like fungi and microbes developed prior to the carboniferous period, any microbe we make would eventually have that same capability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This outcome is more science fiction than science. Relative to other food sources, there's almost no plastic in the environment, and this bug grows very slowly. I doubt it would compete well, except in areas with high concentrations of plastics, like landfills etc. That's actually exactly where we want it to grow! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is an estimated 150 million tons of plastic in the oceans with an additional 8 million tons added every year. The USA alone produces about 100 million tons of CO2 <em>every day</em>.</p>
<p>To convert all of the plastic currently in the ocean directly to CO2 (which would not be a 1:1 conversion, but to keep things simple...) would only equal as much CO2 as the USA releases in a day and a half, and then 2 hours per year from then on. That's a pretty negligible amount considering the immediate harm plastic is doing to the oceans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This does not factor in all the CO2 required to harvest the plastic from the ocean, or the amount required to build and run the infrastructure required for fermentation. It is not really fair to compare this endeavour to all of the emissions released by the entire US - rather, we should compare the <em>status quo</em> to any interventions we might make. Certainly, plastic in the ocean is a very bad problem, but leaving it there is better for emissions than digesting it at present. </p>
<p>Also, don't forget that each gram of polymer may produce significantly more than a single gram of CO2, because the bugs incorporate oxygen and there will be other products to consider as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You said nothing of harvesting the plastic in your top comment. What you presented was the hypothetical of &quot;if you could get it to eat all the plastic in the oceans&quot;. That is the hypothetical statement you made, to which I was replying. If you could get the bacteria to eat all the plastic in the oceans, ie, if it could simply be released into the wild and consume plastic without human effort. Now you're switching back to the literal to refute my response to a hypothetical. Not at all fair.</p>
<p>To your second paragraph, I already addressed that in the parentheses of my above comment.</p></div>		</li>
