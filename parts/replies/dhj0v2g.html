			<div class="markdown"><p>Your answer, while totally correct, is more for inter cities transportation.
OP question seems to be for inner city transport. Some might argue that the answers would be similar, you still depend on a schedule while taking bus. Bus/metro/etc is well made, you ll actually depend way less on schedule since you avoid traffic.</p>
<p>Now I believe the problem is both cost and standard. European cities are not designed like american one, and cost in US would be way higher. At least initial cost, the long term benefit might totally worth it, but who will take the risk to spend million/billions to see the benefit coming in 20 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you might be right.</p>
<p>I actually would say that the two issues are intrinsically linked.
When your whole country is designed around the automobile it makes some sense to incorporate that into the cities as well.</p>
<p>This results in some city planning styles that are different from those in Europe <a href="http://img.bibo.kz/?7169847.jpg" target="_blank">like Chicago's grid </a> which is designed perfectly for the automobile and then ruined by being populated entirely with drivers from Chicago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a really good video. As a Canadian living in Germany, it makes me sad that trains will never be able to work in Canada the way they do in Europe. My husband and I absolutely love the trains here and often choose them over driving. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I appreciated highlighting Germany (&quot;eine Lanze brechen&quot;) I work in the industry outside of a large city. Public transportation is pitiful there. Rural / less urban areas still rely as much on the car as American suburbs. And our urban road systems are paying the price along with delayed infrastructure investments. </p>
<p>Automotive transport systems in large densely populated areas just seems unsustainable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! This was very informative! </p>
<p>As a European living in a big city, I mostly use public transport to move around the city. I find the car a big pain to use because you generally don't know where to park it and traffic is a big mess.</p>
<p>Also, trains from city to city are rather cheap (with respect to other European countries) so they are my way to to (yes they are sometimes late but I generally don't have the need to arrive on time). </p></div>		</li>
