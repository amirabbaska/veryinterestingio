			<div class="markdown"><p>I assumed that the insulation isn't very good in normal ovens, so the deltaT between the elements and the inside walls will be significant.  </p>
<p>Also at the start there will definitely be free convection due to the cold incoming temperature. </p>

<p>Practical experience says that how you load things makes a difference in how fast they cook, which shouldn't affect conduction. I don't think difference is only due to the difference in exposure to radiation.</p></div>		</li>
