<p>The lack of security checks at train stations is a regional thing, not universal.</p>

<p>This exactly. I used to live in Israel and it was exactly like China.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely security theater in Chinese metro stations at least. Half the time the person looking at the screen's eyes are glazed over and I've seen people push past with bags without being checked despite being blocked by an officer and told to scan their bags.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure! You see this type of security all over the place in China. Even the subway stations. Usually there are a few cops with &quot;metal detectors&quot; and some airport customs style bag scanners. I put metal detectors in quotes because me and my friend honestly believe they don't even work, they're entirely just there for show. </p>
<p>To test this theory, I once went to my friend's house with a few very thick pieces of steel (definitely enough metal to be a pistol) in my bag. My bag was scanned by the metal detectors, and.....zilch. It didn't go off. I really don't think they all work. </p>
<p>I also frequently put my bag through x-ray scanners with hashish, they never notice anything. However if i was Uyghur and not a white North American, it might be a different story. </p></div>		</li>
