			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer. If you have a specific time that you need wake up every morning and you go to bed at the same time every night, but you always wake up tired, experiment with waking up a little earlier, try to find the exact time that you exit your last REM cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found that those alarm clocks that gradually increase light leading up to your alarm going off helps tremendously with the sleep hormones aspect, and I've found those &quot;sleep timer&quot; sort of apps help quite a bit with the REM cycle side of things. </p>
<p>I wonder if there is a way of doing both- I'm currently only using the former. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those lights are excellent. We got a cheap one from Aldi for Â£20 and it's fantastic during the winter months (in the summer months, we just use its other good feature; fading up of 'natural' noises like bird song, forest sounds, etc...) when it doesn't get light here until 8+am. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a good idea to overshoot the 6, 7.5 or 9 hours a bit however, since you need to take into account the time it takes for you to fall asleep.</p></div>		</li>
