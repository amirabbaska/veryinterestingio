			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on who you have. I know you said rep, not senator, but if you've ever tried contacting senators Tillis and Burr of NC, you would realize that they have no interest in all of their constituents' opinions, just the ones who like them. It IS a waste of time and effort to contact them, so it makes more sense to put time and effort into things like state senator Jeff Jackson's game plan, or protests, etc.</p></div>		</li>
