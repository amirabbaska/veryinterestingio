			<div class="markdown"><p>I worded it weird but as you see by another post - there is a pressurized chamber idea (albeit a long time ago) in which you could build a square box of wood that's waterproof and remove the water from inside.  Then you can easily go down inside and build what you want and then float the wood away (given wood floats and you'll have to weigh it down to sink it in the water to begin with for that box concept).</p>
<p>I'm just thinking of ways to do modern methods of bridge building with the whole pressurized chamber idea but instead of pressurized, just using what they had at the time.</p></div>		</li>
