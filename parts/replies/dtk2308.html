			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes...(I think the term your looking for is roll not rotate) so you must
pull up and add power during turns. </p>
<p>Pilots will use this concept to lose altitude, for example, if they are too high on a landing (being a student pilot something I mess up all the time). Roll the aircraft in one direction then add opposite rudder to keep your heading, it's called crabbing. There are some awesome videos of planes crabbing into the wind then they cut it back at the last second to land.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those two scenarios you mentioned are very different though.</p>
<p>The crabbing to lose altitude is based on creating extra drag by flying uncoordinated. Rolling with opposite yaw will allow you to maintain your ground track, while allowing the air to hit the aircraft more from the side.</p>
<p>The other scenario you mentioned is correcting for crosswind, which is performed in a coordinated way because you use part of your airspeed to compensate for the wind speed in order to maintain your ground track. In order to do this (efficiently), the aircraft should maintain coordinated flight (except close to the ground, where rolling manoeuvres should be avoided).</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the forward slip.</p>
<p>Crabbing is your angle into the wind to correct your ground track for the wind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's so awesome. Thanks a lot for this. I always knew you need to balance these three for us passengers to not feel anything while turning but I always felt it must be so hard to do it by feel and apply just enough of all. I didn't know you had an instrument for this. </p></div>		</li>
