			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, I would like to address what seems to be a misconception about weightlessness from OP. </p>
<p>When you are in orbit, you are not weightless because you are no longer being pulled on by the Earth. Astronauts in low Earth orbit are still pulled by most of the gravitational force they were when they launched. The thing is, because they are moving so quickly sideways, even though they are pulled down and fall, they move and miss the Earth. Just like a skydiver feels weightless, so do astronauts. The effect is more complete because the astronauts don't feel air rushing past them, because the spacecraft and the air in it are falling along with the astronauts.</p></div>		</li>
