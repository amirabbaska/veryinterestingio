			<div class="markdown"><p>Statistically yes. But considering you could launch something into a retrograde orbit (opposite direction of everything else) and have it survive if you plan properly, that means paths do exist where something could have no collisions, despite having a different orbit.</p>
<p>Over time, I believe gravity effects of the various satellites will eventually pull on each other enough to merge themselves into a disk. But that much would take quite a while considering how much gravity satellites exert on each other. So depends how far into the future you want to go. The mass of all satellites ever launched is going to be far far far less than the mass of the moon.</p>
<p>That said, in a satellite collision, all the pieces are going to eject from a single point, which means all the debris will have at least one shared point in their orbit. And over time they will re collide and eventually even out to a ring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's an excellent, fairly low budget visualization of mass as it relates to the gravitational constant and planetary bodies. Even touches on dark matter. Great teaching mechanism</p></div>		</li>
