			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't necessarily need to increase the chemical potential of the liquid since the freezing point is only determined by the relative difference.  Unlike the vapor-liquid boundary which is very heavily dominated by the vapor phase, the solid-liquid line is much more sensitive to the properties of both phases. </p>
<p>Which is why I might add the freezing point is an absolute bitch to get correct in molecular dynamics models because you have to accurately represent both phases which is hard without making a overly complicated model. </p>
<p>That said, the reason why it would be hard to raise the freezing point with colligative properties is that adding impurities changes both phases and it tends to change the chemical potential of the liquid phase more than the solid. </p></div>		</li>
