<p>There are several (hundreds?) of species of annual cicadas, and even the 13 and 17 year periodic cicadas (genus Magicicada) have different broods such that some will be emerging in most years. Each brood has a slightly different geographical range. This year, brood 5 was scheduled, with a range that covers NY, OH, PA, VA, and WVA.</p>
<p>In addition, you're correct- there are both stragglers and early bloomers that can appear from the periodic species.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah fantastic! This is what I wanted to know. So there are multiple 'broods' of the 13/17 year cicada that have come out sync with the main group.</p>
<p>My follow-up is about speciation. Are genetic differences between the different broods accumulating fast enough for the different broods to diverge into different species? Or is there enough genetic exchange between the different populations/broods by the late/early bloomers for them to remain the same species?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer the question, but I can tell you that Brood X (10) is the big mama-jama of the 17-year Magi broods. They last popped up in 2004, and will be back around in 2021. I made a pretty penny selling cicada shirts the last time around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That brood was awesome. That was the first time that I can remember seeing them. I was building a house at the time and we had just started framing the 2nd and third floors later in may when they came out around here. Standing on just the third floor platform with no walls we had a blast watching the Hornets grab the cicadas out of midair, ride them to the ground and bite off the head and wings in one shot, then drag it into a hole in the ground. Of course we didn't see the biting or dragging from the platform, but the platform let us see how much of it was happening around us, it was like a feeding frenzy with a hundreds of hornets and thousands of cicadas. </p>
<p>I also ate a cicada on a dare, not bad I have to say.</p></div>		</li>
