<p>I tried to find a figure that shows the CO2 distribution in ppm, but the closest I got was <a href="http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/virtualmuseum/images/raw/CCC_Fig4_2_1.jpg" target="_blank">this figure</a> By Berner (1997). It shows the ratio of CO2 compared to pre-industrial (300 ppm) levels. As you can see, the only time CO2 levels got close to the present levels is in the Upper Carboniferous and the start of the Permian (roughly 350-250 Ma ago). It is often thought that during the late Carboniferous, ice-age like conditions were prevalent. This cooling is related to the increase in erosion because of new mountain chains that were formed during the assembly of Pangaea, and possibly due to inefficient biological breakdown of the large swamp forests that were dominant in the early Carboniferous. Ironically, these formed many of the coal seams that powered the industrial revolution and thus the global warming trend we see now.</p>
<p>Besides this dip, we see that the general trend of CO2 in the geological past is a downwards one, probably related to more efficient weathering. Plants in particular seemed to have a significant impact on weathering rates and CO2 storage.</p>
<p>Important to note here is that the relation between CO2 and temperature becomes more difficult the further you go back in time. This is because there are other factors influencing temperature on long timescales, such as the solar output, which gradually increases during a star's life. The decrease in atmospheric CO2 counteracts the increased solar output and vice versa, therefore temperatures were not as high in the past as the CO2 curve might suggest. A good figure that shows 'temperature' evolution is <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Phanerozoic_Climate_Change.png" target="_blank">this one</a> by Veizer et al., (1999, updated 2004). Temperature here is expressed as changes in Î´18O (isotopic changes in oxygen). These come with their own set of limitations of course, and suffer from the same uncertainties the further beack in time you go. This figure shows that, temperature wise, the closest equivalents would have been the Carboniferous-Permian and Ordovician-Silurian periods. Both periods are so far back in time however, that a comparison between past ecosystems and present ones is of limited use.</p>
<p>Bottom line is that comparable situations are scarce and far back in time. Which does nothing to diminish the current situation, mind you. It's not because temperatures as cold as those of the recent past aren't the norm in geological history that the current warming isn't very dangerous. Many of the problems relating global warming have more to do with the speed of global warming than with the actual temperature shift.</p>
