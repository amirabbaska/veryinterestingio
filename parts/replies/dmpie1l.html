			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there levels of strength to an event horizon?  Like,  is it exactly equal to the speed of light, or larger,  and how much larger can it get since space itself ous being bent.? Do smaller black holes have a weaker release of virtual particles which is why it evaporates more quickly,  or is there another mechanism at work?Do largerr black holes release more energy due to surface area and it's just not apparent until much smaller? Also, if a bh leaks off enough mass, went not transform back into a neutron star?    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there are not levels of strength to an event horizon. This is because the definition of the event horizon is where the escape velocity becomes the speed of light. It is important to note that if you were to physically go to the event horizon, you wouldn't see anything special. It is not a physical thing, just a location that corresponds to certain physical properties. At this point, the amount of &quot;bend&quot; in space is so great that any light ray that strays inside will inevitably spiral into the singularity. As you move closer to the center, the &quot;bend&quot; becomes greater and greater, and presumably reaches infinity (so that's how much larger it can go) at a point infinitesimally close to the singularity. This corresponds to a quicker rate of a light ray spiraling into the core. </p>
<p>To get into the math a little bit, the definition of the Schwarzschild radius is R = 2GM/(c^2) or more simply, as everything there but the mass is a constant, R = xM. This means that as mass is radiated outwards, the radius decrease linearly with it. That said, the surface area of the black hole is what causes the hawking radiation, and that is defined by the surface area formula, 4<em>pi</em>r^2. With the radius decreasing linearly, the surface area with decrease as 1/r^2. Meaning that as the black hole gets smaller and smaller, the radius will not continue to decrease to compensate as well. This means that at least proportionately, the black hole with hawking radiate away more mass the smaller it gets. The actual rate will continue to decrease assuming a uniform generation of virtual particles throughout all space, but the proportional release will increase, and thus they will seem to disappear more rapidly as they get smaller.
In short, larger black holes release more energy in general because they have more surface area, but will get smaller at a slower rate compared to a smaller black hole.</p>
<p>To answer your final question, no the black hole will not transform into a neutron star, as it is fundamentally a different kind of thing. A neutron star still has a finite density, while a black hole contains all of its mass in an infinitely dense point directly at its center. As the black hole shrinks, all it loses is influence over the surrounding space. The singularity remains infinitely dense. At no point can the horizon become so small that it is inside the infinitely small point that contains all the mass.</p>
<p>I hope I have answered your questions. If anything is still unclear please let me know.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These kinds of infinities generally tell you your model isn't adequate to describe what you're looking at. We need quantum gravity to describe what the matter in a black hole is doing, which we don't have. So it's more accurate to say we don't know what's going on in there, but it's certainly extremely dense</p></div>		</li>

<p>The black hole does not just contain its mass below the S. radius, it contains all of the mass at a single point at the absolute center, referred to as the singularity.</p>

<p>How do we know that? General relativity breaks down at boundary points and we still have no quantum gravity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No one has ever detected Hawking radiation, and there isn't really a way to actually detect it as far as we know. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>substitute Hawking radiation for &quot;singularity&quot;. Hell, substitute that for &quot;black hole&quot;. We can detect its effects but thats about it.  </p>
<p>So essentially the answer would be &quot;who knows&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can't detect the effects of Hawking radiation. We can't detect anything about it at all. We can detect the gravitational effect of black holes and infer their existence, but so far there is absolutely no observational data that suggests Hawking radiation.</p></div>		</li>
