<p>The proof is in the form of a statistical (thermodynamical) analysis which shows that for large objects quantum mechanics tends towards classical mechanics.</p>

<p>Can you point me to a reference for that?   Preferably one that is pretty high-level, since I'm not a physicist.  I am familiar with the idea of the derivation of the ideal gas laws from molecular kinetics.  Is it like that?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can think of it like this: the more particles the more thermal energy, QM disappears as the amount of thermal energy becomes larger than the separation between discrete energy levels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm afraid I forgot the name of the paper. It's about how a wave function actually collapses instead of it being a postulate and it has to do with entanglement of a particle with a large body and it is shown that it happens due to thermodynamic activity of that body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, thanks.  It's just that I'm confused how all this quantum behavior, for example that particles really are wave functions, some how adds up to what we perceive as reality.  I just wonder that perhaps there is some sort of meso-level activity that we've completely missed.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats a little tail wagging the dog; one way to check your work when coming up with derivations is to ensure that they are consistent when you scale them up to the macro level</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I know, you send \hbar to zero. However it is not in all cases that the phase space then becomes continuous again i.e. it remains quantized to a degree and that's when we can speak of quantum effects on the macro level (such as quantized electrical conductivity or heat capacity and whatnot).</p></div>		</li>
