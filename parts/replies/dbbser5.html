<p>it's very common to find companies that take important notes about each individual male's preferences. Some get special handlers they like. Some have a specific dummy, or a custom-made artificial vagina. Many of these animals get into a routine that they like and, just like humans, each animal needs just the right stimulation to ejaculate.</p>

<p>This is amazing information. Even bulls have a type for who they want to jerk them off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was able to stay at the Smythsonian's endangered animal facility out in Front Royal for a couple weeks and see some of their breeding programs. For artificially inseminated rare cranes and endangered birds, a keeper often bonds with a specific bird and becomes that bird's 'mate'. To inseminate a female, keepers will mimic a mating dance to get her to present, put weight on her back to make her think she's being mounted, and then inseminate her. It is done very carefully and convincingly. Once a bird bonds with a keeper, she often will not let any other keeper unless she doesn't see her mate for a very long time. This was specific to a crane species they were working with, but is true for many bird species with specific mating habits.</p>
<p>For the birds that do this, the bonding and mating dance is key. Without it they'd have to sedate female for insemination which sucks for the animal and the handlers. It's funny how specific some animals are when it comes to sex. They can be every bit as picky as people, especially those who are naturally choosy, or those who breed often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, there are people who specialize in jerking-off bulls? I feel like this just leads to more questions that I both do and do not want answered. Like, what kinds of notes are people taking on this?</p>
<p>&quot;After 30 seconds, stimulate balls while stroking shaft in a reverse grip&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some places it's more of a sideline. Our horse semen guy back home was an equine reproductive specialist full-time, but I once stayed on a cattle ranch where a county judge was the best available bull semen guy. My friend and I got there just after a breeding session. My friend's dad was the bull's preferred &quot;partner,&quot; but he did such a good job that morning that the bull broke his arm. It took him three days to go to the hospital because he didn't want to make a fuss and by then I think it had to be reset, he's lucky he didn't lose his arm because he was too stubborn to pay attention to the useless purple football attached to his torso.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course! The bull semen industry is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Consider this, something like 80% of dairy cattle in the US are artificially inseminated. That's several millions of cattle. If you could discover a way to make the process even a little bit more effective or a little bit less expensive, it would save or make a LOT of money. This is why it's worth specializing in! Producers and companies pour thousands and thousands of dollars into research.</p></div>		</li>
