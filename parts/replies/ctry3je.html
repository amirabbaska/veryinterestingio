			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Modern psychology grew out of experiments with hypnotism; Freud and his mentor (Breuer) hypnotized patients all the time, and were able to relieve hysterical symptoms. The problem was, the hysteria would reappear as a different symptom. This is part how Freud discovered that symptoms come from unacknowledged feelings, rather than existing on their own. Hypnotism is serious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Hysteria&quot; is not an actual condition but something Freud made up to explain a variety of situations.  You should not start out a discussion of &quot;modern psychology&quot; and jump right to Freud.  He popularized some ideas that influence psychotherapy today, but he's simply not representative of &quot;modern psychology&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>a week before the demonstration the man came to practice on us, to see if any of us would be good for hypnosis. I knew about the phenomenon, but I didn't know what it was like to be hypnotized.</p>
<p>He started to work on me and soon I got into a position where he said, &quot;You can't open your eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>I said to myself, &quot;I bet I could open my eyes, but I don't want to disturb the situation: Let's see how much further it goes.&quot; It was an interesting situation: You're only slightly fogged out, and although you've lost a little bit, you're pretty sure you could open your eyes. But of course, you're not opening your eyes, so in a sense you can't do it.</p>
<p>He went through a lot of stuff and decided that I was pretty good.</p>
<p>When the real demonstration came he had us walk on stage, and he hypnotized us in front of the whole Princeton Graduate College. This time the effect was stronger; I guess I had learned how to become hypnotized. The hypnotist made various demonstrations, having me do things that I couldn't normally do, and at the end he said that after I came out of hypnosis, instead of returning to my seat directly, which was the natural way to go, I would walk all the way around the room and go to my seat from the back.</p>
<p>All through the demonstration I was vaguely aware of what was going on, and cooperating with the things the hypnotist said, but this time I decided, &quot;Damn it, enough is enough! I'm gonna go straight to my seat.&quot;</p>
<p>When it was time to get up and go off the stage, I started to walk straight to my seat. But then an annoying feeling came over me: I felt so uncomfortable that I couldn't continue. I walked all the way around the hall.</p>
<p>I was hypnotized in another situation some time later by a woman. While I was hypnotized she said, &quot;I'm going to light a match, blow it out, and immediately touch the back of your hand with it. You will feel no pain.&quot; I thought, &quot;Baloney!&quot; She took a match, lit it, blew it out, and touched it to the back of my hand. It felt slightly warm. My eyes were closed throughout all of this, but I was thinking, &quot;That's easy. She lit one match, but touched a different match to my hand. There's nothin' to that; it's a fake!&quot;</p>
<p>When I came out of the hypnosis and looked at the back of my hand, I got the biggest surprise: There was a burn on the back of my hand. Soon a blister grew, and it never hurt at all, even when it broke.</p>
<p>So I found hypnosis to be a very interesting experience. All the time you're saying to yourself, &quot;I could do that, but I won't&quot; -- which is just another way of saying that you can't.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, I'm back, as promised! Let's tackle this.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>So, I feel like there's a misunderstanding right off the bat here. No one is saying that it's failing for these people. What I'm saying is that given limited time and extremely specific circumstances, it's going to work better for some people than others.</p>
<p>Just about everyone <em>can</em> be hypnotized. But on a stage, in a group, with a huge crowd watching you? That's just simply not the right environment for everyone. Remember, hypnosis has a huge psychological component. Some people will be too nervous, some people will be too excited. Some people just need extra time to get into the right headspace.</p>
<p>I think a lot of your argument is predicated on the false notion that it &quot;only works for certain people&quot; as you put it. But we'll continue down the line, anyhow.</p>
<p>This is a bit like saying there's no such thing as meditation (a close cousin of hypnosis, actually) unless everyone can meditate within a few minutes while hundreds of people watch on. Everyone works differently, and I fail to see how this disproves anything.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure why you think this is more reasonable. It seems that it just falls in line with your thinking, and is therefor more palatable. The funny thing is, I'm not sure how you're separating out &quot;placebo effect&quot; here. If they experience hypnosis sincerely, then how can you say what is and isn't placebo? We're not exactly giving people sugar pills, here.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that your assumption relies on stage hypnosis being the only avenue through which one can observe hypnosis. I've also done plenty of clinical and personal hypnosis. My belief in the validity is not based solely on what happens on a stage. I've had countless opportunities to not only hypnotize someone in a much more relaxed, one-on-one environment, but to also talk with people at length about their experience.</p>

<p>This part was interesting to me. Let me remind you that at the time of my comment, the top comment was literally just someone saying &quot;nope, not real.&quot; Not backing up their claim, not demonstrating any knowledge in the area. Just saying it wasn't true. So this caused me to wonder aloud, &quot;Why is this such a popular response, if it doesn't demonstrate any actual knowledge about the subject?&quot; I wasn't trying to deviate focus from a strong argument, because there wasn't one. This was simply a supposition on why uninformed opinions float to the top, regardless of the strength of their content.</p>
<p>It was never meant to be a strong argument. I wasn't saying &quot;The only reason you don't believe is because you're scared to!&quot; but rather, &quot;The only reason people who don't know what they're talking about get hoisted up is because they present an opinion people are comfortable with.&quot; I stand by that as a probable reason.</p>

<p>You're right that it's universally fascinating, but I don't think these things have to be mutually exclusive. We can be simultaneously fascinated by and frightened of something. And I wouldn't dream, as I said above, of accusing any dissenting view as hostile. The hostile views are not &quot;I don't think hypnosis is real.&quot; For instance, I wouldn't say that about you. I appreciate the time you took to write out your concerns, and treat your skepticism as totally healthy. The hostile views are &quot;Hypnosis is obviously bullshit and anyone trying to say otherwise is scum!&quot; You'd be amazed how much attention these comments can get on reddit.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This isn't a &quot;random&quot; example, and hopefully we can both see that. There's plenty of research out there that tells us that gluten free diets are silly for the majority of the population. So you're comparing something we <em>know</em> to be false to something you <em>believe</em> to be false. But the evidence isn't behind you in the same way. Rather, it's the opposite.</p>
<p>There. I hope you feel that I addressed your comment properly. I apologize for the delay!</p></div>		</li>
