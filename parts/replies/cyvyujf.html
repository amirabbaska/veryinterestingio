<p>Kek, this is actually pretty much exactly how it is. In mainstream media anyway, like Sunrise, and other trite. Even ABC's morning news seems to be getting worse and worse, I've had it on for 20 minutes for the last three mornings and all I seem to hear about is the Essendon doping scandal, WADA, and how the players are now suing the club for lost income.</p>
<p>Remember... JOHNNY DEPP'S DOGS. That saga lasted for two weeks.</p></div>		</li>
