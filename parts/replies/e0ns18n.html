<p>There's basically three categories:</p>
<p>-walking at a constant, sustainable pace<br />
-running at a constant, sustainable pace<br />
-sprinting at an unsustainable pace (close to max effort)  </p>
<p>Running requires a little bit more work than walking over a given distance, but the total calories burned is going to be similar, because both utilize mainly aerobic respiration.</p>
<p>Sprinting the same total distance in discrete intervals is going to burn way more calories over a given distance than walking, because anaerobic respiration is much less efficient than aerobic respiration.</p></div>		</li>
