			<div class="markdown"><p>Obligatory “that’s why golf balls are bumpy.”   In their case, the turbulent flow is induced just to reduce drag, not to  help create lift, but the reason and method for keeping flow attached to the rounded body is the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a rowing or dragon boat paddle going through the water. A static head of non- moving air is built up on the face. Basically a wedge of dead air, which diverts the water and reduces resistance and power in drive.  Now imagine a new paddle with properly sized HOLES on the face of the paddle, turbulance is created because of the disturbance of the static dead air space, hence resistance and power are increased from the rower.  Try it!  Just put your hand out the window of your car and slowly open your fingers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun story--these aren't integral to the blade itself. In fact they're often installed as an upgrade after the turbines have been in operation for a while (the manufacturers love to come back and get a little bit more revenue). They're a bit controversial in the industry because the...ah...permanence of the adhesive used is not always what one might wish for.</p>
<p>Certain countries have banned them for offshore use, because it would be tantamount to littering bits of plastic in the ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as far as I know they're generally found directly underneath. It's quite a light strip of plastic, so even if it's flung off with substantial velocity it's going to end up drifting down relatively slowly.</p></div>		</li>
