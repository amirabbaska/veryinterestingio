			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really... vader means father, not lord. &quot;Our Lord&quot; and &quot;Our father&quot; in the biblical sense are almost interchangeable, but vader literally means father. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Darth_Vader#Etymology" target="_blank">That is where they get Darth Vader's name to begin with</a>, they are just using the dutch word for father to refer to Luke's father, so every time Luke calls him Vader he is really calling him father.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct with the Lord prayer. &quot;Onze Vader&quot; was just the first thing I could think of other examples are &quot;Bezoek&quot; (visit) became &quot;Besoek&quot;, &quot;Zeep&quot; (soap) became &quot;Seep&quot; but some words that are written with an an S stay like that in afrikaans for example &quot;Slaap&quot; (sleep) stays the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dutch (well, Flemish actually) speaker here. To me it always seemed that Afrikaans was a simplified version of our language. (This comment confirms that, the spelling in Afrikaans is a lot closer to the actual pronunciation than our spelling.) And I mean this as a compliment!</p>
<p>I can give you a pretty clear example why we can understand Afrikaans better than they can understand Dutch. </p>
<p>e.g. &quot;Metro&quot; vs &quot;Moltrein&quot;</p>
<p>Better known as a subway, in dutch we call that a &quot;metro&quot;. Why? I have no clue, just a new word or stolen from the English language.</p>
<p>In Zuid-Afrika, they had to make up a word for it. So they where like, yeah it's a train, and just like a mole it goes underground. So let's call it a mole-train, litterally translated: &quot;moltrein&quot;.</p>
<p>For us, we just think about the word and we can guess what it means, for them (if they don't happen to know the English word &quot;metro&quot;), it's like we just pulled some word out of our ass.</p>
<p>EDIT: example was wrong</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. A &quot;caravan&quot; is always called a &quot;karavaan&quot; in Afrikaans, the word &quot;sleurhut&quot; is never used in Afrikaans (I also believe the word &quot;sleur&quot; is Dutch and not regularly used in Afrikaans).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many of the changes which are official in Afrikaans are un-officialy used in day-to-day written as well as spoken communication in Flanders. </p>
<p>Of those listed above, depending on the region in Flanders, for example 'vrouw' is also shortened to 'vrou' or even 'vroe', the 'ij' is extremely often replaced by the 'y' in informal writing. The 'n' for pluralisms is also often dropped in most parts of Flanders. Double negation is still widely present in some regions. </p>
<p>So many of the evolutions which Afrikaans 'underwent' were probably already pre-existant in the regional dialects of both Flanders and the Netherlands (both were a same country during the colonial time though) so I feel the changes are very natural. </p></div>		</li>
