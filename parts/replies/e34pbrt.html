			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, and is there also an animal that takes on the role of the &quot;sea bee&quot;, or is the pollination completely relying on water currents?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an awesome question!<br />
I don't know off the top of my head and am on an island with only my phone. But I'll be spending a bunch of time with one of the world's leading seagrass experts next week - I'll ask him for you and let you know what he says!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pollinator linked below was only discovered in the past year or so. Some species (e.g. turtlegrass) rely more heavily on asexual growth (sending up more shoots from its rhizome) than on pollination though. In my research, I’d estimate that only 1-5% of shoots I see actually have a female or male flower. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reptiles alone have returned to the sea stacks of times. I count maybe 10 we know of at least. But I'd also be surprised if it weren't a lot more times than 3 for plants, as well. :) (Though there might be more of a difficult barrier to overcome for returning to the waves for terrestrial vascular plants rooted into the earth?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea you're totally right. The recolonization line blurs somewhat with animals because many move between land and sea (im not sure i would consider marine iguanas a &quot;re-colonization&quot; event). This probably plays a big role in allowing utilization of the marine environment since animals can move about to avoid osmotic stress and plants cannot. I didn't write very clearly but i meant that in seagrasses alone i believe there have been 3 independent re-colonizations.</p>
<p>I'll bet someone's tallied the number of reintroductions in vertebrates...i'd do a quick scholar search but i'm restricted to my phone.</p></div>		</li>
