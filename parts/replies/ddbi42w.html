			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, this study is very helpful in order to get at least an estimate of the exposure per x-ray. We do get regularly checked and we used to have a dosimeter in the room (a couple of meters away from the source) and it always marked 0. </p>
<p>EDIT : those values seem very high, though. They recorded 52 microSv for the arm, when a direct x-ray to the arm is around 1 microSv?</p></div>		</li>

<p>They are using mSv for microsieverts, when normally dosages and mSv are discussed as millisieverts. I believe normal direct scan is around 1 millisievert, and this is saying 52 thousandths of that. Confusing non-use of the Î¼ character! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sites I was checking were saying 1 microsievert per extremity x-ray ( <a href="http://www.xrayrisk.com/calculator/" target="_blank">http://www.xrayrisk.com/calculator/</a> for example )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the dosimeter should be at the distance the technician or anyone else that needs to be in the room is standing. A dosimeter several meters away while you are only a meter away will never give you your dose. The inverse square law precludes this. Additionally, what is the energy range of your dosimeter? If you're putting out 1-6 mSv and your dosimeter doesn't read that low, it's useless</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I didn't make myself clear. We have dosimeters on ourselves. We just had one extra at the back of the room, that always read 0.</p></div>		</li>
