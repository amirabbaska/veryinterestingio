<p>Evidence for this is that female suicide attempts are much higher, but male suicide &quot;success&quot; is much higher </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure <em>exactly</em> what you mean by suicide rate - attempts or deaths</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suicide means you killed yourself dead.  If you attempt suicide but are unsuccessful you are not considered a suicide and would not be included in the suicide rate. </p></div>		</li>
