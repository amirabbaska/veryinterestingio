<p>Why do some songs stand the test of time and never get old?</p>
<p>Is the reason why, because they are truly great songs?</p>
<p>Why do only some people report frission when listening?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could it be those songs have unique components that can't be found or are very rare in other or modern songs? And perhaps those old songs are playing in a genre or style that is no longer popular? An example is the use of synth, hardly a thing anymore yet old songs used it a lot. Thus our brain never hears synth songs often enough to perpetuate how repetitive we think it feels. Modern pop songs often uses the same instruments, same style, same tempo, and same type of vocals as other modern pop songs so our brain is pretty worn from it before we even hear it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also applies to movies/stories and their relative tropes. Thats why children love watching the exact same movie every time. Each idea and trope is new to them, and each subsequent watch they learn something new. Which is also why things wayyyy out of the norm suck to us. Were not used to it. </p></div>		</li>
