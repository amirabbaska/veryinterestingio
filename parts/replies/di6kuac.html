			<div class="markdown"><p>They use fiber amplifiers. A fiber amplifier uses a section of fiber that's been doped with erbium to optically amplify the signal. The energy required for this process is supplied by a laser. The lasers in the amplifiers are powered by applying a very high voltage across the ends of the cable, powering all of the amplifiers in series.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is some badass physics here that we shouldn't gloss over. It's cooler than the original question.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Every single thing I've read that mentions fiber amplifiers has failed to mention this piece of the puzzle. That explains a few things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the use of optical repeaters. These devices either pick up the signal, convert it to an electric one and then resend an amplified version of the optical signal or they make use of active media to directly amplify the incoming light.</p>
<p>90% loss over 20km is not so much of a problem if you can use high power input and classical amplification, but in my field, which is quantum communication we cannot do either at this point which is one reason why we are interested in said quantum memories, as these are a requirement for quantum repeaters that are roughly speaking the quantum equivalent of the mentioned optical repeaters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can put out a signal that several orders of magnitude powerful than the sensor needs to detect it. You can optically amplify the signal. You can repeat the signal (receive it and resend it out again at full power. And you can have error correction which puts some redundancy in the signal incase the signal is too weak and looses some bits. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically you can make your ring-down time arbitrarily large by making your cavity arbitrarily large if you are in vacuum. LIGO is of course much, much larger than the kind of cavities that I was thinking of, so it might be possible.</p>
<p>That being said it still sounds like an incredible number, but it was an incredible experiment after all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could not shoot light into a perfect cavity to start with. For a perfect cavity the light you insert needs to be perfectly monochromatic and in order to produce perfectly monochromatic light you need an infinite amount of time to generate it according to Fouriers theorem.</p>
<p>Imperfect cavities can be &quot;filled up&quot; resulting in very high intensities insight the cavity. But for a given input you can only fill it so much before the losses are larger than the incoming power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could, however, inject light with finite coherence into a perfect cavity with one mirror acting as a switch (allow the spatially finite photons to enter the cavity and then close it). This would of course not allow coherent power in the cavity to grow indefinitely, but you could still place arbitrary amount of energy in a perfect cavity and it would never decay.</p>
<p>You could also think about what would happen under such a circumstance should you manage to increase the energy arbitrarily. Excluding all practical material nonlinearities and limitations, vacuum itself would eventually become nonlinear (Schwinger limit) and form matter-antimatter particle pairs which would destroy your mirrors. Though well before that the nonlinearity would upconvert your photons into a wavelength that would likely pass through your mirrors. However, if your mirrors would somehow reflect all wavelengths perfectly and tolerate all conditions and you managed to inject more and more energy into the cavity, photon pressure would grow enormous and the cavity would eventually collapse into a black hole.</p>
<p>edit: You might be able to arrange something like this by starting with a huge cavity and then slowly bringing the mirrors closer to each other (after energy is already in your cavity) allowing energy density to grow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the cavity lets light in, it necessarily lets light out in the other direction. As you shoot more and more light in, more and more escapes out, so eventually you reach a steady-state maximum circulating light power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that a physics constraint, or just a materials one? Like, would a material that only allows light through in one direction violate a law of physics? Black holes, for example, let light in but don't let it out, though I suppose they do radiate. </p></div>		</li>
