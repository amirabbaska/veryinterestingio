			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the use of &quot;literally&quot; figuratively more recent ?</p>
<p>Either this or the fact I'm not a native, because I find it strange, even wrong.</p>
<p>edit: </p>
<p>TIL Guy de Maupassant also used it that way.</p>
<p>I guess literally as a auto-antonym is globalized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using &quot;literally&quot; as an intensifier is the opposite of recent - It's been used that way since the late 17th century. People have been whining about it almost as long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, after some googling, it seems it is used as a general intensifier but when used that way can easily be removed or replaced by another intensifier.</p>
<p>Whereas its more literal use (at least its literal meaning nowadays) has a specific meaning which could be impaired by its use as an intensifier.</p>
<p>So, to me, it shouldn't be used figuratively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting similar usage comes from the Simpson's Tall Tales episode with Bart as Huckleberry Finn.</p>
