			<div class="markdown"><p>If you use a VPN, your ISP can only see you talking to the VPN service.  The VPN service will inherit the ability to see/modify your Internet traffic.</p>
<p>You're essentially shifting your trust from your ISP to your VPN provider.  That's why it's important to make sure you get a provider you trust.  Conveniently, VPN providers can be anywhere, so unlike with your ISP you actually have choices available.</p>
<p>As a side note, unless you configure it correctly you could still be leaking DNS queries to your ISP.  Make sure your VPN provider supports routing all DNS queries through the VPN tunnel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>VPN still doesn't make it possible to see end-to-end encrypted HTTPS traffic unless they are performing the MitM (easily detectable), the distent end site is using an older compromised cipher suite or SSL3 rather than TLS v1.2, their software installs a CA chain as a trusted cert on your box, the site you'e going to or their CA has compromised private keys..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct, the VPN service cannot do anything your ISP couldn't have done.  They can, however, do anything your ISP could do.  Things either kind of company can in theory do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read, modify, redirect, throttle, or drop any non-encrypted traffic.  This includes plain HTTP websites, non-encrypted traffic from online applications (such as torrent software or video games), and VOIP calls.</li>
<li>Throttle or drop encrypted traffic, such as HTTPS websites</li>
<li>Inspect DNS queries to determine what websites you may be visiting, even if the connection to the website itself is encrypted</li>
<li>Use metadata, destination IPs, timing, and packet size to make educated guesses as to what encrypted traffic might contain</li>
<li>Use any combination of the above pieces of information to selectively depriortize, throttle or block traffic they don't like.</li>
</ul>
<p>This assumes you did not install anything on your computer from either company.  If they installed something, assume that it may be possible for them to do <em>anything</em>.  This is why I strongly suggest favoring VPN providers that use open standards (such as OpenVPN) -- as long as they use such a standard, you can connect using any compatible client, not just the one they give you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At this moment can my ISP legally throttle me when I’m using a VPN? For example, today I was using one. I opened my Tor browser and entered a .onion address. Almost instantly my VPN disconnected and my internet connection dropped. I had to restart the router to get it to work again. After that I was able to connect to the site I was trying to access but it still left me very suspicious. I’m extra heightened to stuff like this because of all the net neutrality stuff and it’s making me a bit paranoid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A VPN will stop your ISP from messing with your traffic as long as you can use it.  It can help (and I would definitely recommend getting one), but if net neutrality ends there's absolutely nothing stopping your ISP from simply banning or throttling VPNs over their network.  There's unfortunately absolutely nothing you can do about that (which is why net neutrality is so critically important -- without it, your ISP has free reign to screw you over unless you use the services they want).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could be blocked at either end.
For example, Netflix blocks some known VPNs and your ISP could block you from connecting to that VPN by instituting a whitelist. </p></div>		</li>
