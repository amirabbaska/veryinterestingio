			<div class="markdown"><p>I was taught that the biological definition of life was:</p>
<p>1) metabolize</p>
<p>2) reproduce</p>
<p>3) response to stimuli</p>
<p>4) mutate</p>
<p>This sorta helps to distinguish the death of an organism as the point at which cells are no longer dividing, are unable to metabolize, do not mutate and do not respond to stimuli.  A virus would be categorized by this definition as non-life.</p>
<p>That said, spores and many other living organisms can shutoff some of these core biological functions for indefinite amounts of time and still be ready to produce life after their dormancy.  Maybe they do all of the above just at a much slower pace?  I'm not entirely sure.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Duuude, I was going to make a strawberry reference and see if anyone got it. I think I found my place on reddit. You're my kind of people.</p>
<p>The problem is, we don't have a technical definition of the word &quot;dead&quot;. As we get better and better at bringing people back from the brink, it is clear that the line is much fuzzier than our current categorization covers.</p></div>		</li>
