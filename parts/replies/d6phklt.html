			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the above, water content is also a big reason for differences in cooking time/temp. The longer something is exposed to dry heat like on a stove uncovered or in an oven, the more moisture is going to evaporate. So a casserole would be much drier baked at 350 for 40 minutes than one baked at 425 for 20 mins. So to preserve moist internal texture, we use high heat for short times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slow cookers resolve the dryness problem by doing the cooking in a closed environment. The lid will trap all moisture in. It condenses on the glass lid, then drips back down into the thing you're cooking. Its not completely sealed because you don't want it to explode. Its not a pressure seal, but it does trap nearly all water inside the cooking vessel.</p>
<p>This allows you to cook a tasty meal for 8-9 hours without it being a dry, inedible mess.</p>
<p>The other benefit of slow cooking is that some proteins are very robust against high heat. It takes them a long time to cook. Connective tissues are a prime example of this. Slow cooking something for 8 hours on a low heat gives ample time for the connective tissues to break down while at the same time keeping the overall temperature low enough that you don't burn your dinner.</p>
<p>The end result is that you can take a tough, stringy, cheap cut of meat and make an amazingly tender beef stew through the magic of slow cooking. The connective tissues all break down and turn into a sort of delicious meat-gravy which is fantastic with carrots, potatoes, and onions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Which is why heating a rock up fast could make it fracture or explode, but heating it slowly allows the water to evaporate and the rock to hear without breaking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am actually a geologist and heating it up fast and slow affects the mineralogy of a rock completely. It is not &quot;largely the same&quot;.</p>
<p>Crystal structure of a mineral is dictated by the chemical composition. The chemical composition of a mineral crystallizing from a &quot;melt&quot; is dictated by the amount of silica and metal cations in the melt, and by the temperature that allows a mineral to solidify and crystallize.</p>
<p>So if something is slowly melted and takes a very long time. The mineral inside a rock will have time to form crystals and therefore crystallize.  Example: (Granite) <a href="http://imgur.com/TLFDTHZ" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/TLFDTHZ</a></p>
<p>So if a something is heated in at a rapid high temperature then cools down rapidly. All of its minerals crystallize rapidly therefore the grains are extremely &quot;small&quot;. Example (Basalt) <a href="http://imgur.com/ncNd6fu" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/ncNd6fu</a></p>
<p>TL DR: TEMPERATURE AND THE SPEED AFFECT GRAIN SIZE.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you were making a good point, but rocks were just a poor choice as an example. Rocks can break even at temperature changes slower than those experienced on a stove. A quick temperature change (up or down) can cause a rock to crack or explode when a slow one would allow the crystal lattices and grain boundaries to adjust without catastrophic failure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gabbro and Basalt are Related. Gabbros are equivalent in composition to basalts (QAP diagram). Basalts are extrusive igneous rocks that cool quickly and have fine-grained crystals. Gabbros are intrusive igneous rocks that cool slowly and have coarse-grained crystals. Since the grain size is relatively fine, it would be classified as a basalt and not a gabbro even if the bulk composition is the same.</p></div>		</li>
