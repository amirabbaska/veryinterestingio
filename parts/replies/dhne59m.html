			<div class="markdown"><p>This was horrifying to me so I did a bit of research:</p>
<p>Transplant recipients taking cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or sirolimus are advised to avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice.  Research shows that grapefruit juice can block an enzyme in the intestines that is responsible for the breakdown and absorption of these medications, leading to increased amounts of these medications in the body, which may hurt the kidneys.</p>
<p>I'm assuming &quot;hurt the kidneys&quot; means not good at all</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, I'm currently on ciclosporin and I have to get regular (monthly) blood tests to check renal function. </p>
<p>Not sure if ciclosporin is directly harmful to the kidneys, or is it its metabolites, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Anti rejection drugs too. I don't know if all of them do, but as someone else mentioned, ciclosporin (cyclosporin) is metabolized by CYP3A4, and you would get a higher effect of ciclosporin if you also ingested grapefruit.</p>
<p>This increases side effects, including kidney and liver dysfunction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you actually look at the metabolism in detail (which I did when on rotation at a pharmacogenomics company) the major metabolic factor is urinary ph. A fairly significant portion is excreted unchanged in the urine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Too many variables to control for. It would be impossible to recommend a standard dosage. How much grapefruit juice will you drink with it? What brand? From concentrate or fresh? It would add too much complexity to the prescribing process, it would be highly prone to error and consequently would be dangerous. </p></div>		</li>
