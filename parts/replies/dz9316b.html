			<div class="markdown"><p>My 13 year old does too. The very light, flat, pinkish marks are of no concern. Larger, slightly raised and deeper red colored ones have a correlation with Spina bifida EDS. Both types of marks are called stork bites in some areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people have conditions that they don't know about because they don't cause any problems in their daily life. And therefore don't need to be treated. I'm not saying you have one though. I'm sure some people just have a strawberry patch!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wondered why my strawberry mark was down as a 'major' on my past medical conditions, i have one on my hip. Ive also got a normal birth mark about the size of the palm of my hand on my right thigh, never occured to me that some people didnt have either</p></div>		</li>
