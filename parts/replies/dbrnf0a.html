<p>If there is an effect, it's due to some localized area not equalizing in the same way as the rest of your tissues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which totally fits, because collagen in scars is all oriented the same way, while collagen in non-damaged tissue is random. There are substantial differences in mineral structures in amorphous vs ordered structures, the chemist in me is not surprised that such a difference would show up in biology as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to get severe sinus infections once or twice a year. Usually I could get through a working day with the pain in the background. But almost as soon as I got in the car to begin the 50 - mile trip back home, the pain would flare up to almost epic proportions. Once I got home things would settle down until I had to drive back to work the next day and it would start all over again.</p>
<p>I eventually had the problem fixed with surgery but for years I could never understand why driving caused such agony. It finally dawned on me that it was the slight changes in air pressure as I traveled up and down the hills of northern NJ that were causing the already-inflamed tissue in the sinus cavities to become irritated even further.</p>
<p>I used to doubt people that said changes in the weather affected their aches and pains but I don't any more.</p></div>		</li>
