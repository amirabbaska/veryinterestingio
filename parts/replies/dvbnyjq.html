<p>Flash powder does not and should not be packed tightly.  Anything over a teaspoon will create the large boom you're looking for.   M-80s, Cherry Bombs, Silver Salutes, etc the powder is all loose.   Same with theatrical flash pots &amp; canons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thermite burns too slowly, with no gas output. You need a fast burn, and just a little gas output to get a large radiant cloud. Too little gas, you get a hot bright blob that stays hot for a while while giving off only a little light (because it's small). Radiated light is proportional to surface area and T^(4). So a flash grenade, that wants maximum total light in a short time, needs to get a large radiating area.</p>
<p>The flash powders chosen mostly have non-gaseous products (aluminum + potassium perchlorate nominally gives aluminum oxide and potassium chloride), but it's hot enough to vaporize some of them and the combustion isn't perfectly complete, so you get a little gas. There may also be small amounts of stabilizers that also produce a little gas as they burn.</p>
<p>The material also needs to be easy enough to light when needed by the fuse, yet also stable enough for manufacturing, storage, and normal handling.</p>
<p>You could probably get a flash grenade or similar to work with a Copper II thermite, since that burns very quickly and has some gas output (it boils the resultant copper). But normal thermite just burns too slowly, I think.</p></div>		</li>
