			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, but it's not that we're building bases specifically for them as the previous person is mentioning. They come to pilot training to learn how to fly with our guys. In my experience, it's mostly Japanese.. but I have had some Korean, Saudi and even a few Brits come through (and more that I'm forgetting, for sure -- oh yes, we had 2 Italians come through one year). One thing I noticed about all of the foreign students that came through was that no matter your position or rank, you get the same respect you give. Being an enlisted, it felt weird at times. I know JSUPT has been terminated, but I don't know if that affects foreign students coming to train (I don't think it does, but I've been out for a while so who knows these days).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm Canadian, and every branch of our Armed Forces trains with yours both on American and Canadian soil constantly. There are Canadian colonels, lieutenants and generals leading Americans and vice versa all of the world in various campaigns. We are entirely synergistic, we can effectively going to battle as one unified force if we need to.</p></div>		</li>
