<p>Perpendicular to the ground, gravity is going to play into things in some way, so that wouldn't really prove anything.</p>

<p>Under normal 1 g conditions, yes. Why would he point that out? &quot;You don't need gravity to yoyo. Think of how you yoyo normally.&quot; Again, that wouldn't prove anything.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gravity plays no real part in basic yoyoing, only in certain tricks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think that's true. </p>
<p>If you throw a yoyo down on earth you can get it to just run on the end of the string until it stops spinning, which happens because gravity pulls the yoyo tight against the string and allows it to freely rotate. If you did that in space it would immediately bounce back because of the tension in the string caused by throwing the yoyo down and the absence of gravity to counteract the snap that lets the yoyo wind itself back up again.</p>
<p>A lot of yoyo tricks and basic yoyoing rely on gravity to constantly pull the yoyo tight against the string which wouldn't happen in space unless the yoyo has momentum other than it spinning about its axis. You'd have to adapt basically everything about it if you were doing it in space because as soon as you throw it out it would bounce back at you almost as fast.</p></div>		</li>

<p>this would be considered a trick.  basic yoyoing in this context means throwing the yoyo down and having it come back by itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really don't think so. The basis of almost every yoyo trick is throwing it and getting it to stay down so I'd say that's a basic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. If you can create just enough friction to have the yo-yo stop moving away, but not come back- you could literally have the yo-yo spinning indefinitely (In a real zero G environment). This isn't violating any law of motion. You created a lot of spin, you take away a bit- and it will come back to you- with more spin than it did with gravity, but not as much as it left your hand initially. It's no perpetual machine, or else magicians would truly me doing magic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, no you couldn't. Friction from the bearings and string will slow it down quite quickly, and air resistance is still often present.</p>
<p>Secondly to throw out a yoyo and have it come to a complete stop isn't violating any law of motion but it doesn't work in the system. When you throw put a yoyo the friction between the string it's wound around means the speed it is spinning determines how fast it's linear motion is. That energy doesn't just dissappear when it reaches the end of the string, it gets stored as tension in the string. When you have gravity that tension isn't enough to make the yoyo bounce up all the time, when you don't it will inevitably make the yoyo bounce back towards you.</p></div>		</li>
