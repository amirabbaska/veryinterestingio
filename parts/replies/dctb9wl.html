<p>If I asked the average person how many windows they had in their home, they would probably do a mental walkthrough of their home and count the windows. For somebody with aphantasia, they'll know, but they might not know how they know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I have something similar to aphantasia - or at least people have told me that I do. I <em>can</em> form mental images if I make a conscious effort, but it doesn't come naturally to me, and I feel like they're not as rich as I get the impression that other people's are. </p>
<p>I've had a few conversations with people where I've tried to describe how my thoughts work, and it seems like most of the time when someone would normally form a mental image, I'll form a sort of conceptual representation of that thing. For example, if someone tells me to think of a dog, I'll start with the idea of a dog, but if they describe specific markings to me, I might try to form a mental image of the dog - but I'll only be able to visualise short flashes of limited detail. </p>
<p>In the task where I have to count the windows in my house, I'll have no problem, because I can form spatial maps in my head quite easily. Again, by default these have no visual element to them - I just &quot;know&quot; - but just &quot;knowing&quot; is a state of representation in my head like &quot;seeing&quot; a picture in your minds eye, or &quot;listening&quot; to music in your head. If I wanted, I could try to form a mental picture of my house as I imagine my way around it, but it's much faster not to, so I generally wouldn't bother unless there was a reason to.</p>
<p>The only time I've ever noticed this to be inconvenient is when making diagrams. I work in software, so I often need to form a mental model of how various components link together. I usually find that I have a pretty clear understanding of how the pieces fit together in my head, as they're represented in the &quot;conceptual&quot; level, but when I need to translate these into a diagram to show to others, I struggle. When I've spoken to others about this, they've said that they model the relationships with diagram in their mind's eye, and visually rearrange the pieces in their head until they're right, then they can just draw that. In my case, I need to translate my mental model into a visual one, which usually takes a few minutes, and I'll need to draw it on something or I won't be able to hold all of the details in my head at once.</p>
<p>To try to give a better idea of what I mean, I just tried to visualise an increasing number of boxes. I could visualise up to 4 boxes randomly arranged and joined together by lines in a graph, but once I go higher than 4, I start losing boxes - I'll try to add another box in and notice one of the previous ones has disappeared from my image, I'll add it back, but there'll still only be 4 boxes. I can add more boxes if I constrain them to a grid - I started imagining 2 boxes horizontally and kept adding another 2 vertically - after 8 boxes, I lost the ability to visualise the individual boxes and I just have a vague image of a tall rectangular grid. Thinking about it, it's almost as if my mind's eye is a very low resolution camera, and as details get finer, they blur together. Of course, they don't actually look blurred to me, but it's the closest analogy I can find. Interestingly, I seem to have above average visual acuity, and people are often surprised at the details I can make out, so I wonder if there's some relationship between these.</p>
<p>Another thing I've found that may be related is that I don't usually think with words, but the same conceptual representation I use instead of images. Thinking in words comes much easier to me than images though, and I'll switch to using language if I'm thinking about how to explain something to someone else (like while writing this comment) or if I'm stuck on a problem and need to think it through carefully (in which case I find using words seems to improve my short term memory, at the cost of slowing down my train of thought).</p>
<p>This also seems to carry across to my dreams as well. I do seem to visualise things in my dreams more than I do in waking life, but the visuals have the same lack of detail I struggle with when trying to consciously imagine something, and the bulk of the dream details happen in the form of concepts, where I know what happened, but I didn't really see it. Interestingly, I don't seem to communicate verbally in dreams whatsoever, if I 'talk' to someone in a dream it's more like we take turns 'telepathically' sharing conceptual representations with one another.</p>
<p>I've heard that some people bias towards thinking in either images or language normally, although I haven't been able to find anyone who seems to bias towards thinking in concepts, but it makes me wonder if we practice thinking in different ways at a young age and naturally end up favouring a certain way of thinking throughout the rest of our lives, making us more efficient in that mode at the expense of others. Perhaps people with aphantasia may have gone directly to thinking in language or concepts at an early age, and lost the chance to train their minds to use imagery while their brains were still plastic enough to learn that ability. Pure speculation of course, but if anyone has more information on this sort of thing I'd be fascinated to read it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sort of thing interests me greatly, so I find myself thinking about it quite a lot. </p>
<p>I work with a guy who has an incredible ability to remember songs and their lyrics.
It seems every 5 minutes he is singing a different random song aloud, with more accuracy than I can sing even my favorite tunes. </p>
<p>I asked him about it the other day and he replied that he's just singing the songs that are playing in his head, and he joked that I should do it more often.
He has full length songs playing in his head at almost all times, even when engrossed in another activity. He also has had a lot of problems with ADHD in his life, though I don't know if there is a connection there.</p>
<p>This is incredible to me as I think mostly in sentences. I can still visualize or hear songs if I focus on it, but it is very much a conscious activity and is grainy at best.
Song lyrics are totally lost on me, although my memory is pretty bad. </p>
<p>It is amazing how different people process thoughts and information, yet I feel like we kinda just assume we all think in relatively the same way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's quite interesting, if I've heard a song a few times I can play the music in my head pretty well, and I'll often get a song stuck in my head involuntary. I'd have to listen to the song many many times over to memorise the lyrics though. Even some of my favourite songs will have chunks of lyrics I can't remember. I tend to whistle to myself a lot, which might have something to do with remembering the tunes much better than the lyrics, but it's probably more because my singing voice sucks. :) On the one hand, perfect recollection of music sounds like an awesome ability, but I wonder if it would make getting a song stuck in your head even more annoying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just talking to someone about the mental songs today, I do that. It's not every day or all day but its very common for me to be hearing a song if I am not focused on something else. The detail in the song is sometimes equivalent to hearing the song for real which probably depends on how well I know it.  </p>
<p>It's like my mind is filling in the gaps with music.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I kinda have the same condition as well. I'm able to play any kind of song in my mind as long as I remember the song title. It doesn't require any conscious effort at all. Sometimes the song get mixed halfway with another that sounds pretty similar and it annoys me greatly when it happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it is possible that you could have a condition that limits your visual imagery, but it seems equally possible that you just need more practise with it. Your ability to imagine images in high detail can be trained with exercise . The usual example is to read fiction and take the time to stop and imagine as many details as you can from the books scenery. You may have to switch back and forth between imagining certain details, but try to switch back and forth, more and more rapidly until you're eventually seeing them at the same time.</p>
<p>As to the conceptual stuff, I get this too, but it usually comes in conjunction with visual imagery (not always). Actually the 'conceptual view' is so subtle that I sometimes wonder if everyone has it but most don't notice. </p>

<p>I wonder too. </p>
<p>Edit: To back up my imagery stuff, think of how an artist trains their eye to see, and an artist who needs to draw from memory will train their visual memory and capacity as well. At least some will, there are other methods, But I'd say the two above are the most useful by far. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that I could probably improve my visual imagery with more practice, but the conceptual view is so much quicker that it rarely seems worth the time to stop and try to form a mental image. I will sometimes stop and try to visualise part of a book, but most of the time I'm impatient to continue reading, and it doesn't seem worth the time to try to picture a character or scene when it doesn't impact my understanding of the story. I guess it's a bit like exercise, which I'm also too lazy to do most of the time :) </p>
<p>I'm also somewhat convinced that normal people use the conceptual view too, since it seems too essential for me to imagine someone missing it. It feela like a necessary part of consciousness, and while some people I've tried explaining it to say they don't experience it at all, that just makes me think I've either explained it poorly, or they're not actually conscious :) Some people I've explained it to have said they think they only use it when their mind is wandering, which I suppose would make sense if they're generally using visual or language based thought when consciously thinking something through. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm interested to hear about your experience. It's incredibly close to mine. I only learned about aphantasia recently, and realised that I'm probably on that end of the mental-visualisation scale.</p>
<p>I have very weak mental visualisations that are... fuzzy, I guess. Not much detail, and only in flashes like you said. Though I can remember where I've left things, even in an incredibly messy room, because I have a conceptual sense of the object and its surroundings, if that makes sense. I can't see it in my mind, but I'll know the sense of the size and type of the space and objects around it, how high up the surface is from the floor, things like that. I can remember the <em>shape</em> of things, but I can't visualise them well.</p>
<p>The one major difference between us is that I went to art college and  and then I studied industrial design, so I can draw quite well. Life drawing is easy, because I can eyeball sizes of things really well (like pick out the one 3mm drill bit in a box of loose drill bits kind of well), but drawing from imagination is something very different. Drawing, particularly design sketches, is kind of making a concept manifest rather than copying out what's visually in my head. I don't really <em>have</em> a visual in my head, but I have a concept of the way things work or fit together and I can translate that into a visual representation. But there's never really a picture in my head, you know? Or if there is, it's vague and fleeting. I reckon the drawing ability is just pure training and practice though. Not an inherent talent at all. It's just from spending a long time using drawing to visually dissect objects, and understanding how the concept goes back together through drawing as a result.</p>
<p>I have a very good conceptual memory. If I know a fact or understand a mechanism, it's stuck in there real good. I've shite experiential memory though. I'll often have vague or no recollection of things that I've experienced. I know that they happened, but I can't really remember them from a first-person perspective.</p>
<p>Funny you mention the idea of thinking in language and concepts rather than imagery at an early age. My mum told me I was speaking and reading at an exceptionally young age, so maybe that screwed up m'picture thinkbox.</p>
<p>Interesting to hear about someone who's in the same boat. Thanks for sharing!</p></div>		</li>

<p>A study has shown that people who are imagining visual stimuli (as opposed to actually seeing it) still show activation in their visual cortex.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A funny side note to this, is that this is similar to what happens to people with blindsight. In short, some people who are blind can still perceive objects. They can't for example see a chair, but they know (or rather, they are aware of) where it is, how it looks and everything. This is because the eyes still works, registering stimuli and processing it in the brain (the occipital lobe/visual cortex in the back of the head), sending that information to the executive parts of the brain. But there are certain parts of the pathways that don't work, which is the reason these people can't &quot;see&quot; (as in they aren't consciously aware of the objects in front of them). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a really good question. As /u/PureMitten said, there are different kinds of blindness. If we stick with the ones with blindsight, where the eyes still function and the brain registers what the eyes &quot;see&quot; but the person isn't aware of it, I can't answer that question. Sorry to disappoint... But it's a really interesting question. If these people can see the world through their dreams, that could tell us a lot about how our brains work and perhaps first and foremost help answering the question to what consciousness is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only some blind people's eyes work. It depends on the type of blindness, it can be that their eyes don't work to gather the information to perceive an image and/or that that information gets lost when the brain is trying to process it to understand the image. The causes of blindness can be fairly complicated and that's why some legally blind people can actually see some things.</p>
<p>My understanding of how completely blind people dream is that those who lost their sight when they were old enough to remember seeing can sometimes see in their dreams. Also that it's more frequent the older they were when they lost their sight and it becomes less common the longer they're blind. I have no idea if people who have always been completely blind due to a problem with processing visual information but who have functional eyes ever see in their dreams but I would suspect not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're curious but don't want to go through heaps of books, I'd actually recommend the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a> for blindsight. In general Wikipedia is a good introduction source for a lot of things concerning neuropsychology/neurobiology. You'll learn that this condition manifest itself in various ways. </p>
<p>Closely related topics could include various types of agnosia, like for example what could be called the opposite of blindsight: visual agnosia where a person can't make out stimuli presented to them. Or perhaps prosopagnosia, otherwise referred to as face blindness. You may (or may not) have heard of the case of &quot;The man who mistook his wife for a hat&quot; by Oliver Sacks, which probably is the most famous tale of a person with prosopagnosia. </p>
<p>But even a normal, functioning brain is extremely fascinating when it comes to sight (well, the brain is pretty cool in general). It's made up out of various areas (called V1, V2 etc. but this Wikipedia article is a bit unnecessary complicated imho). Each area has a different task in interpreting the stimuli sent from the eyes. One area decides for example shapes, another movement, another colours etc. Everything creates an image in the brain of what we're seeing (hence the expression &quot;we see with our brains, not our eyes&quot;). This information is then sent by two pathways to other parts of our brains to decide what we're seeing and where it's moving. There's suggestions of a third pathway that's supposed to decide if what we're seeing is biological or not, but that's still debated and seldom referred to. </p>
<p>I could probably for a long time about how cool the brain is. I'm going to stop now or this will be too long for anyone to read. But I'd happily answer questions if I can. Otherwise, Wikipedia is a usually a good start here. It's one part of Wikipedia you usually can rely on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP.  But have aphantasia. I can't picture my mom at all. I can tell you facts about her image. (She has long, curly brown hair, she's 5'8, etc.) But I can't tell you what she looks like. Even if I had artistic skills, I couldn't draw a picture that would resemble her.</p>
<p>My brain processes things in words. Like, you tell me to picture a beach. It's like going down a check list. &quot;Beaches have sand. I've seen sand before. It's usually a yellowish shade. Water. They've got that. Often blue, occasionally more green or gray. There could be a life guard station. Or maybe people.&quot; Listening to me describe a beach is a lot like listening to someone who's never been to one try and explain it. </p>
<p>I don't see things, but I know what things look like, if that makes sense. Someone else mentioned picturing an orange. I'd know it if I saw it, I know it's orange and spherical, but otherwise, I've got nothing.</p>
<p>But I dream in images. I can't actually recall if they're in color. But they've been real and vivid enough to make my cry in my sleep.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: When I think of or imagine something it's just factual. Like I know the layout of a room, but there's no image of that room. If I tried to describe my mother to a sketch artist I might be able to find the words, but it would just be words. I think that's a more direct answer to your question.</p></div>		</li>
