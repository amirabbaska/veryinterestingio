			<div class="markdown"><p>The other method /u/heckruler points out below... The former is called the solar (or tropical) year, and the latter (using other stars as reference points) is called the sidereal year.  The results differ by about 20 minutes because of precession, or the torque exerted on one gravitational mass spinning on its axis in an orbit around another gravitational mass spinning on its own axis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the difference not because a solar day is longer than a sidereal day, because for the former the Earth has to rotate 361 degrees, and for the latter only 360 degrees?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you imagine orbiting around an object in your yard while also slowly spinning you can picture the actual reason; because you also moved while you were spinning the object comes to be in front of you earlier (or later) than if you were just spinning in one spot</p>
<p>Because of the distance between us and the stars relative to us and the sun, you won't get that minor inaccuracy with a sidereal measurement </p></div>		</li>

<p>If you find a repeat of the noon reading, then you've completed one year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may be definitionally correct, but it doesn't really answer OP's question.</p>
<p>The method described above is sufficient for determining the length of a tropical year, the length of time it takes for the earth to return to the same orientation relative to the sun itself.  The seasons are governed by the cycle of the tropical year.</p>
<p>However, the earth itself precesses about it's axis.  This slow rotation means that the specific time when the sun is in the same place in the sky actually is a little bit less than the time needed to complete a full orbital rotation.</p>
<p>The actual time needed to complete an orbit is referred to as the sidereal year, and is roughly 20 minutes longer.</p>
<p>This disparity was discovered in antiquity when astronomers realized that the equinoxes and solstices appeared to move relative to the stars.  Solar noon on those days occurred before the sun had returned to the same position relative to the background stars.</p>
<p>To answer OP's question, we know the earth has completed a full orbit when the position of the sun relative to the background stars has completed a full cycle.</p></div>		</li>
