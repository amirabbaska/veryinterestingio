			<div class="markdown"><p>Good lord old school hand drawn animation looked like it was a horribly tedious process.  Now I want to know how those camera operators and animators kept their sanity after drawing / filming Mickey 9000 times in ever so slightly different ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Animators would draw &quot;key-frames&quot; (The extreme poses of a run cycle or a jump, for example).  They hired &quot;In-betweeners&quot; to draw the smaller motions between key-frames.  Some animators could have 5 or 6 In-betweeners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well all of this certainly explains why animation was so expensive back in the day.  It sounds like you needed a crew about the size of a feature production to get 30 minutes of high quality animation on a TV schedule </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The process is still fairly common place, you have straight head animation or pose by pose, where you’ll block out your key poses first and then in between. Similar process for 2D, 3D etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the question is why weren't more efforts made to match the moving item with the background images if they're meant to be similar objects, e.g. rocks?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the studio, Ghibli is excellent for making sure the entire palette matches.</p>
<p>Also we see it less now days because you either share the digital palette or use the image program loupe tool to analyse the background and key imagery for colour for you to match to</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual animation itself in Ghibli is often poor as a consequence, you don’t really get those smooth, flowing movements. </p>
<p>The trade off of course is the detail they’ll put into every aspect of each frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They could do that before hand too. I posted the reason why colours didn't match in another post. Basically it's not that they couldn't share colours, its that the background layers in cel-shaded productions had to account for layers of transparent film.</p>
<p>Basically, to be the same colour, the background has to be very precisely <em>lighter</em> than the foreground layers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What happened is that they were, originally, all the same colour and matched, but the sheets of transparent film that each of the moving pieces was on ever so slightly darkens the background. </p>
<p>Take Scooby-Doo, they could potentially have 5 characters + one or two monsters + various debris and each item has it's own layer and potentially limbs and clothing items (like a mask or held item) would have it's own layer. Nothing is 100% transparent, so all those layers add up to make the background darker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's several factors here. It's one part a trade off between having the object in question generally match with the background or generally match the animation frames. Since the animation frames are the primary focus it's better that the object matches with them over the background. Imagine cell shaded Mickey interacting with an acrylic painted rock and you can sort of see the oddity behind it.</p>
<p>There's also who was in charge of making that object. If the background artist did it it would look nicer on the account that they could have spent more time and focus towards it. If it's done by the animators then they wouldn't want to waste precious time making the rock looks nice when their focus would be more on making the overall animation flow. It's the same reason why they don't use blending techniques where applying shadow to the characters.</p>
<p>Finally this type of shortcut was the result of the early days of animation. Things were still being figured out and there were constant attempts to improve but deadlines and underfunding got in the way. Nowadays we don't see this type of method used because we're at a stage where technology and management prevent its need.</p></div>		</li>
