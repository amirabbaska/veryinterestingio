I wonder if microbe replacement therapy is going to become the next trend in dieting...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be interested in hearing more. Starting weight, ending weight, what were your meals, how many meals, did you track calories, any exercise, what resources did you use, etc?</p>
<p>Ive been dieting for a few years now, focusing on calorie restriction, net calories, and exercise. I had to take off 2015 due to a shoulder injury and gained some back (was ~123 down before, the ~60 down, now ~80 down). The injury though made me think more about what my exercise regimes do to my joints given my size, so I've been thinking about tinkering with the diet side of the equation again.</p></div>		</li>
