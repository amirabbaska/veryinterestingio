			<div class="markdown"><p>I read (on reddit though) just a little while ago that beavers are driven to build dams cause they don't like the sound of running water. They are driven by their need to silence the water noise and end up building a perfect habitat for themselves in the process. Nature is amazing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to imagine that it's a compulsive behavior.  Like some people are compulsive about counting.  Some ants were compulsive about digging.  Those ants bred, and now all ants compulsively dig.  They don't understand it, but they do it as a form of mental-problem-turned-survival</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, people tend to not think of themselves as animals but we all have compulsive behaviors and impulses that makes us do complicated thing. The most obvious is the desire to have sex. We don't learn that shit, we just find people hot and want to do <em>things</em> to them. There is also the desire to be around other people. It varies from person to person but usually someone gets sad when they do not have any sort of human contact at all.</p>
<p>We refine our behaviors based on what we are compelled to do, but it is that initial compulsion that forces us to do these complex things. They are our basic instincts. Things suck as mental illnesses, or deviations from the norm that detract from your quality of life, are just a result of genetic mutations that make evolution possible.</p>
<p>Going back to birds, they have a compulsion to build a nest. To them it just feels fucking good to do it. Kinda like how to humans making friends feels good.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I hear that the slightest change in ant DNA will show profound colony wide behavior alterations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brains of small insects are so small and simple that, I imagine, observational learning is impossible.</p>
<p>I am not a scientist, but I do remember reading about a scientist who was studying the nest building behavior of a particular insect and the insect had a very particular order of putting the nest together, like first do X then Y then Z.</p>
<p>The scientist waited for the insect to do X, then Y and then the scientists &quot;undid&quot; Y. The insect would then redo Y, at which point the scientist would undo Y again. The insect would then redo Y, at which the point the scientist would undo Y again. In short, the scientist undid Y like 50 some times and every single time the insect just repeated Y, never learning from observation that Y keeps getting undone when he does it the same way every time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ants aren't really capable of observing in that level.  They can react to chemicals on the ground, and they have built-in behaviors that they're born with.  The rest is all programmed in how their neurons connect, which follows a pattern specified in their dna.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, there could have been a short lived evolutionary branch of birds who did build square nests.</p>
<p>If so, they probably died out because the bird had to spend more energy building them (hence need more nutrition), had to be more selective about building materials, square nests of the same size could hold fewer eggs, and were a tiny bit more likely to break in the corners. </p></div>		</li>
