			<p>&quot;Knowledge&quot; isn't necessarily the most accurate word for this scenario - it just helps us think about the broad concept.<br><br>In many cases, what we think of as knowledge (especially instinctual knowledge in other animals) is just a programmed, automatic response. When your doctor strikes your patellar ligament with a hammer, your body involuntarily causes your leg to kick out. Well, just as certain stimuli can trigger certain involuntary physical responses (kicking your leg out, pupils dilating in response to light levels, screaming in response to a sudden danger), information can trigger your mind to engage in certain behaviors and thought processes. The thing is, there isn't any real difference between a physical stimulus, like a force to a ligament, which causes an involuntary movement and the knowledge that shelter can protect us from many forms of harm, which causes a person (or ant) to build or purchase a sturdy house. Both are just kinds of information processed in different ways.<br><br>It's important to remember what a gene really is, in the physical sense.<br><br>Genes are just sequences of amino acids.<br><br>Genes code for proteins.<br><br>Proteins are physical objects that have different structures (and thus different properties) depending on the sequences of amino acids within them.<br><br>Proteins form cells. The type of cell being dependent on the sequence of amino acids.<br><br>Some of these cells become neurons. <br><br>Neurons respond to stimuli and send signals (waves of electrical depolarization) to each other to relay information from one body system (central nervous system) to another (muscular, for example).<br><br>When many, many neurons are firing, complex thoughts and behaviors can arise.<br><br>Our brains contain 86 billion neurons. <br><br>We are also taking in astronomical amounts of environmental information at all moments of our lives. Subtle differences in temperature, light, noise, smell, and physical contact over every square inch of our bodies and within them. We have also developed powerful brains which allow us to recall huge amounts of information from the past as well as to anticipate events which will occur in the future. <br><br>All of this information + huge numbers of neurons = immensely complex thoughts and behaviors. But to say that knowledge of innate behaviors is somehow stored, like physical coins in a piggy bank, isn't really accurate. Rather, our neurons, which are made of proteins, which are coded for by our genes, respond in consistent, particular ways to particular stimuli.<br><br>So when an ant or a colony of ants finds themselves without shelter (information), a particular chain reaction of sorts occurs in their neurons (not that dissimilar from a physical chain reaction of dominos falling over) which causes them to engage in certain complex behaviors necessary for constructing a shelter and rearing young. If their nervous systems are developed in such a way that they are efficient and smart nest-builders, they may reproduce and generate more ants that are as good, and potentially better, at building nests. But if something goes wrong, if one of the dominos in their nervous systems isn't quite in place, they might not be successful nest-builders and a particular colony might not produce any descendants. After this process of natural selection has occurred for a few hundred million years, everyone generally has got their dominos in order, which is why members of species are generally capable of the same complex behaviors.<br><br>I hope this makes sense. I am not an expert in any way on neurology, so feel free to correct or improve upon anything I've said.</p>		</li>

			<p>Solid answer! Follow up question and maybe you answered it and I'm just dense. Can you help me understand the difference between me or a monkey grabbing a stick to get ants out of their homes, versus compulsively grabbing garbage to build a nest? <br><br>I saw this thing where a bird grabbed a bunch of trash and put it out near a hiding spot. Beatles would come and feed, along with various other insects, and the bird had a buffet. I feel that type of behavior is more intentional than reactionary. That bird had to have an understanding of insect behavior enough to know they like trash, which would suggest a presence of mind to differentiate it from them. <br><br>Maybe with birds it's just understood that eggs need a safe place and a female bird won't come to you unless you have a sweet pad built. You can see this behavior in birds of paradise. They'll go and clean, dust, and compulsively and meticulously inspect every square inch just to make sure it's in perfect shape because they know the female will pass them up for the other bird with the sweet nest. <br><br>I can understand the knee jerk reaction for ants. There's probably a chemical that gets released that feels good whenever they place one piece of dirt next to the other until a shelter is built, but ants are strange as it is. They're also capable of complex action and behave as one giant disjointed organism in a lot of ways. <br><br>Difficult to wrap my head around. </p>		</li>

			<p>So, the patterns for any action are in the genes...which provide the code for the amino acids, which provide the code for the proteins, which make the cells, which make the neurons that do the stuff. If something wasn't programmed in the genes none of the complex behaviours that follow would occur, no? Therefore, action is, at some level, programmed in the genes, no? My take: We're getting caught up in language games here. Reality is beyond us. </p>		</li>

			<p>It's more accurate to say <del>knowledge</del> instincts are <del>stored in</del> affected by genes.<br><br>Genes affect how cells develop and behave. Some of the genes affect how the brain develops. Change some of those genes, and it changes how the brain gets wired up, changing instinctual behaviours.</p>		</li>

			<p>That wasn't the best way of phrasing it. Birds have the intellectual capability to realize that they should build some kind of shelter for their eggs and use materials that they have to do so. Humans are programmed with the capability to do multiplication. How to do multiplication isn't in our genes, we have to learn it, but the capability to do so is in our genes. That's what I understood that to mean at least.</p>		</li>

			<p>We don't know that, but it's the same way a baby knows where to get milk, and how animals and we know that we can 'grab' things, that we can move, etc<br><br></p>		</li>
