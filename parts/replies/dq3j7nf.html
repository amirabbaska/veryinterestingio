			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's not right. The external observer will never see the person fall inside the event horizon. It will seem like that person is stuck near the edge. </p>
<p>And if the person falling in would see the entire life of the universe go by, it would happen in an instant from his perspective. Although I'm not sure that last part actually happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aslo not true, the person falling in would appear stuck and begin to appear more and more red-shifted until he fades away, he wont appear forever stuck at the horizon as there is nothing actually there for photons to bounce off of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The person falling in would not see the entire life of the universe go by at all.  That is only true if he is hovering at the horizon accelerating at near infinite rate.  You would see the same thing if you accelerated at the same rate no where near a black hole.  </p>
<p>A freely falling observer would see nothing special at the event horizon of a supermassive black hole.  Near a steller mass black hole it doesn't matter as you are spagettified long long before you get near the event horizon.</p></div>		</li>
