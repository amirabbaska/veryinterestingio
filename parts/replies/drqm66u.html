			<div class="markdown"><p>That chapter is attempting to say that the turbine blades would fail at 4-6% under speed which just doesn’t happen in the real world.  To really a crappy source. </p>
<p>Turbine stages are constantly facing an alternating stress as the blade passes between nozzles. Basically the ratio of this stress to the allowable stress is called a Goodman factor (GF) GF&gt;1 means you can run that blade for ever. </p>
<p>Simplistically  turbine designers fudge the GF to account for unknown stresses.  So in the first stage they may want a GF of say 5. Where in the middle of the turbine where things are more constant they are ok with 1.25. </p>
<p>Each blade has natural frequencies and when Those frequencies (or multiples of them) are in the operating range they add to the stress the blade see, so the GF may need to be increased. </p>
<p>The goal of making the turbines lower cost and more efficient pushes designers to remove this fudge and push things further. </p>
<p>If you ever want to see robust turbines you go to the petrochemical industry. API 612 turbines run un-spared doing viable speed drive at the heart of the largest plants in the world powers aren’t as large as in power gen (100,000HP considered very large) but their wide operating speed range (75-105%) makes for much tougher challenges.  Most new eythlene crackers are running steam pressures and temperatures similar to power gen. </p></div>		</li>

&quot;Skipping&quot; over the identified frequencies you should avoid. Essentially spending less time at or near those frequencies was my understanding way back.
Perhaps it's different now.
It's about minimization. </p></div>		</li>
