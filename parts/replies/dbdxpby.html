			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, in 2015 Americans ate 62.3 lb broiler chicken per capita compared to only 51.5 lb beef. So chicken has been ahead since at least 2012.

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's good to hear, because <a href="http://www.greeneatz.com/foods-carbon-footprint.html" target="_blank">according to at least one article I've seen</a>, the carbon footprint of beef is almost 4 times that of chicken. To raise, process, and ship one kg of beef, the carbon footprint is roughly equivalent to driving a car 63 miles, while one kg of chicken is equivalent to 16 miles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Emissions per kilo of food is one thing. Emissions per calorie, or per gram of protein is another. </p>
<p>For instance, beef has roughly 25% more calories, 20% more salt, and 80% the potassium than the same amount of chicken.  While beef has about 20% less protein, it has about 150% more fat and some fat is good for you (unless you are actively trying to lose weight).</p>
<p>Adjusting for calories (vs kilo of food which really is a silly metric to use), all the numbers in that table shift quite a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's bitter sweet. Cattle are treated better than chickens. I don't want to start sounding like a vegan but; small cages, packed tightly, bred so fat they can't walk, genetically mutated for fat legs blah blah blah you get the point.</p>
<p>If we're going to eat more chicken there needs to be a greater push for better treatment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just calculated my intake and it's close to 80 pounds annually. And I only eat 1200 calories a day, 8 oz of chicken per meal, 3 meals per week. I can imagine someone who eats a lot more chicken a lot more often topping out pretty high up there.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the inflation of that figure at least somewhat driven by immigration over the years? Chicken is quite a common meat in the East; in some countries much more than beef.</p></div>		</li>
