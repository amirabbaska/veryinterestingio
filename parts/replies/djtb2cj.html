			<div class="markdown"><p>Same for walking. You don't even have to think &quot;walk&quot; actively all the time, you can think about something else and you continue walking as long as there is no obstacle. The downside: If a path is too familiar, you might follow it even if you want to go somewhere else.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We don't have to think, right foot, left foot, right foot to walk. It just happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>walking is so much more complex than that.  It's an amazing balancing act involving nearly your entire body.</p>
<p>That's why it's so hard to get a bipedal robot -- even now they still are rather clumsy and have very non-organic motions even though we've made great progress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always find it interesting that there are things we can do on full auto-pilot like walking and breathing but that we can force full control of too. Like, if I want I <em>can</em> think about left, right, left foot. Yet there are also things that our bodies do on auto-pilot with no such control. For example I'm having the hardest time trying to get my heart to beat differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there neurotransmitters that regulate both conscious and unconscious movements?  What neurotransmitter can play both roles?  Is there anything known about differences in proteins and receptor sites between conscious and unconscious action?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question! When you consciously lift your foot, it activates the same motor neurons as when you unconsciously lift your foot while walking. The difference lies in the upstream neural circuit. I wish I knew more about this! Sorry!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. The instructions never change. The hardware itself does. Think of the conscious thought process as a slow and inefficient but very flexible CPU, while muscle memory a small, efficient and fast, but single-purpose FPGA. </p>
<p>Learning a motor skill in this case would be like gradually rewriting a naive high-level algorithm into a hardware descriptor language that reconfigures the physical layout of the gates.</p>
<p>Point is, doing a skill for the first time is like running in software emulated mode. Learning a motor skill is porting it to run natively on low-level purpose-built hardware. </p></div>		</li>
