			<div class="markdown"><p>I credit the lightweight interface. Reddit was going 180 degrees the opposite direction of other forums that were just adding feature on top of feature. I can't remember for sure but I'm not sure if the comments were even threaded very early on.</p>
<p>Even today the interface remains light and easy to use. It's why 500 comment threads open quickly and without the baggage of flash or a shitload of javascript. In fact maybe they use no javascript, I know for a long time reddit worked even with noscript turned on.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Huffman’s plan for the new funding includes a redesign of reddit.com — the company is literally re-writing all of its code, some of which is more than a decade old. An early version of the new design, which we saw during our interview, looks similar to Facebook’s News Feed or Twitter’s Timeline: A never-ending feed of content broken up into “cards” with more visuals to lure people into the conversations hidden underneath.</p>
<p>“We want Reddit to be more visually appealing,” he explained, “so when new users come to Reddit they have a better sense of what’s there, what it’s for.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt it. Reddit has shown great reluctance over the years to make <em>major</em> changes to the site. In particular the &quot;look and feel&quot; has been virtually unchanged for a really long time.</p>
<p>Further, there isn't a whole lot of reason to change something that's working. Reddit has become one of the biggest websites in the world. They have proven beyond any doubt that you DON'T need a bunch of fancy bullshit to make a forum site popular.</p>
<p>Keep the interface out of the way and make it about content. That's what they did early on and they are still doing in now. In fact, they specifically avoided the temptation that forums usually fall into of adding feature after feature and continuously tweaking the colors and graphics until it's a bloated mess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm okay with them changing it.  When I first started using it, I hated the look because it looked so.. old?</p>
<p>I love the websites look now that I'm used to it because it really is light, but I prefer using mobile apps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like how you don't have to wade through shitty signatures that take up more space than the actual content of internet forums.  Whoever thought it was a good idea to allow gifs in signature blocks of forums should be shot.  I appreciate that Reddit doesn't have any signatures, just small flair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They use JavaScript for their &quot;locked thread&quot; modals and various other things (when you delete a post, post a comment etc.) </p>
<p>They use async sparingly and don't have hundreds of complex animations to make the site look more &quot;fluid&quot; which in relaity just slows down the site.</p></div>		</li>
