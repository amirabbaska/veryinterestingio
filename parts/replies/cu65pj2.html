			<div class="markdown"><p>A better way to think of light travelling &quot;up&quot; a gravitational well:</p>
<p>When you go &quot;up&quot; in height, you lose momentum. For massive things, this means losing speed. For massless things, this means losing overall energy, while maintaining speed = c. So for light, as it &quot;climbs up a gravitational well&quot; it loses energy, red shifting down from its initial emitted wavelength. In a black hole, it would red-shift its energy completely away to zero. And with no energy, it can't be meaningfully said to exist. </p>
<p>Note, this isn't a precise truth, but just a useful &quot;way of thinking about things.&quot; The reality is more to do with disagreeing with how one measures lengths and times. Inside a black hole, the &quot;direction&quot; of all <em>future</em> times is toward the center of the black hole. So light can only move toward the center of the black hole, because there's no &quot;future&quot; outside of it. This is why we call it an &quot;event horizon.&quot; 'Events' in space-time are like 'points' in space. A specific location in both space and time is an 'event.' Inside a black hole, there is a horizon for which no events exist. There is no future event that occurs &quot;outside&quot; of the black hole. All of the futures point &quot;inward&quot; toward the center.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems to be the exact inverse of the overall universe where all things radiate out from a central point(the big bang) toward infinity (heat death). </p>
<p>Is there any significance to that?  </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is actually a common misconception about the big bang. There is no central point to the big bang. It happened <em>everywhere</em> in the universe at once, approximately uniformly. You've probably seen animations of like, a single point &quot;exploding&quot; into the universe. Totally not how the science actually goes though.</p>
<p>We know that early on, the universe is very very dense. It may be a single point, or it may be a finite volume of high energy density, or it may be an infinite volume of high energy density. If it's finite, it's finite in a way that it has no boundaries, no edges. Then, the big bang happens and throughout the volume, finite or infinite, a lot of space is added very very quickly, and then continues to be added more slowly over time. </p>
<p>Now it looks like, but is really hard to prove, that the universe was infinite then and is infinite in size now. Our observable universe is just one small subvolume in the whole.</p>
<hr />
<p>Anyway, you are correct, there are some parallels to metric expansion and a black hole. The oversimplified version is where you imagine an expanding universe with only a single black hole in it. There will exist an event horizon where you can't see anything that happens within the black hole... and another event horizon where the events are expanding away from you faster than light, so you'll never be able to observe them either. Your observable universe is this &quot;bubble&quot; with another &quot;bubble&quot; cut out of it. (on a technical note, this is referred to as a Schwarzschild-deSitter metric, if I'm not mistaken)</p></div>		</li>
