			<div class="markdown"><p>A tax deduction is mathematically equivalent to the government subsidizing what you are funding. </p>
<p>There's no difference between you donating $100 and not having to pay a tax of $30 on that income verses you donating $100, paying the tax of $30, and the government adding an extra $30 to your donation.</p>
<p>Essentially it means you can decide how money that would otherwise be used by the government is spent. There are limits in that the recipient organization has to be a charity, but that still gives you very broad discretion. You can fund things like churches, horse racing fields, or opera houses that would not be funded at that level by the government, if at all, as they are not high public priorities.</p>
<p>For example, if you donated $100 to an opera house but still had to pay the $30 tax on that income, probably less than 1% of it would go to fine arts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, this. In effect British laws are written with the same concept in mind. Supposedly the subsidies are in general socially beneficial and in the past this has generally been the case, yet lately there have been quite a few dodgy schemes where a government connection would &quot;subsidise&quot; a narrow interest in just this fashion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this is a good point. if I had $100k in stock with 0 Basis. Bought apple back in 1990....</p>
<p>I sell it I get to keep let's say $60k after taxes.  But if I donate I get a write off on my taxes that might be worth $50k. So
It cost me $10k to put $100k in my private foundation....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do the stocks you're donating still keep their cost basis? That is, does the recipient charity pay any of the taxes on selling them?</p>
<p>When you donate the stock to your donor advised fund, does it get sold then and there, or does it stick around as appreciated stock until you actually donate to a charity? If the latter, what if the value of the stock goes down in the meantime?</p></div>		</li>

<p>the cost basis becomes a non-thing because the charity doesn't pay taxes at all.  If the stock has a value of $100 at the time you donate it, that is your fair market value assessment of the asset (this can be much tricker for things that aren't part of a well established, efficient market, or things that are one-offs (art).  It is <em>very</em> possible (and common) to assess the value of these sorts of things &quot;generously&quot;.  And...there has been some real crack-down on that sort of thing in recent years.</p>
</li>
<li>Donor advised funds typically only take things that are liquid and uncontroversial.  They will liquidate as soon as they can, generally speaking, but they will take illiquid items (for example, private company stock is illiquid, but they'll generally accept it if you can provide a trustworthy value).  A donor advised fund will generally keep you in-line with regards to the IRS as well because they are a single non-profit entity taking donations from a gazillion different people and don't want their status questioned because one individual wants to play it fast and loose.  So...they TEND to focus on liquid, public-market assets.  The private foundation route is much more flexible but comes with higher costs to maintain, more liabilities and more likelihood of close IRS inspection.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the event that the stock goes down after donation, but before the liquidation by the fund, then...it doesn't matter.  That happens.  It's the value at the time of donation.  This is especially challenging for private stock - e.g. I start a company and it's doing great and a donate some shares and then next year it tanks before my company can go public or get acquired or whatever and the stock is essentially just paper.  If you could reasonably <em>know</em> that this was the fate of the company then you'd have gamed the system and you'd likely get in trouble.  For this reason many donor advised funds don't take private company stock unless your trajectory is pretty clear and a matter of near public record (e.g. you could donate airbnb stock with a fair market value that was credible at the time of donation, but they might not accept myCompanyZ stock because there is nothing to substantiate the value of said stock.  Ultimately it's the managers of the donor advised that make the call!</p></div>		</li>
