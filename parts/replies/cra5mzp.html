			<div class="markdown"><p>The Colosseum has been quarried for a long time and most people stealing the stone did not care enough or appreciate disturbing the structural integrity of the building. Also, there has been major earthquakes in and around Rome since the Romans built it. So the government there has been forced to reinforce a lot of the Roman architecture. However, Without the pillaging most of it would be intact even with earthquakes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most of the destruction did only happen in the last 600 years. Mostly because noone really build anything big in Rome during the medieval times. The papacy wasn't even there a lot of the time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wasn't that also the fate of the pyramids? I dimly recall they originally had an outer layer of brilliant white limestone but that was stripped over the centuries. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pyramids were quarried, too.  The sides used to be flat, not stepped like they are today.   Not all of that is due to erosion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya, some buildings in Rome are known to be built with that marble, although I forget which ones.  The Colosseum was nicer than most stadiums today.  It had tones of marble, it held around 50,000 people, and it had a retractable canvas roof to keep the sun off people.  They also let people in for free and gave everyone a voucher for one free wine.  Now we have the Astrodome, $70 tickets, and $10 beers.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So we can still see it today. The Romans were so disgusted by the end of neros reign they buried his palatial estate and built over it. He built it after the great fire that some people think he had a hand in to take over large portions of inner city Rome. </p></div>		</li>
