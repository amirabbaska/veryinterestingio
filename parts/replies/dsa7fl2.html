			<div class="markdown"><p>The last part of your comment, about how we adore dogs because of their lack of sophisticated emotions, really just clicked for me. I’ve often said I like dogs better than people because they are truly innocent. Innocent in the sense that yea they may shit on your floor, or bite a little too hard while playing, but there is no premeditation, there is no malice.  Dogs don’t don’t hold grudges. It never dawned on me that part of the reason for that is they don’t have the complex emotions to create the motivation for such things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also dogs have been reproducing for 20-50 thousand years based on how much humans favor them. Dogs that we bond with the most have been more successful, including how much oxytocin they trigger in their masters brains, and how much value they bring to the human hunt, how much security they provide to humans and their livestock etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if a dog can remember doing something bad and feel guilt over it. I wonder how important language is for the formation of memories and the emotions that get attached to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This one is complicated because we don't know if dogs actually feel bad about the things they do wrong. It's possible that they have guilty mannerisms because of positive reinforcement. They simply understand that we do not like certain behaviors and/or find them acceptable, which is understandable in a social animal.</p>
<p>For example:
My dog once brought me something of mine she had destroyed and dropped it, then put her head down and flopped her ears back like she does when she's in trouble.</p>
<p>I would like to believe:</p>
<ul>
<li>She understands she has done something bad.</li>
<li>She regrets having done the bad thing and is now apologizing for having lost control.</li>
<li>She is a good dog.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I also except may be reality:</p>
<ul>
<li>She wanted attention and/or affection and has formed the connection between behaving that way and me giving her attention after, usually involving some sort of a hug or pet and an, &quot;it's ok. I can buy another.&quot;</li>
<li>She has made the association between behaving guilty early and getting caught and has realized that if she owns up to what she's done wrong, her punishment is milder and I get less upset.</li>
<li>She is still a good dog.</li>
</ul>
<p>P.S. I do not abuse my dog. Her punishments mostly involve timeouts of various lengths where she lays in a corner away from other people and animals, sometimes while I emit a string of vulgarities over whatever she's done into the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The guilt thing has been disproven. They do not feel guilt, they just act like it. </p>
<p>And yes there is a difference, ask me or a psychopath. </p></div>		</li>
