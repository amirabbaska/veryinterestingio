			<div class="markdown"><p>While it is true that the brain can tell when two notes aren't &quot;aligned&quot; properly, I would argue knowing that this is &quot;off-key&quot; is mainly cultural. My reasoning is that the modern standard of tuning instruments is what's known as <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament" target="_blank">equal temperament</a></em>, which is in fact ever-so-slightly not in perfect tune (because it's actually impossible for certain instruments to be in absolutely perfect tune, for mathematical reasons; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2j8lbu/eli5_why_are_pianos_never_actually_in_tune/cl9d6uu/" target="_blank">see here</a>). And while I can hear the difference between equal temperament and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation" target="_blank">pure intonation</a></em> (the original system that's based on aligning frequencies exactly in a nice pattern) when played together, there's a cultural aspect that's primed me to feel that equal temperament is the one that's in tune and not pure intonation.</p>
<p>Also, I think some musician called Schoenberg once conjectured that if children grew up listening to dissonant music, they would end up finding the dissonant music on-key. He did create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique" target="_blank">a technique for composing such music</a>, but it never caught on in mainstream music to the point where his conjecture could be tested.</p>
<p>So in summary: Your brain can hear when a note is off-key because its soundwaves don't fit together well with other soundwaves; however, slightly-off-key notes are used so much in modern music that our brain's primed to think that those notes are in fact on-key. This suggests that some element of &quot;off-key-ness&quot; is acquired.</p></div>		</li>
