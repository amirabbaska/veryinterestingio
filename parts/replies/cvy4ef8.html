<p>I used to get them terrible in my traps, started using a lacrosse ball to roll them out... such a good feeling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used a golf ball that was lying around the office lounge and put it between my tense shoulder and the wall and leaned on it until I wanted to scream, and then leaned on it some more. That was about 10 minutes. I had to repeat it a half hour later. But, then the pain went away. A beautiful thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try using a tennis ball / softball / bouncy balls...bouncy balls work wonder on your feet...sit in your chair, shoes off and roll the ball under your foot. </p>
<p>Also if you shoulders are tight when you lean against the wall try doing a shoulder stretch when rubbing that ball on the shoulder. This opens up the shoulder blade and gets to some really sore muscles. I do a lot of computer work so I have several stretches and tricks I do that when others do them they whimper because they never realized how sore they are....I probably should put them on the web for others...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you suggesting I can slap electrodes on myself and achieve the same results I'd get by flopping around on the floor over a large foam roller? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. This book kinda saved my life. Not a shill for the book, just a major fan of the idea that you can treat yourself instead of going to some high-rent practitioner who probably doesn't know what they're doing.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't easy to find someone who knew what they were doing, but I did finally find someone (someone who did physical therapy and pilates) and that was invaluable for me.</p>
<p>It's true that it's hard to find someone who's good vs the many people who want a paycheck but are not, but personally I regret spending so much time trying to cheap out on it.</p></div>		</li>
