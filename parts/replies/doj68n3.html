			<div class="markdown"><p>usually just IEEE double precision tho. completely rational finite set of numbers.. that doesn't include 1/10th. well, maybe not THAT rational.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Computers certainly can calculate irrational numbers exactly. For example, if you use Mathematica to calculate the square root of 2, it will output the exact result (which is of course &quot;square root of 2&quot;). It does that symbolically. If you want to compute the decimal expansion, then of course you can only get an approximation. Which has nothing to do with computers really, seeing as nothing else can do any better.</p>
<p>Even when it comes to non-symbolic representations of numbers, computers are not inherently limited in their precision. The limitations are only based on available memory and processing power. The relatively limited floating point representation that is built into the processors is how things are usually done (when integers are not sufficient), because it is very efficient and has good enough precision for most purposes. But there are other ways to handle numbers, which can sacrifice memory and performance for increased precision (or make other trade-offs).</p></div>		</li>
