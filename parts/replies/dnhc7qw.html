			<div class="markdown"><p>Those numbers are the actual preterm births, not the rates.  From your link, here are the rates per 100 live births:</p>
<pre><code>Malawi: 18.1 per 100
Comoros: 16.7
Congo: 16.7
Zimbabwe: 16.6
Equatorial Guinea: 16.5
Mozambique: 16.4
Gabon: 16.3
Pakistan: 15.8
Indonesia: 15.5
Mauritania: 15.4</code></pre></div>		</li>

<p>So where do industrialized countries like USA Canada and Europe fall ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The number of preterm births is highly correlated to the size of the population and the number of births. The rate would be more useful. Here it is (% of live births) :</p>
<p>India 13.0%,
China 7.1%,
Nigeria 12.2%,
Pakistan 15.8%,
Indonesia 15.5%,
USA12.0%,
Bangladesh 14.0%,
Philippines 14.9%,
DRC 11.9%
Brazil 9.2%</p>
<p>So the USA numbers are even worse in this context imo. The causes for the USA's poor performance in terms of maternal and perinatal health, not limited to preterm births, are thought to be a mix of poor/inequal access to health care (insufficient prenatal preventative care) and maternal health issues (heart disease, diabetes, hypertension).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Most C sections in the USA are a result of medical intervention and not scheduled for convenience as people may think. Now in some countries this is different. According to Emily Oster, in Brazil the rate of c section is around 80% and those are scheduled for convenience. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is more accurate to attribute our high cesarean rate to our overuse of other interventions. People may not schedule a cesarean for convenience, but it is very common to schedule an induction at 39 or 40 weeks. If the body isn't ready, then it can take days for progress to be made. Most hospitals won't let mothers eat food during this process, so they are starving when expected to engaged in the marathon of good bing birth. After artificially softening the cervix and dilating the cervix to 4-5cm with a foley bulb, they have to start pitocin if mom isn't having regular contractions. Pitocin may cause more intense and painful contractions which leads to use of an epidural. Epidurals can slow labor down which leads to higher doses of pitocin.  The unnaturally strong contractions caused by pitocin can lead to fetal distress. Distressed baby means c-section. Or mom can't push effectively because she can't feel her body or the baby, so she pushes until she is exhausted (keep in mind she is also starving) and then has a cesarean. Even moms who go into labor spontaneously are often given pitocin to speed things up in many hospitals. </p>
<p>According to WHO the caesarean rate should be around 11% to account for cases where surgery is safer for mom and baby than letting nature take its course. The rate in the US is 34% last I checked. So, the majority of caesarean births in our country should not be necessary! </p>
<p>For full disclosure - I had a totally unmedicated birth with my first who was born at 42 weeks. My second was born at 42+1 and I chose to get a little pitocin to get things going (3 hours later she was born - it was a wild ride). I was already 5cm, but not having regular, strong ctx. I'm a childbirth educator, so I was making an informed decision after weighing the risks of going much further past 42 weeks. I think a lot of moms are treated as passive recipients of care instead of partners and get caught in this cascade of interventions that lead to major surgery instead of the vaginal birth they planned. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely rather mild of course - itâ€™ll allow a few babies that might have never got delivered happily to survive but an awful lot of the C section births would have been fine normally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible but I don't know of any study to that effect. Currently,  the risk from C-section comes only <em>after</em> the mother has had one. While this <em>could</em> have an evolutionary impact long term, right now all we can say is that increased risk of a preterm birth is a facultative effect produced by a prior c-section.</p></div>		</li>
