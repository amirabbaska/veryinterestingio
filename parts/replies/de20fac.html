			<div class="markdown"><p>Because hair growth is determined by genetics, the only thing you can do is try to minimize damage. If you've tried growing it out and its still patchy, I hate to say it but thats just how it is at the moment. You could <em>maybe</em> try taking some multivitamins and making sure that your hormones and diet is as healthy as possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not patchy, its full from where the head hair meets the beard (sideburn area) all the way around, the moustache has come in alright, its only on either side of the soulpatch area directly under the lip, otherwise its full all around. I've been looking into some multivitamins the EXOS AM + PM seems to be a good option. I'm having a hard time finding it in Calgary though. I'll check out community natural foods I suppose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for cheap kicks, try folic acid. It made my hair grow fast, maybe it will fill in areas too. Take it daily for a year and see if there is a difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try minoxidil. It's a drug, which promotes hair growth. Spray it twice on your head. However if you get positive results,don't stop using it. </p></div>		</li>
