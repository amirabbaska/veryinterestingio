			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting that instinctive* maternal behaviour is coded into the mother cat, rather than coding survival behaviour in the kittens! Could it be more efficient this way?</p>
<p>(*) I assume it is instinctive for the mother cat and she doesn't learn it on her own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some cats seem to be born without this instinct entirely. I had an elderly neighbor who had <em>tons</em> of cats, more than was socially acceptable (and I love cats) because the cats kept reproducing...and reproducing...and reproducing, some even with each other until a generation was born with extra toes and shit. She couldn't afford to get them all fixed and it happened so fast she wasn't able to give them away in time.  </p>
<p>In any case, my mom would always send me over there as a kid to help her out and I liked playing with the kittens and she was in all a nice lady.  </p>
<p>A few of her cat mothers were completely disinterested in their litters. When I was 10 and the lady was out of town, I literally had to deliver a litter of kittens and for the last two the mother just stopped removing the sacs and the kitties stopped breathing for a while. Cue ten year old me removing them from their sacs and rubbing their chests and tummies (which I'd seen in a TV show, had no fucking idea what I was doing) which eventually got them to start breathing at which point the mother took interest in them again.  </p>
<p>Another cat had her litter (again, while the lady was out of town) under a tree in the yard, and completely abandoned them. I was going for a walk when I heard squalling and I wasn't sure from where, sure enough I found a litter of kittens under a tree, basically half starved and covered in dirt. Me and my mom washed them up, got some kitten formula, but unfortunately the kittens had been infested with worms and the worms were eating them from the inside...horrifying. The last one survived a few days, and my mom would stay up late with it sitting on her chest to make sure it kept warm, but it stopped breathing one night :(  </p>
<p>Most of the time when the litters were abandoned though, another cat would adopt and nurse them. This crazy cat fiasco went on from when I was around 7-16, so I saw many a generation of kittens. There were always healthy ones to play with, which is fun for any kid.  The old lady was super sweet though, when my cousin died she sent a box of little kittens to help cheer up my aunt and uncle. It was really nice.</p>
<p>This has been my experience in sort of fostering deadbeat cat moms. Spay and neuter your pets, please. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason the cat moms were disinterested might be due to sheer overcrowding. Overcrowding does weird things to animals.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Baby kittens are born blind, without the ability to keep their body temperature and without the ability to poo/pee by themselves. Baby kittens need to be pulled by the mother/slowly flail to the other kittens relaying on each other and mom for body heat. They are blind so mama cat purrs at them to call them to come suckle.  Finally, after they finish eating mama cat licks their bottoms to force them to poo and pee, which she cleans off. This is so that there would be no smells to attract predators to the helpless kittens. In fact for weeks all these kittens do is eat, sleep and when mama cat makes them poo and pee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually I think this proves the opposite on the part of the mama cat.  She instinctively knows how to take care of her kittens without any instruction whatsoever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the mama cat knows .. usually but not always. Shelters also have kittens abandoned by their mamas tho those are an aberration. But the kittens do not know how to survive by themselves. if the kittens do not survive, there won't be grown up cats to become mama cats with instincts. </p>
<p>Chasing things are innate to cats, actually killing is not -- both in household and wild cats. It is why cats play with mice and other animals -- they know to catch but not necessarily to kill (tho there are cats who learn of course). But this is especially bad for young wild cats who have never killed before who can die of hunger while holding a pray that simply doesn't die. Wild cats need to be taught/learn how to hunt/deliver that death blow. </p>
<p>So some things are taught to animals, others are innate instincts. Mammals seem to need both though i am in no way an expert on the topic...</p></div>		</li>
