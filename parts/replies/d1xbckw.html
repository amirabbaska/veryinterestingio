			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanted to quickly add a less technical summary of /u/Midtek's excellent answer.</p>
<p>An irrational number is one that can not be represented as a ratio of two integers. In any basis, you can always multiply and divide a finite expansion by a power of the base to represent it as a ratio of integers.</p>
<p>For example, if we wanted to write 5.123 (in decimal) as a ratio of integers we could just multiply the top and bottom by 1000 and represented it as the integer ratio 5123/1000. The same principle hold for all integer basis so all numbers that have a finite expansion must be able to be expressed as a ratio of integers and in turn be rational. Pi is irrational and therefore can not be finite in any integer basis.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Got it. 0.333 repeating is not a finite expansion. Disabling inbox replies now</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a little bit more alebra involved to go from repeating rational decimal to fraction, but this proof works on any repeating rational decimal. We'll use 1/3 for this example.</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>X =0.33333... </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Multipy both sides by ten. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>10X =3.3333... </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Subtract these two equations. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>10x = 3.33333.....
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;  x = 0.33333..... </p>
<p>-------------------- </p>
<p>&nbsp;9x = 3.00000.....</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Divide both sides by nine. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>X= 3/9 </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Reduce the fraction </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>X = 1/3 </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Boom. There's  the algebraic proof that .333333.... is rational. Based on the length of the repeating section you may have to use a different factor of 10. (x100, x1,000, etc.) </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Edit: formatting </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Edit #2: </p>
<p>The more I think about it, there is one more interesting implication of this proof: </p>
<h1>Every possible infinite-repeating decimal can be expressed in the following form</h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x </p>
<p>------------</p>
<p>(10 ^ n) - 1 </p>
<p>&nbsp;
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Where X represents the repeating part of a decimal number less than 1, and n represents the number of digits of X. (In this case X must be a natural number.) A little more simply: </p>
<h1>To easily convert any repeating decimal to a fraction, put the repeating part on top of a fraction bar, and match each digit on the bottom with a nine.</h1>
<p>For example, take the repeating decimal 0.142857142857........</p>
<p>&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<p>142857 (the repeating digits) </p>
<p>------- </p>
<p>999999 (six 9s because there are six repeating digits)
&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=142857%2F999999" target="_blank">Reduce this fraction</a> to find that 0.142857142857..... is equal to 1/7. Pretty neat trick, huh?
&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=y+%3D+(floor+(x\)\" target="_blank">Here</a>%2F(10+%5E+(floor+(log10+(abs+(x))+%2B1+))+-+1)+where+x+%3D+142857) is the above equation expressed as a function within in wolfram alpha. You can replace the very last number with a number that represents the repeating part of a decimal number less than one and it will return the corresponding fraction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He mentions that all finite expansions can be expressed as a ratio of an integer to a multiple of the base, and that all of these numbers are rational. It is not mentioned that all rational numbers have to be expressed as aforementioned ratio, only all finite expansions. Some Venn diagram shit going on, here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does that mean that, in base pi, &quot;10&quot; is irrational since it is the base pi representation of pi? If so, doesn't that mean the colloquial definition of irrationality, which is that the number is non-repeating and non-terminal needs the caveat that it is non-repeating and non-terminal specifically in base 10? </p>
<p>I'm guessing that the preferred mathematics definition of irrationality would therefore be that an irrational number cannot be expressed as the fraction of two integers since this will be true no matter the base the numbers are in. The colloquial one is a bit confusing to me now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is true for <em>any</em> integer or rational base. The only way around this is to choose an irrational base <del>(and even then, it only works for irrational numbers that are the base times some rational number)</del>.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm... I've got a bit of math under my belt, though I'll admit most of the higher end stuff is going over my head, this raises a question.
I get that you can't represent irrational numbers in a rational base, and why there are multiple representations of rational numbers in irrational bases. Question is, what happens to non rational multiples of other irrational numbers in irrational bases? Like, if you're in base pi, what happens to e, sqrt2, phi etc.</p></div>		</li>

Rationality doesn't change if the base changes. The integers are still the integers, even if you have to write down an infinite number of digits.</p></div>		</li>
