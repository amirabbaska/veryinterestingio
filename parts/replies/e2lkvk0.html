			<div class="markdown"><p>Einstein published on special relativity in 1905.  The Michelson-Morley experiment was carried out and published upon in 1887.  The experiment and it's results came first, which is what I believe OP was asking. Einstein came up with the correct explanation of the results, but the debate over the existence of the ether was in full swing due to the Michelson-Morley experiment by the time he came along. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for specifics, I was too lazy to include them :)</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure however that Maxwell's equations are older than Michelson and Morley's experiments, which is why I don't think the answer is as straightforward as you seem to imply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure, Maxwell's equations strongly hinted towards special relativity. However, given that Maxwell's equations form a wave equation, and the wave nature of light was well established by the first part of the 19th century, the aether theory was the first interpretation.  Huygens actually hypothesized it in the 17th century, and when Young was able to solidly show that light was a wave, it was the first interpretation of what the wave of light was (after all, pretty much every other non-quantum wave motion in nature requires a medium).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_wave_equation" target="_blank">acoustic wave equation</a> also implies a constant speed of sound, but that speed is clearly measured relative to the sound medium of air. The fact that Maxwell's equation didn't refer to a specific medium contained some hint that the speed of light might be constant, but I believe most physicists at the time considered this proof that the ether was hard to detect, not that it didn't exist.</p>
<p>Edit: the Wikipedia pages on the history of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_electromagnetic_theory#Maxwell" target="_blank">electromagnetism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_special_relativity#Aether_models_and_Maxwell's_equations" target="_blank">special relativity</a> both mention that contemporaries of Maxwell thought the fact that light can travel through a vacuum was evidence for an all-pervasive ether that simply hadn't been observed yet, perhaps with some unusual properties. To quote the special relativity page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the relative motion and the mutual influence of matter and aether, there were two controversial theories. One was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Jean_Fresnel" target="_blank">Fresnel</a> (and subsequently Lorentz). This model (Stationary Aether Theory) supposed that light propagates as a transverse wave and aether is partially dragged with a certain coefficient by matter. Based on this assumption, Fresnel was able to explain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberration_of_light" target="_blank">aberration of light</a> and many optical phenomena.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_special_relativity#cite_note-6" target="_blank">[6]</a>The other hypothesis was proposed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gabriel_Stokes" target="_blank">George Gabriel Stokes</a>, who stated in 1845 that the aether was <em>fully</em> dragged by matter (later this view was also shared by Hertz). In this model the aether might be (by analogy with pine pitch) rigid for fast objects and fluid for slower objects. Thus the Earth could move through it fairly freely, but it would be rigid enough to transport light.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_special_relativity#cite_note-7" target="_blank">[7]</a> Fresnel's theory was preferred because his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_drag_hypothesis" target="_blank">dragging coefficient</a> was confirmed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippolyte_Fizeau" target="_blank">Fizeau</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizeau_experiment" target="_blank">experiment in 1851</a>, who measured the speed of light in moving liquids.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_special_relativity#cite_note-8" target="_blank">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, the fact that light does not have a medium was very surprising, as it was the first wave shown to not need a medium to travel.</p>
<p>Double Edit: Note also that matter was known to be polarizable at the time (this is particularly notable for dielectrics). The polarizability of matter can easily explain bound photons, also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaron" target="_blank">polarons</a>. The fact that light can travel without any matter present could be more easily explained by the presence of some other &quot;thing&quot; that is getting polarized, hence the ether. This would make sense in comparison with previous knowledge about waves. The only issue was that the speed of light did not appear to be affected by this &quot;ether&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Michelson and Morley thought they were just deciding whether the ether was affected by the relative motion of the Earth or not.  They weren't expecting their data to be used to argue that there was no ether.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism came first though (1862) . And the invariance of the speed of light was a feature of the theory already then. Even if it was not very well understood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, but again it wasn't the ruling interpretation of the day.  The constancy of the speed of light as a universal speed limit had to be rigorously shown first (a) experimentally through the MM experiment (and other precursors, see the other posts) and (b) through the development of the theory of special relativity by Einstein in 1905.  Maxwell himself initially attempted to find a mechanical model of the ether which gave rise to electromagnetism but failed in that search.  That's not to downplay the importance of the mechanical model to Maxwell's development of electromagnetism: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0039368186900026" target="_blank">it's been argued that the idea for the displacement current was first formulated in Maxwell's mechanical conception of electromagnetic lines of force. </a></p>
<p>Also, as it was pointed out below, the universal constancy of the speed of light is assumed as a postulate of special relativity; the effects of that constancy for <em>electromagnetic</em> interactions drops out of Maxwell's equations (see the Lienard-Wiechert solutions for the electromagnetic field of an arbitrarily accelerating point particle). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Related question: I read here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation#History" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation#History</a> that Larmor suggested that time dilation for the electron specifically might occur but there is frustratingly little written (at least that I can understand) as to what might have led him to believe this, years before Einstein.</p>
<p>(Very tangentially related: Larmor was a generation before Einstein almost, seems like he should be better known.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for pointing this out. I did not know about it.
Although, basically every consequence of c being a constant (time dilatation, relative chronology of non-causaly linked events...) was more or less hinted to before Einstein, his contribution unified them all in one very simple scheme.
The mathematical abstraction required to make it work was not Einstein's work either, but Lorentz, who rather saw his own transformation as mere mathematical game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i am just wondering what Larmor was thinking, not really concerned except secondarily about priority. the electron's existence was not even proven in 1897 so i would just like a laymen's explanation of what experimental results would lead anyone to think about time dilation then at all and/or why for the electron?</p>
<p>(Interesting to me is that Larmor lived almost to the end of WW2 and I think to the first chain reaction. One of his student's student's died in 2004 and may actually have met Larmor himself.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Classical Magnetism doesn't make sense from a particle perspective.  Even Galilean Relativity poses a problem for it.  Suppose you have two electrons released from rest some distance apart.  They repel by the electric force, but there would be no magnetic force if they have no velocity perpendicular to the line between them.  But what if you are moving past them when they are released.  Now they feel a magnetic attraction?  The exact magnitude depends on how fast you are moving.  But if you're moving past them and I'm not, which is it?  Is there a magnetic field generated and a magnetic force felt or not? If you move fast enough the magnetic force would become greater than the electric force.  So do they attract or repel?  How can your motion, regardless of your distance from them affect it?</p>
<p>You don't need to know anything about light to see a problem with classical magnetism.</p></div>		</li>
