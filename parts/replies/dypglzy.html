			<div class="markdown"><p>i dont remember the specific mechanisms but it has to do with the different receptors for adrenaline, like alpha 1 and 2, and beta 1 and 2 receptors, as they arent equaly distributed and each one does different things, so at the same time you can contract the blood vessels to less important organs and relax to more vital organs regulating the blood flow. (so the brain arteries can have a lot of X receptor while liver arteries have a lot of Y receptors so the bloodflow is regulated differently with the same stimuli)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious from this answer: are these three priorities &quot;hard-locked&quot;?</p>
<p>If, for example, a hospital were to externally administer and monitor the levels of vasogenic hormones in an injured person, would the brain recognize that the adrenal glands' job is being done and move on to the next needed area of injury? Or is the adrenal gland always going to be prioritized, regardless of internal hormone levels?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a very tricky question to answer succinctly. The short answer is: it depends. Usually when you are at the point of having to use vasogenic drugs to assist in hemodynamic management you have gone from <em>compensated shock</em> to <em>uncompensated shock</em>. At that point regional perfusion to the various organ vascular beds could be compromised in a way that the body is no longer shunting blood to the 'vital' areas. This frequently happens in distributive or 'warm' shock in the setting of overwhelming sepsis. What is happening is that the vascular beds are no longer as responsive to endogenous or exogenous vasoactive substances and the capillaries relax and become engorged with blood. As blood is no longer being shunted to the large central vessels, blood pressure may drop significantly and you now have a situation where even the 'vital' organs (brain, heart, and adrenals) are undergoing hypoperfusion. This can be exacerbated by incorrect vasopressor management. For example, administering too much vasopressor in the setting of heart failure can cause the heart to fail even more leading to a quickly downward spiraling clinical status. Sorry this answer is so vague. It really does depend on the clinical situation. In most scenarios, I would still say that perfusion is preferentially preserved in the brain, heart, and adrenal glands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be possible to infer or create-as-art a flowchart of the body's response to the offenses that generate shock? I mean like a flowchart like programmers use, &quot;if this then that&quot; kind of thing? &quot;If this chemical and that chemical are in the bloodstream and picked up by this type of cell and that type of cell then this chemical gets dumped from a gland, but if it's this other chemical then it's that other gland product ...&quot; kind of thing. </p>
<p>A flowchart art object like that would make it much easier to define when &amp; what chemical signals from outside of the body would be heard/useful/lifesaving. Like, if the patient's BP is dropping, and you know they got to this point by having this and such happen through liver/adrenal/kidney widgets, then this this and this will shore them up until shift change, but only if you give it now. </p></div>		</li>
