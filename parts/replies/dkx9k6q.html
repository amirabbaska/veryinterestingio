			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a check for my own knowledge, isn't Iron generally regarded as the heaviest element created during a star's life?  It was my understanding that supernovae are the source of anything heavier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a bit of a simplification. Iron is the heaviest element produced by nuclear fusion in stars, but neutron capture does actually allow for them to produce heavier elements late in their lifetime. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Nucleosynthesis_periodic_table.svg" target="_blank">This chart</a> shows the dominant methods of origin for all the elements on Earth today, though that means it doesn't show all the short-lived heavy atoms that appear and then quickly decay after a supernova or other large event.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for sharing that chart, it's fascinating. I had no idea low-mass stars were such a significant source of heavier elements. Do you know why &quot;exploding massive stars&quot; are so dominant from Oxygen through Rubidium? Why do &quot;dying low-mass stars&quot; disappear as a source for that range of elements? (I wouldn't previously have been surprised to see that, but having taken on board your point about neutron capture, I don't know why it doesn't occur in that range as well.) Finally, why doesn't neutron capture happen in the higher-mass stars as well? (Based on the lack of massive stars on the chart above Zirconium.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stars can form elements that are more massive than iron even before they go supernova, even though many isotopes are only formed in supernovae. This was first discussed in a famous paper by Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler and Hoyle (the so called B^2 FH paper).  </p>
<p>There are a few processes that are responsible for nucleosynthesis:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-process" target="_blank">s-process</a>, which happens in the asymptotic giant branch where stars burn helium in their centers and also exhibit hydrogen shell burning. In this process nuclei do neutron captures (followed by decays once the nuclei get too neutron rich). About half of all isotopes above iron are due to this process.</p>
</li>
<li>[p-process]( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-process" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-process</a>) the same, but using protons. The original p-process from the B^2 FH paper does not work well, but rapid proton captures are important in supernovae, and some proton captures also happen in stars.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, isotopes are also formed by photodisintegration (a massive nucleus absorbs an energetic photon and is destroyed in this process) and even by neutrino capture (same as photodisintegration, but with neutrinos; this only happens in supernovae).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the s process has an element capture a neutron, which then causes a beta decay and turn an electron into a proton, producing a higher atomic number element? Am I understanding that correctly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The forming of elements heavier then iron actually cost energy instead of producing like all the elements before it. So once a star start producing iron it is on it's way to dying because all the energy is being used to create heavier elements instead of counter acting gravitational forces thus the star collapses (and depending on size then explodes or forms neutron stars/black holes). During supernova a lot of energy is released in a very short amount of time this energy is free to be used in fusing iron into all the heavier elements. That is why elements heavier then iron are more uncommon the heavier they get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though as an interesting footnote, the half-lives of elements can be &quot;increased&quot; substantially due to relativistic time dilation. If they come flying out of a supernova near light speed, then they can exist for much longer (from a stationary frame of reference) than you might expect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, although from the reference frame of the isotope (proper time), the half life doesn't change. And it's all relative, so there are reference frames that see time for the neutron star moving very slowly and tone for the isotope moving normally. All relative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean there's no real reason to say some trivial quantity of impossibly high atomic number atoms are formed in supernovas just that anything with pick second order decay rates would be undetectable even given the several grams you'd be creating? </p>
<p>Edit: I'm saying elements numbered in the high 100s -200s+ WAAAY heavier than anything we've created in lab conditions.</p></div>		</li>
