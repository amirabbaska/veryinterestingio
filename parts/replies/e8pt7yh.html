			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that stainless steel on itself is not inherently corrosion resistant, forming a robust chromium oxide layer is very import for big stainless steel installations (think chemical/food industry). </p>
<p>So before these are put into operation, one of the first steps is &quot;passivate&quot; all the stainless steel surfaces that will see process fluids.<br />
Basically this is a controlled form of corrosion where the protective chromium oxide layer is grown to an optimal thickness, and all the free iron is &quot;scavenged&quot; from the surface layer, so that the equipment is sufficiently inert for it's normal operating conditions...</p>
<p>If you don't properly passivate stainless steel, it tends to corrode and typically in a nasty way such as pitting or crevice corrosion...</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is a lot going on to &quot;properly&quot; passivate stainless steel before putting it into service.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why is there an ISO standard for a chemical process?  Even the ISO page itself says there are multiple methods.  Isn't ISO for things that need standardization, as in, it doesn't matter how we all do it, just as long as we figure out a consistent way so we're all doing it the same way.</p>
<p>I understand that there are probably better and worse ways to passivate, but what is the advantage of everyone coordinating the way in which they passivate into a standard?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you passivate?</p>
<p>For example, I have several stainless steel items that have developed &quot;surface rust&quot; which I then abrade off to reveal clean steel underneath.  How can I then encourage the formation of the chromium oxide layer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>easiest(safest) way is with caustic solution and citric acid. typically in a sequence like this: heated caustic --&gt; strong citric --&gt; diluted caustic --&gt; rinse. </p>
<p>There are tons of recipes if you look up stainless steel passsivation, good place to start is ASTM380 and ASTM967</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure you will find some interesting information on it, but I personally would suggest just removing the rust via a light abrasive (bar keeper's friend or comet are two popular abrasive cleaners) and then adjusting how you care for the utensils.</p>
<p>Rust on stainless items (assuming they're at least a halfway decent alloy and not a marketing scam) is typically the result of abuse. Leaving them in the dishwasher with acidic juice/food on them and then running them through said dishwasher, banging into other things and being heated up, for example. This contributes to corrosion and passifying the steel won't last long if such abuse is routine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand further, the reverse can happen with certain acids that will weaken the chromium barrier and allow the surface to rust again. Consumer grade stainless steel kitchen surfaces and tools are still able to rust if left with acidic juice on them (at least the cheaper alloys). It's important to be somewhat gentle with common stainless utensils and surfaces, avoiding scratching and prolonged acid contact, else you get rust spots on them.</p>
<p>It gets even more interesting with acids that will discriminate between chromium, iron, or iron oxide. I can't say too much about the chemistry (not a chemist) but if you browse the hardware store's selection of rust-related products you will see that different results (e.g. removal, neutralizing) are achieved with different acids. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with konwiddak. Iâ€™m an instrument technician for a hospital, I deal with the instruments after use on patients and I have seen many stainless steel instruments become rusty over time. Generally this occurs because the instrument has either not been cleaned as soon as possible once used, or it has been misused and damage has caused the chromium oxide on the instrument to be damaged and therefore allow the material underneath to form rust.  These instruments must be replaced/repaired once this occurs.</p>
<p>Stainless steel can still rust, it just has a protective coating that helps prevent the rust from essentially taking up residence on the steel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that there are many different stainless steel alloys!</p>
<p>The harder alloys like <a href="http://www.pennstainless.com/stainless-grades/400-series-stainless/440c-stainless-steel/" target="_blank">440C</a> that are used for surgical tools are much less corrosion resistant than alloys like <a href="http://www.pennstainless.com/stainless-grades/300-series-stainless-steel/316l-stainless-steel/" target="_blank">316</a>, which is less corrosion resistant than <a href="http://www.pennstainless.com/stainless-grades/duplex-grades/duplex2507-stainless-steel/" target="_blank">2507</a>. </p>
<p>Also keep in mind that &quot;corrosion resistance&quot; is relative, and depends on the actual chemical in question, and the service conditions of the material. Some grades of stainless steel do better than others with different chemicals, at high temp, at low temp, under high stress, against high fluid velocities, and so on. There are entire careers dedicated to specifying the right material for the application, and entire industries dedicated to developing new grades of stainless steel to meet customer needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say - what happens when you sharpen a chefs knife?  Do you abrade the oxide layer significantly enough that it would need to be re-treated?  I'd hate to have a good knife pit and rust along the blade edge after sharpening.  Do chefs knives simply use a more resilient steel?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda simmilar to aluminium. It actually react with the oxygen extremelly fast, but the aluminium oxide is extremelly hard and also form a layer that is stable, thru effectivelly sealing the surface and no furthur oxidation can occur.</p>
<p>That oxide layer is what cause aluminium to be a pain to weld... First, the layer is very hard, then it form very quickly, and finally it melt at an higher temperature than the aluminium under it that you want to reach and weld to.</p>
<p>If you compare with steel... Steel you just grind/sand it down to bare metal, and you have hours to weld, if not days... Alu you have seconds from the grind until the layer is too important to easilly weld. Fortunatelly there is some ways to deal with that.</p></div>		</li>
