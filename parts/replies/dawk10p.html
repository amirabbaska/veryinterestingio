			<div class="markdown"><p>That's honestly the most fascinating aspect of supernovae for me.  On a scale in which &quot;short-lived&quot; stars endure for &quot;only&quot; millions of years, and the closest star besides the Sun is trillions of miles away, we can still have an amazing, cataclysmic, cosmological phenomenon that unfolds in less time than it takes for my grandmother to tell a story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe more direct an answer:  Elements heavier than Iron can undergo fusion, given enough pressure/temperature.  The difference starting around Fe in the elements is that fusion of lighter elements is exothermic, meaning it releases more energy than is required to initiate the fusion.  Heavier elements undergo an endothermic fusion, meaning it requires more energy than it releases.  So a star made of lighter elements can undergo a self-sustaining fusion, while those made of heavier elements can't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting fact: The creation of heavy elements by the fusion of elements heavier than iron only really happens in one specific time in a star's life cycle. The energy required to fuse these is so great that it requires an enormous instantaneous release of energy. This comes from a supernova.</p>
<p>So when a star finally gives up the ghost, it releases energy to form massive elements, many of which are essential to our modern lives and are found in our bodies.</p>
<p>So the self-sacrifice of these stellar giants creates life. Truly a wonder of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all white dwarf stars are the same, and not everything about them is understood yet.  </p>
<p>Having said that, they're mostly made of carbon and oxygen, with a relatively thin atmosphere dominated by either helium or hydrogen.  The atmosphere emits most of the visible light via thermal radiation.  About 25% of white dwarf stars also contain emission spectra of heavier elements.   </p></div>		</li>
