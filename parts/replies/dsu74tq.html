			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a sheet with a ball on it. The ball curves the sheet, which is the analogy most physicists use when talking about how mass curves spacetime. </p>
<p>Now, imagine a sphere. If you put a ribbon on the sphere, the only time it will lie flat is if it is travelling around the circumference of the sphere. Even if you try and follow a latitude line on a globe, the ribbon will lift off of the globe, because that line is curved along the surface.</p>
<p>Because a straight line on a curved surface follows the path of that curve, if something is travelling in a straight line across a sheet with a ball, if it meets the depression near the ball, it will follow the curve of the sheet, because to continue in the direction it had, it would have to curve relative to the surface of the sheet. Light travels in a straight line, but when it meets the curve in space caused by a massive object, it follows that curve because, relative to the curve, it's still going straight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your explanation is unfortunately off the mark.
Inertia is a measure of something’s resistance to change. Typically this is measured in units of mass, since mass resist “classical” forces, such as gravity. </p>
<p>Typically, light hits the reflective surface, is absorbed by the atoms valence electrons of the reflective material, and then re-emmitted to travel on its way. You must keep in mind, light is energy, not a physical chunk of matter.</p>
<p>Light/photons do not have mass, but they do have energy. Left alone, light will travel in a straight line, and will only change direction if acted upon by another electromagnetic force, or indirectly by gravity curving space time ( which the light travels along). Key concept being it takes something acting on light to change it; meaning light has inertia. ( you can look up the equation for the “rest mass” of light and the equation for calculating how much momentum light has.... hint; E=mc^2 is involved)</p>
<p>Secondly, you’re right in that we don’t understand gravity itself very well, BUT we do know with pretty good precision how it affects light. General relativity is literally Einstein’s theory of gravity, and tells us how light is affected by gravity’s warping effect on space time. In fact Einstein’s theory of special &amp; general relativity was scientifically proven, when evidenced by an experiment that showed the sun bends light around it. </p>
<p>This is how we know for example, that light cannot escape black holes; black holes gravity is so immense even light cannot escape it. </p>
<p>Back to an answer; light doesn’t reflect back instantaneously. It reflects so fast that as far as us humans are concerned it seems instant, and the light will have phase changes, and imperfect losses of energy ( meaning its wavelength will be altered. This is how a prism works like on the Pink Floyd album cover). When light reflects off of a surface, it makes more sense to look at light as a wave instead of a photon. Keep in mind that photons DO NOT EXIST. Photons are literal made up ideas to help think of lights behavior ( Einstein himself literally coined the term photon). Light sometimes acts as a wave and sometimes acts as a photon, but it never IS a photon. This was a baffling idea that no scientist thought made any sense ( how could something act like two different things at the same time!?!?!) ... quantum mechanics and relativity was born when people like Einstein proved to the entire scientific community that this was the case. </p>
<p>Anyway; to understand what is actually happening, you cannot think of light, like a ball thrown into the air, as most people picture a photon to be like. You have to think of light as a wave, and understand the basics of wave mechanics. </p>
<p>Then to go a step even deeper, you have to look at light, interacting with the reflective material, on a quantum mechanical scale, where physics gets really weird, and doesn’t look like the same physics we see in our regular day. </p>
<p>To learn this and not go to school for physics pick up Feymans book “Quantum-Electro-Dynamics” which walks through exactly is going on when light interacts with other things. It should also do a better job than I ever could to straighten out when it makes sense to think of light <em>like</em> a photon, and when it’s appropriate to think of light as a wave. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is called Thomson scattering, and is not what's at work when talking about regular reflection. Instead it has to do with Rayleigh scattering (the photons interact with a &quot;large&quot; chunk of matter that's smaller than the photon wavelength).</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm not doubting you, but do you have a source for this?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>How can you say this when we can measure individual photons? It's very misleading. Photons exist just as much as electrons exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe your right, I described the interactions of light going through a medium which is typically Thompson scattering. Rayleigh scattering occurs more in reflections and is partially responsible for why the sky appears blue. In either case however, the photons interact with the surface and the light Ray is bent. Either bent enough to be a full reflection or bent enough to change wavelength like a prism. </p>
<p>Look into Feymans book like I mentioned. That’s the best source I have on hand that can describe all this the best. You can probably pirate a pdf version like I did in college. The book will also describe how these interactions are not instant. Light has a finite speed, and the light itself will undergo a phase change at reflection points. More details in the book. </p>
<p>Photons, in the sense that you can have localized wave packets; resulting in a localized density of light/energy exist. HOWEVER the point I’m trying to really get a crossed is at no point is light a physical ball. At all times it is a wave. It’s just that sometimes you have a situation where the waves <em>act</em> as if all the energy was in a single place. Look up wave packets, and the law of superposition. </p>
<p>OP’s comment used the analogy of throwing a ball and therefore making people think of light behaving like a classical ball of mass. If you study light any further than Ray optics ( high school level) you will quickly find out that if you use this analogy you will arrive at the wrong conclusions and have a much harder time moving forward. The sooner people are told that photons are simply a tool for a few specific situations of light interactions the better. I know from experience the challenge of going from classical models that are easy to imagine in your head, to modern models that are hard to visualize, but more accurate. I wish I had more guides telling me which and where mental models were wrong so I could have learned better. So I passed on the knowledge I would have found useful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May I ask a (stupid) question. Why does the mirror can reflect photons chemically on an atomic scale at 100%. Shouldn't the energy be absorbed to some degree and less light shown as in colors. Right? What about a mirror physical and chemical properties makes it reflect 100% vs lower percentage or temperature(?)  </p>
<p>Maybe I am misunderstanding everything</p></div>		</li>
