			<div class="markdown"><p>They take every possible cost cutting strap from not training employees well to charging a shitload if you need any type of person to person customer service. They also don't have any benefits for employees and the seats don't recline. The example of why it didn't work in the U.S. Was that the European companies were bigger. I didn't really understand that part because most airlines have lots of money to invest.</p></div>		</li>
