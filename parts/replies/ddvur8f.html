<p>If they were all fine with all having the same library, it wouldn't be an issue, but then Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc. wouldn't have any real reason for you to choose one over any of the others.</p>

<p>I disagree with this part. They can compete in the same way video stores did, and in the same way any two competitors that provide the same product do. Spotify and Apple Music are pretty much doing it with music now - the services are different but the content is quite similar.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really.  Video stores competed on the basis of content and physical location.  If you want a system where online streaming services all have the same library (e.g. because of compulsory licensing), then there's no differentiators between competitors, since the Internet is everywhere.</p></div>		</li>
