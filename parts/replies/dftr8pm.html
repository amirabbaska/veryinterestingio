			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to be said that a fair amount of information can be divined from knowing what you're looking at, and for how long.</p>
<p>With encryption, your ISP doesn't know what videos you watch, or what subreddits you read. But they know if you're a frequent porn viewer, they might be able to divine your general interests from the sites you frequent (eg, if you daily check bustyredheads.com it's quite obvious what you're into), they might be able to guess things like political affiliations based on what news sites you read, and so on.</p>
<p>Encryption certainly helps a lot, especially for sites like reddit and youtube that have an extremely broad spectrum of content. But it's not perfect, and if it's important for you that something about your browsing habits be really private, you should consider the above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding was that they can't see the actual site you visit, not just specific URLs? So if I watch YouTube regularly, but use a VPN to go on PornHub, would the ISP be able to tell that I was watching porn and not YouTube?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's where things can get tricky. Generally only one server can access the same port so servers like Apache and nginx (the web servers) use the domain name to determine which site on the server you wish to access. </p>
<p>Basically, I can have multiple sites on one IP address but the web server can use the specific domain (part of the request) to point you to the right one. Accessing by the IP directly doesn't give it enough information and it will show a default site or no site at all depending on configurations. </p>
<p>Edit: typed this on mobile and fixed some formatting. I'd be happy to give a more detailed explanation just not from my phone keyboard. </p></div>		</li>
