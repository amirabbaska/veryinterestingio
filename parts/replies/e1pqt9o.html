<p><em>One should know quite a lot ahead of time.</em> <em>We have chosen radar antenna and signal characteristics to match the specific (largely chernozemic) soils of Donbass.</em> <em>And, we have done extensive research on the types of devices likely to be present in this area.</em></p>
<p>Does interpreting the images change with different soil types?</p>
<p><em>How (and whether!) we record images changes.</em> <em>The great thing about holographic radar is that the interpretation is really simple.</em> <em>With minimal training, we have operators IDâ€™ing mines at high PD, with low FAR.</em></p></div>		</li>
