			<div class="markdown"><p>How come it seems like every time there's <del>a picture</del> an illustration of mitochondria in a text book it's colored purple? Why wouldn't they color it orange if that's their actual color? Here I was thinking mitochondria were purple since I was in 9th grade.</p>
<p>EDIT: I guess I just had weird textbooks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking about a drawing of a mitochondria I can't tell you why the authors chose purple other than perhaps to help it stand out from the rest of the cell. If you're talking about actual images of mitochondria, they are falsely colored purple by imaging software. In my experience this is usually because there is something else in the image that is falsely colored green since green and purple make a good contrast. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i havnt actually looked at a cell illustration in a while but i have looked at many in the past over 9 or 10 years of my schooling. when i first read the title i automatically first thought of orange mitochondria and purple ER. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which explains dark and light meat in chicken or turkey. Dark meat muscle fibers are slow twitch oxidative fibers which contain high amounts of mitochondria </p>
<p>edit: My physio professor set me up for failure. The darker color is actually due to a higher concentration of <em>myoglobin</em>, not mitochondria. I remember learning the correct reason at some point but I guess her explanation stuck better in my head</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The type 1 (slow twitch) fibers do have more mitochondria, but I learned that the darker color is due to the increased concentration of myoglobin (which is related to the increased mitochondria count). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An example of this is brown adipose tissue. It's a type of tissue that has a high concentration of mitochondria which gives it the brown colour it's named after. It has many mitochondria to burn fat very fast and generate heat in hibernating mammals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although it might fall outside the scope of this question, you <em>can</em> use dyes and other clever tricks to stain specific organelles that are otherwise fairly difficult to distinguish. </p>
<p>Other sorts of imaging, such as electron microscopy or phase-contrast microscopy can also let you distinguish between various organelles, but it's based more on appearance than color per-se. </p>
<p>Also, u/alphaMHC, your flair is a perfect description of my nascent thesis. Here's hoping you don't scoop me ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this way, something that did <em>not</em> absorb light would be white (or the color of the light source).</p>
<p>You have to admit, talking about color based on what light is absorbed is backwards from how we usually discuss color. I guess it makes sense when talking about things down on the molecular level, but for anything that more macro it's more comfortable talking about reflected light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. Whether a particular molecule has absorbance in the UV (at 280nm for example) is not predictive of whether it would reflect a particular wavelength of visible light. That is, if you see a peak in the spectrum of some unknown at 280nm, you cannot say that unknown will be some particular (visible) color.</p></div>		</li>
