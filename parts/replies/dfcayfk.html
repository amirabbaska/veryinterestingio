<p>But I think that the human diet thousands of years ago would consist of unprocessed food's requiring more chewing and containing more grit &amp; contamination to wear the teeth.<br />
I recall reading that early British explorers of Australia found the local aboriginal people largely had surprisingly healthy teeth and properly developed jaw structure, with, of course no toothbrushes.
Maybe brushing simulates the wear and tear on our teeth our current diets no longer provide ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did a little googling sounds like your right.
There is evidence aboriginals used simple tools to clean teeth. </p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>There are reports of ancient Egyptians and Babylonians fraying the end of a twig to clean their teeth in 3500BC. The Chinese reportedly used &quot;chewing sticks&quot; made of aromatic tree twigs to freshen their breath before developing what's regarded as the world's first toothbrush in the 15th century, a device made of bristles from pigs necks attached to a bone or bamboo handle.</p>
<p>Natural bristles were used for teeth-cleaning until nylon was invented in the 1930s.</p>
<p>&quot;Australian indigenous populations' diet would often be quite abrasive with particles of dirt and sand in food,&quot; Dr Aldritt adds.</p>
<p>&quot;They did show more wear and tear on their teeth from abrasion but they didn't experience as much tooth decay. They also used kangaroo tendons to clean between their teeth.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does this mean that changing our diet would eliminate the need for brushing? Has anyone questioned whether brushing our teeth is actually killing all the healthy bacteria and CAUSING the problem we are trying to solve just like douching the vagina? Have there been any studies that have questioned?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would have to change it quite a bit. Like zero processed anything pretty much. Just unprocessed meat ( maybe cooked? ) and veggies. Things that require chewing for a loooong time. And fruit that you find in the nature around you and collect yourself. Only water and blood to drink. </p>
<p>Brushing teeth isn't killing bacteria so much as it is disturbing the biofilm that processes simple sugars and creates acid. It isn't the single bacteria that causes the real problems but rather it is the established biofilm. Much the same as a biofilm causing problems with plumbing in certain systems. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Why is it that when people talk about cleaning the vagina or ears people say that you should 'leave your body alone&quot; and not interfere with your bodies natural cleaning process but demand that we clean our teeth?</p>

<p>Because we don't insert bacteria laden foreign objects into those orifices several times a day.  </p>
<p>Well, unless you're a sex worker.  Or possibly have a very specific fetish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks but first of all that's quite incorrect and second of all doesn't answer the question. Plenty of bacteria laden foreign objects are inserted and ejected into the vagina on a daily basis. Secondly it doesn't explain how a human species that evolved with something so essential to survival as teeth survived for millions of years with a toothbrush with perfecty healthy teeth but all of a sudden in the last 100 years we have to use them or our teeth will rot our of our heads.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tooth cleaning is thousands of years old, and <a href="http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v206/n8/full/sj.bdj.2009.309.html" target="_blank">tooth decay has been a problem since people existed</a></p></div>		</li>
