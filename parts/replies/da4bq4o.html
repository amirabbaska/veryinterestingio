<p>In other words, it'd be affected by the <em>tides</em> caused by the earth, which act upon the space-station and the sloshing air within it, much the same way that the moon affects the earth and its rock/oceans/atmosphere.</p>
<p>There's a short story called &quot;Neutron Star&quot; by Larry Niven which took that idea to extremes but had a useful analogy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What is a tide?&quot;</p>
<p>[...] &quot;I'm going to try to tell you. The Earth's moon is almost two thousand miles in diameter and does not rotate with respect to Earth. I want you to pick two rocks on the moon, one at the point nearest the Earth, one at the point farthest away.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Very well.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Now, isn't it obvious that if those rocks were left to themselves, they'd fall away from each other? They're in two different orbits, mind you, concentric orbits, one almost two thousand miles outside the other. Yet those rocks are forced to move at the same orbital speed.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;The one outside is moving faster.&quot; [Than it would on its own]</p>
<p>&quot;Good point. So there is a force trying to pull the moon apart. Gravity holds it together. Bring the moon close enough to Earth, and those two rocks would simply 'float away'.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How far is &quot;close enough&quot; can be answered by calculating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit" target="_blank">Roche Limit</a> for the system, which helps explain why sometimes you see moons and other times you see <em>rings</em> of dust and fragments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being much larger, the Earth probably wouldn't be torn apart, but no form of life as we know it would be happy with the complete scouring of its surface by migrating oceans and crashing moon-bits.</p></div>		</li>
