			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, my research actually focuses exactly on this anology.  The phenomenological equations describing electron/hole transport in semiconductor materials is precisely identical to the equations describing diffusion/electroconvection of dilute ionic species in water (in the context of nanometric scale confinement where surface charge additionally acts as the analogue of impurity density).  There is no difference however in the Poisson equation; this is a very general relation from electrostatics that generally must be solved in either context.</p>
<p>What's cool about this is that, if the equations are identical for semiconductor solid state devices and ionic nanofluidic devices, then in principal the same solid state components realized with SCs can be realized with ionic systems.  In particular diodes, which allow us to rectify things like solute flux, solvent flux, and electric current.  Among other areas, this is hugely promising for desalination, because if solvent flux rectification can be achieved in practice, it provides a method of doing reverse osmosis with orders of magnitude less energy than traditional pressure driven methods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but can't you ignore the poisson equation part of you only care about the node values and fluxes?</p></div>		</li>
