			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I had an explanation like this for every subject that I was taught in school. I feel like students learn through motivation. Why am I learning this? How will it affect me in the long run? Most students and maybe even teachers, the answer is &quot;because it's part of the curriculum&quot; or &quot;to prepare you for college&quot;.</p>
<p>If a teacher sat me down and told me that basically- school isn't just about building a foundation of concepts to better prepare you for more complex/specific subjects that will ideally lead to a career path. It's also about helping you become an informed citizen, a cultured citizen. It's for you to watch TV and catch a joke that references a famous book. It's for you to converse with strangers and connect through that very way. It's that &quot;cultural connection&quot; that you mentioned. </p>
<p>And as much as I hate to admit it, I reference a lot of what I learned/read in my English classes. It's almost like watching movies like Citizen Kane or Twelve Angry Men. They might not be the most exciting movies to watch, but they are so famous, you kinda need to watch them. They have been referenced and parodied on so many different levels - it's an obligation you owe yourself. I just wish I had this type perspective when I was still in school. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that so many people take that question as a sign of disrespect. Now that I'm more confident, I want to go back to my teachers and say &quot;I'm not asking 'why are we doing this?' to say you shouldn't have spent your career on it. I'm asking because I want to orient myself.&quot;</p>
<p>In real life, asking &quot;why are we doing this?&quot; is super important if you want to actually do things <em>well</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to ask that question a lot as a kid/teenager and it was always met with the same offhand remarks and cyanicism.  I'm 37 now and my kids ask it a lot as well.  Instead of discouraging it though I embrace it.  I'm convinced that adults that get offended by &quot;why&quot; are either too insecure to admit they might not know, or lack sufficient critical thinking required to ask the question themselves.  </p>
<p>It's amazing where those three letters can lead us when my kids use them and I encourage it every time.  That simple question has lead to me explaining gravity and solar systems, how engines and suspensions work, engineering practices for foundation building, electrical theory, human behaviour, and on and on...  Sometimes for the more obscure questions, or more abstract questions, I'll end up confirming things with other sources and showing them that not everyone thinks the same things.  Then we'll try to reason through the different theories to come to our own conclusions.  </p>
<p>They're already developing critical thinking because we encourage them to ask questionsâ€‹ about what they observe and things they don't understand.  Anything from a marking on a road to why the earth goes around the sun.  I learn so much trying to find them answers sometimes, it's amazing.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got to experience this in math class once. We were going over the FOIL method and factoring. The teacher was telling us steps and I asked why we were doing this. She went on a 30 minute rant about why math was important and we needed to take it seriously. At the end of her rant, I asked in different wording, why do the steps you are teaching us work? I needed the basis of why the method works, not just a series of steps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the reverse of that is that many students who ask that question don't actually care when you try to answer it, and are asking it as a way to convince themselves they shouldn't have to care. </p>
<p>I'm not saying you're wrong at all, but it's not nearly as simple as &quot;well teachers just don't give students they 'why' well enough.' Were that it was so easy to engage people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High school English teacher here. I love getting this question. When I do get asked, I have a whole presentation about the role of storytelling, the idea of norms and shared cultural experiences, and why language, making meaning(ful ideas to share), and the words we use to express our thoughts, feelings, and experiences matter in understanding who we are. I don't think I've taught a class that didn't get at least a little of this (plus I try to write those things into the syllabus). This is super important for high school students, who are going through that purgatory of adolescence and are starving for something meaningful and true.</p>
<p>If it's not meaningful to the students, they're not learning anything about themselves or about the world they are inheriting. I'm talking right down to learning about how to use a comma in a complex sentence. Realizing this about my subject completely changed how I teach and who I am as a teacher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the crucial insight here is that studying literature, like most academic study of media, is, in reality, largely studying history of literature.</p>
<p>You get remarkably similar descriptions, for instance, when people try to articulate why <em>Citizen Kane</em> is considered a great film.</p>
<p>The problem is the same in boring literature education as it is in boring film education: educators who don't realize that they're teaching history of film (or history of literature), or at least fail to communicate that to students.</p>
<p>There is an omnipresent trap of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" target="_blank">Seinfeld Is Unfunny</a> - nothing seems interesting if you don't contextualize it because the most important things you're seeing were so influential that they've become pedestrian. The example of Hemingway illustrates that nicely.</p>
<p>But if you realize what you're doing, things become fascinating. Modern audiences don't bat an eye at how Welles uses sound bridges to show that time is passing. They aren't even consciously aware it's happening. And when you draw their attention to it, you still get more of an &quot;oh, yeah, I guess that is what that does&quot; than any real interest. Some people will find it interesting to be able to put a name to that effect, but it's certainly not going to be a novel kind of editing to any modern audience. But if you frame it from a historical perspective, if you talk about how Welles <em>invented</em> so many techniques for the film, about how they <em>weren't</em> pedestrian, about how the film isn't cliched, but is the <em>source</em> of the cliches you perceive, then it's a lot more interesting.</p>
<p>If you show someone <em>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</em>, most people will find it fairly boring. Some will find the obvious aesthetics unusual enough to sustain their interest, but the ending, for instance, will usually seem weak. But if instead you're watching it with an understanding that this was arguably the first horror film, that the ending was wildly original, that this was one of the first times anyone had presented that kind of ending - suddenly it's much more interesting.</p>
<p>Hemingway would have been a lot more interesting to me when I was younger if it had been contrasted against his contemporaries and predecessors, if we had talked about how it was innovative <em>at the time</em> instead of pretending like reading it <em>today</em> is emancipatory and electrifying. Instead, you have countless people who can recite the &quot;fact&quot; that Hemingway's writing is economical and direct, but honestly don't really get it because, without context, it didn't seem particularly economical and direct when they read it.</p>
<p>It is incredibly important that literature teachers teaching the canon understand that they are acting as history teachers at least as much as they are acting as literature teachers. Unfortunately, I don't think this is widely recognized, particularly in middle and high schools.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>so today we might read Hemingway and [rightly] think he's boring and dry</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had a college English prof who was deep into Hemingway, and I didn't mind at all. Once you realize it's all subtext, it's actually fun to think about what he's actually talking about, and I found it easy to get into. (It also meant he would ask us things like &quot;Explain your answer in 100 words or <em>less</em>,&quot; and refer to The Scarlet Letter as, &quot;400 pages of crap&quot;.)</p>
<p>Similarly, I <em>despised</em> Flannery O'Connor until a good teacher explained to me what she was going for. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The surface layer is that they get into the canon because old stuffy [usually white, usually male] scholars want to study them</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I always found the 'we included this for diversity' parts of the high school curriculum to be the weakest parts. It was always obvious why those works were there, and it felt forced. They do the same in music history courses (I was a music major). They always throw in a few extra female or minority composers into the listening list who were not really worth talking about otherwise, and mostly the profs just skip over them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But why do you think that these POC/non-male artists aren't worth talking about otherwise? It's possibly that you've been conditioned this way due to hegemonic forces behind your upbringing/education. Giving these pieces of literature/art the time of day is what will break down these sexist/racist tendencies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Women like Mary Shelley, and POCs like Alexandre Dumas, are legitimately part of the Western literary canon. Yes, they are very rare. That doesn't mean we need to add random no-name authors and pretend they are equally important. Students deserve to learn the truth, not to be indoctrinated.</p>
<p>I'm sure that 500 years from now, the Western literary canon will include a much larger percentage of women and minority groups, as those people are now more fully participating in literature at this point and that will probably continue. But today, it would be misleading to suggest that Western literary culture has been significantly influenced by women and non-white people in the past.</p>
<p>The reason why students should read Shelley and Dumas is because everyone in our society <em>must</em> be aware of Frankenstein and the Three Musketeers in order to fully participate in our shared culture, not because the authors are a certain kind of person. Some random author that no one has heard of does not provide this value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, but I can see where /u/MisterJose is coming from.  I'd say most of the time it's a weakness in how it's taught, where they just shove Hurston or Frederick Douglass at you and say &quot;THESE ARE BLACK PEOPLE THEY WRITE BLACK THINGS IT'S FEBRUARY BLACK HISTORY YAAAAY!&quot;  Sometimes, though...like, I just couldn't get <em>Native Son</em>.  I will be the first to admit that I'm a privileged white dude so I'm sure that was a barrier, but it just never clicked with me.  I feel like there could have been better options there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm saying artificially filling the curriculum with works based not on their merit but simply for the sake of diversity is not something I'm for. I'm for having the merit and the importance of the works be the deciding factor. I don't like including works based on minority status, or disincluding works based on minority status. </p>
<p>I see where you're coming from, but I think it can go to a troubling place. If we prize diversity and minority recognition so much that we say there must be something wrong with everything else if it doesn't include those things, that arguments against those things must be anti-minority, or that the fact that, say, there aren't the same number of female composers being valued as male composers is purely because of upbringing and prejudice (because it just <em>must</em> be true due to blind ideals), that ventures into crazy land pretty fast. Also, <em>forcing</em> those works in there not out of merit can have a blowback effect, as it has. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Scarlet Letter is the only book I ever outright refused to read. My teacher didn't think I was seriously until I turned in a second blank quiz for a zero. Thankfully I was in gifted English and she recognized I wasn't going to budge. Got to read Stranger in a Strange Land instead and aced the final essay I wrote. </p>
