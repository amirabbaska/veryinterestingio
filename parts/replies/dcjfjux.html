			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 30 with scoliosis and have tried stretches to ease lower back pain. It always has helped a bit but never completely took away any pain. The best results for me were stretches with strengthening exercises but I'm lazy and never kept up with it.</p>
<p>I now am starting physical therapy this week because the pain got almost unbearable! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just bought an inversion table.  Only $150 on Amazon.  I have wanted one for a long time because of my scoliosis, and it has helped a lot.  The great thing about it is, you can actually be lazy and watch TV, be on your phone etc, because you are just hanging there.  20-30 minutes a day for about 10 days now has brought me tremendous relief.  I have tried yoga, massage, stretching, chiro, etc.., but this has made this most difference the fastest.  Hope this helps, good luck.  Back pain sucks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe since you spent months stretching before doing strength training you were able to improve faster? </p>
<p>I certainly agree with you that strength training is the best thing that can be done for many body problems. </p>
<p>I have suffered from knots in my scapula area for over a decade and have tried everything to remedy them. The best thing I have found is deadlifting. Rows help too. Basically just strengthening my back. </p>
<p>I realize today that in high school I focussed on bench press but never did back exercise. I had an over tight front and a weak back making for bad posture and lots of pain.</p>
<p>I now hold the belief that most people in our modern U.S. need to do some form of weight training because of how sedentary our lives are. Just working a physical job is not enough!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Times have changed friend.  Although some of &quot;those&quot; type of chiros are still around, many chiropractors, like myself, are evidence based chiros with an extensive educational background.  During all of my undergraduate classes I was mixed in with PA, PT, Pre-med, and nursing students.  So all of these professions have the same basic science backgrounds.  In graduate school all of my classes consisted only of chiro students, but my school was evidence based so we took many research classes and although we learned about everything to do with chiropractic care, the evidence based stuff (like evidence based orthopedic tests for example) was always stressed and focused on.  I will not disagree that chiropractic has some odd stuff in its history, but so do most other professions.  I have seen a countless number of patients get relief and improve from chiropractic treatments.  If its not for you, thats fine, but please do not knock a profession simply because you do not agree with it, are misinformed about it, or read a wikipedia page about it.  Thanks and sorry for the rant lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not knocking chiropractors at all and I'm 24 so I assure you I'm with the times. I have a VERY good and thorough chiropractor who always leaves me feeling good but my point to this post wasn't to say the chiropractor doesn't know his shit he was simply playing it safe. My point rather was that the higher intensity and load of the strength training did much more for me than any physical therapy / stretching ever could've. For a weaker/older or more injured individual this may not be the case.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So you're not actually evidence based? Make up your mind!</p></div>		</li>
