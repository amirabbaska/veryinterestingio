<p>It could signify fertile land and the abundance of springtime. With new warmth comes the return of migratory animals, comes the most seasonal foods, comes longer days, and less danger of freezing to death. Better visibility. Birds &amp; many many other animals bare their young in the springtime to take advantage of the warmth and abundance when raising their young. In short, when you see flowers, you can relax. It's time for gathering.</p>
<p>Pretty much everything that is associated with springtime is seen in a light and positive manner - not just flowers. </p>
<p>Then there are medical reasons. Flowering plants are most easily identifiable by their flowers so it would make sense for them to be attention grabbing (either poisonous or medicinal). <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/04/09/176694090/on-call-in-the-wild-animals-play-doctor-too" target="_blank">here</a> is a list of animals which use natural medicine.</p>
<p>Flowers also feed bees, moths, butterflies, beetles, hummingbirds, bats, and some 1,000+ other species which form the base of a food chain.</p>
<p>There are plenty of evolutionary explanations, and many more which I am sure I am not even thinking of. </p>
<p>Nature and Nurture are a coupled system - It is not so easy to identify subtle genetically instinctual behaviors from cultural ones, but I look at it like a continuum whereby each behavior we collectively express is influenced at least in part by both. I imagine something like our collective appreciation of flowers to have contributions from both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You got some solid points here.</p>
<p>Didn't think of them before. Anyway, I think, as you say, the appreciation of flowers is both evolutionary and cultural.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not entirely true.</p>
<p>Are you familiar with Oscar Wilde or his theories of asthetisism?  Surprisingly, when he was doing lecture tours in the USA (which at the time was rather bumpkinish even in the largest cities) he found, surprisingly, as much or more enthusiasm for his ideas in hard-scrabble frontier mining and farming towns as in the urban northeast.  I believe this is remarked upon in the essays and history that come with most expanded copies of &quot;A Picture of Dorian Grey.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
