<p>Going to the deep cuts of specific macros, science based lifting programs, etc, will probably get you better gains, but it's a very small difference. If you are just starting out, go to the gym, and make sure you walk out feeling sore (not from hurting youself, but from working hard)</p>
<p>Increase the weight you work with every time you go in, not a lot but some. Eventually you will hit a weight that you fail at. Go back a few days worth and start upward again. Depending on your diet and body, you may need longer or shorter breaks in between workouts.</p>
<p>If you don't get stronger or bigger, you are a) not working hard enough. b) not taking care of yourself of c) seriously ill. </p>
<p>I've never actually seen c in person. It's almost always a.</p>
<p>Hit it hard, keep hitting it, and never, never ever skip leg day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lump that in with not taking care of yourself. That said, you can still make strength gains in deficit. Size is tougher, but rookies and super humans can do it.</p>
<p>Macro stuff is a lot more important there though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But damn he was cracking us up. Dude is straight hilarious. Just super blunt and straightforward. Love the dude. </p></div>		</li>
