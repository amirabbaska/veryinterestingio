			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the modern usage, but not the origin.</p>
<p>The real origin of &quot;¿&quot; seems to be purely arbitrary. In 1754, the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language decided that interrogative and exclamative sentences in spanish had to use coupled symbols, ¿? and ¡!. A century later its usage was finally widespread.</p>
<p>Other romance languages (Portuguese, Galician, Catalan) use the same wording structure as Spanish, but use only a single ?. Some of these languages have &quot;unofficial&quot; recommendations of using both ¿? if the sentence spans longer than a single line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also want to point out that word order is not as big of an issue in Spanish because it is directly descended from Iberian forms of Vulgar Latin. Latin also did not require a specific word order, and in most cases, it was even more flexible than Spanish. It also helps that the verb is conjugated to reflect the subject!</p>
<p>English has Germanic roots, so it doesn't share that feature, and word order is crucial to make grammatical sense. The only way to change word order is by altering the sentence grammatically, for example, switching from the active to the passive tense. </p></div>		</li>
