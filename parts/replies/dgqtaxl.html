<p>Unfortunately, the total light collected by the lens is proportional to its diameter squared. So a tightly focused image of the moon has the same intensity per square meter, whether it is created by a giant lens or a tiny one.</p>

<p>Forgive me if I'm missing somthing obvious here. But if the light collected by a lens is proportional to its diameter, then wouldn't a giant lens produce a more intense and hotter image than a smaller lens if they focused it down to the same size?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also remember that magnification is how much larger lines get, so the area is affected by the square of magnification. Since M is proportional to r, the magnified area is proportional to r^2 . Which coincides with the total light captured by the lens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm understanding this correctly, it's that the larger lens has a higher lower limit on how small you can make the moon. So the image would be spread out over a proportionately larger area.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, just like when you open the diaphragm of your camera lens. </p>
<p>The intensity increases with the lens diameter but it tends to a finite value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you use a group of lenses and mirrors to bend and focus many different images of the moon onto a point and create enough heat that way?</p>
<p>Edit: Ok so no one has really answered this to my satisfaction so I'll try to be more specific: If light is viewed as energy radiating through space, whats to stop me gathering more than one source of light and then focusing that energy into a single spot? In my mind two sets of energy focused into one point should result in twice the energy output... and then just repeat however many times is required to reach ignition temperature. I don't really see how the fact that it comes from the same low-energy source would change anything, it seems to me that this just means you'd need to gather more photons to get the desired result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Id like to see an answer on this one. Seems to me you could theoretically reach higher temperatures since you are taking multiple instances of light from the moon and combining them into one singular beam or area...of each lens has an equal intensity , does that light actually combine if focused onto the same point?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The XKCD comic goes into this. Essentially, the best you could achieve with this approach is having the 'target' be completely surrounded by images of the moon, all of which are at the same temperature as the moon. The target would then heat up to the surrounding temperature, which is still that of the surface of the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you read the XKCD article, it makes your question a little more clear. No matter what combination of lenses or mirrors you use, you can never get hotter than the temperature of the source.</p>
<p>The article talks about some amazing lens that entirely wraps around the sun, so that all the light gets captured, and even then this holds true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read the article and I still don't see how my idea wouldn't work. I'm not scientifically educated but it seems that this article only applies to a single lens/mirror configuration focusing light from a source. It states that you can't reach a temperature hotter than the surface of the sun with a lens, but if you had a hundred lens and mirror setups, each focusing light from one percent of the sun's surface into a point then wouldn't it be a matter of each percentage of surface of the sun emitting x energy, and you're combining all of that energy into one point... therefore you should get x*100 energy at that point, which far exceeds the energy emitted by the initial one percent received by a single lens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm having a lot of trouble reconciling what you said with energy conservation.<br />
If I took half of the photons emitted by the Sun and had them absorbed by a single hydrogen atom... that atom is going to be moving really fast... since it has like 10^28 joules of energy.  Have the photons get absorbed by a few hundred atoms instead of 1... and you've got a lot of atoms moving really quickly... you could call that a super high temperature gas.<br />
I can believe that the geometry of lenses and mirrors just won't let you focus the photons arbitrarily small.  But I don't believe that this limitation has anything to do with thermodynamics.  Could you clarify this some?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is where I'm getting hung up as well, we know how much energy you can get from a single photon in the visible spectrum, and we know how many lunar photons are hitting the earth per second and what their energy is, so what's stopping us from directing all of them onto a single point? If every photon reflected by the moon to earth hit a single atom at once, wouldn't that thing get super crazy hot?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is that there <strong>is not</strong> and <strong>cannot</strong> be a lens or reflecting mirror system that behaves as you describe.</p>
<p>I can't explain why any better than those who have already tried, but the thermodynamics thing is more consequential than causal, and I think it's confusing people</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If every photon reflected by the moon to earth hit a single atom at once it would get very hot, possibly making a black hole but the thing is how do you manage to do this?</p>
<p>You can't go out and push every photon with a stick like a bunch of tiny ping pong balls, you need some sort of mechanism and there are well defined limits to any sort of mechanism it is possible to build in the universe.</p>
<p>It's like saying that because a computer screen can show only a finite number of pictures all we have to do to find the cure for cancer is calculate every possible screen image, nevermind that this takes more processing time and storage space then it is possible for the universe to hold.</p>
<p>Problems like this arise from unexamined assumptions in the models you are playing with, this mental quirk is why perpetual motion machines will always be a thing someone is working on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lenses don't require any energy to function. Therefore, if you could focus light from the sun to a higher temperature using lenses you would be transferring energy from a low temperature to a high temperature 'for free'. This violates thermodynamics, and if true would allow you to create a perpetual motion machine, amongst other things.</p></div>		</li>
