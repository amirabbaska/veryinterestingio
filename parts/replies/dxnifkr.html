			<div class="markdown"><p>It has a lot of energy, but it collides with everything and collides really easily making it deliver its energy at a shorter range span</p>
<p>Don't think about it like beta and gamma pushes through paper. They skip past the paper atoms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alpha particles are easy to shield against because they're electrically charged, so they interact strongly with many nearby atoms in the material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.  It has no penetrating power and imparts everything it has to the first bit of material it hits.  But that also makes it incredibly dangerous.  </p>
<p>If it's outside your body, no problem, the outermost layer of skin cells will stop it and get sloughed off normally shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>But if it gets <em>inside</em> your body, ingested or inhaled, then all those alpha particles are releasing tons of energy into cells that you really <em>do</em> care about.</p>
<p>Think of radiation as different calibers of bullets.  Alpha is really low, such that any old bit of armor will deflect it easily.  Gamma is really high, goes straight through no matter what.  That means your natural 'kevlar' will keep alphas out.  But if it's <em>already inside that armor</em>, then being deflected just means that it bounces around inside your body instead, shrapnelling way more damage than if it had simply done the &quot;in and out&quot; a high velocity round like gamma would have.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A helium atom has charge 0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A neutral helium atom with 5 MeV of kinetic energy moving into some material will not remain neutral for long (not to mention how it gained so much kinetic energy without losing any electrons in the first place).</p></div>		</li>
