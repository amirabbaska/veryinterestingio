			<div class="markdown"><p>Your explanation of the tipping system was great, however it didn't seem to answer the fundamental question of how the tipping system got started. Say for example Walmart wanted to start a tipping system for their cashiers. The general public would be outraged and laugh at the idea of having to pay extra money for a service they are already paying for. So how did the restaurant industry manage to make tipping a mainstream idea? You fully explained the reasonings and justification behind it, but how did it actually become a commonly accepted practice by society? How were people convinced that they should have to basically pay twice for the same service they ordinarily would only pay once for?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you know what you want when you go in. </p>
<p>But some people may not have the same knowledge or experience with what to buy. </p>
<p>So they may ask questions like what liquor goes well with x mixer or ask about the vast array of wines and pairings for those wines. The staff may be knowledgeable and in those cases, the customer may be inclined to tip for the knowledgeable service provided. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly!</p>
<p>This same argument could be made for retail stores: rent is high, revenue timing is inconsistent and the floor salespeople/cashiers are only useful when customers are present, so changing them to tip pay will meet the expectations of customers, high quality service always, and allow [stores] to pay [employees] only when they can afford to pay them.</p>
<p>And yet, we don't do that, thankfully.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salespeople and cashiers are more like the cooks in the original analogy, since salespeople and cashiers are (usually) able to switch between jobs and have a limited ability to rearrange work. There are shelves to reorder, clothes to refold, and labels to retag - these jobs can take a significant amount of time.</p>
<p>Waiters can make sure their tables are squeaky clean and their uniforms are presentable, but those are things that only need to happen if there are customers, anyway (tables don't really dirty themselves...).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't comment on the history of how it got started, but I can comment on an important point which isn't brought up here. There's an error in the questions when it says &quot;How did the restaurant industry talk the public into paying their workers for them?&quot; The issue is that the public pays the workers everywhere. If WalMart did this same thing, they wouldn't be asking you to pay more, they would, in theory, be asking you to pay the same amount, but a portion of that would be optional and direct. The wages of those cashiers is already a part of the price of the goods sold in the store. Without the tip system, you wouldn't pay less, but about the same amount, only it would be reflected in the cost of your meal. Same total, different subtotal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Funny you mention WMT....They do, IN FACT, have the public pay their employee's wages for them. They pay them so little that they can't survive without food stamps and HUD then direct them in how to sign up for food stamps and HUD.</p>
<p>People consider it abusive in the same vein they consider tips abusive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I wanted to jump on to this because I work in a restaurant in a state that has the same minimum wage for both tipped and non-tipped employees, and have interacted with both service-class folks and restaurateurs from areas of the country that employ a tip credit. Here are some big things I've noticed, at least anecdotally, with some first hand backing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tipping is largely just as generous, and it is easy for me to make an additional $3/hr on top of my wage of $10/hr. </p>
</li>
<li>There are fewer people on waitstaff and generally have a larger workload each. Tiny cafes in Wyoming (which tip credits) generally have at least two servers on staff at all time, which is about how many my larger volume restaurant in a medium-sized city has during our rush times</li>
</ul>
<p>-Staggered shift scheduling is more common, with overlaps around rush times</p>
<p>-Tip sharing is much more common, despite dubious legality. Generally, because of wage equality, this isn't considered a big deal, and most servers encourage it, as it improves front/back relationships. Many of my friends from tip-credit states are appalled until they learn that servers make full minimum at least.</p>
<p>This is all to say that wage equality's impact on restaurant service is a tad bit overstated. margins of course are tight, but apart from an increased work load in some sectors, Restaurants around these parts are just more fastidious about scheduling. Sometimes that means that hours are slightly less (lots of 6 and 7 hour shifts, etc) but the tips on top usually make up for it. </p>
<p>However, should tipping go away? yes. I would rather be paid slightly more hourly and have people endure slightly higher prices than have random amounts of cash every day. I have to plan accordingly in the winter because my tips just disappear with the tourists. </p>
<p>edit: Got excited and forgot my double spacing</p></div>		</li>

<p>That would all be well and good.... except that full service restaurants are still a thing in non-tipping cultures and they don't seem to be suffering particularly in comparison to those in tipping cultures.</p>

<p>A slow lunch on Tuesday doesn’t keep the lights on. It might only cover the cost of rent.  Those high-volume times are so high they pay for the rest of the “dead time”.</p>

<p>Isn't this true, on some timescale, for every single industry? The up cycles pay for the down cycles. If you expect a constant up cycle, you're gonna end up fucked (and this seems to happen FAR too often).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bartend/serve in the US and bartended/served in Australia. In the US I make 2.19 USD an hour + tips. Australia I made between 23 - 33 AUD an hour depending on the time and if it was a weekend.</p>
<p>The main difference is when I serve in the states we have free refills (most of my time spent) on soda and many options on our menu such as multiple sides which can take a lot of time for a table of 6 to order/ring in/retrieve. Our typical sections are 3 tables. With a friday having 25 servers give or take and a full restaurant of guests, there is someone constantly in my way. With a two hour wait, tables instantly getting sat I have to greet them within 45 seconds ignoring my other list of things to do. With only two drink stations and ice bins constantly needing filled. Tea to be made. Soda syrup replaced. Lemons to cut. Too many people can cause traffic jams and too few can spread the servers too thin.</p>
<p>In Australia I worked at a nice pub where you could be seated with a server or order at the bar and obtain a number to have your food ran to you. The food dishes were specific orders such as (filet with mashed potatoes and asparagus) no substitutions. Made orders a lot quicker to take and ring in. Soda was expensive and no free refills. Mixed drinks were ordered more regularly and people drank them slower or cut themselves off. Therefore I could handle much larger sections or if I bartended make drinks for servers who were busy if I wasn't busy.</p>
<p>Which beings me to my point. We would only ever have at most 7 servers and 2 - 3 bartenders a night in Australia handling a restaurant in similar size to the one in the US which takes 25 servers and 2 bartenders. </p>
<p>The Australian restaurant had a lot more down time but we had to always be working or cleaning if we weren't serving. There is less constant running back and forth getting refills and more babysitting. </p>
<p>In the US I'm constantly doing busy work such as getting refills of soda. Its not uncommon for a table of 6 to drink all their soda before I finish taking the order and am I expected to have refills for them without being able to teleport? What if i run back to get more pepsi for them and the pepsi is out or the ice bin isnt filled? What are my other tables doing and what do they need? My income depends on how I manage my time or if I get a table that doesn't believe in tipping it doesn't matter how perfect I am. I suffer. </p>
<p>If we changed it to making say 15 - 20 USD an hour which is comparative to Aus then my boss would have to fire a huge portion of the staff and restructure how the restaurant operates. But people are accustomed to a specific standard when they come out to eat. My restaurant would not survive if it was only staffed with 9 servers on a busy night.</p>
<p>The cultures are different and the workload is different. It's not a fair comparison.</p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>I will also add that because of the way it was set up and we didn't make tips in aus that every server could help any table. I could ring in something for another servers table and go get it for them. </p>
<p>In the US if a person at another server's table orders a beer from me while I walk by.
Number 1: I wont make any money from them. Number 2: It interferes with me from helping my own guests who I will most likely make money off of.
Number 3: I don't even have access on the computer to ring in a drink for that table. I have to track the server down and let them know.</p>
<p>Two different systems in work here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible that the difference between the workplace dynamic between AU and US is affected by the difference between tipping and not tipping? </p>
<p>It seems to me from your story that a big part of the difference in how the work is done is based on the tipping. You said yourself, you won't help another table because you won't get paid for helping them, since most of your income comes from tips. As a result, the restaurant <em>has</em> to have more servers because you can't work collaboratively because it's not economically sensible for you. (FWIW, servers at places that tip share will often work collaboratively -- simply because that economic math you point out doesn't work against them doing that.)</p>
<p>I would be very curious what would happen if someone in the US opened a restaurant that had no refills -- and no tipping. (FWIW in my limited international experience, &quot;no substitutions&quot; is not a common thing.) It seems like business mindsets are fixated on &quot;this works, nothing else could possibly work, so we won't do it,&quot; not because there's any actual evidence that it won't work, but simply out of fear that it <em>might</em> not work (meanwhile, they do things that they think are conventional business wisdom that ultimately cause their business to fail, and they find something external to blame, like, say, millennials. But I digress...)</p>
<p>We haven't even gotten into the discriminatory impacts of tipping -- like, with all other things being equal, how <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soin.12056/abstract" target="_blank">servers of color get less tips</a> than white servers, <a href="http://www.payscale.com/data-packages/restaurant-report/full-data" target="_blank">female servers get more tips than male servers</a>, attractive servers <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pretty-waitresses-earn-bigger-tips-from-women-2015-9" target="_blank">get more tips</a> than unattractive servers, and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm only familiar with US restaurant economics and customs. When we start talking about Scandinavia, or other parts of Western Europe, I can't speak with certainty. But I do know the biggest reason for why sit down restaurants exist outside the US, there is a demand for them. With that demand will come a supply. Admittedly that's a broad answer and not satisfying.</p>
<p>As for the business cycles, yes all businesses have cycles, but I think it is worth noting that not all cycles are created equal. Restaurants are unique due to the very large labor market, the relative ease of training new employees, and the industry expectation of sending people home when there isn't any business <em>that day</em>. Additionally the thin margins mean controlling cost is just as important as controlling revenue (again could be said for any industry) but in restaurants you can actually not pay people when you don't want to. That is unique, healthcare doesn't work that way, law doesn't, oil doesn't, manufacturing does to a point. The immediate feel of a slow down and the ability to staff up quickly and recapture capacity is unique to the service industry and does help explain why tipping has persisted. </p>
<p>And you are right, people in every sector for as long as there has been documentation have expected the best and not been able to survive the worst.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I liked your explanation, but I think you're also missing a bit that the Restaurant industry loves about tipping.</p>
<p>TAX EVASION</p>
<p>For anyone that's ever had a manager prefer them not to report all their tips, it's tax evasion on the water and the owner's half (avoiding tax on paying higher wage employees)</p>
<p>And I think this is a huge part of modern day stickiness of tipping, otherwise almost everyone I know doesn't like it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, law does. A lot of legal work is moving into contract work. Most law school students don't walk into a salaried law job anymore.</p>
<p>And of course oil does. They are on 2 week contracts. 2 weeks on, one week off. They pay enough salary for people to put up with it.</p></div>		</li>
