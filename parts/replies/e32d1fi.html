			<div class="markdown"><p>We often parametrize tests of General Relativity by the potential (i.e.  how big the central mass is) and curvature (i.e. how close you are to  the event horizon) of the spacetime where the test is performed. The  highest-precision tests in have been performed in our own solar system,  where both the curvature and the potential are comparatively low. Some  recent measurements (e.g. from gravitational waves or pulsars) have been  performed at much higher curvatures, but still relatively low  potentials. Our redshift measurement is the most direct test of GR  around a supermassive black hole, which means that we’re exploring for  the first time the parameter space of high potential and low curvature. </p>
<p>As  to which theories are ruled out by our measurement: the redshift  measurement is a confirmation of the Equivalence Principle, which states  that the laws of physics are the same in any inertial reference frame.  This Principle leads in general to a “metric” description of gravity,  which is a theory in which gravity is described as a curvature of  spacetime (as in General Relativity and several alternative theories).  So our result is evidence that gravity is described by a metric theory,  but we can’t (yet) distinguish between those metric theories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you very much for your answer! When you mention the Equivalence Principle, are you referring to the strong Equivalence Principle oder the Einstein Equivalence Principle? Wouldn't (for example) Brans-Dicke gravitation or higher order gravitational theories be ruled out by this result? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So when does it become a Law vs a Theory? It passes every test that we can throw at it. How much more is needed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Physicists stopped using the term &quot;law&quot; and everything is hypothesis and then it either becomes a refuted hypothesis or it graduates to &quot;our current best theory&quot;, there are very few laws. (Newton's Laws, Kepler's Laws, Ohm's Laws and a few remain in the vocabulary of course, but we'll probably continue to refer to GR as &quot;Einstein's theory of General Relativity&quot; even if it's much more powerful than Newton's Law or Kepler's Law.)</p>
<p>It's probably a language shift thing, but ...</p>
<p>... we have better understanding of epistemology too. We know that our model of the universe is just as good as our data and our inference from it. Clever minds design ingenious experiments to gather valuable data to quickly zoom in on the right parts of the model space. But of course the model space is vast, infinite dimensional, and endless in a sense. (You can always come up with a more convoluted and contrived explanation for why the world is the way it is.) But we of course prefer the simpler of the equally powerful models. (Power here means predictive power. How well the model can predict future events.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One explanation I’ve seen is laws replicate the effects of something else and theories explain the underlying phenomena that results in the effects we measure (like Newton’s law of gravitational attraction which describes the movement of bodies and Einstein’s theories of relativity which explains those movements with mass curving spacetime)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never. Laws and theories are inherently different concepts. Hypotheses (may) graduate to become theories, but that's where it stops. Laws are a different thing. A Law is more like a math-like statement and a theory is more like an explanaiton of that statement. The &quot;theory&quot; title is the highest an explanation for phenomena will ever achieve, regardless of how much or how slam-dunk the evidence is that supports it.</p>
<p>Science is set up intentionally to avoid concepts like &quot;facts&quot; or &quot;proof&quot;, instead using &quot;theories&quot; and &quot;evidence&quot;. It leaves room for revision, because no matter how truthful a scientific statement is, there's never a point at which that statement can confidently be assumed to be fully encompassing. Doesn't mean theories are wrong, just means that they leave room to add more as more is discovered, or revise portions that may not be accurate in every instance of the phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>
