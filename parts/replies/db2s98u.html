			<div class="markdown"><p>Lorentz invariance is incredibly important in modern physics. It is a fundamental symmetry in all of our current models. Very roughly speaking it means that the laws of physics are the same in every place, regardless of which direction you look or the speed you are moving.</p>
<p>Lorentz invariance doesn't allow you to escape black holes. A violation of Lorentz invariance could.</p>
<p>To tie it into some of the other answers, without Lorentz invariance the notion of causality and the relationship between future and past would be modified (would, in some models, essentially return to the &quot;intuitive&quot; notions of such things in fact)</p></div>		</li>
