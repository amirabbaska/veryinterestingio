<p>An example: Western Europe should be Taiga (as Taiga forests usually occur around 60N and 60S). However, the Gulf Stream which hits the Eastern United States Seaboard provides warm currents to Europe; Europe, as we know, contains deciduous forest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a misconception.  The Gulf Stream is only responsible for a small part of Europe's warmth.  The warmth is really caused by air currents set up by the location of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation" target="_blank">&quot;While it is often stated that the thermohaline circulation is the primary reason that Western Europe is so temperate, it has been suggested that this is largely incorrect, and that Europe is warm mostly because it lies downwind of an ocean basin, and because of the effect of atmospheric waves bringing warm air north from the subtropics. However, the underlying assumptions of this particular analysis have likewise been challenged.&quot;</a></p>

<p>It is not uncommon for gas giants to have bizarre weather. There is little 'atmosphere'</p>

<p>On the contrary, gas giants have the most massive atmospheres.</p>

<p>We still don't know what makes the Great Red Spot 'exist'. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have some very good theories, though. Both cascade (feeding from the jets) and inverse cascade (feeding from smaller vortices) processes help to maintain the Spot. Unlike Earth hurricanes which have a low at depth and a high aloft, the Great Red Spot seems to be an isolated high, much like isolated meddies in the Atlantic which can last for decades. (The wind shear is far too great for the Great Red Spot to have much vertical structure.)</p>
<p>Combine those processes with its location - it's at low latitudes, where the Coriolis force isn't very strong, so the deformation radius is quite large - and it's not at all surprising to find the largest vortex there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anticyclonic storms, or storms which 'spin' in the wrong direction (like Great Red Spot), are not impacted by the Coriolis effect because they are so 'small' compared to the planet's size. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is definitely not true for the Great Red Spot. The Coriolis force keeps the system together. In general, this is also not true for any large anti-cyclonic system. On Earth, they aren't storms, but rather large blocking highs (Rex or Omega blocks) and bring fair weather.</p>
<p>To be honest, even calling the Great Red Spot a &quot;storm&quot; isn't accurate - it's a vortex, but the interior is very quiescent.</p></div>		</li>
