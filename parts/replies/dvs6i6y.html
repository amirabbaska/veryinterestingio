			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems like a great answer, thank you! I'm not a big coffee fan since I need to use the restroom too frequently, but do other caffeine based stimulants (tea, RedBull, etc.) have similar 45 minutes onsets, or this something unique to coffee?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's a fact of drinking most liquids. Caffeine is really not the potent diuretic that everyone makes it out to be. Especially if you consume it on any kind of regular basis. Coffee is even consider a hydrating beverage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's if you're ingesting it. Sublingual absorption for caffeine has an onset of just a few minutes. Caffeinated gum works this way. </p></div>		</li>
