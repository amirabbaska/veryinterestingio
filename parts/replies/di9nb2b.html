<p>As for why Timor won't join Indonesia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indonesia's occupation of East Timor was marked by violence and brutality. A detailed statistical report prepared for the Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor cited a minimum bound of 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period 1974–1999, namely, approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 &quot;excess&quot; deaths from hunger and illness. The East Timorese guerrilla force (Forças Armadas da Libertação Nacional de Timor-Leste, Falintil) fought a campaign against the Indonesian forces from 1975 to 1999.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No means no.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_East_Timor" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_East_Timor</a></p>
<p>Timor's exports are ~50% petroleum, which tends to trade in USD. They have $279 million in reserves and most of their country are subsistence farmers. ~25% of their exports are in coffee.</p>
<p>Most telling is perhaps this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor_centavo_coins" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor_centavo_coins</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>East Timor centavo coins were introduced in East Timor in 2003 for use alongside United States Dollar banknotes and coins, which had been introduced in 2000 to replace the Indonesian rupiah following the commencement of U.N. administration. One centavo is equal to one US cent. The coins are in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 centavos and feature pictures of local plants and animals. East Timor does not yet issue its own banknotes.</p>

<p>The simplest part of this is that the government will accept payment of taxes in US dollars. That will usually be enough to get people using whatever the government takes for tax payments.</p>

<p>Along with the related concept of establishing a &quot;legal tender&quot; which  means that someone can't refuse to accept US dollars from you when claiming a debt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to wonder if countries with few resources like East Timor would have been better off just joining with the neighboring superpower, in this case Indonesia.</p>
<p>I know there are some serious divides, but...come on. </p>
<p>Worst example has to be Western Sahara/Polisario. What the hell do they plan to do with a country that is essentially desert and beach?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally people don't want to give up power, especially power over their own lives. You're asking them to vote to give up all ability to set their own laws in return for....what? A bigger army? No one wants to invade them at this moment. Indonesia doesn't really give out welfare...</p>
<p>People didn't even give up their countries for the EU, and there was some very clear economic welfare given out there.</p>
<p>Even then they would have to be accepted into their new home. You can't just vote to join America and get SNAP benefits, America probably wouldn't take a 3rd world country for various reasons - it would dilute existing Congressmen's power, it would cost us a lot of money that we'd probably never get back. Even an existing colony of America can't get made into a state - Purto Rico has been complaining about it for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah I get the motivations, I just mean as a whole. Timor is probably never going to amount to much, whereas Indonesia might someday liberalize. </p>
<p>Course a Timorian province of Indonesia might just get ignored for longer than they would be as a poor independent country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indonesia attempted genocide against Timor and would probably go back to building death camps if they got them back. That's like saying Serbia should annex Bosnia, or Nazi Germany should annex Israel </p></div>		</li>
