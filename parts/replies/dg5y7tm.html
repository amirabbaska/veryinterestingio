<p>You'd need a good physics engine to accurately simulate every movement of fabric on a character's body, and even today, that's something we rarely see. Often times, the games just make sure that the most obvious cloth physics look right, but there's still dozens of other details that look wrong. </p>
<p>It's not long ago that I still actually saw chainmail stretching across a character's body, and that's <em>pretty</em> unrealistic. Can't remember which game it was, though. Skyrim, perhaps?</p>
<p>Likewise, we don't usually see muscles and other tissue (fat, tendons) moving underneath the skin in a realistic fashion either. Some tissue gets a physics treatment, like breasts, maybe even butts, but when you look closely, you'll see that basically every major muscle group shakes a bit when you run or jump in real life. Few, if any games, do physics calculations on more than a few very visible parts, such as perhaps tendons in a character's neck, or facial muscles.</p>
<p>Some fighting game characters get more extensive physics for huge muscles, though. I know Astaroth's pecs bounce in soul calibur, even since SC3 on the PS2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't disagree with you but that is all beside the point I think. The question doesn't seem to be referencing immersion which is what you are referring to.</p>
<p>If it <em>looks</em> like a video in a loop, but was rendered by a GPU, it fits the criteria the OP is asking for.</p></div>		</li>
