			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard it posited that higher global temperatures can disrupt the polar vortex, which is one explanation for surges of colder air coming from the Arctic and Antarctic.</p>
<p>Does that mean that global warming can help to save the ozone layer by reducing the isolation of the atmosphere around the poles? Obviously it’s not a great tradeoff if so but an interesting interaction nonetheless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but smaller ozone holes have been observed over the arctic too. It's just not as persistent or as large.</p></div>		</li>
