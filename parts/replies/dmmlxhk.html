			<div class="markdown"><p>It is pretty good, but it is only a model. Hurricane will hit Florida around Sunday-Monday and any forecast  this far in future is not reliable. On Friday you can get very good idea how it will look.</p>
<p>Try for yourself, there are different models, on the right bottom of site (NAM 3km ECMWF9km GFS22km) and they differentiate on what path the hurricane will take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's fairly typical of the region. The South Pacific is an incredibly dangerous place to sail. It's part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_Ocean_Race" target="_blank">Volvo Ocean Race</a> and is notoriously difficult to navigate. <a href="https://volvooceanrace-img.s3.amazonaws.com/m44171_crop8_1024x1024_proportional_148546691161E6.jpg" target="_blank">Example race route</a>.</p>
<p>I think part of it is due to being a very large expanse of water - no land/mountains to break the winds and waves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived in SE Georgia for many years. One time after a near miss of a hurricane (i forget its name) came by and slapped us with rain band after rain band for a week. It was heavy and flooding was serious but not catastrophic. </p>
<p>Anyway after the rain bands let up some we made a short trip out to Jekyll Island to see what we could see. The beaches were mostly gone! Cut down several feet from the normal spot. With most of the sand gone, many things were partially uncovered and the coolest thing was a giant tank tread. It may have been some heavy construction thing, but the little part we could see was just massive treads like on a tank seemingly still attached to what ever vehicle it was built on. We took some pics (many years ago, lost on hard drive crash) and as we were climbing back up to the trail to get back to our car (used to be a connected trail, now we have to scale a 6 foot drop off/sand cliff) we see an octopus running (yes running) back to the ocean from the woods!! He was small and moving so weird it took a minute to realize what was happening. The hurried pics we tried to snap didnt come out too well, but still. Ive never seen anything like that. So between finding a presumable tank under the beach that weve been at for years, and the octopus running back to the ocean fro the woods, it was a fun trip to the beach for sure. It was sad to see how much beach  had washed away though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Navy vet here.  I was stationed on a U.S. destroyer (arleigh burke class, if you want to google the stats of that size ship). The ship was about 505 feet long, and we would avoid serious storms like hurricanes and monsoons.  Literally drive around them. Big Navy wouldn't want us to risk anything more than 20 or so foot waves (hard to be really precise on this, sorry). That gives you an idea of what type of ships would be comfortable risking going through a storm like this. Also, the width of a ship or its &quot;beam&quot; is very important to how it can handle large waves. Some cargo ships might be massive and very long, but the ones that are not as wide won't risk huge waves the way a wider one might.</p>
<p>As to your question about a submarine, I can't speak very precisely on that but my job in the Navy involved knowing a bit about them, so I can answer vaguely. They really don't need to be that low in the water to dodge the effects of something like this. Big storms are generally low pressure areas that allow the wind and lack of pressure pushing down on the water to make enormous waves. A sub would only need to be <em>maybe</em> a few dozen feet below the largest height of the average size wave to not feel much at all. I'm very interested in the rest of your questions, though, as currents might affect a sub more than the waves. Surely, a storm like this does have a large effect just below the surface, and I'm pretty curious to learn about that stuff.</p>
<p>I don't think even the largest cargo ships would risk something that big. Even a couple of boxes lost over the side to hard rolls and high winds could mean thousands or even millions of dollars to them. This sort of thing is a simple cost benefit analysis for them.</p>
<p>There was a documentary or two on &quot;rogue waves&quot; where they showed that in the last decade or so, massive waves really have been captured on film and by measuring instruments. There's a lot of youtube videos of that, but this link is an idea of what HUGE waves (maybe 30+ feet) do to a modern oil rig:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former Submarine sailor here. You are sort of right.  But for hurricanes, we could definitely feel the waves to a few hundred feet underwater.  Big storms also make it difficult to go to periscope depth to get radio messages as well.</p>
<p>Once we were actually doing an practice exercise with a destroyer in the Caribbean when a hurricane or tropical storm rolled through.  The seas made the exercise increasingly more difficult and uncomfortable for all, until the destroyer sent off a message saying that pretty much everyone on board was seasick and they were bugging out.  We went deep and rode out the storm. I will say the soft rocking of the boat is perfect to sleep in.  It's like sleeping in a rocking cradle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Amen, best sleep ever.  I could get 4-5 hours a day at sea and feel better afterwards than 7-8 on land.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about a diesel sub - how do they handle huge storms? They have a low freeboard, and they can't really stay down long enough for the storm to pass? Or can they go down below the weather and stay there for long enough if they are conserving energy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The United States doesn't operate any diesel subs so it's a non issue for us.  As for other countries, they either don't have hurricanes to worry about or they bug out long before it's an issue.  From my limited knowledge of submarine warfare, the countries with diesel fleets are mostly using them for littoral/coastal patrol so they'd have time to get boats to safe harbors or out away from impacted areas.  It's Not like they're just out punching holes in the ocean and stumble upon a tropical storm/hurricane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Waves are measured from trough to crest, so if there are ~30' waves, look at a three story house or an old 3 story building, and you would relatively be at the trough level looking at the crest and body of the wave. </p></div>		</li>
