			<div class="markdown"><p>No!  I’m a psychologist with advanced training in sleep disorders.  Warm baths/showers do help because they raise your internal temp and then as you do your bedtime ritual your body cools creating a sleepy feeling. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/time/4665489/hot-shower-before-bed" target="_blank">time article</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure this is super bad for you, but take a hot shower, get used to the heat, turn it just a few degrees hotter for a minute or two.</p>
<p>Now turn the hot completely off.  Only cold.</p>
<p>Stick your head under the cold water for like 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Now wrap yourself up in a towel, go straight to your bed cause you are about to just straight up pass out.</p>
<p>I had bad migraines to the point I have to sleep them off.  I used to do that when it was so bad I couldn't handle it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, rinsing your head/hair with cold water is recommended for after you clean and condition your hair. Supposedly it helps the hair seal back up after all the heat (heat opens the hair up) and makes it smoother/less frizzy. I find it leaves my hair pretty soft. So maybe not bad for you in that sense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're triggering your dive reflex with the cold water, which lowers your heart rate and constricts blood vessels in the extremities. If you ever need to employ the technique again (hopefully your migraine days are done), you should be able to increase the effect by holding your breath for those thirty seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just heard about this on Joe Rogans podcast a couple weeks ago. Now that I know temperature has so much to do with sleep, I’ve been blasting my ac for 2 hours before bed. Probably placebo, but placebo works a lot of times. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I seem to recall reading somewhere that it might be helpful to take a cool shower before bed. Something about the process of your body working to warm up afterward would help with going to sleep. Seems legit. I don't try it myself because I don't use a hairdryer and if I shower before bed, I'll wake up in the morning with crazy-homeless-guy hair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, a cool shower can encourage or “jump start” the process. I think that it can almost “remind” your brain that hey, it’s nighttime, body’s starting to cool off, bring on the REM! </p>
<p>Also, on the hair thing - if I shower before bed I let my hair air dry, which means it’s impossible in the morning - flat on one side, a kink from my ponytail holder even if it’s so loose it almost falls out, etc. I just stick my head under the tub faucet in the morning to rewet it, then I can blow dry and style the same as right after a full wash. It also blow dries more quickly because even though it seems completely wet, it’s less so than after a full shampoo, condition, and rinse. Saves SO much time!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I always feel groggy and relaxed after using the hot tub at night, but I wonder if it ultimately makes for worse-quality sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might! How often do you hot tub before bed?</p>
<p>Might be like alcohol in that while it makes you feel tired and eventually pass out, er, fall asleep, you’re getting really crappy sleep. Even just a drink or two in the evening negatively affects sleep quality, even though most people think it helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not terribly often in the summer. Couple times a week in the winter. I haven't necessarily noticed that I'm not sleeping well, just found your information interesting. The hot tub helps my wife's fibromyalgia, but there's always the chance the help could be getting somewhat counteracted if she isn't sleeping as well as a result.</p></div>		</li>
