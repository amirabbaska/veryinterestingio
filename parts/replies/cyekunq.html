			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's the same thing with why the US calls soccer, soccer instead of football. The British called it zee at some point and US English speakers just agreed that that's how we're ment to say it and never switched over to zed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whilst the term &quot;soccer&quot; is indeed a British invention, there was never a national consensus within Britain of calling association football &quot;soccer&quot;. That term was used initially and mostly within public schools and universities as a shorthand to distinguish &quot;rugby football&quot; from &quot;association football&quot;. Of course association football became the predominant code, hence common usage eventually just became &quot;rugby&quot; and &quot;football&quot;. Soccer remained popular in countries where the predominant football code wasn't association football.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the soccer/football thing is different. </p>
<p>Americans play a variant of Rugby called Gridiron.     American universities got together in the late 1800's and standardised a set of rules for Rugby which they would use to play amongst themselves.   This caught on pretty well domestically.</p>
<p>The international offshoots of Rugby are still played quite passionately globally under a series of different codes (league, union, etc), and the competitions involve multiple nations.</p>
<p>Australians play a totally different code which is an unusual hybrid of Rugby and Football, which they refer to as &quot;AFL&quot; (and well worth checking out as the gameplay is very energetic).  Believe it or not, the Australian rules are older than the American College rules (by a decade or so). </p>
<p>Rugby itself is a variation of the more traditional game of football, which was played in various villages and tribes around the world in various forms for centuries.   The mainstream game of football, &quot;Association football&quot; is popular worldwide and derives from the formal English/European rules for the game.   It's called &quot;Soccer&quot; in countries that have more prominent football codes to avoid confusion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The game is more of a unique thing in its own right than a rugby football hybrid. It's incredibly fun to watch. </p></div>		</li>

<p>One widely-held theory is that because zed, as the older of the two, was the most widespread variation amongst British English speakers, during the Revolutionary War American English speakers looking to distance themselves from anything even vaguely British simply adopted the zee version as their own to make a stand—no matter how small it might seem—against British control. </p>

<p>I don't buy this for a second.</p></div>		</li>
