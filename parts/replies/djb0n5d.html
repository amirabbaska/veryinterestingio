			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. This just blew my mind. Could this have anything to do with a higher rate of obesity in the south? To be honest I don't even know if there is one, but it would make sense from that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a loose correlation between higher obesity and the south, but by your logic of heat causing less appetite the opposite should be true. iirc it's more of a socioeconomic issue since a lot of southern states are poorer so fast food is the best option if you can't afford to cook.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My girl friend and I have actually found it's significantly cheaper to grocery shop and cook daily than to eat fast food.
As far as obesity in the south and the logic that your body uses less energy to keep cool may actually line up. Since your body uses less energy to keep cool the access food intake without much energy output will contribute to weight gain. Plus the South is popular for its delicious, but horrible for your health fried food. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a link to provide but what I read not too long ago was that, although it should be true that people in the South should tend to be thinner because of the original reply, it began to change with installation of central A/C, which shifted the cultural dynamic regarding activity to staying in as much as possible, which meant increasingly accepting a sedentary lifestyle.</p>
<p>I'm sure other aspects like poor food consumption choices, lack of community programs, distance between areas of interest, and the influx of TV/internet/video games all played their part, as well.</p>
<p>Simply put, why be outside in the heat when you can be inside in a 35 degree cooler difference home in front of the TV, conditioning your body to eat as if it is in cooler months?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume that if someone from the north and south were eating the same amount of food, and the one in the south used less of that food to create body heat, they would store more of it as body fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is partially right. Food is a fuel source yes, but the body doesnt kill appetite because it doesnt need  fuel to stay warm, its because the digestive process itself produces heat. Its called the standard energy of digestion. Protein and fat digestion produces more heat than carbs (this is not the same as heat generated when the calories are burned as fuel). So when you are already hot the body tries to maintain temperature regulation by suppressing your appetite. Source: graduate degree in clinical/biochemical nutrition</p></div>		</li>
