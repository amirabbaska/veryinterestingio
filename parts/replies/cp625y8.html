<p>Consuming pure water in large amounts in a short period of time can cause fluid overload, pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) and electrolyte imbalance causing cardiac arrest.</p>

<p>Brain swelling too. Like you suggested it's due to electrolyte concentration issues.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its hard to say. Age, weight, rate of consumption, kidney function, previous hydration level, preexisting conditions, electrolyte levels, and amount of consumption would all be factors. I have heard of people dying from as little as a gallon chugged over 1 hour. u/BoomjumG provided this link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication</a></p>
<p>Obviously being over hydrated prior to consumption, consuming large amounts in a short period of time, and having a low sodium level will all contribute to higher likelihood of death. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other than a flat flavor there is little difference between distilled and tap water in terms of danger. Water lacks the electrolytes that could cause death. Trace minerals in tap or bottled water are negligible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true. The resistivity of pure water is several orders of magnitude higher than tap water. There are plenty of salts/minerals in water - cells definitely notice the difference.</p></div>		</li>
