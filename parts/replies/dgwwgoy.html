			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also non-water particles (contaminates) in the water as it freezes which cause more air bubbles. Things like dissolved air, chlorine, calcium, lime, etc. Because the water can't form a nice crystalline structure around those contaminates they cause a pocket of not-ice. Not necessarily air, but a bubble no less, which causes the ice to be non-uniform. This in turn causes light to get scattered as it passes through the ice in various directions, making it harder to see clearly through.</p>
<p>If you have a place nearby that sells highly filtered water (reverse osmosis filtered) it will freeze almost perfectly clear with very few air bubbles in it, and as an added bonus it will often &quot;explode&quot; when you put it in water. Not terribly violently or dangerous, but it's fun to watch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting that fridge ice makers are an accessory and don't need to be heavy duty, so they go with the easier and cheaper technology to keep the overall unit price down.</p>
<p>I own a pub/hotel and our ice maker cost almost as much as non commercial fridge freezer with ice maker, but it'll make 50lbs of crystal clear giant ice cubes every 24hrs.</p>
<p>You can always buy a bigger/better/more specialised machine. I've a fishmonger friend that has a machine that will make 1000kg (2200lbs) of crushed ice in 24hrs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure. They get as big as the situation calls for. A customer of mine has a catering business. He had a machine that came off a cruise ship. It makes 20k lbs/ day. It's liquid line receiver holds 500 lbs of R22, which runs like $700/ drum rn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Appliance salesman here. Clear ice makers typically spray ice into an upside down mold one layer at a time. While fridge Ice makers fill a mold ( like an ice cube tray) and let it freeze solid. Doing it the clear ice way is much more expensive as it requires more specialized refrigeration and mechanisms. A clear ice maker also generally is designed so the old ice melts, as the ice holding portion is not refrigerated. This is inherently inefficient, but produces bomb ass ice. A good residential clear ice maker runs 2000+ dollars, where a normal fridge icemaker  is a 2-300 dollar upcharge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. I went to school for water resource management (basically drinking water, wastewater, and all that entails). Dissolve gasses play a much larger role in water quality than most people think. Using brita filters (basically activated carbon/charcoal) on normal tap water does little more than act as an air scrubber. drinking water plants do all the filtering before it reaches your tap. Most use bleach as a disinfectant and since bleach is a salt of chlorine, the salt will dissociate (break apart) into chlorine and it's other constituent. Since chlorine is a gas, it will naturally leave solution if you leave it out in the open (as opposed to the inside of a pressurized pipe). Boiling also drives off gasses while keeping most of the water (what boils off is negligible). </p>
<p>This is why a glass of water that is fresh tastes so different than a glass of water that has been left to sit for several hours, which tastes &quot;stale.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't mean to come come across as know it all douche nozzle with an internet connection, but even without the crate of chemistry and water treatment books, manuals, and guides sitting next to me and several years on the job, I still managed pull up at least one source saying otherwise.

<p>Under &quot;what are the characteristics of of sodium hypochlorite?&quot;, it states &quot;then heated sodium hypochlorite disintegrates.&quot; Now correct me if I'm wrong, but given the preceding and following sentences in that article, I'd take it as yes, chlorine will be driven off by boiling, depending on exact pH and presence of other chemicals.</p>
<p>Seriously, though. Correct me if I'm wrong. I'm always open to learning more and will change my statement and position when provided with new information.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much exactly that way. The ice trays are actually vertical, a pump periodically drizzles water over it and it builds up layers of ice.
Once the ice layer builds up, the ice pushes the a little switch out and that shuts off the condenser and lets the ice tray heat up a bit. Then the ice falls down into the ice storage compartment.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct.  Basically large scale ice makers work like a radiator.  Pump some super cold gas/liquid through while pumping water over the outside.  Once the ice is a certain thickness usually done via timer as it's easier, then turn off water and pump hot stuff through the radiator.  I worked for 2 years at an ice plant the 2 small ice makers would make 20 tons each in 16 hours the large one made 60.  In all we could push about 120 tons of ice a day a full tilt and that was an 8-9 hour day depending on the bags we were running.  Our ice makers ran on an ammonia system which was fine unless one of the pipes broke, which happened once. That was a call to the EPA as you could not go near anything without massive respirators.  That week sucked in general.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>correct.  the tray is cooled, and water runs across it slowly layering ice until the tray is full.</p></div>		</li>
