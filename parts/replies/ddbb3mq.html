			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak to every single animal in existence, but cats don't really express pain. If you hurt a cat you'll likely get hissed at, or maybe even yowled at, but those are threats. An injured cat will conceal its injury most of the time. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Rabbit screams are freaky as hell, I've heard them a few times.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Since genes are what matters, not individual survival, behavior that makes other close relatives more likely to survive is more likely to get passed on.</p>

<p>But that's not how evolution works - survival of the fittest dictates that an organism that has favorable genes is more likely to survive longer, and therefore more likely to pass these favorable genes on to the next generation. The injured animal in your example is increasing the odds that it will die. Thus, its genes don't get passed on. The benefit to the group is irrelevant - the genes die with the individual that has them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read The Selfish Gene. Your understanding of evolution is too focused on individual animals. If I die protecting my sister's children,  my genes get passed on. Similarly, if an animal, which shares significant genes with its pack, makes a lot of noise when dying and saves the rest of the pack, its genes get passed on. Whether an individual animal lives or dies, mates or fails, is irrelevant to whether or not its genes get passed on.  </p>
<p>In short, to reply directly to your edit, evolution does not work in favor of individuals. Evolution works in favor of genes that get passed on. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I can't pretend to be any kind of expert on evolution, and I'm not trying to be pushy about this. I'm just trying to wrestle with the concept. In my understanding, I guess I can see how there may be one way this could work, but it's kind of counter to the concept of the survival of the fittest. </p>
<p>The gene that gives an organism an overwhelming urge to scream out in pain had to start somewhere. Just like with every other trait, that somewhere would have been a mutation, meaning there was a time when (if we're assuming this trait started with pack animals) there was only one member of a group that had this trait. Now, I think we agree that an organism's advertising its weakness to the world makes it more likely for that animal to die. This may be good for the pack, but it's bad for the animal - especially if it's the first animal to have this mutation because then the trait would die with it. Survival of the fittest - and if this animal is less fit, it's less likely to survive.</p>
<p>Now, say that animal, despite having this weakness, were to get lucky and survive anyways and pass this weakness on to its offspring, and they also survive long enough to do the same, etc. etc. If this weakness were to survive long enough (despite being a weakness) to be spread through the population, well now I think you're right and (while it remains a weakness for the individual) it turns into a strength for the group, and now that we have a group where that gene is prevalent, the gene is still allowed to pass on to the next generation. </p>
<p>But the gene needs to reach that critical mass first. That's counter to survival of the fittest, but it's not impossible for this to happen either. </p></div>		</li>
