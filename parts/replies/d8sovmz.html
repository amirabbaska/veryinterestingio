			<div class="markdown"><p>In audio testing you need quite a good source of white noise, which is these days done using very large Linear Feedback Shift Registers but used to be done with a reverse-biased diode.  The advantage of a diode is that the output is truly random (it's down to whether or not an electron jumps across the gap, a bit like Geiger counters and radioactive decay) but the output amplitude can drift.  LFSRs have fairly consistent output but produce pseudorandom noise, which might or might not make a difference to your measurement.</p>
<p>Very old LFSR designs used in music synthesizers were like the MM5837 chip which was very short (17 bits) so at a typical clock speed for audio use of 40kHz they would repeat their cycle about every three seconds.  Surprisingly you could actually hear when the LFSR looped back around as a distinct &quot;chusshhchussshchusshchussh&quot; effect - this is a genuine real-world instance of a not-random-enough pseudorandom number generator.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're incorrect about the CCD thingy in casinos. I am pretty darned familiar with slot machine hardware as a casino technician and publisher of Slot Tech Magazine and I've never seen such a thing. It's really just a soft RNG (meaning it's really, really, really good but not perfectly random in all respects). With slot machines, true randomness isn't quite as important as unpredictability.</p></div>		</li>
