I also think the op is conflating emotions (happy, sad) with moods like manic or depressive, emotions will only last a short while without being reinforced moods are not as strong but can last months and put you in a state more likely to feel the corresponding emotion.</p>
<p>I would recommend looking more into it if it interests you, there are some good books on the subject.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it almost sounds like we are engineered via natural selection to not be truly content, because being truly satisfied means you don't have to do anything.  Why do anything when you're happy and high all the time?  Feeling like something is always missing seems to keep you motivated more.</p>
<p>Further thought edit:  well that sucks, no wonder the world is filled with depressed and anxious people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In evolution the organism wins that can access a resource better than others. Being complacent/content with the way things are means the more competitive species will probably invade your space and push you out. There are some species who have been solidly lodged in their niche for millions of years, but those niches often aren't all that appealing to begin with. For the nicer spots in nature, the competition is fierce.</p>
<p>Humans are wimpy, lanky creatures, no scales, no claws, tiny teeth, the only thing we're physically good at is running long distances, and simulating different realities in our brains. The joke is, at that stage, we anticipate things to be much more enjoyable, and the joy to last much longer than it actually does. Our brains pull mean tricks  to keep us going in more than one spot.</p></div>		</li>
