			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, language learning difficulty is very much dependent on native languages and other languages one knows. The Foreign Service Institute has created a <a href="http://www.effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty" target="_blank">tier system of languages</a> based on average class hours required for a native English speaker to learn them.</p>
<p>Generally, Romance and Germanic languages are the easiest for English speakers (not surprising, since English is a Germanic language with a quarter of its vocabulary from French and another quarter from Latin), then certain lingua francas (Indonesian and Swahili), then other Indo-European languages, then most other languages, then Arabic and East Asian languages.</p>
<p>Other languages have different 'tier' lists, mostly based on genetic relation (linguistic families) and shared vocabulary. For instance, for Mandarin speakers, other Chinese languages are the easiest, probably followed by Japanese (due to shared vocabulary and characters), then Korean and Vietnamese. In particular, French is considered quite difficult for Chinese speakers, although it is one of the easiest for English speakers.</p>
<p>Note, however, that it also depends on which combination of the four main skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing) one is learning, and varies wildly from person to person, with the most important factor of course being motivation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how often it's updated, but I wouldn't think it's the sort of information that would change much over time anyway. I don't know that much about Arabic, but the Japanese writing system alone makes me inclined to agree with Japanese being harder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as someone who knows basic chinese and japanese (though not a native speaker of either) the similarity of characters actually really pisses me off sometimes because there are enough differences to trip you up, especially as China (except Hong Kong) uses simplified characters, and Japan uses the traditional characters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japan doesn't use traditional characters. Japan undertook its own simplification process independently from Mainland China and is kind of a half-and-half. Characters that tend to trip you up will usually be those that have <em>undergone simplification</em> in both scripts but in a slightly different manner, further complicated for online learners by something called &quot;<a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Han_unification" target="_blank">CJK unification</a>&quot; in text encoding:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%B8%8E" target="_blank">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%B8%8E</a> (Chinese doesn't stroke through, Japanese strokes through)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%94%BB" target="_blank">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%94%BB</a> (Chinese separates the 田 from the 一, Japanese extends the vertical stroke and joins them)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%AF%8E" target="_blank">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%AF%8E</a> (Japanese replaces the two dots with a stroke -- but the base character 母 remains written with two dots in Japanese)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8D%98" target="_blank">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8D%98</a> (Three dots in Japanese, two in simplified Chinese)</p>
<p>and my personal favourite:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%AA%A8" target="_blank">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%AA%A8</a> (Japanese and traditional Chinese have the small square on the <em>right</em>, simplified Chinese has it on the <em>left</em>, and this extends to other characters such as 過 which may display completely wrongly thanks to the aforementioned CJK unification)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the overlap of phonemic inventory.  Spanish and Japanese have extremely similar phonemic inventories, which makes Spanish surprisingly easy to learn for Japanese speakers and vice-versa.  This really only effects the ease of acquiring good pronunciation, though.  Virtually anyone can learn to have very good pronunciation in any language given enough time and instruction, but it's going to take an English speaker longer to master Chinese phonemes than Spanish ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Is it easier for some people to learn certain languages than others?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely! Some languages are closely related to each other, others are only distantly related, and this is more or less a continuous scale. It's far easier to learn languages that are similar to your first language, since there are fewer new concepts.</p>
<p>For example, French is generally considered a comparatively easy language for a native English speaker. Of course there is a certain amount of common vocabulary due to the Latin heritage and so on, but it is also structured relatively similarly, in global terms. There are some new concepts, like extra ways to conjugate verbs and almost everything having gender, but the grammar broadly functions similarly.</p>
<p>Chinese is much harder for an English speaker to learn, and one major reason is the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_%28linguistics%29#Mechanics" target="_blank">tone</a>. In English, tone is used to convey emotion or context, indicating sarcasm, humour, questions, and so on. In French, tone is used in a broadly similar way, but in Chinese, it serves as the sole way to distinguish different words (often with entirely different meanings).</p>
<p>There can also be almost physical difficulties in learning the phonemes required for another language, since no language makes use of all the sounds that a human can produce. Famously, several Southern African languages have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_consonant" target="_blank">dozens of consonants produced by clicking the tongue in different ways</a> (none of which exist in English), but there are plenty of more ordinary sounds that are not present in all languages. For example, the Arabic letters &quot;ه&quot; and &quot;ح&quot; have distinct pronunciations, but both sounds like an &quot;h&quot; to most English speakers.</p>
<p>It's tempting to look at the subjectively difficult bits of other languages and think that English is comparatively simple, but there are equal complications for people trying to learn English as a second language. For example, Russian has no articles, causing native speakers of Russian to struggle with where to place &quot;a&quot; and &quot;the&quot; in English, and Japanese people learning English can have difficulty with &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot; sounds, which are not distinguished in Japanese.</p>
<p>I've probably picked too many examples, but my point is that there there can be aspects </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: It all depends on how different the student's native language is from the language they wish to learn, and all human languages have both similarities and differences.</strong></p></div>		</li>

<p>Just to nitpick, English does not have a Latin heritage. Is is a Germanic language. It is descended from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Germanic_language" target="_blank">Proto-Germanic</a>. Proto-Germanic is also an ancestor of modern German, but it is <strong>not</strong> the same thing as German. English and French (and the vast majority of European languages) have a common ancestor in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language" target="_blank">Proto Indo-European</a>. French has also had direct influence on English as a result of the Norman conquest, but it was mostly loanwords, not changing the grammar.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not a Romance language, but it does has an exceptional amount of Latin-derived vocabulary for a non-Romance language (much of it dating back to before the Norman conquest, due to pre-migration contact with the Roman Empire, and later to the adoption of Christianity).</p></div>		</li>
