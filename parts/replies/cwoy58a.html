			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I think there are some aspects to the fire itself which slipped the media and which are important in understanding the full picture. </p>
<p>1). Bucharest is a big city, and also a very young city, with many universities and people coming here to study. It was voted recently by some famous foreign magazine as the second best city in the world for youngsters to live in, following Lisbon, by criteria such as the number of young people in the entire city population, price of rent/sqm, price of beer, etc. It has a very young and energetic vibe.</p>
<p>2) The fire didn't occured in a regular &quot;night club&quot;. When I think of the idea of a night club, I imagine more or less a promiscuous setting and crowd. This wasn't an underground night club/pub such as those in the old town, which are so famous. It was a &quot;cool place&quot; were the youngsters loved to gather, set in the building of an old communist factory. It was a place famous for concerts of underground bands. I don't think the reaction would have been the same if one of the posh clubs, where the rich folks gather and use to park their Rolls Royces and Lambos in the front, would have burned down.</p>
<p>3) The band that was singing was a heavy metal band. Romania is a church state (otrhodox) and the church itself kept quiet, as they saw this tragic event as a punishment to those unfaithful. This is something that also infuriated the youngsters , the more educated, and less religious society in general.</p>
<p>4) The people who died were regular, smart, young people, from normal families and everybody found some common grouds to their stories and could easily put themselves in their shoes in this tragedy. For example, many young architects, IT engineers (there were many Oracle employees who were injured and 3 of them died), students, freelancers, artists, were in &quot;Colectiv&quot; that evening. You can imagine, the type of people who would love an underground rock band. </p>
<p>I hope this clarifies a bit the starting point to the street movements, which are more complex in terms of demands. Basically, it is a clash of new and old, of young people who want to live in a normal and civilized European society against a relaxed, corrupted and innefective central administration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your third point is something that really pisses me off. People saying they deserved it for celebrating Halloween and listening to 'satanic' music. There were no priests at the club offering there blessings or support to people paying their respects and grieving because they 'weren't invited' (yet they happily knock on doors uninvited to bless homes and expect money). Aaand the fact theres like 8 thousand odd churches to which they build about 3 new ones a week. Yet only 450 hospitals in the country that couldn't even cope with the injuries obtained from that fire. <em>God</em> forbid some bigger disaster.</p>
<p>EDIT: 18000 churches not 8000</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Come on, stop with this idiocy. The problem is not lack of hospitals, the problem si that those that exist are understaffed and underequipped. Having 8000 hospitals would be absurd, you're just comparing random numbers at this point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that the fact that it was an underground Club that played rock and underground and not commercial or manele music plays a fact in the outrage. I would of been just as mad if it was a club full of Florin Salam fans that cannot string a sentence properly, as much as i hate that genre of music. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on this doesn't this fit in the current theory?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let Turkey fall into a dictatorship</p>
<p>US/NATO boots Turkey out or distance it. </p>
<p>Support the kurds and aid them to fight ISIS.</p>
<p>Any land taken from ISIS is given to the kurds to make their own country</p>
<p>New kurd state neighbour to Turkey creates even more tension, possible future war in Turkey</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall I wouldn't bet my money to do anything in Turkey. Unless it's selling arms. I think it will be most likely a war zone in the near future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard, because you got the West bribing people on one side and the Russians bribing people on the other. If someone refuses a bribe then they're in a worst position compared to the peers that do take it as they get the external support. Say nobody takes a bribe then the super powers will cause problems for the country. They're in a shit position all round like a lot of countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just pay attention to what new political class you wish for. You may get to have a new one but you may not get to choose which one. See what happened in Italy right after Berlusconi and what's happening now with Renzi. What was promised as a new way of doing politics after years of corruption is, in fact, just a way to bow our heads to other powers that dictate what's good and what's not. Plus the same ole' corruption. </p>
<p>Your situation looks a lot like ours but at least some of your criminal scum moved here because how crappy our criminal law is and how good our prisons are.</p></div>		</li>
