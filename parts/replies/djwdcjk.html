			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer, but probably not in simple enough language. I will try simplify it.</p>
<p>It's simple law of conservation of energy. The power grid mostly works by converting mechanical energy to electrical energy. So when you turn something on, the power grid responds by sapping more mechanical energy from a turbine. Simply put, the turbine slows down if too much power is drawn (and speeds up if too little is drawn).</p>
<p>You essentially can keep the correct power output by maintaining the proper speed on the turbines. Sort of like giving more gas going uphill or braking when going downhill to keep your car at the speed limit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the TV programs I've seen discussing power issues when all of the UK turn on their kettles at once (eg due to an extremely popular TV show finishing) they've said that they judge their success by ensuring that the 50Hz AC mains stays within their acceptable tolerance for frequency.  </p>
<p>Is the mains frequency (50hz UK/60Hz USA) produced proportional to the speed the turbines are spinning?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, the frequency generated is determined by the RPM of the generator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>60 Hz generators that I commission (I build and test power aboard very large US Warships) all run at 900 rpm but all of them multiples of 60 at one time they were 1200 rpm but it caused problems with damage to turbines and Diesel engines. It really has as much to do with the way the generator end is wound. A generator is a set of bare copper wire wound around an iron core spinning inside a big iron donut wound in bare copper wire. An excitation voltage is applied to the iron core called the rotor which induces a voltage in the donut called a stator. The frequency is determined by how fast the rotor is spinning in relation to the stator and the output voltage is determined by the magnitude of the excitation voltage applied to the rotor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Texas has its own power grid called ERCOT run by the same company. It's independent but it has ties to one of the other US power grid and Mexico in case of emergency or need for more production on either end. It's meant for Independence and it also does not need to follow federal regulations because the power grid is not inter state. No cons as far as I can see, they'll get power no matter what due to their connections to other power grids but remain largely independent</p></div>		</li>
