			<div class="markdown"><p>Technology and the rise of social media is a huge part of it. As a stay at home mom, I'm the perfect mark for these scams, and I'm constantly hearing &quot;you don't need to throw parties like our moms did, in your own home. You can do it all online!&quot; So they make it sound easy - you're on Facebook anyway, why not just sell stuff on there to your friends? You don't need to throw a party and invite a bunch of relative strangers over, just add them to a Facebook group and hope they buy your crap. </p>
<p>They also prey on the insecurities of women. You're at home caring for kids all day, don't you want to earn extra income for your family? Earn &quot;free&quot; vacations to Disneyland? Own your own company and be your own boss? </p>
<p>I just wish my fellow stay at home moms would do a little more research before falling for this crap. We don't buy things on Amazon without reading reviews. Maybe google the company before your sign up to peddle their wares.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your response! I had long expected that they marketed in the way you described in your first paragraph. I live in a pretty nice neighborhood, significantly nicer than the neighborhood I lived in before, and I see lots of cars with signs and stickers from various mlms on them in my upper-middle class+neighborhood. There was even a story on the local news about the regional Mary Kay head who earned another &quot;free vacation&quot; or car or some crap in my neighborhood. This kind of attention definitely gives people and unrealistic expectation. She is the head of her network, meaning everyone in the mlm in our area goes through her. It's not like they are selling toilet paper or anything essential. There is only but so much market. And this lady has it all through her minions. She makes money off every party they have, off every sale, every new person the sign up. It frustrated me and my wife to all hell. People are going to aspire to a goal that isn't just unachievable but impossible.l</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder how regional this stuff is. I've heard of MLM's from stuff like this post, but have never encountered one in the wild. You make it sound very widespread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your mom's right, this is nothing new. </p>
<p>Avon's been around since the 1800s (seriously). More recently, there was Amway in the 60s, Tupperware in the 70s, Mary Kay in the 80s (ask mom about the pink Cadillacs), and PartyLite candles in the 90s. </p>
<p>The methods have changed a bit, as social media replaced real life gatherings in homes, churches, schools, and so on. But in my experience the reasons why people do it have always been the same: make more money on a flexible schedule with no formal education required. </p></div>		</li>

<p>We are trying to find ways to talk people out of mlms and so I highly enjoy learning more about this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Introduce doubt....never argue.</p>
<p>For example, ask them what their profit and loss ratio was.</p>
<p>Chances are it will be very bad. Point out that if a business is failing, you should cut ties and move on. The logic might not sink in immediately but hopefully over time....doubt grows internally once introduced if it's based on fact. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: student says she has heard you can make great money selling plexus. Asking the student if plexus seemed like something they would buy in the store was enough to get them thinking maybe this isn't a good idea</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tell them she's seen a lot of students join plexus and all of them have lost $XXX of dollars. Don't slam it.....just state the facts and treat them like an intelligent person who can make an informed decision. </p>
<p>If they still join after that it's likely for other reasons(social). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! Yeah while the mlm thing was big in our old town it wasn't as big, just popular among military spouses and stay at home wife's. Here it's much larger and she teaches in a significantly poorer area, where these kids don't get a lot of parental guidance</p></div>		</li>
