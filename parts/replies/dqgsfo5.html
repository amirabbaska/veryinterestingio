<p>Any black hole more massive than the moon is colder than the cosmic microwave background. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That would seem to mean that even if there's no other mass or energy falling in, the black hole would slowly gain mass just from the microwave background photons.</p>
<p>So a black hole of any significant size can't even start to get any smaller, until the universe expands a lot more and the cosmic background cools further. Is that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How exactly is the temperature of black holes defined? It's certainly not the average speed of atoms as in normal matter, since black holes don't have atoms. Is it the temperature of radiation given of by the black hole? I'm not really up on my understanding of the types of radiation that they can emit. I've heard of Hawking radiation, is that related?</p>
<p>Edit: apparently black holes aren't degenerate matter. Got mixed up with neutron stars. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hawking radiation is blackbody radiation given off by a black hole and is determined by its temperature. Temperature in general has to do with the relationship between entropy and energy. The energy of a black hole is proportional to its mass, and the entropy of a black hole was shown by Hawking and Bekenstein to be proportional to its surface area, so from this it's possible to calculate a temperature. Black holes aren't degenerate matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>u/iorgfeflkd talked about two different temperatures. The first one, which is very cold, is the Hawking temperature. To a coarse approximation, the wavelength of the emitted radiation is comparable  or larger than the black hole event horizon.</p>
<p>The other temperature u/iorgfeflkd mentioned is that of the infalling matter accelerated towards the hole. That matter is outside and the temperature is defined as usual here for a gas.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why doesn't this go against the second law?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mass in the black hole is essentially being converted into Hawking radiation and radiating away. The amount of Hawking Radiation released is proportional to the inverse square of mass of the black hole. This means the smaller the black hole gets(from Hawking radiation) the more Hawking radiation gets released. So near the end of its life, a black hole theoretically should be releasing lots of energy. In the last few moments of its life a black hole should basically explode.</p>
