			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you are thinking of <a href="http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v90/n3/full/6800237a.html" target="_blank">this paper</a>, whose title almost directly matches OP's question: &quot;<strong>The Great Wall of China: a physical barrier to gene flow?</strong>&quot; It's conclusion is similar to what you describe, quoting from the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One population from each of six plant species along both sides of the Juyong-guan Great Wall, together with one population from each of five species along both sides of a path on a mountain top near Juyong-guan, were selected to study the effect of the Great Wall as a barrier on genetic differentiation between two subpopulations using RAPD markers. Significant genetic differentiation was found between the subpopulations on both sides of the Great Wall. [...] <strong>Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the Juyong-guan Great Wall has served as a physical barrier to gene flow between subpopulations separated for more than 600 years.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This paper provides a nice piece of direct evidence showing how physical separation can lead to genetic divergence even over the course of a &quot;short&quot; period such as a few centuries. In fact this study is a textbook example of this process (at least it was included in one of my textbooks on introductory genetics). Unfortunately I couldn't find a source that specifically talked about animals as OP asked, but hopefully someone working closer to the field will chime in later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a slightly similar topic... the bio-diversity increased within the 'no-man's-land' along the former east-west German border to such an extent that it's now been/being turned into a kind of nature reserve (<a href="http://e360.yale.edu/feature/along_scar_from_iron_curtain_a_green_belt_rises_in_germany/2390/" target="_blank">http://e360.yale.edu/feature/along_scar_from_iron_curtain_a_green_belt_rises_in_germany/2390/</a>).  There are many endangered species of plants and animals that live in there.</p></div>		</li>

The difference is a bit more striking because of the reckless disregard for biodiversity (and all things environmental) on both sides of the fence, and also because that fence is still up with no signs of coming down any time soon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really doesn't take that long in some cases. Even the finches at the Galapagos are evolving right before our eyes. But a classic example of how quick adaptations can occur is the peppered moth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dark-coloured or melanic moths (carbonaria variety) were not known prior to 1811. After field collection in 1848 from Manchester, an industrial city in England, the frequency of the variety was found to have increased drastically. By the end of the 19th century it almost completely outnumbered[not specific enough to verify] the original light-coloured type (typica variety). </p>
