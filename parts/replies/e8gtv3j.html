			<div class="markdown"><p>It should also be noted that the index of refraction is c/phase velocity and the phase velocity can be faster than c. So you can get index of refractions that are less than 1 and light appears to speed up in those mediums. This does not break any rules because group velocity is what has to be less than or equal to c.</p></div>		</li>

Speed of information is the mininum(Vp,Vg).</p></div>		</li>

<p>How much the electrons oscillate also depends on how close the frequency of the light is to the electron-nucleus bound system, which is why refractive index varies by wavelength.</p>

<p>Wait a minute, is <em>this</em> why refracting prisms split white light into a rainbow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in fact all bulk dielectrics have some dispersion by wavelength.  Some are better than others (SiO2 happens to be great in this regard... for NIR).</p></div>		</li>

<p>What do you mean by this? I cant imagine it in my head.</p>
