			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but I only have to know the insurance laws that apply to them - most insurance laws that matter to me actually apply to everything, and there are a few specific ones.  But even though I work a lot with construction companies, I don't have to know a lot of the health and safety laws they need to follow, for example. Unless they break some of those laws and we have to pay a liability claim!</p></div>		</li>
