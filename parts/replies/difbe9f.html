<p>That's not the only assumption being made here.  Your calculations are assuming that the gravitational pull of the planet stems from it's center regardless of its shape.  While that may be true for a sphere, it may not be true  for an oblate spheriod.  The gravitational pull is more spread out at the poles, compared to the equator, so there are cosine variations to account for.</p></div>		</li>
