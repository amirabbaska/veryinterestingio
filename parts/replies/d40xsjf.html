			<div class="markdown"><p>Europa is a special case being in an orbit about Jupiter.  Its like a cross between an ice ball like Pluto and Jupiter's moon Io, which is a mess of volcano's due to tidal heating.  It is suspected that tidal heating gives Europa subsurface oceans--not any sort of pressure related phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Europa has a lot of water in it, so do a lot of the bodies out beyond Mars. Water is a lighter molecule and we find lighter stuff out towards the edge of the solar system. But this water also isn't &quot;free&quot;. It's molecularly bonded up with the rock. So even though Europa likely and arguably has a mantle of a few hundred miles of H2O, below that it's probably a molecular mixture of rock AND H2O.
Tldr? It's probably like a soup bread bowl, lots of soup, then soggy bread for a while, then bread. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>answer is that any size blob of liquid water will partially boil off in to space</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have two questions about your answer: One, in space would not the water entirely boil off and entirely freeze? This is my understanding of experiments done on the space station. The difference between the video you cite and space must be taken into account. The pace of boiling will be so much faster than internal freezing and heat transfer that the water &quot;should&quot; boil off before it has a chance to freeze, then it freezes.</p>
<p>Secondly, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>high enough pressure to stop the boiling, which is also hot enough to prevent freezing by conventional means.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it not true that sufficient pressure will force a solid state of water? In other words, while pressure will increase temperature and mitigate freezing, there are pressures at which a solid will be formed &quot;anyways&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will partially freeze and leave behind some ice independent of the rate of boiling vs. rate of freezing because the energy to boil off water must come from the mass of boiling water itself.  The energy required to vaporize water is way, way higher than the energy to melt/freeze water, but if the mass of water is really, really tiny, or starts off very hot, it may not get cold enough to freeze before fully boiling, but who can say at the molecular level how many very small ice crystals might remain?  Even if its just a bit of snow, that's still a &quot;core of ice.&quot;  And we know that solid ice sticks around in a vacuum because we have things like comets, KBOs and moons, some made almost entirely of solid ice and are without atmospheres.  Plus all the ice that hangs around things like the space shuttle in orbit.</p>
<p>And in the second case you mentioned, /u/RobusEtCeleritas analysis would likely be representative of what happens in the center of the mass of water--though to produce large enough an atmosphere to prevent boiling off of surface water one would likely need a much larger sphere than his analysis claims is necessary to fuflfill OPs criteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps a rephrasing of the question would shed some insight? Let's assume there is a cloud of water particles and ONLY water. What is the minimum and maximum amount of matter that could coalesce into a planet AND maintain a liquid surface? If surface temperature is needed lets go with 25C again.</p>
<p>What kind of atmosphere would this produce? Is it needed to ward off solar radiation? Can a water only planet produce a magnetosphere? Assume what you need to assume in order to make planet stable with as little outside influence as possible (i.e. does it need to be in the goldilocks zone in order to maintain liquid surface or can internal heat suffice?).</p></div>		</li>
