<p>ASPD w/ Factor two traits (Sociopathy) can and do recognize that something is missing. But the thing is, sociopathy isn't something that the person was born with. The way they were treated as a child lead up to them being that way. </p>

<p>So how did they come to this conclusion? how could they totally eliminate nature for some of these issues, not saying you/they are wrong just curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's where my knowledge may be a bit limited, but the age old argument is Psychopathy was born because of the significant changes within the brain, where the amygdala is 18% smaller with so many other changes within their brains. But that's not saying they can't be affected by their envrionment, because they can. If a psychopath isn't taught well, they will have a quite a huge hurdle to work with. Which could lead them to committing crimes and being overall more anti social. </p>
<p>But because <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130924174331.htm" target="_blank">the significance in the brain differences</a> between psychopaths and NTs (Neurotypicals; Normal functioning brains) that it is definitely seen as a neurological disorder, akin to how Aspergers is, but in a different ball park entirely. </p>
<p>From here I'm a little out of my league when it comes to sociopathy, but what it is known that the behaviors they exhibit stem from the way the world had treated them. The way the world shaped their way of thinking. Because of the abuse they had experienced, the genes for psychopathy were activated after birth, because of said abuse and trauma. But epigenetics is in it's early days and we still don't really know. </p>
<p>But it is widely known that it is actually rather unknown and hard to pinpoint it. All we have is little tid bits of information, so everything that is surrounding the fundamentals of the formation is incredibly speculative and hard to even get scientific proof of. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can pitch in a neuroscientist.  Modern literature seems to suggest that it's a (as is often the case) a genetic vulnerability that is triggered via environmental stressors.  These stressors act on several circuits in the brain, primarily what's commonly referred to as Limbic circuitry (don't start on that can of worms).  Inhibition of basal tone of significant portions of the amygdala lead to down-regulation of other circuits which are critical to things like empathy and perspective taking, also other circuits such as inhibitory tone of aggressive impulses.  </p>
<p>Obviously a lot is still unknown/tenuous, but at my last check of the literature that seemed to be the state of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't entirely true. Psychopathy is the personality disorder most caused by genetics (along with schizophrenia) and can often be detected as early as toddler aged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for bulging in, but others in this thread seem to claim that sociopathy and psychopathy are the same, and that the sociopathy concept should not be used. Even those who claim to be in the psychology field. You seem very expert-y so what is the difference really? I would think that the difference is whether it's a physiological versus environmental disorder but reading this fascinating thread has confused me entirely. The same goes for the difference between empathy and sympathy. </p>
<p>Hope you, as an expert, could clear this up a bit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A side note, you can be diagnosed as a psychopath with the current ASPD spectrum. You would be labeled as ASPD+P if you score highly on the factor 1 traits. But sadly, ASPD is predominately based upon behavior instead of traits. So many potential noncriminal psychopaths and sociopaths will go unnoticed with the current structure. This should change with time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmZgnCHweLM" target="_blank">There's also a great theory from Joseph Newman's research about Psychopathy. Give it a once over</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I'm more or less talking about being able to diagnose someone that does not have a predominantly criminal background. So what it gets at is making the disorder more or less it's own thing, something that is more on the lines of a neurological disorder. But also harkening back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mask_of_Sanity" target="_blank">Cleckley's list of traits of psychopaths</a>, instead of relying on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy_Checklist" target="_blank">Hare's overly behavioral approach.</a> (Robert Hare's checklist is heavily based upon Cleckley's work)</p>
<p>Hope that makes what I said more clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It interferes with the ability to study and gain insight into the disorders to only catch a small segment of the population, not necessarily representative of the population as a whole. Atm, while most people with aspd are nonviolent, those we are exposed to for research purposes are largely found in the prison population. Treatment and other considerations would be a factor too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Factor two is sort of more of the sociopathic traits, the anti social traits in hare's checklist. It's sort of considered to be secondary psychopathy but a lot of this stuff is not set in stone, so from different people and even people in the field there is no real common consensus overall.</p></div>		</li>
