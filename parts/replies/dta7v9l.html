The &quot;wobble&quot; of a star+planet orbiting around their shared center of mass that is a different, larger effect.  The easiest way to see such a wobble is to look at the color of the star, and see if it gets redder and bluer with a cyclical pattern.</p>

That's how much redder or bluer its light is when it reaches us compared to when it was emitted. We can tell this by looking at the characteristic absorption or emission patterns of various molecules, which occur at particular, well-known wavelengths. If the star is moving away from us, then its light gets stretched out (from our perspective), so all these lines move to larger (or redder) wavelengths. Similarly, if it's moving towards us, then the light gets bluer.</p>
<p>So by splitting a star's light into different frequencies and seeing precisely at which wavelengths this emission and absorption occurs, we can figure out whether it's moving towards or away from us, and at what speed. Where the &quot;wobble&quot; comes in is that, assuming the wobble is aligned with our line-of-sight, this will cause small fluctuations in the star's speed. While it's a small effect, it's something that we can now measure for many stars, as long as a) the star is nearby, and b) the planet is heavy and close to the star, which maximizes the effect. This is why most of the planets discovered with this method are so-called &quot;hot Jupiters,&quot; very massive (often more than Jupiter) planets which orbit extremely close to their host star (often closer than Mercury).</p></div>		</li>
