			<div class="markdown"><p>As an autistic person, this is a good answer. Thank you for working with us. I would add that eccentric narrow interests, even if they seem useless, can be <em>adapted</em> to employment.  For example, with the right training and workplace support, someone who wakes up in the morning and spends hours memorizing the bus schedule would be invaluable to any city trying to update their bus routes. Someone with this type of narrow interest can be trained not just to identify inefficient bus routes but prevent inefficiency when a new bus line is added. The tricky thing is convincing employers that we're worth hiring and our unusual skillset is very much needed, especially if &quot;there's an app for that.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My narrow interests vary, but are almost always scientific with a striking visuals. If I write about something I always end up drawing it. For example, I'm scared of house spiders (cellar, true house spiders, and hobo spiders) because they are boring but I will sit in the garden for hours sketching an orb spider and spend hours on my computer researching orb spiders because they are so beautiful. I could write and illustrate an entire book about big, colorful, and unusual spiders but have a panic attack trying to draw an average spider.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! This is my attitude too, try to adapt it to employable skills. I've been teaching a lot of computer coding. It doesn't always click but is useful when it does. Computer science involves a lot of critical thinking, though, but there are a couple small companies dedicated to giving autistic folks jobs in software quality assurance. It works, some times.</p></div>		</li>
