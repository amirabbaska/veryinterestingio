			<div class="markdown"><p>Like other folks have said, there's lots going on... but here's another ELI5 answer:</p>
<p>The acid in our tummies is actually really strong (pH of 2 is pretty low for living creatures) but it's only strong like an acid and can only do acid things.  Like a strong weightlifter can pick up a really heavy barbell, but he couldn't lift hardly any water, because he can't grab it.  </p>
<p>Some things our acids can grab (like living bacteria and their proteins), and some things they can't (like some toxins produced by bacteria, or very well shielded viruses).  </p>
<p>That's why we have lots of other things going on in there - sometimes the enzymes are just like giving our weightlifter a big bucket! Other times we need to cook things before we eat it - maybe this would be like freezing some water so we can grab it.  And some times, we just need to be careful what we eat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP is half right, only. </p>
<p>So your stomach typically always has a bit of acid in it. It's not like a fish bowl full of acid, it's like more of a damp surface of acid and mucous (and, like OP said, other stuff).</p>
<p>Lots of bacteria, in fact, do just get dissolved by the acid because...well, it's strong acid and not a lot can survive a wade through that puddle.</p>
<p>How do they get through and make you sick, then? There's a couple things that dictate this; can they piggy back inside something that you've eaten? How much of them are there?</p>
<p>If you've eaten a bunch of potato chips and then scarf down a tainted burger, that tainted burger might only get partially dissolved before moving into your intestine.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you just ate an entire pan of gnarly tuna casserole...well, that's just too many damn bacteria for your stomach to dissolve, and they're gonna pass through. Imagine you had a 2 foot pool of acid in a moat around your house. 3 zombies trying to get you would just lead to them getting dissolved in the acid, while 30,000 zombies trying to get to you would lead to the formation of a &quot;zombie bridge&quot; because the acid couldn't get all of them in one run.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, food poisoning isn't caused by bacteria surviving the stomach acid. You're more properly describing an infection as a result of food being undercooked. </p>
<p>Food poisoning is caused by the bacteria previously having lived in the piece of food for a while, and in doing so they have excreted certain chemicals (toxins) that make us sick. The bacteria die in the stomach, but the toxins produced by some species are acid-resistant, and so pass through. Hence the term food <em>poisoning</em> and not food <em>infection</em>, because the damage isn't done by live bacteria. This is also the reason why you're never sick with food poisoning for more than, say, eight hours. You're not infected, so once the toxin has passed through it's over.</p>
<p>The best way to protect yourself against food poisoning is to (1) keep food refridgerated, as then the bacterial colonies grow slower, so they don't have time to produce so much toxins before you eat the food. (2) Do your best not to introduce bacteria into food unless it's cooking or going to be cooked soon, so no touching the food after cooking, and don't put utensils in there which has been in your mouth. (3) Don't let leftovers get too old, because even in the refridgerator you only slow down the bacterial progress, it's not halted completely. Following these three rules makes it extremely unlikely that you get poisoned.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To take it one step further some bacteria are acid labile, and others are acid stable.  The acid labile ones (such as Salmonella) dissolve easily in the acidic environment of the stomach, so you need a lot of them (10,000+ or to have them well hidden) for them to make it through.  The acid stable bacteria (such as some Shigella species) can cause an infection with as few as 10 bacteria making it onto your food!  </p>
<p>One of the other ways that bacteria can get you sick is by forming a premade toxin.  If you leave dairy or meat products out for too long sometimes bacteria (such as Staphylococcus Aureus) can start to multiply and form toxins that will make you very sick if ingested.  The difference between these food poisonings is that they show up really fast (hours after meal) and go away fairly quickly once you've vomited up all the bad stuff or let it go the other way.</p>
<p>The last major mechanism that bacteria can mess with your food is by forming spores.  Clostridium Botulinum can form spores that are very resistant and hard to kill, which can sometimes be found in honey.  When ingested, these spores transform back into bacteria and can try to colonize your gut.  In adults this is not really an issue because we already have an army of bacteria in our gut so the C. Botulinum don't really grow that much.  In babies however, the C. Botulinum can form colonies in the gut and produce botulinum toxin which causes a form of paralysis called botulism.  That's why we don't give babies honey!</p>
<p>So in conclusion, there are a lot of really cool ways that bacteria have evolved to try to make us poop and vomit!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some pathogens, a popular way to get past the outer defenses, so to speak, is simply to be dead.  The acid and the proteases can trash an actively metabolizing cell that needs to be at least somewhat open to its environment in order to take care of business (although a thick enough capsule will also defeat stomach acid, like our old friend tuberculosis uses, but it comes with drawbacks, the biggest one being that it is very expensive), so it has a large attack surface, as it were.  Enter the spore (or the cyst, which is sort of the eukaryote equivalent of the same idea), which is a carefully packed, dehydrated mass of cellular machinery carefully sealed in a protective coat.  Spores are resistant to many of the attacks that kill living things... because they aren't living things.  Think of it as the difference between how easy it is to break your laptop by shoving it off your desk onto a concrete floor, and doing the same thing to the box the laptop came in.  Sure, the laptop in the box can't do anything right now.. 'cuz it's in a box, but.. after being dropped, kicked, farted on by disgruntled DHL employees, etc. it will work after you take it out of the box, plug it in, and turn it on.  Spores are a tiny bit weirder than that, in that it's not a functional bacterium inside the spore, it's a kit for building one, but the idea is the same.  Our intrepid spore goes from low pH to high pH when it passes into the small intestine, which washes off its casing, water diffuses into the packed mass of cellular machinery inside, and before long, the reactivated spore has built itself up into a functional bacterial cell, and is ready to, pun intended, wreck your shit.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of us walk around with a lot more of that acid just hanging in our gut than others  however.  So for anyone that reads this, if you've always wondered why you're nauscious all the time, it could be acid.  I just found out this year and pepcid has become my new best friend in the morning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gastroenterologist here. Although we say that a lot to patients as a simple metaphor, it actually isn't about excessive acid production in most cases. Classic heartburn, or GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is from stomach contents refluxing up into the esophagus through a combination of factors and failures in some mechanisms meant to avoid this. But you don't necessarily have excess acid. </p>
<p>Then there's the broader complaint of &quot;dyspepsia&quot; which includes a variety of issues and includes the classic feeling of a hole being eaten right in the middle of your gut, stomach ulcers, etc. This is generally due to a number of factors that affect the guts defenses against your stomach acid (h. Pylori infection, NSAID use). But again, not really excess acid. </p>
<p>There is a disease, however, that does hypersecrete stomach acid, and that's Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome and involves a tumor called a gastrinoma that secretes gastric causing excess HCl. But this is rare and usually causes numerous severe ulcerations in your distal stomach and proximal small intestine, so not the cause of your typical dyspepsia sufferer. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we're often so rushed we don't get to fully explain that and go with the easier &quot;excess acid&quot; explanation. Anyway, just thought you'd find it interesting since you suffer from this (as do I!). Make sure you're eating something 30 minutes after taking your PPI for max effect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with your assertion that GERD is not usually caused by excess acid. But if that is the go-to explanation given just because it's easy, is it not then responsible for mis-medicating thousands or millions of people who take PPIs under the assumption that they have excess acid and thus need a PPI to reduce it?</p></div>		</li>
