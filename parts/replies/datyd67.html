			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also the problem of the strength to weight ratio.  As length grows, cross sectional area (proportional to strength) grows as the square of that number, while weight grows as the cube of it.  Eventually the weight is too great for the mammal to move, and at some point, even breath.  If the cross section doesn't grow then very long spindly body parts will start to bend and buckle.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can ignore the square cube law (to a reasonable extent) if you only scale your mammal to gigantic proprotions in one or two dimensions - an arbitrarily long mammalian snake would have all sorts of problems, but should have approximately the same strength-to-weight and surface-to-volume ratios as any other length snake of the same thickness. Extending in two dimensions is a bit more unusual, but a vast, flat, many-legged creature wouldn't <em>necessarily</em> collapse under its own weight - a half metre thick sheet of mammal would only need a few deer-sized legs per square meter. It's a bit easier if it can be a bit less mammalian.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your suggestion of a deer-carpet is equal parts hilarious and terrifying. I'm imagining a creature that grows outwards like a sort of clonal aspen colony. I don't think at this point calling it mammalian would do it justice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that snake like mammal could become very long with less of an issue.  But unless the animal had multiple hearts and digestive systems and lungs it would start to have difficulty getting blood oxygen and energy to the faraway places.  If it did have those,  it would eventually start needing multiple brains to control those organs.  At some point is it even really one animal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, we're not discussing muscular strength, we're discussing material strength. </p>
<p>Forget animals. Think about wood. If you take a table, and double all dimensions, the strength of the legs increases by 4x, but the mass of the table increases by 8x - this might work once, but twice would be pushing it.</p>
<p>Similarly, the strength of the bones in our legs would scale at a rate of &quot;squared&quot; while the mass of everything they hold up would increase by &quot;cubed.&quot; That's why elephants have such proportionally thick legs.</p></div>		</li>
