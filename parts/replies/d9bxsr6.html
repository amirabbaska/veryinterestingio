			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it could be either as a lower IQ would hamper your ability with rational or empirical debates while education would affect technical ones  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, some people don't have full dialogues in their head? I'm not being sarcastic I'm legit curios because I've never stopped to think about it before. I just assumed outside of people with developmental disabilities it would be the default way to think. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting question. With a limited vocabulary, you really can't express yourself to others - but when you're thinking yourself, its not like you need to be specific so you'd understand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that a larger vocabulary would help a lot. It shows you have a conscious and nuanced understanding of &quot;things,&quot; I guess. If I'm not being clear, I'm arguing that an intuitive feeling is not necessarily wrong (e.g. thinking of something as simply &quot;good&quot; but not like other &quot;good&quot; things) but it is not exact. Two people might be classified as good, but one is benevolent and the other altruistic. They are similar, but they have very specific meanings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can understand what you are saying, but i can't understand why you would come to that conclusion. Words are by definition a means of contextualizing our inner monologues and thoughts to other people.</p>
<p>Schadenfreuden isn't a word that is helpful for you to understand your own feelings about being happy at someones elses misery. It is there to help you communicate that emotion to another person, so they can understand what you mean.</p>
<p>You do not need to know that word to understand your own feelings. If you do, you are emotionally stunted, not vocabulary challenged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But even without knowing the words someone could easily parse out the difference while thinking to themselves - even if in &quot;intuitive feelings&quot;.  Unless you're talking about super low IQ, I suppose.  But it's not super difficult to recognize someone as being generally nice and another being so nice that they'd give the shirt off their back. </p>
<p>I get the point you're trying to make though.  I just don't think the example is the best.  </p>
<p>Maybe the problem of these thoughts not leading to same outcomes or getting as far might be from  the frustration of not being able to easily get to proper conclusions.  That frustration in trying to work through the words/ideas might lead one to give up quicker, ultimately coming to the wrong conclusion/decision/perspective... </p>
<p>I don't know.  That's my 2 cents.  I've definitely done it when tired or hungover.   </p></div>		</li>
