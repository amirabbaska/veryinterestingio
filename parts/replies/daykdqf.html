<p>If you have an older Java version then maybe there is a know exploit for it that has been patched in the new version. But you never updated. And you accidentally click on a file with the name: &quot;HotSexySluts.png&quot; but whose real name is &quot;HotSexySluts.png.exe&quot;</p>

<p>...But then it would be a jar file. An exe is a native binary file that wouldn't bother with the JVM. I guess you could write an exe that generates and executes an executable jar file to maybe exploit a JVM flaw but that seems kinda roundabout. Especially since you're already in if they're foolish enough to open that untrusted random exe file.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically by default the &quot;exe&quot; extension doesn't appear in filenames but java extensions do. So you'd need to be a bit roundabout. But good catch! I was actually worried about that sentence a bit, but I'll still stick with it for now.</p></div>		</li>
