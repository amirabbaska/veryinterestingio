			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're on a swing set, swinging back and forth. Every time you reach the highest point on your back swing somebody gives you a shove.</p>
<p>A second person shows up, this person doesn't give you a shove every time you reach the highest point, but only does it every other time you reach the highest point.</p>
<p>Now a third person shows up. This person does it every fourth time you reach the highest point.</p>
<p>These three people are showing what is called &quot;constructive interference&quot;. They are applying force to you at exactly the right moment, all working together to make you swing further. The shove that you're going to notice the most will be once every 4 shoves, because that's when all three people are shoving you at the same time. And it's the same way with sound waves where waves hitting your ear drum at the exact same time produce a pleasant sound. This is basically the origin of all consonant sounds and what most common chords are based on.</p>
<p>An example of &quot;destructive interference&quot; (which makes the wave weaker) is if the second person instead just started shoving you at random times. You could be halfway on your way back and this guy just suddenly shoves you in the back, making you slow down.</p>
<p>Side note: In this example (with one person doing it every swing, a second one doing it every second swing and a third one doing it every fourth swing) it's actually talking about octaves and not a three-note chord. The principle is the same but this was easier to visualize.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To your ears, it'll sound louder. If you look at the waveform, it will be &quot;bigger&quot; with it's peaks being higher and valleys lower. Its amplitude increases.</p>
<p>Edit: To clarify, when those peaks or valleys of different waveforms occur simultaneously, they create constructive interference, increasing amplitude and pushing the peak higher or valleys lower where they meet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imaging sound as waves of compressed air and decompressed air. If two different sound waves collide, they will interfere with each other. </p>
<p>If the waves are the opposite of each other (out of phase) then the first wave's compressed air will meet the second waves decompressed air and just make... regular air. The strength of both waves is decreased and the volume of both sounds are lowered.</p>
<p>If the waves complement each other (in phase) the compressed air of both waves will multiply to <em>more</em> compressed air. The decompressed waves will multiply too and decompress that air further. What you get is stronger waves that result in louder sound.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes.  You record the sound, and analyze the resulting sound wave.  You will find an increase in volume when combining two ranks of pipes that are an octave apart (for example, the 4' and 8' Flute ranks).  The increase in the volume of the sound is 'more than expected' than just the sum of the two sounds.</p></div>		</li>
