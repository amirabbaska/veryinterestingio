			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting... I thought a destructor was actually a thing, as in someone that destroys something, but apparently it is something I learned from C++. Must have mixed that one with destroyer over the years, or maybe picked it up from a comic book.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in the sense that it comes from the same root with opposite prefixes applied, but the standard English form is 'destroy.' Although its other forms look more parallel to 'contruct,' -- see 'construction,' 'destruction,' -- the form 'destruct' on its own is not typical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guessing you used the New Oxford American Dictionary. Then you'd notice that it includes the note that &quot;destruct&quot; is a recent back-formation from &quot;destruction.&quot; &quot;Destruct&quot; is pretty atypicalâ€”&quot;destroy&quot; is usually considered correct in this case.</p></div>		</li>
