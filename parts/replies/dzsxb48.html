			<div class="markdown"><p>This is partially true. Neurosurgeon here. I have taken care of many people who survived a gunshot to the head for some time.  I've always wondered what they are experiencing. </p>
<p>I wouldn't agree the right spot to not experience a gsw is the top of the spinal cord. Our consciousness is largely regulated by the reticular activating system (RAS), which is slightly above the top of the spinal cord. Severing the top of the spine simply removes the ability to control respiratory muscles and leads to death from respiratory arrest, as is the case with hanging. To become unaware the RAS must be destroyed, and this is in the pons/medulla. </p>
<p>It's probably nit picking, though. I'm sure the shock wave from a gsw to the spine/occiput junction would likely disrupt the RAS enough to impair consciousness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did make the assumption the bullet would have been one typical for defense... 9mm, .40, even .223 rather than like a .22 pistol, since the last would interact pretty differently with surrounding structures than the first 3. </p>
<p>I do think it's interesting to consider the degree of awareness a person might experience, but I suspect that any sufficient trauma to anywhere except (exclusively) the frontal or occipital lobe will disrupt all higher levels of thinking, and awareness would be limited to a very primitive degree. Whether that's suffering or just stimulus response will have to be addressed by someone way smarter than I. Definitely would like to get your opinion on the matter though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's something I always wonder with our traumatic brain injury patients. Of the ones that recover, almost none have any recollection of their hospitalizations. That, of course, doesn't mean they aren't aware. Memory processing is different than consciousness. I've also had a few patients that say they remember things and even recognize me. </p>
<p>However, I agree that the subject should be discussed by people smarter than I. </p></div>		</li>
