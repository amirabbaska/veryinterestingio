			<div class="markdown"><p>From an algebraic perspective:</p>
<p>If T is the tens digit and N is the ones digit, then a number is 10T + N. The reverse is 10N + T. When you subtract you get:</p>
<p>(10T + N) - (10N + T) </p>
<p>= 10T + N - 10N - T </p>
<p>= 9T - 9N</p>
<p>= 9(T - N)</p>
<p>With 53 and 35, T=5 and N=3. 53-35 is 9(5-3)=18</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in accounting a long time ago.  If you came up with a wrong total somewhere, a shorthand I was taught by an old hand was to divide the difference by 9. If there was no remainder, check to see if you transposed a number along the way (data entry error, etc.). Obviously not foolproof, but it was a handy thing to know.</p></div>		</li>

I prefer a slightly more complicated technique called &quot;casting out elevens,&quot; which unlike casting out nines does catch transposition errors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned exactly this 10 years ago when I worked in the company accounting room.  I remember being amazed first time I was shown. Like it was some kind of savant street magic.  I still use this trick to this day to solve various life-number problems that crop up!  I've impressed a few people with it as a result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to make sure you don't come away thinking 9 is somehow special, consider that in any numbering system, the largest single digit number will always have this property.</p>
<p>For example, in base 3 (digits 0, 1, and 2) you can write 14 as 112 while 211 is what we'd call 22. 22-14=8 which would be written 22 which is divisible by 2, the largest single digit writable in base 2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As mmmsoap wrote above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If T is the tens digit and N is the ones digit, then a number is 10T + N. The reverse is 10N + T</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we cast 10 to a variable, B...</p>
<pre><code>(BT + N) - (BN + T)
= BT + N - BN - T
= (B - 1)T - (B - 1)N
= (B - 1)(T - N)</code></pre>
<p>So, yes.  For whatever base B you use, you'll get funny stuff happening with (B - 1).  So, you're right: essentially, the answer to OP's question is, &quot;it's a property of using base 10&quot;; use another base, and it'll happen with one less than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. More generally, one less than the base should have the same property. </p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/functor7" target="_blank">functor7</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. If you use base B, then any divisor of B-1 will have this property. For instance, all of this works for dividing by 3 as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, just as 1/9 = 0.111..., 2/9 = 0.222..., ..., 8/9 = 0.888...; so will, in base N: 1/(N-1) = 0.111..., 2/(N-1) = 0.222..., etc., for each numeral in the system as a denominator. </p>
<p>As a bonus, one can easily see by these sequences that, in fact, 9/9 = 0.999... = 1.  :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice explanation, but your first premise is that a number is divisible by 9 exactly when it's digits sum to a multiple of 9. Why does this hold?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The remainder of 10^(n) after dividing by 9 is always 1. Eg, 1000=999+1. So if we are to find the remainder of, say, 4*10^(2)+3*10+1 after dividing by 9, then since we know that the remainder of each 10^(n) is 1, we can replace each of these by 1. That is, the remainder is the same as the remainder of 4*1+3*1+1 = 4+3+1.</p></div>		</li>
