			<p>From an algebraic perspective:<br><br>If T is the tens digit and N is the ones digit, then a number is 10T + N. The reverse is 10N + T. When you subtract you get:<br><br>(10T + N) - (10N + T) <br><br>= 10T + N - 10N - T <br><br>= 9T - 9N<br><br>= 9(T - N)<br><br>With 53 and 35, T=5 and N=3. 53-35 is 9(5-3)=18</p>		</li>

			<p>The idea is to write the number and it's reversal as sums, then show that the difference is equivalent to 0 modulo 9 (meaning it is divisible by 9).

			<p>Not just mixing them around, but also redistributing their values any way you like.<br><br>As in:<br>473 -&gt; 554 (by moving 1 from the 7 to 4 and another to 3)<br><br>Just as long as the sum of the digits is the same. (You can show that moving 1 from any digit to any other adds or subtracts a multiple of 9 from the number).<br><br>So even 19 -&gt; 1111111111 works. Or even 1030040002.</p>		</li>

			<p>The sum of the digits doesn't even have to be the same.  It just needs to have the same remainder when divided by 9.  The two numbers don't even need to be the same number of digits long.<br><br>For example:<br><br>M=5894503 (Some randomly typed digits) has a remainder of 7 when divided by 9  <br>N=7<br><br>M-N=5894496=9*654944<br><br>N can be any number with a remainder of 7 and you get the same results.

			<p>Use the same trick of spreading the proof out over addition. So for example if we have 5412, we look at<br><br>&gt; 5412 − 2145<br><br>and divide over sums as:<br><br>&gt; (5000 − 0005) + (0400 − 0040) + (0010 − 0100) + (0002 − 2000)<br><br>Pulling out each of these numbers (5,4,1,2 in this case) we have 10^m − 10^n in each case. <strong>Every</strong> such difference is divisible by 9, therefore the sum is divisible by 9, since 9A + 9B + 9C + 9D = 9(A + B + C + D) by the distributive rule.<br><br>This is not hard to see; 1000 − 10 = 990 for example. The formal argument looks like this: when you divide 10^m by 9 you must get remainder 1. Take the m=0 case first, 10^0 = 1 and it obviously has remainder 1. Now suppose that 10^(m−1) has remainder 1 and can therefore be written as  9X + 1; then 10^m must be 90X + 10 = 9(10 X + 1) + 1 = 9Y + 1, so remainders-after-division-by-9 are always preserved when we multiply-by-10.<br><br>Therefore when we divide by 9, we get (A + 1/9) − (B + 1/9) = A − B, which is a whole number.</p>		</li>

			<p>Suppose x = a (mod 9) and y = b (mod 9). Then x = 9n + a and y = 9m + b for some integers n and m. Hence, xy (mod 9) = (9n + a)(9m + b) (mod 9) = 81nm + 9am + 9bn + ab (mod 9) = ab (mod 9).

			<p>This proof and the version that generalizes it to numbers of different lengths can also be used to prove it in any other base, you just have to replace the 9 with base - 1.<br><br>in base b you get:<br><br>(10T + N) - (10N + T)<br><br>= 10T + N - 10N - T<br><br>= (b-1)T - (b-1)N<br><br>= (b-1)(T - N)<br><br>meaning that in any base b any number minus it's reverse is divisible by b-1.

			<p>I used to work in accounting a long time ago.  If you came up with a wrong total somewhere, a shorthand I was taught by an old hand was to divide the difference by 9. If there was no remainder, check to see if you transposed a number along the way (data entry error, etc.). Obviously not foolproof, but it was a handy thing to know.</p>		</li>

			<p>Just to make sure you don't come away thinking 9 is somehow special, consider that in any numbering system, the largest single digit number will always have this property.<br><br>For example, in base 3 (digits 0, 1, and 2) you can write 14 as 112 while 211 is what we'd call 22. 22-14=8 which would be written 22 which is divisible by 2, the largest single digit writable in base 2.</p>		</li>

			<p>The remainder of 10^(n) after dividing by 9 is always 1. Eg, 1000=999+1. So if we are to find the remainder of, say, 4*10^(2)+3*10+1 after dividing by 9, then since we know that the remainder of each 10^(n) is 1, we can replace each of these by 1. That is, the remainder is the same as the remainder of 4*1+3*1+1 = 4+3+1.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think /u/functor7's reasoning can be applied in this case. The reason it works for 9 in base 10 (every base is base 10, duh!), is that all the powers of the base can be written as a multiple of n-1 plus one. For any number m dividing n-1, you can then also write it as a multiple of m plus one.<br><br>In other terms: The reason it works for 9 is that 1000 = 9 <em> 111 + 1, 10000 = 9 </em> 1111 + 1, and so on. The reason it works for 3 is that 1000 = 3 <em> 333 + 1, 10000 = 3 </em> 3333 + 1, and so on, and those are true because the same thing works for 9.<br><br>Formally, you need that <code>n mod ab = 1 =&amp;gt; n mod a = 1</code> (or perhaps a more general variant of that), which seems intuitively true, but I don't have the background required to prove that.</p>		</li>

			<p>A number has the same remainder when divided by 11 as its alternating sum of digits: e.g. 57236 mod 11 = 6 - 3 + 2 -7 +5 = 3. If the number of digits is even then a digit will enter the remainder sum for the nimber and its reverse with different signs, so it cancells out for their sum and it is divisible by 11. If the number of digits is odd then each digit has the same sign in the remainder sum of a number and its reverse, so their difference will be divisible by 11.</p>		</li>

			<p>There's actually an algorithm by where you can repeatedly add a number to its reverse and you'll eventually get a palindrome. It's called the 196 algorithm because 196 is the first number that this apparently doesn't work for, although this hasn't yet been proven. It has been proven that in base 2 some numbers enter into a pattern and do definitely repeat forever, never reaching a palindrome. </p>		</li>

			<p>As mmmsoap wrote above:<br>&gt; If T is the tens digit and N is the ones digit, then a number is 10T + N.

In another base, it'd be different.<br><br>[Edit: given some of the comments below, I thought I'd try my hand at three-digit numbers.  d₀ is the ones digit, d₁ is the tens, and so on...<br><br>    (B²d₂ + Bd₁ + d₀) + (B²d₀ + Bd₁ + d₂)<br>    B²d₂ + Bd₁ + d₀ + B²d₀ + Bd₁ + d₂<br>    d₂(B² + 1) + 2Bd₁ + d₀(B² + 1)<br>    (d₂ + d₀)(B² + 1) + 2Bd₁<br><br>Looks like that middle digit is your fouling factor.

			<p>It does work for 4 digits. B^3 + 1 is 1001 which is divisible by 11, and B^2 + B is 110 which is also divisible by 11. it looks like you're tripping yourself up with the rather unneccesary substituion of 10=B.</p>		</li>

			<p>First: the substitution was to demonstrate that the property has an equivalent in every base - e.g., that '9' and '11' aren't special, just that they're one-off from the base number; it was not arbitrary, though it was originally done in another thread to show this for &quot;(AB - BA)/9 is an integer&quot;.  <br><br>I spend a fair amount of time in Galois fields, so I see this kind of property show up all over the place.<br><br>Anyway, I had just carried it over from the other since it's easier to copy than to type - but I'm going to suggest that this <em>mayn't</em> have been any easier with a bunch of '10's everywhere; it would have just shown that it <em>may</em> be true for base 10.<br><br>Meanwhile, thanks for reminding me to check in a numerical context; the factorization didn't look obvious to me at first, but noting that 1001=11(91) helped.  Here's the completed proof that four digits will work the same way in any base:<br><br>   (B³d₃ + B²d₂ + Bd₁ + d₀) + (B³d₀ + B²d₁ + Bd₂ + d₃)<br> B³d₃ + B²d₂ + Bd₁ + d₀ + B³d₀ + B²d₁ + Bd₂ + d₃<br> d₃(B³ + 1) + d₂(B² + B) + d₁(B² + B) + d₀(B³ + 1)<br>   (d₀ + d₃)(B³ + 1) + (d₁ + d₂)(B² + B)<br><br>   // Here, I insert '- B + B' so that I can pull a B + 1 out.<br> (d₀ + d₃)(B³ - B + B + 1) + (d₁ + d₂)(B² + B)<br>   (d₀ + d₃)(B + 1)(B² - B + 1) + (d₁ + d₂)(B² + B)<br>    (d₀ + d₃)(B + 1)(B² - B + 1) + (d₁ + d₂)(B)(B + 1)<br>  (B + 1)((d₀ + d₃)(B² - B + 1) + B(d₁ + d₂))</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; So, because reversing the digits does not change the sum of the digits, the difference will always be divisible by 9.<br><br>Extrapolating from this, we can infer that any permutation of a number's digits subtracted from the number itself achieves the same result. For example, 925 and 259.</p>		</li>

			<p>Is this rule of adding digits and being divisible by a certain number true for all number bases? For instance, if it was base 6, then the rule would apply to all numbers whose digits added up to multiples of 6. It would just be the highest numeral for the base.</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't want to seem dicky, I just have a few questions. <br><br>Almost all you are explaining there is basic congruence which is for the most part trivial. The core of the problem isn't how congruence work but why does the sumof the digits of N is congruent to the same number that N itself. The rest comes obviously. Care to explain ? :)</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; A number is divisible by 9 exactly when it's digits sum to a multiple of 9.<br><br>Also, yes I'm late with this, but to make this more bearable (for me at least), look at it like this:<br><br>This works because we are in the decimal system and simply, 9 is 10-1. This means that 10 has the exact same remainder after division by 9 as 1 does. In that same way, you can multiply. So 20 has the same remainder as 2. 100 has the same remainder as 10, 1000 the same as 100 and yes even 80000000 the same as 8, namely 8.<br><br>So would we have written down all numbers in a different system, on say base-X, we would have the same properties for division by X-1.</p>		</li>

			<p>For your first question, just do everything in remainders. and you'll have to repeat eventually. 5 mod 7 = 5. 5^2 mod 7 = 25 mod 7 = 4. Then you multiply that 4 by 5 and take the remainder, which gives you 5^3 mod 7 = 6. Multiply by 5 again to get 30, which gives 5^4 mod 7 = 2. Then you get 3, then 1, then back around to 5, so you'll start repeating 5, 4, 6, 2, 3, 1.</p>		</li>

			<p>Works in all bases. If you write a number in base B, then this works when dividing by B-1. Further, it actually works for any divisor of B-1. This means that everything works for 3 in the above discussion, because 3 divides 9. Base 1 is not a thing. To write something in base B, we need the powers B,B^(2),B^(3),... all to be different.</p>		</li>
