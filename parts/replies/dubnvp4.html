			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, but still, if you’re talking about oxygen levels the change is insignificant compared to the simple act of breathing.</p>
<p>My guess is you’d see more O2 change around populated areas (human or animal) than any seasonality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Between 21 and 19%, you won’t notice a difference. </p>
<p>Between 19 and 16% and you engage in physical activity, you’ll become exhausted quickly because your cells aren’t receiving enough oxygen. </p>
<p>Between 10 and 14% your mental functions are limited and you’ll get exhausted by any movement at all. </p>
<p>6% or lower you die </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would never notice the lack of oxygen, but you would notice (and die from) the CO2 build up (a la Apollo 13) over time in a confined space.</p>
<p>Given how massive the planet it, it’d take a very long time for CO2 levels to get toxic (40,000 years at current trend maybe...???).</p>
<p>We’d actually feel the global warming effects (like we are now) long before we ever felt the air quality effects.</p>
