			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm having trouble doing the math...  Let's say an environment experiences 4 pCi/L (pico Curies per liter) in air, and let's assume that all the radiation is from Radon in the air.</p>
<p>Given Radon has a half life of 3.8 days, how many moles are in a cubic meter of space at any one time.</p>
<p>...from that, we should be able to calculate the production of lead per unit of time (assuming a constant flow new radon).</p>
<p>EDIT:  Looks like 1 pCi/L = 37 Bq/m^3, so 4 would be 148 Bq/m^3</p>
<p>and...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A 1000 Bq/m^3 (relatively high) concentration corresponds to 0.17 picogram per cubic meter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so 148 Bq/m^3 is ~0.025 picogram/m^3
and, 1 Ci = 3.7 ร 10^10 decays per second
and 1 L = 0.001 m^3
and the decay is one-to-one Radon to Lead</p>
<p>Then 4 <em> 3.7 </em> 10^10 <em> 10^-12 </em> 1000
= 148 molecules of lead created per second per m^3</p>
<p>So (148 / (6.02 <em> 10^23) ) </em> 207.2 (Pb grams per mole)</p>
<p>is ~5.1 x 10^-20 grams per second per m^3</p>
<p>which assuming a space of 5m^3 and a convert to a per year basis...</p>
<p>= ~0.2 nano grams of lead per year. </p>
<p>Medical impact of lead is at around 100 micro grams per liter.  ...and given 5L or blood per human...</p>
<p>So it would take <strong>25 million years</strong> of FULL absorption of all the radon gas decay in my basement for me to suffer lead poisoning.</p>
<p>Ok, I feel better :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At <del>room temperature</del> 0ยบ C and atmospheric pressure, any gas will have a density of 22.4 L / mol. If you want to go more exact, use PV = nRT, but 22.4 L / mole is a pretty good rule of thumb.  </p>
<p>From this, we get ~44.64 moles / m^3 .</p></div>		</li>
