			<div class="markdown"><p>That completely breaks the pay per click model which assumes a user did the clicking. Even if the advertiser never gets anything from you the expectation is that if you clicked you were interested enough to engage and more importantly actually saw their website.</p>
<p>Auto clicking without showing anything is just ripping off the advertiser. Since Google is in the advertising business they of course would ban anything made to rip off advertisers on their storefront.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah sure, but that’s just being Google :)
I wonder what would happen if suddenly all visitors of a site would start using this for a few months. How would the site and the ad agency react to that? Just in theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll know eventually, when the amount that advertisers pay content creators starts to decrease. The problem with a system like this is that it helps content creators in the short term, but it hurts the company's that are trying to sell products through ads. They're going to see an increase in their advertising investment with no matching increase in their return. Over time this will devalue web advertising on the whole. So you're helping the content creators today by stealing from the advertisers to pay them, but you're hurting everyone in the long run. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally: we're already seeing the pushback from adblockers in general in the form of integrated/sponsored content - which is going to be one of the new norms in advertising where adblocking can occur.</p>
<p>Squarespace, skillshare, and mobile games all have been heavily leveraging integrated and sponsored content (others too, but these are the ones I see most often in the videos I watch).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look, basically ads are a situation where the company selling something, the ad network (middleman), and Website operator all share a portion of the revenue from someone buying something. The Website operator earns on any ad shown or sometimes only on clicks but that's just an incentive to show it more times on their site.</p>
<p>A background &quot;clicker&quot; would essentially guarantee that while they see the company selling something and the ad network saw &quot;clicks&quot;, there would never be a conversion or revenue from a customer. In the end the company selling never makes any money and ditched the ad network since working with the network never resulted in sales. </p>
<p>Eventually the ad company would look into it and find out what was going on and would create issues where the Website would lose the ad network potential on their site since the display of the ad never generates income for either organization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand all this, but to be honest sounds pretty good.
Nobody likes ads. If we could filter them out in real life we would for sure. The fact that it's much easier (and cheaper) to put ads online does not make them wanted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should probably ask this in a new thread, but is there a common &quot;suite&quot; of extensions people use to protect their privacy?  It feels like the recommended list is always changing.</p>
<p>At the moment, I'm using Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin, and HTTPS Everywhere.  I don't know if those extensions get in each others' way, or if I'm still unprotected in some way.  The extension you linked looks wonderful, but I don't know if it will break something on my end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I stopped using Privacy Badger, because it breaks too many sites. Instead I replaced it with Cookie AutoDelete, which deletes cookies from sites that you don't whitelist. This allows websites to still function, but thwarts any attempt to track you using cookies.</p></div>		</li>
