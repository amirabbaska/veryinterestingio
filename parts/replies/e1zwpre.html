<p>I can't recall the reasons why this is. Is swimming pool water more dense (chlorine) or is it just imagining an effect which isn't there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apples float.</p>
<p>Put an apple in a small bowl, that's just big enough, and it will touch the bottom before it's displaced enough water mass to become boyant. This is like a person in a bath.</p>
<p>Put it in the sink and it will float. This is like a person in a pool. People floating in a pool are probably 90% submerged before achieving boyancy. You just can't achieve this in a bath without touching the bottom first.</p>
<p>Items float because their density is less than the fluid. So you are right.</p>
<p>But your wife  has found the limiting factor. An item can only float if the container is large enough for the item to displace a volume of fluid that <strong>at least equals the mass of the object</strong>, before touching the bottom.</p>
<p>While what you said is true for better than 99.9% of circumstances. What you wife says is true for the rare occasions where an object is in a relatively small container that doesn't allow enough displacement.</p>
<p>Edit: you can repeat the test with something a similar size of an apple but a much lower density, say a ball from a ball pool. It will float in both the bowl and the sink. Establishing that density is the primary deciding factor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Funny thing is Archimedes figured it out in a bathtub</p></div>		</li>

<p>Assuming there is at least enough water to submerge the object in, can you help me explain why she's wrong? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That assumption doesn't apply to the bath.</p>
<p>If you had a large enough paddling pool (say) where she could lie flat you could do the experiment with various depths of water. The problem with the bath is that the surface area is too small and a person's bent body touches the bottom while also protruding out the top.</p></div>		</li>
