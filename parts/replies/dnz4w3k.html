			<div class="markdown"><p>NURBS can be used (see u/Abba_Fiskbullar 's comment) but Parametrics really don't have much use in video games or movies. Effects perhaps, but effects can run very differently from any modeling techniques.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the modeling software mathematically knows something is curved, visually, it's still a mesh.</p>
<p>When you run simulations, one of the steps is to create a mesh of your object (you can adjust parameters of the mesh, trying to make it as simple as possible while maintaining whatever your desired level of accuracy is).</p></div>		</li>
