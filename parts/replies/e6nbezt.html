			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly, and that might be effective on a single aircraft. However they could radio their base about the situation and they'd send up reinforcements with anti-radiation missiles (that track radar emissions). Or they could just turn off the alarm and take their chances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read that in Bosnia/Serbia, the rebels would take a microwave oven, jam it open and leave it on.</p>
<p>Anti-radiation missile would home in and destroy it.</p>
<p>Not sure if that's apocryphal or not, but the concept of using radars that are cheaper than anti-radiation missiles to keep spamming the area is a valid one.  You're not going to actually shoot down US planes with that, but you'll get them to waste a lot of missiles and never be certain they are safe in the area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. There's something called &quot;low probability of intercept&quot; (LPI) radar that jumps across frequencies to avoid detection by warning receivers that track a source by single frequency. And you could certainly spoof receivers by having different signal strengths and maybe using half your sensors at one frequency and half at another.</p>
<p>However, signal strength is proportional to the number of modules you use to generate it so roughly speaking using all your transmitters to send on one frequency gives you more power (and therefore range) than splitting your transmitters across frequencies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>modern fire control radars with active electronically scanned arrays will hop frequencies quickly enough that most RWR systems will just see it as noise. </p></div>		</li>
