			<div class="markdown"><p>yea. This case came up in a thread the other day, and someone mentioned that part of the issue in that case was that the &quot;burglar&quot; was a kid who had an alternate explanation for being on the roof.  Most people didn't buy it, but it was apparently plausible enough that the court didn't laugh it out---according to the thread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting question. The usual idea is that you're not allowed to &quot;set traps,&quot; but that means you're not allowed to set up dangerous things and then leave them to trigger if someone shows up.  </p>
<p>But, if you actually fear for your life (as Kevin did) and you are just doing the only available thing that would allow you to stop actual theft/destruction of your property (as Kevin was), than most/all states would allow you to escape liability. They could sue, but Kevin could plead self-defense/defense of property and probably win. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the question is why did Kevin fear for his life, and the answer is that he overheard the wet bandits talking about how they were going to come break into his house at 9 o'clock, several hours earlier.  And what did they say, not that they would hurt Kevin but that they would come rob the house.  You would have to prove that Kevin overheard the wet bandits talking and that he is why he feared for his life.  The other side of that is that Kevin lived in an area where there were plenty of options other that the route he took.  It's not like he lived hours away from civilization and no police or any other sort of services were available to help him, he could have easily call the police to help him rather then set his house of Horrors up.  Also, the wet bandits up until this point were committing nonviolent offenses and robbing homes where no one was hurt  and his parents I am sure had insurance, he could have just removed everything sentimental value from the house so that all the robbers got was items easily covered by insurance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the real issue is not that the traps are intentional, but they were protecting the kid. The burglar won the case bc the deadly booby traps were protecting property, and not life. In Kevins case, these robbers were a danger to him, and he semi-impromptu set up dangerous traps in self defense. If you break into my house and i drop the chandelier on you when you are coming up the stairs, i don't think you would win a case</p></div>		</li>
