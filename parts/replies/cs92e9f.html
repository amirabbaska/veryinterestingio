<p>Cancer results from a failure of control mechanisms that stop cells from dividing. In the cancer cell, the genes run amok and go full-selfish, replicating as fast as possible and creating new cells that make up a tumor.    </p>
<p>The genes are happy about this, because they want to copy themselves as often as possible. But the individual will die. So in this case the selfish gene knocks itself right out of the gene pool.     </p>
<p>On a more practical level, there are many mechanisms that can alter the way genotype affects the actual outcome of the organism, called phenotype. The gene is not always responsible for what the individual looks like. As an example, human growth can be mediated by nutrition, so no matter how tall your genes would have you grow, if your nutrition is poor during development, then your height will not be the result of only the genes. If height has a fitness effect, the genes for height will be selected upon based on the environmental effects, not the genic effects.
Phenotype is what selection can see. If a gene is awesome at increasing the fitness of the individual, but that gene isn't expressed in the individual, then selection is blind to it.       </p>
<p>So selection actually acts on the expression of genetic information, not the genetic information present in the cells. This is why selection happens on the individual and not necessarily on the gene -- because selection operates on phenotype, not genotype.    </p></div>		</li>

The gene-centric view really doesn't do a great job of explaining real selection. </p></div>		</li>
