<p>did you mean red?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer. The major point after the discovery of the three primary colours is that you need chemicals sensitive to each colour, and then to somehow produce the <em>same</em> colour based on those chemicals' reaction to light. We didn't have chemicals which are sensitive to, say, blue light and when exposed to it, turn from black to blue (nor from white to yellow.)</p>
<p>In fact, we <em>still</em> (as far as I know?) don't have chemicals exactly like this: rather, we have chemicals which are sensitive to particular colours, and bond them with another chemical which, when processed correctly after light has activated the sensitive part, produce the correct colour dye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anybody makes an ASA 3600 stock today. Ilford still makes Delta 3200 which is an ASA 1000 film. Color neg film goes up to 800. For stocks slower than 100, there's still Ilford Pan F+ (50), Agfa Copex Rapid (50), Velvia 50, Rollei RPX (25), Adox CMS II (20), and all the ortho films. Also, photo-nerds that do their own densiometer testing usually rate both TMAX 100 and Neopan Acros somewhere in the 64-80 range.</p>
<p>Edit: I also forgot to mention Kodak's daylight cine film, which is ASA 50</p></div>		</li>
