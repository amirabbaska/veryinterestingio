			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol. Thats not rude at all. I get this question more times than you can imagine. </p>
<p>My interest in soil started when I was a kid. I loved digging. I loved looking at all the critters scramble about when I dug them up. I liked the different colors I found in the ground when I was on family vacations.</p>
<p>But I never took it as a serious desire until college. I was going to be a civil engineer until I took an intro to soil science course. I quickly realized I loved how all of the sciences are incorporated into it - soil physics, soil chemistry, and soil biology are all equally important. </p>
<p>I guess it's hard to explain why I enjoy it so much. If you like lab work, you can do lab work with soil. If you enjoy being in the field, you can do field work with soil. It reaches into more areas of study than I previously imagined. Agriculture, hydrology, landscape management, engineering, and urban design just to name a few. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soil scientist here. Let me answer your question with another question.</p>
<p>Did you enjoy a healthy breakfast this morning?</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p>But, snarky response aside, terrestrial life as we know it would not be possible without soil. Mankind's fate is inextricably tied to the soil and poor soil management has contributed to the downfall of numerous civilizations. Someone's gotta study it if we want to keep this species running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually really disturbing how little attention is paid to soil, especially regarding agriculture. Here in Kansas we have the Land Institute doing great work in soil research, perennial crops, and sustainability, and I doubt more than a handful of people in Salina where it's headquartered know it even exists. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For what has been dubbed as the &quot;Gulf of Mexico dead zone&quot;, it's a bit of a mixed bag in terms of how storm-related freshwater inflow from the Mississippi plume (and some influence from the Atchaflaya and other rivers) impacts these hypoxic/anoxic conditions. During the summer, it has been observed that disruptive storms (i.e., hurricanes) do a pretty good job at mixing the water column and breaking up stratification (a principle component for the development of the dead zone); this mixing appears to have lingering effects by drastically reducing the size of the dead zone even after stratification re-emerges. Conversely, these winds may enhance upwelling- and downwelling-favorable conditions that simply shift the location and shape of the dead zone and not help to alleviate it at all. </p>
<p>Another interesting component in all of this is the probable shift in species distribution of phytoplankton; the silica-rich freshwater inflow would replenish a Si-limited system and allow silicifying algae (e.g., diatoms) to bloom again (as opposed to dinoflagellates and other phytoplankton that are commonly associated with harmful blooms). What is interesting (and somewhat cool if not for the hypoxia) is that this has pretty substantial biological, chemical, and geological consequences in both short- (intra-year) and long-term (decadal or more) time-scales.</p>
<p>Also (pre-)congrats on finishing! I'm currently have a few more years until my PhD is complete. :(</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's difficult to say since it appears the timing of the hurricane also matters; if it occurs prior to the 'dead zone' forming then it may actually enhance the size, shape, and magnitude it due to a massive increase in freshwater inflow. Given that wind patterns (direction and velocity) will change with warmer air temperatures (1.5-2 deg. C by 2100 in the region), this will have profound impacts on the development of downwelling- and upwelling-favorable conditions. So on the whole, it is very reasonable to predict that the 'dead zone' will only get worse (this year was the largest and was slightly larger than the state of New Jersey). It is also worth noting that even heavy reductions in anthropogenic nutrient input (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) will not overcome physical changes in the water column. </p>
<p>If you (or anyone else) has any interest on the subject I highly recommend perusing the LUMCON website--they are the research organization that conducts annual inventories and assessments of the Gulf of Mexico dead zone. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer.  I'd also add that I'm skeptical of this notion of surface soil being washed away- won't it just be replaced from soil elsewhere?  After all, typically in a floodplain you actually <em>need</em> the floods to replenish soil nutrients...that's why the Mississippi river valley is so fertile...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hurricanes, under the correct and pretty typical conditions, can move tons of sediment (pun intended, although a major understatement). Among other things, overwash is a great example of how hurricanes can be very depositional along the coast. With that said, it is a bit of a mass balance question: if it is depositional inland, then it had to be erosional elsewhere, and that is usually in the form of coastal erosion. Another example was seen from hurricanes in 2005 when more than 100 square miles of fertile marsh land was completely washed away. With that said, the Mississippi River typically transports 100,000s tons of sediment per day, meaning that soil generally gets replenished from upstream inflow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soil scientist here. Excellent information, but I'm going to push back on OP's take on soil erosion impacts a bit. Hurricanes can be hugely depositional events. I had one research plot on a Mid-Atlantic barrier island that, after Hurricane Sandy, was buried under 3 feet of sand brought laid down by the storm surge. Made for quite an amazing soil profile. Houston is a bit inland to experience this directly, but I would imagine the coast would experience a similar effect.</p>
<p>As far as hydraulic conductivity goes, I don't think there will be much in the way of a change. The soil in southeastern Texas is dominated by Vertisols, a type of soil that contains a subsurface layer rich in shrink-swell clays. This layer (when wet) is the most limiting factor for the transmission of water through the soil profile. If, as OP posited, the entirety of the topsoil was removed by the hurricane the hydraulic conductivity would remained unchanged. OP was correct in stating this soil loss would exacerbate runoff issues, the recovery timeframe of &quot;months to years&quot; was a bit optimistic. &quot;Lifetimes to millenia&quot; is a much more realistic scale.</p>
<p>Soils might be a bit of a moot issue, however. The Houston area has been blessed by a near total lack of any regulation on impermeable surfaces and floodwater management. Bit difficult for soil to do its job in the hydrologic cycle in such an environment. The amount of stormwater making its way to sea through groundwater flow is going to pale to insignificance compared to what is going to flow directly into the gulf through overland flow. Combine that with the presence of major chemical industries in the area and we have the potential for widespread contamination.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My understanding is that almost all of the water in Houston is from rainfall, not storm surge?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. Coastal areas affected by Harvey would be likely to experience thick deposits of coarse material deposited by the storm surge. Inland areas are more likely to experience deposition of siltier material from overland flow.</p></div>		</li>
