			<div class="markdown"><p>If the box started moving from rest that means it accelerated. Unless every part of the headphones were completely fixed in relation to the box, they would bunch up and bounce off of the back of the box ('back' in terms of the direction of movement) causing some parts to slow, some to bounce forward and move more quickly etc.</p>
<p>EDIT:Extension:As well as the slowing due to the friction mentioned above in previous comment.</p></div>		</li>
