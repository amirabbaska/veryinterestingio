			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that they're awful at spelling them. It's that Japanese is syllabic, and they only have several dozen possible syllables to use. And all of those syllables end in a vowel.</p>
<p>Basically, their entire alphabet is just the vowels with a different consonant stuck in front of them. So let's take the letter A. The syllables with that are A, Ka, Ta, Ra, Ma, Na, Ya, Sa, Ha, and Wa. Notice that none of those <em>end</em> with a consonant.</p>
<p>For instance, &quot;cake&quot; in Japanese is &quot;ケーキ&quot;. That's the two syllables Ke (ケ) and Ki (キ), with an extension on the Ke syllable. So it's pronounced &quot;Kēki&quot;. The pronunciation doesn't end on a hard consonant like the English word (in this case, the K sound) because none of their written syllables do - All of their letters end in a vowel, and they don't have the ability to write lone consonants (without switching to romaji, which is essentially the English alphabet) so their adaptation of it ends in a vowel as well.</p>
<p>Another good example is &quot;Computer.&quot; It's written as &quot;コンピューター&quot;. That's Co (コ) N (ン) Pyu (ピュ) Ta (タ) with extensions after Pyu and Ta. So it's pronounced &quot;Con-pyu-taa.&quot; Even someone who doesn't speak Japanese would recognize that as &quot;Computer&quot;, since it's essentially the same word without the hard R at the end.</p>
<p>It would be like trying to transcribe a language with sounds we don't have, (like the tongue clicks in certain African languages, or any number of sounds in Native American languages) in English. Some things just wouldn't work very well when written down, because we simply wouldn't have the characters necessary to express the sounds. We have all the letters we need for English. And they have all the letters they need for Japanese.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close. I think most (American?) English speakers would pronounce Banana as &quot;bəˈnɑːnə.&quot; In Japanese katakana, the pronunciation would be closer to &quot;bəˈnəːnə.&quot; Note the second syllables. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Crazy...I didn't know about X+.  I've been living in Japan and speaking/typing in Japanese for like 10 years now and I had always done L+ to make small characters. 　</p>
<p>And I just asked my assistant and she said &quot;kithi&quot; works too, and it does.</p>
<p>This kinda blew my mind. haha...  I never even thought to question the one way I'd learned to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One day my husband saw me typing something and I'd put a space, an イ then space down to the small one, ィ, then go back and delete the space so it's part of the previous word and he was like 'what the fuck are you doing?' and showed me xi in a really patronizing 'duh, how could you not know that?' way. He also taught me du = ヅ which reeeally helps because dzu does now work when you'd expect it to.</p>
<p>I've been here 7 years btw and I learned several years in :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on which input method you came from - back in the mid to late 90s, IMEs just started accepting all the different variants. So things like xtu and ltu became equivalent.</p></div>		</li>
