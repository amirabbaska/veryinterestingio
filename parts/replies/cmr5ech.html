<p><strong>Edit: </strong></p>
<p>If condensed the volume of that water would be 172,766,190,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 km^3 (1.717x10^32)</p>
<p>Earth, in its entirety, is 1,083,210,000,000 km^3 (1.083x10^12)</p>
<p>That ball of water would be 158,541,089,566,020,313,942 times bigger than Earth.</p>
<p>That would be a diameter of 34,550,689,251km.</p>
<p>The diameter of Neptunes orbit is 9,090,000,000km.</p>
<p>The estimated diameter of the Suns helioshpere is 14,211,000,000km.</p>
<p>That is 1.334 light days.</p>
<p>Or in other words that musty ball of water would collapse into a black hole long before it condensed into it's &quot;full size&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(And strictly speaking, it is decillion, but I recommend throwing out the lot and using scientific notation)</p></div>		</li>
