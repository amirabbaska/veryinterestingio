			<div class="markdown"><p>fun fact: scientists removed leptin from rats (not sure how) and the rats would eat non stop and became literally too fat to function.
i don't know of any experiments or research where they removed ghrelin, but it would be reasonable to assume that if the rats never experienced satiety then they would likely feel no hunger. </p>
<p>i know that doesn't answer your question, but from what i've learned leptin and ghrelin are responsible for your appetite or lack thereof. cholecystokinin is mostly used to signal to your body stimulate digestion; it only kind of helps as a hunger suppressant. </p>
<p>side note - it takes a long time to starve to death (assuming you have access to water). death by starvation depends on your body composition and mass. it takes well over a month to die that way. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are so many hormones and chemicals working together in your body's systems that it would be difficult to trick the body into starvation. I'd imagine that it would translate into hunger+pain. (This is purely speculative) You might start dry heaving to purge the phantom food, as your body would sense its full but would not be able to extract nutrients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's a minor player. It would keep your body producing what's needed to digest food, though, so I could see some bad effects from that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, at least some of them. I assume you mean someone who can't feel below the neck - because so much of it comes from hormones, they can still tell when they are hungry. At least in my friend's brother-in-law's case - I had to check with him to be sure.</p></div>		</li>
