<p>One thing: 1500 MW is 1.5 GW, not TW. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Truth is, I'm just a guy who's fascinated with some of the weird stuff the USSR ever did.  The whole Chernobyl disaster is incredibly interesting.  From the crap reactors to untrained staff to their attempts to cover up the accident.  It's insane. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The RBMK is graphite moderated and water cooled which creates some interesting issues. </p>
<p>When water turns to steam, the neutrons have an easier time passing through steam, meaning they are more likely to interact with the graphite moderator and cause subsequent fission. In other words, raising the volume of steam bubbles causes power to go up. </p>
<p>Water in a boiling reactor goes in at the bottom, and comes out the top. That means the top of the core has the most steam bubbles, and also has the most power generation. This means the top of the core has the lowest amount of heat transfer/removal, because steam is a poor cooling agent. And because of graphite moderation it also means power at the top was the highest, and power at the bottom of the reactor is the lowest. </p>
<p>To prevent the fuel at the top of the reactor from drying out and melting during operation, you need to take action to push the neutron flux/axial power profile to the middle or bottom of the core. This meant partially inserting control rods to lower power in the top of the core. However overall core power would drop, because power in the middle and bottom of the core would decrease due to reduced core back pressure and an increase in cooling flow. To counteract this, select control rods had graphite tips. This means that the top of the core, where the rod was inserted, had safe power levels, and the graphite tips helped to raise power in the middle/bottom of the core for more efficient fuel burnup. </p>
<p>These graphite tipped rods had specific limits on being removed during operation. The problem is if the rods are fully removed, when you later go to put them back in power will go up initially as the graphite tips go in, until the tips are in far enough that the control rod is actually entering the core. This happened at Chernobyl, and the graphite tips caused power to begin to spike, which in the unstable operating state the core was in caused the unarrested power excursion which damaged the core. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just so I'm clear on this: they needed to be able to both increase and decrease output depending on the situation, and they put the materials to do those two separate jobs on the same part (the control rod)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for explaining this better than anything I've ever been able to find.  This helps clear up my confusion as to the role the graphite part of the rods played in controlling reactor power distribution. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for explaining the purpose of the graphite tips! I've always wondered why they were designed that way.</p>
<p>As someone in the industry, what are your thoughts regarding the challenges of replacing older plants with newer, safer designs? It seems to me this is a significant problem facing the nuclear industry worldwide. There are big incentives to keep running old reactors (cost of replacement, regulation barriers for new designs, political challenges, etc).</p>
<p>It seems crazy to me that there are still 11 RBMKs in operation (albeit with some safety improvements after Chernobyl). Shouldn't we be pushing more for newer designs with passive safety, etc? Or at least reactors that don't turn into a giant graphite fire if it all goes wrong? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the control rod was retracted, the void left by the absence of the boron rod was replaced by the graphite.  I'm still not 100% clear on how these were positioned in the core with the rods &quot;fully retracted.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was because of the timing and low power operation. The fission products were producing Xe and Sm which was shutting down the core. So they withdrew rods beyond the allowable limits so the reactor didn't shut down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some interesting extra information I got from reading the NRC's report is the power output from the core when it went prompt critical was around 30,000 MW.  They are unsure if it went higher being that the gauge maxed out and the core was, as we know, completely demolished by the explosion.  </p></div>		</li>
