<p>So you're saying the pain itself results in the spider being unable to move?</p>
<p>And not an indirect result of some kind of neurotoxin?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Australia they are called the Spider Wasp. They do this with huntsmans.</p>
<p>See them all the time in Sydney wandering back to their nest (only in a direct line) with a huntsman in their jaws.</p>
<p>This straight line was once up my hallway. Cat didn't know what to do so just watched.</p>
<p>They are docile to humans and quite pretty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are also very beautiful. They are often very timid around humans and are docile but then again, surprising any animal rarely ends well. </p>
<p>The tarantula hawk, along with many other Hymenoptera and insect families species considered &quot;most painful&quot; live in and around the US-Mexican border. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_dauber" target="_blank">mud daubers</a>, of which there are lots of different species. They aren't actually wasp. They just have a similar appearance. The organ pipe mud dauber is well known in the eastern and central US. I've even caught them by hand without being stung. Though the buzzing vibration they make when trying to escape can spook you into thinking your being stung. They can sting though, but it's not very significant. They paralyze spiders, keeping them alive, to be packed into the mud nest for the young to eat. Some mud daubers will actually fly into spider webs and sting the spider as soon as it comes in for the kill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is a wasp, taxonomically? I was taught that it was a non-monophyletic term referring to all of Hymenoptera minus ants, bees and Symphyta. It seems like your definition of wasp is just the Vespidae?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That depends on the species, actually. The Tarantula Hawk is renowned for having one of the most painful insect stings in the world. </p>
<p>There's a video of a dude getting stung by one, for science. It's a 15 minute long video, so here's a timestamped URL to skip to the action.</p>

<p>That looks fairly painful, and he's done a ton of these videos where he gets attacked by animals. He actually has a whole run of episodes specifically where he got stung by different bugs on the Schmidt pain index (and some other things with marine animal stings and bites, too).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah there is a lot more than one wasp that does that. Probably something in the region of a few thousand species. And that's just the ones that lay on spiders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Polysphincta</em> species will lay an egg on a spider, the egg will hatch into a grub. The grub will live in the spiders back for a few months drinking its blood etc. When it's ready to pupate it takes over the spiders brain and forces it to build a special nest for the larva before finally killing it.</p></div>		</li>
