			<div class="markdown"><p>Same applies even to CGI movies. Their texture resolution can be much higher than any video game can produce because it's all pre-rendered.</p>
<p>Pre-rendering is the reason why movies look better than games. Games render in real-time so they are limited by their hardware and what artists and programmers can make them display with limited resources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was really noticeable in the PSX/N64 era, when developers leaned into pre-rendered scenes for story sections that don't require player input.  Compare the gameplay graphics of Final Fantasy VII to the cutscene graphics.  This kind of thing still happens, of course, but the difference is much less stark due to the improved capabilities of real-time rendering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isnt really done that way anymore, now everything is game graphics. Back then developers wanted to impress you with cutscenes because the gameplay always looked like shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a difference in the way that movies render graphics compared to games.</p>
<p>Movies use a technique called Ray Tracing that is much more computationally intensive than the technique that games use which is Rasterisation which can be done faster and with much less powerful hardware.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/03/19/whats-difference-between-ray-tracing-rasterization/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a good explanation of the difference.</p>
<p>There may come a time when real time Ray Tracing becomes feasible but we're a way from that time still. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually great that you brought that up. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3ue35ago3Y" target="_blank">Real-time Ray Tracing</a> is actually feasible now(in tech demos) with the lastest GPU and software innovations.</p>
<p>Probably won't be too long before it starts getting seen in the ultra(insane?!) settings for games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Didn't Unreal and Serkis do some bit about new ray tracing? Or was it that Star Wars Elevator mini sequence? Genuinely asking if these were denonstrating what you were describing or if they are still a few steps behind. </p>
<p>I'll try and dig up the links...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bigger reason (in my opinion) is the constant, glaring physics issues in games. Things are constantly clipping into other things, armor bends with the character, cloth and hair go through everything, feet are never flush with uneven terrain, etc. Game stills can look amazing, but once things start moving, it’s becomes blatantly clear you’re playing a game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Just to add that it's the same with audio and sampling rates. Although the difference may not be audible once everything is heavily compressed into the end product. </p></div>		</li>
