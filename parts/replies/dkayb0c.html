			<div class="markdown"><p>With the temp solution for water that you describe, isn't the water at the hydrant at a much higher pressure than home lines are rated for? Do they put a temp pressure reduction valve in as well then, or do you have to hope that the spigot you connect to a high pressure one (and thus before the house's valve)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you could stick a pressure regulator right on at the hydrant if needed, but not all mains are so high pressure that you couldn't feed directly into residential plumbing.  Depends on where the project sits within the water system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water pressure should be relatively the same at the hydrant as it is at the house unless your home has a PRV (pressure reducing valve) at it.  In our city they don't, so if the hydrant has 65psi your house should be similar with the exception of elevation and things like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, it really depends on the way the house / area is set up but in my area it's normal for the domestic and fire systems to be run off largely the same lines, so they're at the same pressure. Houses may or may not have a pressure regulating valve that would be bypassed by what OP described, but typically even if the new pressure is significantly higher than the old the odds of it causing immediate problems are fairly low. Going from 50psi to &gt;200 is a thing I have seen happen more than once. Usually it's discovered to be &gt;200 by a plumber who's out there because something failed. (Faucet started running, PVC irrigation line failed, etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just saw the water replacement stuff nearby recently.  Looks like a bunch of big garden houses going to everyone's home.  They go into the water meter pit though, maybe for better pressure?  I'd imagine many have pretty bad outdoor faucets.  I know mine are shady and leak.  </p>
<p>Enjoyed your reply.  Love seeing all this stuff and love knowing what is happening even more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point of connection probably depends on the municipality.  In areas with harsh winters we don't usually have meter pits because the service could freeze inside of them, which is why you have to connect to the hose spigot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing they ran it to the meters so they could still record the usage and bill appropriately. Probably varies from city to city.  There is also a check valve on newer meter setups that would prevent any possible contamination to the water system due to back flow from a house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering about the sewer under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>When I flush, does poo flow nonstop, or are there stops and starts until it reaches the sewage plant?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends.  If you live on a dead-end sewer main serving a residential street, there's a good chance it will stop and probably sit in the sewer main until higher flow pushes it along (ie: someone doing laundry of everyone taking a shower in the morning).  Once it's in one of the mainline sewer mains there will be enough flow to carry it the rest of the way nonstop.  The only other exception would be a lift station.  A lift station is a large pump that sits somewhere along the main that pumps sewage up to a higher elevation, and is used when your house is not at a higher enough elevation than the treatment plant to maintain flow.  In that case, sewage will stop for a bit in a tank at the bottom of the pump before getting pumped up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes more sense.</p>
<p>In my situation, if I understand correctly, my house is on a plateau, and it is higher than the sewage plant, which is on the other side of the river. So, I could imagine gravity taking it under the river, and then the pump, that you describe, bringing it into the plant.</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p></div>		</li>
