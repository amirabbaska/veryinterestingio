<blockquote>
<p>VuloviÄ‡ disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. &quot;The man who found me ... told me that I was in the middle part of the plane,&quot; she said. &quot;I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That having been said, there's a number of people who have survived long falls without a plane. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Magee" target="_blank">Alan Magee</a> crashed through the glass roof of a train station after falling 22,000 feet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Chisov" target="_blank">Ivan Chisov</a> slid down the edge of a ravine after falling about 23,000 feet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Alkemade" target="_blank">Nicholas Alkemade</a> survived a fall of 18,000 feet with only a sprained leg after crashing through some pine trees and falling into the snow. (All of these were in World War 2. Turns out that if you blow up thousands of planes in mid-air, some crazy stuff will happen.)</p>
<p>Fundamentally, it's not the fall that kills you, it's the sudden stop at the end - anything that makes the stop less sudden will improve your chances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During the Battle of Stalingrad there was an incident where a Soviet tank drove out onto a runway and smashed into a German transport aircraft that was trying to take off as the airfield was overrun.</p>
<p>If you put something like that in a serious war movie people would howl about how fake it was, but it actually happened.  WW2 was such a big conflict that <em>everything</em> seemed to happen at least once.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That part of the article misrepresents the <a href="http://www.avsec.com/vesna_vulovic__how_to_survive_a_bombing_at_33000_feet/" target="_blank">actual interview</a> - scroll down to &quot;<em>The reports say that you fell in a part of the fuselage that remained intact. Some of the reports said that you were in the back of the aircraft</em>&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fuselage is the main body (basically the entire cylinder) and unless you are wiring, fuel, or aluminum you're <em>always</em> in the fuselage of the aircraft.</p>
<p>The conflicting reports were whether she was found in an intact portion of the middle part of the fuselage or in the tail section (any part of which that is occupiable by passengers/crew is still part of the fuselage).</p>
<p>There was never a question of in/not inside, but rather <em>which section</em> of the plane.</p></div>		</li>
