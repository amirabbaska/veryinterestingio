			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the closest answer so far. I'm just going to add a little more.</p>
<p>The specific part of the autonomic nervous system which is activated is the sympathetic nervous system. </p>
<p>The sympathetic nervous system is part of the body's &quot;flight or fight&quot; response. </p>
<p>Essentially, your body releases adrenaline into your blood stream which interacts with routine organs and blood vessels. </p>
<p>[Here is a nice diagram.] (<a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/50/f9/d2/50f9d22f435e908106845c79fdf636ae.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/50/f9/d2/50f9d22f435e908106845c79fdf636ae.jpg</a>) </p>
<p>Essentially, it explains why you get nausea, dry mouth, butterflies, etc when you are stressed. </p>
<p>For completion, the other part of the autonomic nervous system is the parasympathetic nervous system. This is the body's &quot;rest and digest&quot; response.</p>
<p>This is why they say that you should wait an arbitrary amount of time after eating before you swim&quot;. So, you have time to digest before activating a different system which will divert blood away from the gut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Panic attacks relate to a catastrophic misinterpretation of biological anxiety sensations (e.g. heart racing is interpreted as &quot;I'm having a heart attack&quot;). They are further maintained by coping strategies that prevent disconfirmation of the misinterpretation (known as 'safety behaviours').</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's about how you perceive &quot;the stimulus&quot;.</p>
<p>If you are anxious about it, then it's a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>But there are ways to train yourself to not have abnormal activation of your fight or flight response, such as cognitive behaviour therapy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of options.</p>
<p>You can train yourself with cognitive behaviour therapy to respond differently to stresses. </p>
<p>You can use medications which inhibit uptake of serotonin to keep the &quot;happy hormone&quot; around for longer.</p>
<p>You should tell your friend :) to see their GP. There are so many ways to modulate the impact of the limbic system on your function. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not something that can be disconnected. What you(r friend) can do is learn to effectively cope and rationalize events <em>before</em> they become stressful enough to cause a strong sympathetic/parasympathetic response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont know how possible it actually is, but from personal experience it seems to just be willpower. Being able to maintain rational thought while your emotions are all over the place. </p>
<p>However, I also have problems with empathy and am not at all an emotional person, so it could be completely up to your brain chemistry. </p></div>		</li>
