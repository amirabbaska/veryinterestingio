<p>Adenosine is a molecule that blocks nerves from transmitting signals, so as more and more of it is released in the brain, more of your brain is essentially being shut down, and you feel tired. When you sleep, adenosine gets removed and you feel more alert. </p>

<p>I've heard of super efficient <a href="https://youtu.be/o6oxXwBsD1U" target="_blank">PEPCK-C enzymes</a>...now I want science to find a super efficient adenosine removal enzyme. Then nothing will stop us! haha except cancer or diabetes or some other build up of waste molecules (like adenosine). </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Adenosine is a molecule that blocks nerves from transmitting signals</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Removing the chemical that is blocking a pathway would actually fix both the need for sleep and the the thing that makes you feel sleepy. It's literally inhibiting your brain's function not just simulating a feeling of tiredness.</p>
<p>Yeah for sure, there is other molecules which would also need to be addressed, but it looks like adenosine is the primary factor. </p>
<p>Also, the goal wouldn't be to never sleep, it would be not to need it <strong><em>as often</em></strong>, even if you could double the amount of sleep deprivation without brain damage (7-11 days), it would be huge.....not because we'd actually go weeks without sleep, but because when we went a day or two without sleep it wouldn't be so detrimental to our ability to function at optimal levels. It's about improving the whole human experience. Being tired is not desirable. A huge portion of the population is still tired throughout the day even after getting a consistent healthy amount of sleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adenosine forms the basis of most cellular energy, a large percentage of signaling and regulatory pathways, as well as being one of the four (not technically four, but four for all intents and purposes) nucleotides which makes up all of your DNA and RNA. It plays a direct role in probably close to half of all reactions in your body, and you would be hard pressed to find a reaction it didn't have an indirect effect on. </p>
<p>Not that anything you said about caffeine is necessarily incorrect, just that it refers specifically to neurotransmitters. Also, producing a drug which broke down adenosine would be unspeakably dangerous due to its prevalence.</p></div>		</li>
