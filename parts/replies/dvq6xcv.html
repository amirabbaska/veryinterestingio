			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the Sears CEO.</p>
<p>He owns the holding company that owns all of Sears physical storefront assets, so if Sears goes under, he still makes an insane fortune selling off vaulable real estate holdings. He makes a bit more money if either Sears dies slowly (most likely) or he turns the company around (very unlikely) vs killing Sears quickly.</p>
<p>It's a tremendous conflict of interest, but the important people don't care so he was able to do this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's from a 'all things perfect' financial point of view of course, sometimes execs just get spent, mentally drained, stressed and have lost direction or faith in themselves or those around them - at that point they may welcome bankruptcy in order to turn themselves around and go back to making money again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TLDR they might still profit minimally off a bankruptcy, but they make a lot more money from a successful business that's not bankrupt, so a bankruptcy is basically a last resort to salvage the business.</p></div>		</li>
