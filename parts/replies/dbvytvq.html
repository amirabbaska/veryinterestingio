			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a few questions, if you don't mind.</p>
<p>1)How long did it take her to reach 200k subscribers? Investments in advertising her channel?
2) Is that her primary source of income?
3) At that level, does the content creation take 40+ hours/week - as a full time job?</p></div>		</li>

<li>A few years. No advertising, just creating videos.</li>
<li>She has a regular job as well. </li>
<li>I'd say she spends on average 10-20 hours a week on it, but there are others that make similar videos at the same level of popularity that do treat it as a full time job and it is their only source of income.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, once people get enough subscribers, it's actually still profitable for them to outsource 90% or more of the video creation and still make additional revenue. </p></div>		</li>
