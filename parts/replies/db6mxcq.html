<p>I think they just grow the hair on the back longer (not shave or trim it short) so it's not very visible. Think of it as a forest of 10000 short trees, vs a forest of 50000 oaks with leaves that cover the sight of ground. </p>
<p>Some 20 years ago they used to &quot;cut&quot; a piece of your skin from the back of your neck, and extract hair there to transplant to the front, and it looks like a doll's hair, very artificial. </p></div>		</li>
