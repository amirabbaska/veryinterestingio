			<div class="markdown"><p>Now explain why they don't just make the bottom one smooth arch around the bottom with a divot in the middle. Then they could mess with the shape of the spout and make bottle stackable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can find bottles similar to that design if you look at some European sodas which are bottled in more rigid plastics, allowing them to be blown more like glass bottles.</p>
<p>The answer is that with thin, easily deformed plastic the internal pressure would make the divot (which would have to be relatively large to make the bottle at all stable) invert into a convex shape.</p>
<p>If you look at the bottom of a bottle with feet, you'll see that there are several arches at work. Ignore the feet for a moment and you'll see that the bottom basically <em>is</em> a dome, and it's convex - the plastic between the feet and the center of the bottom forms a convex shape. Then the feet are set into that dome to allow it to stand up without gluing a cap onto the bottom like they used to.</p>
<p>Water bottles either do the same thing, sometimes with a merely shallower dome, or they use thicker/more rigid plastic. Also, because there's no internal pressure (relative to atmospheric pressure) to hold them deformed, it actually isn't a huge deal if they <em>do</em> deform. You can definitely find cheap water bottles where shaking them up and down causes the bottom to alternate between convex and concave - but because there's no internal pressure, it isn't really a problem since there's no force holding it convex when you try to set it down and stand it up. In fact, while it's closed there's force holding it concave - when you shake it and the bottle becomes convex, the volume of the bottle expands and the pressure is higher outside the bottle than inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I see it now. The arch is going in the opposite direction that I originally visualized ( I haven't had a soda in awhile :P )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>both soda and water bottles are blow molded similarly to the way glass bottles are made, along with lots of other  types of bottles,  if it's  pete plastic,  then it's probably blow molded. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's because the bottom has to be concave in some parts. That way under intense pressure, the bottom will just pop out and become convex, as opposed to the bottle exploding. Just a hunch though, I'm no bottle expert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that may have been for just a moment, but before the transition happened it was just a domed bottom which would have fallen over without the black piece on the bottom.  I also took these apart as a kid.</p></div>		</li>
