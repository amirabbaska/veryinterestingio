			<div class="markdown"><p>Listerine Zero has the same four essential oils as the alcohol-based ones but doesn't list them as active ingredients. And it does not have fluoride. I've always assumed they don't list them as active because they would have to then market it as over the counter drug, which I'm guessing would require proving its efficacy, which maybe they can't do? I don't know. But if you look at the inactive ingredients listing of Listerine Zero it has the same ingredients that are listed as the active ingredients in regular Listerine.</p>
<p>And even though it was explained above that the alcohol helps mix the solution well, I also think that alcohol is a disinfectant. It breaks down the cell walls of bacteria.</p></div>		</li>
