			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the question Myriodq! There are many many barriers, beginning at a young age and throughout a STEM career. The percentage of women continually decreases the higher up the academic chain we go, meaning the barriers are higher the further in a woman's career she gets. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/young-girls-are-less-likely-believe-their-gender-brilliant-they-age" target="_blank">new study</a> published in <em>Science</em> shows that at age 5 and under, girls and boys are equally like to assume that a smart person is of their own gender. Around age 6, they are 20-30% less likely to assume that a smart individual is a woman. There are many reasons this happens, starting with gender stereotypes. Young girls are often valued when they are pretty and well-behaved. Boys are often valued when they ask good questions or take a leadership role. Legos and other puzzle-like toys are marketed to boys (although there are companies trying to change this). Additionally, if there aren't women role models who are making headlines for breakthroughs, girls will never see people who look like them working in these fields. <em>Hidden Figures</em> did a great job of highlighting this problem in the mainstream.</p>
<p>Women are less likely to be encouraged by their peers and teachers to pursue science and math based careers when they are in high school, and are perceived to be <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0148405" target="_blank">less knowledgeable</a> in college classrooms (shout out to my friend, Dan Grunspan, who authored this study). Students respond to positive encouragement - they are more likely to continue pursuing something or to perceive themselves as capable when authority figures and peers tell them they are. They are more likely to answer questions in class when they feel confident in their abilities. If they are ignored by peers and teachers, they will not feel encouraged to speak up in class, perpetuating the problem.</p>
<p>500 Women Scientists' mission is to help break down some of these barriers by serving as mentors who encourage young girls, and to serve as role models so that young girls and underrepresented minorities can see that people who look like them are in STEM careers. Additionally we serve as a support network for each other. Working in an office or lab full of mostly men makes it hard to find people who can relate to some of the problems described above. By organizing, we have been able to encourage and support each other in an empowering way. </p>

<p>3/4 of all secondary teachers are female*.  Who is doing the discouraging?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How many of the science teachers are female?  </p>
<p>Who is doing the discouraging? Society as a single organism. Just like boys are discouraged from being nurses.  Barriers are things that block an individual, you will have your own barriers to doing things, that isn't invalidated just because I can't see what they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because the teachers are female doesn't meant they necessarily are encouraging women in a positive way. There's a lot of women who have sexist views. Just because someone's a woman doesn't mean that they necessarily are good for other women. Eg, there's plenty of female politicians who vote in ways that are detrimental for women as a whole.</p>
<p>I'd consider it sexist (in a perhaps non-traditional way) to assume that women don't spread sexism, as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why does teachers being female somehow mean that young women aren't discouraged from going into STEM fields? If female teachers are discouraging young women from going into science, would it not still be a problem that needs to be addressed?</p>
<p>Why does women wanting to study gender gaps in their fields and advance toward equality in science turn into you assuming that it is an attack on men?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I experienced all of these things. Do not underestimate the power of being ignored. Despite excellent grades in the sciences, I was never encouraged to be a scientist. My abilities were never even commented upon. But I did get a lot of cat-calls growing up in NYC, which made me frightened, like hiding. My brother, however, was a terrible student, yet given opportunity after opportunity. I ended up becoming a physician-scientist, but my trajectory was fueled by a powerful belief that I should be what I want to be. Now, I hope to be an example for young women. Thank you women of 500 Women Scientists! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep on fighting the good fight. Ignore the trolls, sexists, and morons ignoring facts and dodging attempts at giving women equal opportunity. It's clear we still have a ways to go.</p></div>		</li>
