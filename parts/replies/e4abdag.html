			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Plaque hardens after a couple weeks if being left alone and forms &quot;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_(dental\)" target="_blank">calculus</a>&quot; (not the math). If that's there, it's a dead giveaway that you don't floss regularly or correctly or both. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, no. </p>
<p>The last dentist I went to showed me x-rays of where my teeth have small holes worn away by bacteria/acid right where my teeth touch - not near or at my gumline. The point of flossing is indeed to disrupt bacteria colonies anywhere between your teeth that brushing misses. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Plaque take holds after 14 days and can build up anywhere on the teeth, the gum line just happens to be the place most people don't properly clean. All one needs to do is disrupt the constant growth.</p></div>		</li>
