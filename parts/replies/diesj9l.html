<p><a href="http://www.sunhelp.org/pipermail/sunhelp/2001-January/008122.html" target="_blank">Sun chips on Solaris</a> used to have an occasional calculation error caused by solar storms. Which I think is absolutely fitting. This was caused due to the weak shielding. </p>
<p>To answer the original question part of the <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/small-cpu2.htm" target="_blank">limit of how small chip fab can get is due to the increased probability that an electrons wave function would cause it to tunnel into another part of the circuit causing a problem</a>. </p>
<p>I don't know if there are current plans to either try to do some kind of internal check for that or just focus on doing parallel processing to make up the difference. </p></div>		</li>
