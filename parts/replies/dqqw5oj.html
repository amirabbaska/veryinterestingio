			<div class="markdown"><p>You can surgically manipulate brain tissue without the patient feeling pain. Of course getting through the multiple layers of skin, subcutaneous tissue, bone and meninges do require anesthetics, but the brain tissue itself does not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That, I understood. I mean, nobody could drill a hole in someones Skull without causing pain. But the brain itself would feel nothing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it is pretty true. For example, patients are typically awake while deep brain electrodes are lowered into their subthalamic nucleus for Parkinson's treatment. There are pain receptors in the dura mater and in blood vessels, but they are in less density than those in other parts of the body. The dura is sensate, but no where near as sensitive as, say, skin, which itself is much less sensitive than the dermal layer underneath.  </p>
<p>Migraines are still undetermined with respect to their pain source. In some cases, they are extremely sensitive to the components in the blood (plasma), and react quite quickly to changes in plasma. So, it may be a biochemical reaction of brain blood vessels to components in the bloodstream - at least for some types of migraines. Still much to be learned. I have heard from monitors of the upcoming CGRP antibody treatments - and they tell me that the early results are very large in magnitude and very promising...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, it could be that a Migrane is not actually my pain recieving pain, but it may be the blood vessel that is hurting. I mean, it feels like pulsating, so that could be very possible, right?
Thank you for your thurough answer!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Been on neurosurgery cases. You anesthetize for the approach which is generally as follows: </p>
<p>Skin incision</p>
<p>Burr holes into the skull, remove plate of skull</p>
<p>Incision into the dura (the outer layer of the meninges, the dura mater is the primary covering of the brain. It has lots of pain receptors, and is the theorized origin of many types of headaches, including migraine)</p>
<p>Patient is awoken, and the actual procedure on the brain begins</p></div>		</li>
