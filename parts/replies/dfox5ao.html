			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know enough about any of this. But, it does sound like that it might be possible to create, with magnets, a &quot;very low cost in terms of energy&quot; machine. Is that also not very realistic?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a perfect vacuum, yes, if you ignore the lifespan of the magnet and friction within the string and the knot holding it up. The system continues to move because the kinetic energy in it isn't being converted to anything else. If you want to use it as a source of energy, you have to convert the kinetic energy into whatever you need - this means there is less kinetic energy in the system and it will slow down and eventually stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to disagree. In a perfect vacuum, this would still not be perpetual motion. It might run for a very long time, but there are still moving components, and thus other friction to consider. </p>
<p>What will probably happen is that you will discover that you cannot arrange magnets in such a way that the swinging part doesn't just eventually find the spot where the magnetic interaction is the weakest, and simply end up stopped dead in that spot. </p>
<p>Even planets are not perpetual motion. The orbit will decay over enough time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Induction is not free... Inducing a current in the wire causes the wire to induce a current in the magnet which causes a torque that counteracts the rotation of the magnet. So some of the potential energy you gave the magnet when you placed it there is turned into electrical energy through the wire. Some of it is used up with the counterproductive inductive forces.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Induction is not free...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Easy way to demonstrate this is to get any hand-crank radio or flashlight and have someone try and crank it.</p>
<p>Oh look, there's resistance.  The crank will not spin free. Where's that resistance coming from?  The magnets in the motor are not rubbing against the copper wires creating friction.  That resistance is coming from the fact that it's turning the kinetic energy you're applying into electricity.</p>
<p>Now think about how hard it is to crank that little flashlight to light up a few LEDs for a few measly seconds.  Now imagine your free spinning magnet on a string had <em>that much</em> kinetic resistance applied to it.  It would stop almost immediately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to add: &quot; Magnets do no work&quot; is a way that it is commonly explained. Just like gravity is a force on a pendulum's mass causing it to swing from the axis, someone still had to originally lift the pendulum (the work).
A magnetic force has nothing to add without an equal amount of input. We already use magnetic fields to make electric generators and motors. You can use magnets to create electricity only if you use an eternal source of work like the spinning blades of a wind tower. And you can only make an electric motor spin using an external source of electricity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if there was no air resistance and the pendulum was to swing forever, any kinetic energy that the magnet on the pendulum momentarily has will be converted to potential energy and vice versa, so no new energy is being introduced into the system. Perpetual motion, like the example you demonstrated, is theoretically possible. You don't even need the magnets, since a mass on a string with a given initial amplitude will oscillate forever, given ideal conditions. It is not perpetual motion itself that is impossible, it is making a perpetual motion machine that is. Harnessing the kinetic energy of perpetual motion will not give you unlimited energy since the kinetic energy such a machine would use would periodically be lost whenever the pendulum is at the height of its swing, i.e. when all its kinetic energy is potential.</p></div>		</li>
