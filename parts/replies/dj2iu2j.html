			<div class="markdown"><p>Printing currency is, effectively, a tax on money. If you have £1000 and the government printed more money so that your money was only worth half as much, the government effectively took £500 from you. This disproportionately affects the middle class which tends to keep a large proportion of their net worth in monetary form, compared to the working class which doesn't have much money anyway, and the upper class which tends to have the bulk of their wealth in assets. So taxation is pretty much always fairer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Basically, everyone pays no tax on the first $10k, then 5% on the next 20k, then 20% on the next $20k... or whatever it may be.</p>
<p>So when someone hits the next bracket up, only the amount above it is taxed at that level. There is never a time when more income means less after tax money. </p>
<p>It also means that you could put a 99% tax on any earnings over a billion, which would only affect people who make over a billion, and would leave their earnings below a billion as before.  </p>
<p>EDIT: I know that other benefits may be affected by higher incomes, but that's not what I was describing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How much difference was between rich and poor at that time, did they had a similar starting point after war?</p>
<p>In Florence, Italy, for example due to very accurate tax documentation it was shown that the 5 wealthiest families are still the same than from the years 1400. Hence no war and world war changed anything regarding that...  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure the results are that dramatic, but still pretty interesting that differences persist after 600 years: <a href="http://voxeu.org/article/what-s-your-surname-intergenerational-mobility-over-six-centuries" target="_blank">http://voxeu.org/article/what-s-your-surname-intergenerational-mobility-over-six-centuries</a></p>
<p>&quot;Stated differently, being the descendants of the Bernardi family (at the 90th percentile of earnings distribution in 1427) instead of the Grasso family (10th percentile of the same distribution) would entail a 5% increase in earnings among current taxpayers (after adjusting for age and gender).&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The richness is gone, however I think there are still people carrying the name (?).</p>
<p>What I found very interesting ist that the Fuggers (other Family, started with weaving, than trading, than mines and metals) were by far richer. This family still exist today, for example they created the oldest social housing building (kind of a small city) which still exists today.</p>
<p>At the time of construction they were also under the pressure of Luther which was claiming that 3/4 of society are below poorness. Later the Fuggers were debating contracts of buying Chile and large parts of Peru - to give you a sense of richness (didn't happen in the end). However they rebuild the social housing (word war destruction) and still keep updating their housings and offering places for people in need practically for free (same price from old time, non inflation corrected)</p></div>		</li>
