			<div class="markdown"><p>Water is indeed a better coolant than antifreeze, but it has the annoying property of freezing.  In really hot countries (e.g. most of Africa), people will use distilled water and an anti-corrosion fluid in place of anti-freeze in the summer, as it helps prevent cars from overheating.  The whole freezing problem of water isn't so much of a concern when it's hot enough to fry an egg on your dashboard.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also on racetracks, distilled water and <a href="https://www.redlineoil.com/waterwetter" target="_blank">Water Wetter</a>. Antifreeze is extremely slippery and extremely difficult to clean off of a track, so it's against the rules pretty much everywhere to run antifreeze. And even when it's &quot;cleaned&quot;, it's still relatively slippery, which is bad when you have a car or motorcycle going through a turn at 100mph.</p></div>		</li>

<p>often failed early was because anti-freeze is also a corrosion inhibitor which those engines need,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anti-freeze (ethylene glycol) alone isn't but it has a corrosion inhibitor (potassium disphoshate, ISTR) mixed in with it.</p>
<p>Anti-freeze gradually oxidizes  to form some acidic compound, so it is recommended that it is replaced every 3 years, before the alkaline corrosion inhibitor is used up. Once it has turned acidic, it starts bi-mettalic/galvanic corrosion which usually destroys the head gasket. Look up 'bad anti-freeze'. </p></div>		</li>
