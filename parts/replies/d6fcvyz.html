<p>1) Why do you assume that all inbred mice are healthy? Many strains have well-described health issues. In some cases, this is the desired result.</p>

<p>Absolutely right. <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247%2816%2930525-3" target="_blank">Here's a recent research paper detailing a severe health issue among a strain of mouse that's very commonly used in scientific research.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually in most cases that's the desired result. Lab mice with certain cancer/diseases susceptibilities are used in order to test different treatments on so instead of waiting for a mouse to get a certain cancer/diseases many different strains are bred because they have exponentially higher rates of certain cancer/diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but B6 is meant to be the wild-type baseline for virtually everything. They're not like NOD mice, which have a well-characterized autoimmune phenotype. It's made even more complicated by the fact that they're multiple B6 substrains like B6N (the one in question) and B6J, which a more careless researcher might assume are functionally identical. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a concept called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck" target="_blank">Genetic bottleneck</a>. Basically, a large amount of the population(and their genetic diversity) is killed in some catastrophe. The members of the species that are left repopulate (provided their niche isn't taken over by some other species), but because all that diversity died, the entire diversity of the population as a whole is reduced. </p>
<p>In some species, this can effectively mean that extinction is imminent. Being genetically bottlenecked can be devastating to the long-term aspects of a species, because it can mean that the diversity of genetics that would've enabled them to survive the next catastrophe may have been lost. I've read some hypotheses that <em>Homo Sapiens Sapiens</em>(us) possibly went through a genetic bottleneck at some point in the distant past, but I've also read some articles refuting that concept. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is what happened with golden hamsters, the population in captivity is pretty much entirely descended from one batch of siblings</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The leading theory is that their population was drastically reduced something like several thousand (might be several ten thousand) years ago. Since there were relatively few members of the population around, this caused what we call a &quot;bottleneck.&quot; Cheetahs are inbred simply because their population has not been large enough in recent history for them not to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand there are plenty of breeds that are known for their health or longevity. Many working breeds for example have been breed for health and long life. There are also many small breeds that have excellent health and few problems. </p>
<p>Eugenics isn't condemned because it doesn't work, it's condemned because it is antithetical to our values when it comes to humans. That and it takes a long time due to our rather long maturation process. You could most certainly breed humans for certain traits too if you had the time and lack of ethical restraint. </p></div>		</li>
