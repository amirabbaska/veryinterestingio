<p>A death by misadventure, as recorded by coroners and on death certificates and associated documents, is one that is primarily attributed to an accident that occurred due to a dangerous risk that was taken voluntarily. In contrast, when a cause of death is listed as an accident rather than a misadventure, this implies no unreasonable willful risk.</p>
<p>For example, a death caused by an illicit drug overdose may be ruled a death by misadventure as the user ignored the risks of the drugs. Misadventure is a form of unnatural death, a category that also includes accident, suicide, or homicide.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One description of them is that: <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/226523-ants/" target="_blank">&quot;they have evolved a surprising, successful, and rather unsettling strategy of ironclad loyalty, absolute intolerance, and brutal violence.&quot;</a>  They only accept other argentine ants.  Any other ants are immediately exterminated.</p>
<p>So i don't think we need to be any more like them than we already are.</p>
<p>Listen to the podcast in the link.  It's equal parts fascinating and terrifying.</p></div>		</li>
