			<div class="markdown"><p>the judicial branch &quot;interprets&quot; the law or in this case the order but their ability to rule on constitionality is secondary. It's a thing they can do, but it's not an accurate depiction of why they exist, or what their intended role is in the 3 branch set up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See that's the beauty of our fucked legal system. A civilian of even the lowest class can challenge an executive order as being unconstitutional. They can even take it straight to SCOTUS though appeals if needed. However SCOTUS = Board of presidential nominees covering several POTUS appointed SCOUTS Judges.</p>
<p>Seeing how Obama had any and all of his nominations blocked in the last year with one seat currently open, and the potential for up to 4 more to open SCOTUS could become the last place you want your case to land.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very well put..   except most conservatives do not believe that President Obama's executive orders were unconstitutional because he was issuing them. We believed they would be found unconstitutional by the Supreme court. The conservatives your referring to are similar to the small percentage of Democrats that run around in the streets screaming &quot;fry em like bacon&quot; and inciting violence. </p>
<p>Most Republicans aren't bible thumping racists just like most Democrats aren't welfare dependant rioters. </p></div>		</li>
