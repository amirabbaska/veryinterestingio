<p>You can even watch that in the fossil record of hominids. Evolutionary dice rolls of modern human-looking hands on a body with an ape spine, or a spine for upright walking but a small brain, opposable toes and a larger brain... It's not one, uninterrupted line of bigger and bigger brains, ever more dexterous hands, springier feet. Features show up and disappear again several times. Until with homo sapiens it all comes together in a configuration that's so successful, it overpowers all the others.</p></div>		</li>
