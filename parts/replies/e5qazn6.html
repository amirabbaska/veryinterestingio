			<div class="markdown"><p>To point 1) the only way earth really radiates heat is via infrared radiation, the white cloud tops reflecting more light than the dark ocean would have a local effect on temperature, but this is temporary and does not really make an impact on the scale of global warming. The energy for these was already sitting in the air and water, this just distributed that energy around differently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can very much model a <a href="https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2349743" target="_blank">hurricane as a Carnot heat engine</a>, though, as it turns a heat differential (in this case the temperature difference between the sea surface and the tropopause) into mechanical work (wind).</p>
<p>That said...the wind will eventually dissipate as friction, redistributing heat along the hurricane path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) yes usually 4-5 C cooling. Note that cooling also occurs because of the wind mixing of deeper cooler waters towards the surface. I don't think it is important on global cooling</p>
<p>2) sea surface temperatures should be greater than 26 C and favorable wind shear, though upper ocean heat content is also important</p>
<p>3)  If the ocean surface was near boiling it would effect wind shear and this is not an easy question to answer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you!  I figured 3 was a hypothetical and would be difficult to answer.  Maybe a more general question though -- for every degree C above 26, does the extra heat energy allow for more rapid intensification and/or higher sustained winds within the eye?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Per that point, though, it has been theorized that unrealistically high sea surface temperatures could generate an entirely new kind of storm, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercane" target="_blank">hypercane</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything else being equal, if U increase sea surface temperature, hurricanes would get stronger. However, ocean currents can be much more important since they can move warm water under a hurricane so as the hurricane takes heat out of the ocean, the currents move more warmer  water in place. This happens over the Florida Current, Gulf Stream,  the Loop Current and the large eddies shed by the Loop Current.  Florence will move over the Gulf Stream and this is not good news. Be safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) Overall, a hurricane turns latent heat of vapour into actual heat, so it's actually an overall heating effect. It's transfering heat from the ocean into the air. The heat flows are complicated.</p>
<p>2) Hurricanes form when the surface sea water is over 26°C (79°F). A low can form at lower temperatures, then move to an area with warmer water and develop into a tropical storm or hurricane, but unless you have a lot of water above 26°, a hurricane wil not form.</p>
<p>3) Speaking precisely, <em>ludicrously</em> more powerful.</p></div>		</li>
