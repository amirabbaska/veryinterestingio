<p>I'll add to this something I just picked up from Radio Lab. Above ground tests produced a lot of carbon 17 which people have, hardly, been measuring bi weekly as part of atmospheric studies for decades. As it turns out there's a correlation between the amount of C17 in the atmosphere and that which is taken up in cells when they are created. </p>
<p>What's cool about this is that it means we have a way date the age of cells, something that is historically hard to do. Interestingly in the near future the levels of C17 will drop to the point that you can no longer use for dating making all of us biologically unique in a way that we may never see again.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>It sounds like you're thinking of C13, which is the less common of the two stable carbon isotopes.  That would make more sense, because burning fossil fuels is changing the C12/C13 ratio in the environment, which would go along with a lot of the rest of what you're saying.</p></div>		</li>
