<p>Yup. Dick size is a much (ahem) larger concern, for men, than for women.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As I understand natural selection, this isn't how it works. What about the occurrence of micropenii in our current population? Is penis size genetic? I really don't think it is, and I'm too lazy to google currently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When people make cultural choices about reproduction it starts to grey the area of 'natural' selection but the exaggerated sexual characteristics of human beings are definitely genetic, and it has to do with our physical characteristics being more tuned to visual rather than olfactory arousal. What I mean to say is, the choices we make about prospective mates, based on appearance, mean that people who pass those positive traits on to their offspring, ensure their children will also be more likely to reproduce. It's not that genetically, we need a large penis and women need large breasts, its more like we preferentially choose certain physical characteristics over others and that leads to more successful reproduction, IE a genetic legacy. IE animals can smell and taste health and fitness for reproduction, we lost that ability when we started walking on two legs and making tools, but we make up for it with visual cues. </p>
<p>Large breasts, a thin waist and wide hips denote fertility and good physical health. Good hair, smooth skin, symmetrical features represent good genetic health. Male sex organs are external and so they are a visual indicator of a mans fitness for reproduction as well. </p>
<p>This is why human women have larger breasts for body size than any other mammals, why human men have larger penises for body size than any other mammals, and our obsession with things that make us look more sexually fit like high heels, makeup, good teeth (genetic health), a strong jawline, chiseled abs etc. </p>
<p>Animals just need to smell each other to know just about everything they need to know. We use our eyes. </p>
<p>Other closely related species like chimpanzees and baboons are a mix of animal and human sexual characteristics, IE visual and olfactory. The sexual organs on many apes are swollen and puffy when in heat and these visual cues, along with pheromones and olfactory cues advertise their readiness and health to reproduce. What is interesting though is that many of the apes have relatively small sized penis for their body size but much larger than usual testes. Chimpanzees especially have much larger testicles per body size than any other relatives of the apes. </p>
<p>We can laugh at an ape sticking it's tail up, thrusting it's swollen, bright red, junk out at anybody walking by, but it's not so different from collagen injections in the lips and wearing bright red lipstick and blush (it gives the visual cues of arousal). </p>
<p>I wanted to add something to my statement about confidence being an attractive quality. There have been numerous studies done on sex hormones in many animals and they discovered something interesting. In social animals like wolves, apes, etc, the social standing of a male has an impact on their testosterone levels, which in turn have an affect on their aggressiveness, physical appearance, and other behaviors. If an alpha male becomes an omega or a beta, it's testosterone levels decrease measurably. So where you fit in socially, can have a physical effect on your sex hormones. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand natural selection, assuming penis size is genetic, that is how it would work. If bigger males had the most children, they'd spread the most genes. Smaller men weren't killed off though, just less frequent, so the genetic variety is still there. It's similar to how megafauna establish breeding rights based on &quot;alpha&quot; bull status, the dominant one yields the most offspring so his traits are going to be more common. Only slightly due to natural variance, female's genetic input, recessive traits, and the fact that other males aren't killed off as mentioned before.</p>
<p>Again, assuming wing-wang size is generally genetic, but I'm also too lazy to Google.</p></div>		</li>
