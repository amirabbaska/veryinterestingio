			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of my family suffers from narcolepsy so I've been trying to figure this stuff out for awhile haha</p>
<p>There are so many &quot;links&quot; in the chain that it's hard to determine if it's a single issue in a single link or a systemic one that affects multiple links, in different ways. </p>
<p>For example hypersomnia could theoretically be caused by a lack of inhibition producing stimulation on the VLPO, which is often inhibited by adenosine, serotonin, and especially orexin. </p>
<p>Or you could even theoretically say that some forms of hypersomnia are caused by a lack of adenosine deaminase, making it harder for the body to clear adenosine from the brain while it sleeps. Which might make it very difficult to wake up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Frequently, what people experience as &quot;hypersomnia&quot; is actually obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  This is where as you fall asleep and your muscle tone relaxes, it causes a partial or full collapse of your airway. The brain detects a decrease in available oxygen (desaturation) and partially awakens you.  Muscle tone restored, you resume breathing, and begin to fall asleep again.  The cycle then repeats.</p>
<p>This can occur multiple times per minute.  The consequence is that you <em>think</em> you've slept, but in reality you've possibly never reached deep sleep stages, and spent the night bouncing between almost-awake and barely-asleep states.</p>
<p>Warning signs of sleep apnea are: 1) loud snoring, 2) your bed partner noticing that you occasionally stop breathing, choke or gasp for air, 3) waking up fairly frequently with a headache or dry mouth.  Feeling sleepy during the day despite sufficient opportunity to sleep (i.e., being likely to unintentionally fall asleep when not active, such as watching TV or riding in a car, despite having slept 7+ hours) is a strong indicator of a possible OSA.  Being overweight is a predisposing factor but not always present.</p>
<p>Sleep apnea increases the risk of all kinds of problems, including high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, automobile accidents caused by falling asleep at the wheel, diabetes, and depression.  Also makes it nearly impossible to lose weight.</p>
<p>Assessment and treatment are straightforward - one night in a sleep lab, where your oxygen levels and brain waves are monitored.  If you think you have these symptoms, alert your doctor and ask if a referral to a sleep study is appropriate.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about antipsychotics, but histamine itself helps in keeping you awake. So naturally, antihistamines will make you tired. Benadryl crosses the blood-brain barrier, so that's why it makes you tired. Allegra, also an antihistamine, does not, which is why it helps with allergies but doesn't make you sleepy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in the case of diphenhydramine at least, the sleepiness is caused by activation of the H1 receptor, a histamine receptor. </p>
<p>The brain's major and only source of histamine is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberomammillary_nucleus" target="_blank">tuberomammillary nucleus</a>. This projects to the hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex, among other areas. Since it projects to the cortex, it can encourage arousal by exciting parts of the cortex.</p>
<p>But it can also increase the release of acetylcholine in the cebreal cortex, indirectly through the cholingergic neurons in the basal forebrain. </p></div>		</li>
