			<div class="markdown"><p>240GB would appear as 224GB not because you're getting less space, but because of the way the computer reports storage size. The computer considers a KB to be 1024 bytes, where as in reality, kilo = 1000, so kilobyte = 1000 bytes. You're still getting 240GB. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, that's a standard GiB/GB problem that's existed since hard drives hit the 1GB mark. With that said there aren't many good answers as to why there are 120gb and 128gb drives or 240 vs 250gb vs 256gb drives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Upvoted because nobody else seemed to talk about GiB vs GB. It's surprising that they're teaching the difference between the two and not the real names/abbreviations for GiB, MiB, etc</p></div>		</li>
