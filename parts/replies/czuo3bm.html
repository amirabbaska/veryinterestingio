			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, yes, the ethics of it all. </p>
<p>Of course this is something I have had to extensively think about, not the least because it was a two year struggle to get my research through the university research ethics board. </p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION 1: This is a normal process. For one, we all hack each other memories all the time, we just usually don't know we are doing it. Friends may make suggestions to you, contradict your memories making you take on their versions, or even just get you to picture things as they could have happened and suddenly you feel like something actually happened to you that didn't. Ethically, to me this at least partially justifies doing false memory research, since it suggests that there is nothing abnormal about creating fake memories. </p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION 2: I think that doing this is an amazingly eye-opening experience for participants. Over the course of the two weeks in which my studies take place, participants MAY have negative feelings about the fact that they now think they recovered a memory of doing something antisocial. However, once I debrief them, my participants are usually relieved and intrigued that their brains could do such a thing. It seems to instill them with a sense of curiosity about how memory works, and I think it might even help protect them against other people using bad retrieval techniques in situations that are more likely to harm them (for example, if they were ever the innocent suspect of a crime). For the rest of their lives, my participants have an advanced understanding of how faulty memory can be.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION 3: Preventing wrongful convictions.  I also think that because of the tremendous implications this research has for the criminal justice system (including countless wrongful convictions), and for the horrible repercussions experienced by people who are exposed to questionable therapies, it is unethical NOT to show that false memories of crime exist and that they can be created quite easily. </p>
<p>It is only when we really understand how something works by creating it in a lab that we dissect it and understand how we may prevent it from happening.</p>
<p>By telling as many people about this phenomenon as possible we can hopefully equip more people to be skeptical of their memories and to not &quot;fall&quot; for bad memory techniques. This should counteract the few people who may try to hijack these memory hacking techniques for undesirable purposes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's possible to figure out, people wanting it enough will figure it out. If someone is content with life without a deeper understanding of something, they may never analyze it out of lack of necessity or different priorities alone.</p>
<p>I genuinely believe I'd fall into that other 30% of people you mentioned earlier, but hey my confidence in that may be due to incorrect perception :) I think desire plays a tremendous role in memory encoding and in recalling memories, you said we are encoding them again, and energy and desire would definitely be a big factor. I write stories time to time, so I might be looking into it more than normal.</p>
<p>My question is, have you done any research regarding memories where, after recalling them, something happens where our attention is immediately redirected to something completely unrelated (like a surprise) and we immediately stop thinking about that memory? When we recall it later, we remember the surprise, but the memory itself, how is it changed? Where does the memory change, in the act of recalling it, or further analysis after recalling?</p>
<p>If you read this and answer I really appreciate it.</p></div>		</li>
