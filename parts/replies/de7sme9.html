<p>No more than average media of any other country, and perhaps less effective due to being bad at it.</p>

<p>People are generally affected very little by not using them due to all the clones tailored to Chinese needs (there are certainly suggestions that the bans are equally commercial and political), and those who really need them know how to do it.</p>

<p>Probably the most severe part of your list. Change is coming though.</p>
<p>In the end I think it is really down to the Chinese people paying more attention to aspects of life that the developed West take for granted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> is a good reference. For the others I don't really have a good one-stop reference (except the Wikipedia pages, which are quite good) and with the risk of sounding like a Trump aide, &quot;you can ask anyone who has been in China&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
