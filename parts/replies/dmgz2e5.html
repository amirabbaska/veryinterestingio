			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, these were small groups of hunter-gatherers who were moving around a lot regardless of weather. Around 13,000 years ago there was enough water tied up in glaciers that the Bering land bridge was exposed, but there was also a gap in the glacier expanse that allowed for people to move down into the rest of North America. Those are the most relevant environmental conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They were chasing megafauna like camels<em> (really!), wooly mammoths, bison, caribou, muskox, as well as deer, sabre-tooth cats, dall sheep, saiga antelope, yak, moose, flying squirrels, lynx, lion, dhole, dogs, river otters, ferrets, bears, jaguars, lemmings, mice and voles, fox, rabbits, and wolverines. The land across the Bering Sea and along the coast of Alaska was dry, with very little snowfall at that time. There were massive glaciers that held a lot of water to the north and east, which is why the sea levels were so low. They most likely did not realize that they had crossed to another continent and that they would be trapped there once the ice melted over the next 10-15K years. They were already in Siberia, and were probably following migrating animals, or searching for game. </em>Camels actually evolved in modern day Canada and the US, and migrated across the same Bering Sea land bridge into Mongolia and much warmer weather. The same adaptations inside their noses that allowed them to breathe cold air also allowed them to lose very little water caper during respiration, which helped them to live in dry areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern ones probably not, they have a lot of surface area for their size and so lose a lot of heat. But I can't imagine that there would be many adaptions required for them to survive colder climates. </p></div>		</li>
