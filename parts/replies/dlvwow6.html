<p>Take an example of a pet dog. While they can be trained and show emotions they cannot tell if you have been away for 1 day or 10. (At least mine cannot).</p>

<p>But they also bury bones and toys, which indicates awareness of the future, no? They also might go to the living room window in anticipation of the mailman/other regular visitors once they recognize the patterns. Of course they perceive and react to time differently, but I don't think that makes them unaware of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right.  But animals are IN TIME.  At least in the same time space tha we are in, regardless of their sense or knowledge of it.   To me, the question was more in line with &quot;How do animals have faster reaction times than we do&quot; kind of thing.  Even though they live in the moment, they can still process information, course of action, and physical reaction to the same stimuli as us, but much faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Animals are adapted to their environment over time.  Frogs have faster tongues to catch insects, predators have sped to catch prey.  Prey are hyper aware of changes in their surroundings that may be a predator.  Their reactions to stimuli are much faster due to a lack of consciousness.</p>
<p>Conscious thinking, not necessarily faster senses, allowed humans to survive and prosper: <a href="https://bsj.berkeley.edu/?p=384" target="_blank">https://bsj.berkeley.edu/?p=384</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dogs have more perception of time that people give them credit for, in fact, they are absolutely capable of planning ahead. In fact, that's how they hunt. Wolves will cooperate and hunt an animal for days sometimes. </p>
<p>A quick example: I have two labs. They both used to insist on going upstairs and sleeping right next to my bedroom door. When the female was little she climbed the stairs and fell, breaking her leg. Since then, even though it's been 3 years and she fully recovered after a few months of having the leg immobilized and a small surgery, she's been scared of stairs. So, after all that happened I began telling them both to stay when the other one wanted to follow me upstairs. So, what he did was wait around 10 minutes, then come upstairs. So, it's been years, and I no longer tell them to stay downstairs, and yet he consistently waits around 10 minutes after I go to bed before coming upstairs. He just sits in the first step and waits a bit. </p>
<p>They certainly don't follow time, so they can't tell if It's been 2 days or 3 since a certain event, they don't recollect or track time like that, but they certainly don't just live in the moment, and they do have a concept of time, and most importantly of future and that allows them to plan ahead .</p></div>		</li>
