			<div class="markdown"><p>Asked my opera professor this question. He is pretty fit, but said that for many people, a lifetime of somewhat stationary singing/pronunciation practice, endless listening to recordings/watching operas/piano practicing, the weird work hours, sometimes moving for a few months to do a show and presumably not cooking at home.. they all add up. Plus, he mentioned that until recently, many great singers actually smoked.</p>
<p>I also wonder if a job that requires that much time and energy doesn't leave time for exercise or cooking meals.</p></div>		</li>
