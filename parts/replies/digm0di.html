			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not following. You say that the cards are running on old hardware designed for swipe cards, but that old hardware wouldn't have a slot to insert a chip card. Retailers were hesitant to adopt the technology for many reasons, one being the huge expenditure of having to replace all their card terminals to support chips (or face increased liability for fraudulent transactions).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not talking about the Slot for the Chip Cards. </p>
<p>I'm talking about the Server sitting in a Data Center <em>somewhere</em> in the US that processes your payment. It takes longer for them to authenticate your card, because they're dealing with a few extra Authentication factors that weren't present on a Magnetic Strip.</p>
<p>This shouldn't add much time to individual Authentications... but a Credit Card Company's Authentication Server is dealing with <em>a lot</em> of requests every day.</p>
<p>Once those Servers get updated, Chip Cards should process significantly faster.</p>
<p>On a related note: The present state of the United States' Internet Infrastructure also slows this down. It can take <em>awhile</em> for a packet to go from Point A to Point B, especially if it gets routed through a region of heavy congestion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um, what? The infrastructure is a lot more solid than it use to be, especially when it comes to hosting. Congestion can cause issues but that's more likely within the ISP than traversing the backbone. I don't know how you define a while, but &lt;200ms wouldn't account for seconds of processing time, and really a lot of non-consumer traffic is in the realm of 5-50ms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What the last poster said is  incorrect.  New software requires multiple verifications during charging process which requires you to leave the card in the slot. New EMV software had been loaded in most US inside processing points of sale. Regulations by banks were requiring it by Oct. of 2016 but due to delays from First Data many were not able to upgrade. I work in the retail fuel industry and outside point of payments have to be chip enabled by 2020.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your cell phones sim card does this sort of verification on the fly. But it still takes a few seconds to power up and power down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah takes me a split second contactless in NZ</p>
<p>The USA is always slow to adapt to new things. Must be harder in a larger country. I used EFTPOS in 1987. USA got it over a decade later</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bullshit.</p>
<p>Why spew nonsense.  The fact is that, primarily many vendors BATCH their transactions and swipe away.  They don't always get approvals on the spot, they get confirmations from the vendor that the vendor guarantees the transaction.  Like writing a check, it's not actually posted against your account when you do a EFT, it's only the processor saying they will fund the transaction.  </p>
<p>In the Chip situation it's a bit of a different transaction.  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The card needs to be read and decrypted... that needs to be sent to  be verified and decrypted. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the back end is still the same... unless it needs to go to Visa or MC to be checked (primarily for card number) for verification.  Which is what the vendor is paying for then.  </p>
</li>
<li>If it's you on the hook, then it doesn't need to be verified at the moment... but if it's someone else... then you need to wait since the processor doesn't want to be on the hook for a fraudulent payment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thats the difference.  Not some made up infrastructure story.</p></div>		</li>
