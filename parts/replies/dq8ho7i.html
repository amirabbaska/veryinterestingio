			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in grad school (ot)  I was in an ICU and would do sensory stim on coma patients with manual therapy. I’ve heard of smelling ammonia with the Glasgow but i never saw another medical professional do it. I always believed  the rationale was that when you are in a coma your medulla and pons are affected but your olfactory nerve is unaffected since it obviously does not insert on the brain stem. Obviously we would try not to use overly noxious scents if we were perform a massage or prom; but it always caused individuals who were vegetative to open their eyes and react. Than again we were dealing with a lot of individuals who were medically induced so we were really just trying to maintain joint integrity and decrease edema </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vegetative state is different than coma; coma is complete unconsciousness. When someone is vegetative there is spontaneous eye opening (it’s not  predictable) and sometimes they wake up for a couple seconds but  like a said it’s spontaneous not stimulus invoked...</p>
<p>When you perform prom after being in a hospital bed it’s not comfortable; they could develop contractures and are sometimes very spastic. I know tbi patients who state that it can be painful and they can tell us to stop once they reach their threshold, so imagine you couldn’t? The icu pts never reacted to ROM; but once we would do edema massage and add in a scent they would become aroused (eye opening). It would usually be a glare but it was a reaction. You would think that the discomfort in a kinesthetic/proprioceptive movement (think of the discomfort of someone trying to make you do a split) would trigger an overt response but it defiantly was not as effective as sensory (olfactory) stim. </p>
<p>I honestly didn’t believe it until I saw it myself. But thats probably one the coolest parts of being a neuro OT. Because of the way we are trained, we learn to incorporate more innovative techniques into our evidence based practices. I recently read an article stating people just discovered “VR and phantom limb pain”: I laughed we’ve been doing it for years! But than again of course the community of rehab therapists is significantly smaller than most other medical professions and most people would rather be in the clinic than conducting research studies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Ammonia is an irritant, so as long as you still have feeling in your nose, you'll have the same reaction. </p></div>		</li>
