			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdote from my father: My father would often stay awake for long periods of time to keep watch on oil tankers back when he was a merchant marine. The longest he stood awake was upwards of 130 hours. He tells me he didn't hallucinate at all, having kept him self active during that time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I've been awake long-ish without hallucinating though not quite as long as 96 hours, and the key does seem to be activity. But I will say that the feeling of fatigue is much more burdening when you've been constantly active for so long, than it otherwise would be. So it seems you will pay the cost one way or another!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hallucinating hours of conversations is no fun. The worst part would be when you start a conversation with someone and then they'd ask you a question. You'd answer the question in your head and then continue to have an entire conversation... all the while in the real world you're just staring at them for 2 mins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that must be pretty weird for everyone involved. But wouldn't the person ask you about it and make you &quot;snap out of it&quot; in a way?</p></div>		</li>
