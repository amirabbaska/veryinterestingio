This is a great article on the topic:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering the original post you replied to and this, I find it very hard to believe that micro organism can manipulate our cravings to suit their biology, yet we have no cravings that are driven by biological demand.  This implies the pathway is present, but were supposed to believe its unused except by gut microbes?  That the rest is only psychologically driven?  Seems counter intuitive to evolution that we have no cravings for things we are deficient in.  I wonder if modern society makes it harder to judge because food is so abundant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add some research news about the role of hormones. <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-015-0931-0" target="_blank">This study</a> found that &quot;an increased intake of protein, and specifically animal protein, as well as an increase in reported food cravings, during the luteal phase [ovulation to start of period] of the menstrual cycle independent of ovulatory status. These results highlight a plausible link between macronutrient intake and menstrual cycle phase.&quot; They noted that chocolate, sweet, and salty were all popular choices along with animal protein. (It would be interesting to know how much of that was culturally influenced.)</p>
<p>Interestingly, <a href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/early/2016/06/01/ajcn.115.126565.short" target="_blank">this study</a> found that a differentiated weight-loss plan that considered the impacts of the menstrual cycle on diet and exercise made a positive, statistically significant difference in weight-loss outcomes for  women. (Note that the study size was small, 31, and included self reporting.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I understand this means that the cravings are not related to the period cycle. Am I right? The other 2 answers (/u/justhereforastory + /u/Quirky_Word) seem to confirm the opposite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it means that if you are in the &quot;post ovulatory/pre-menstrual&quot; stage of your cycle that your cravings are independent of whether you actually ovulated. In other words, if you didn't release an egg but your hormones are still at that pre-menstrual level, you'll still have the same cravings and related macro intake. </p></div>		</li>
