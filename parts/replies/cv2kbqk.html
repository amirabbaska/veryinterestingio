			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really cool chart, but given that no one genuinely wears trousers around their waist anymore, the distinction between 'waist' and 'hip' seems to add confusion. The 'hip' line on this chart seems to be around the upper thigh somewhere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, because your hips are the biggest part of your ass. The actual waist is the smallest part of your midsection, which for most people is about an inch above their belly button. </p>
<p>Where most men where their pants these days is the &quot;lower waist&quot;, about 1.5&quot; below the belly button. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um. My wife and I wear lower articles of clothing at our actual waistline. It looks better.</p>
<p>I guess you speak the truth since I have been told my pants look high when I am getting dressed (just have a undershirt and pants/trousers) infront of random guys. </p>
<p>Once, I went with a friend to get a suit tailored for a wedding and when the (overweight) tailor asked my athletic/hip hop dressing friend what waist size he normally buys. My friend responded with &quot;40 inches&quot;. The look and the response of &quot;Look here 50-cents, I even too thin for that.&quot; we pretty funny for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  But also why you need to put in a little more work to knowing <em>how</em> things should fit you, not just what tag size to buy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You sure put a lot of effort into describing why the clothing industry is a bunch of bullshit. Yet that was only about men's pants sizing, and not that many people are probably going to read it. But I appreciate it, and the next time I buy a pair of pants I'll remember that /u/bamgrinus was the one who told me it was all a bunch of bull. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't.  Someone with a physical waist of 36&quot; would need <em>pants</em> with a 37.5&quot; waistband if it's cut to sit on their hips.  Or that's the logic, anyway.</p></div>		</li>
