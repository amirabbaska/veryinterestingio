			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes technically right but not really relevant to the basic understanding of compression.  Also symbols are often reassigned, e.g.</p>
<p>A -&gt; Pizza</p>
<p>%7(A)Linguini %3(A)Sub would be the next step of &quot;compression&quot;.</p>
<p>Really though, most of the effort is usually in identifying patterns rather than the &quot;compression&quot; aspect of things.</p></div>		</li>
