			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, in music, there are a lot of ghost writers. These people are great at writing but might not be so good at singing. </p>
<p>And some are just trying to get a foot into the industry. </p>
<p>For example ([Sia] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sia_(musician" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sia_(musician</a>)) , despite releasing her own music was pretty much unknown till her song &quot;Elastic hearts&quot;, but she has written/co-written a few of the chart-topping songs before she became a household name. </p>
<p>Then we have [Max Martin] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Martin" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Martin</a>). You probably haven't heard of him, but he is a singer. He's also written pretty much every single top of the charts pop song in the last 20 years!</p></div>		</li>

<p>They are called songwriters.  You aren't required to sing the songs you write, or write the songs you sing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite fucking amazing that he is #3 on the list for most number one singles, and the two people ahead of him are Paul McCartney (32) and John Lennon (26)</p>
<p>It just seems like every time someone becomes the new number 2 on any kind of list in the music industry, it's always just behind the Beatles, even after all these years </p></div>		</li>
