			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose. But I would take it a step further and say that they are literally the same thing -- all mass is energy, all energy is mass. At the very least, one does not exist without the other.</p>
<p>You can think of <em>matter</em> (neutrons, protons, etc) as being energy/mass which is trapped in the form of potential energy. The exact form of this potential energy, though, is where my knowledge gets fuzzy. In fact, if I understand correctly, this is still an active area of physics research and conjecture.</p></div>		</li>
