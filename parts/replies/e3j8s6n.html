			<div class="markdown"><p>Moldy wine pairs well with moldy cheese too! </p>
<p>Seriously though, splurge sometime on a Trockenbeerenauslese (Botrytis affected German style of dessert wine) Riesling or Gew√ºrztraminer and serve it with a plate of fresh rye bread, granny smith apples, two or three blue cheeses, and some honey.  </p>
<p>This also works with Ice Wine for the record.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Botrytis itself isn't toxic to humans. When a fungus infects a plant it makes it more vulnerable to other diseases. There could be more than just mould on the fruit.</p>
<p>Don't eat mouldy fruit. It's all mouldy.</p></div>		</li>
