Now I would like the owners of the building I work in why they decided to have thousands of feet of polished brass handrails for the stairs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brass is a cooper alloy so it gets the antibacterial benefits of cooper. Since handrails are touch by thousands of people a day, this is really important as it cuts down on the need to clean. </p>
<p>Polished brass is actually more durable (naturally tarnish resistant + coating applied) and antibacterial (molecular imperfections allow bacteria to gather and grow) then a brushed finish. The downside is itâ€™s a finger print magnet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One small correction, certain types of steel often used in architecture such as Cor-Ten steel will produce a protective oxide coating when exposed to the weather. This is the stuff shipping containers are built from and many art installations, it forms an orange rust layer that doesn't leach onto surrounding materials like other steel oxides would.</p></div>		</li>
