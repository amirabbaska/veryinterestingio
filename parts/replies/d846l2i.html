			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that local newspapers are less and less common, with most money on journalism being national. </p>
<p>Many places don't have good local news. They have a regional TV network that covers news in short sound bites and then a state newspaper that knows it won't sell more papers by adding more Congressional race coverage beyond one special election section before each election (primary, general).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although the overall outcome of all 500+ elections for congress is as or more important than the presidential election, any one congressional race is not that important. A single legislator holds relatively  little power.  A root cause is basing members off of geographic districts rather than proportional representation. </p>
<p>Same thing applies to state races with the governor vs the state legislature. </p>
<p>This is compounded by the fact that in most states we elect an absurd amount of officials: Governor, two houses of state legislature, several state executives other than the Governor (Attorney General, Secretary of State, Treasurer, Education Commissioner, etc), state judges (electing judges is an absurdity in itself), county boards, county executives (county clerk, recorder, sheriff, auditor, etc), city mayor, city council, city executives other than the mayor (clerk, treasurer, etc), and a slew of special district boards (education, water, parks, transit, utilities, etc). There's no way even the most eager voter could educate themselves and keep track of all of these officials. I vote for around 50-60 different offices, most of which are so low key that there is not any information online and the candidates don't even bother posting statements in the voters guide. This system needs to be streamlined!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! You always hear about how you <em>should</em> pay more attention to local elections, but it is damn near impossible to actually get any information at all on your, say, county council election, and if you do, you'll generally find that your choice is between the local car dealership owner and someone that is running on the &quot;my dog should have 2nd amendment rights&quot; platform. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. Parliamentary systems are far more streamlined. The average UK voter has one national vote (Member of Parliament, every 5 years) and two local votes (city/borough/district councillor and county councillor, every 3 years). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's ridiculous. The majority of the roles should be appointed by your elected representatives rather than be elected representatives themselves. the common man likely has no idea what skills and ability is required to perform the role of siting on a board of utilities for example. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's the whole point of gerrymandering is to group your opponents into one district that they will win massively and then group yourself into districts that you will win by smaller but still noticeable margins. Like Florida's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida%27s_5th_congressional_district" target="_blank">5th congressional district</a> which the state legislature promises is not in any way gerrymandered (never mind the state supreme court ruling).</p></div>		</li>
