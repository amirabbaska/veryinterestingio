			<div class="markdown"><p>When you get it within minutes it can be a result of something called a Gastrocolic reflex.  As you said, it's basically your colon freaking out after your stomach sensed incoming food.  It's a very common symptom for people with IBS and can makes eating out very difficult / stressful.  For most people, this reflex only occurs when they overeat.  It's the &quot;make more room&quot; trip that you suddenly feel better and less bloated after stuffing yourself like a turkey on thanksgiving.  For people with IBS or other chronic digestive issues it can occur without warning and before they are even finished eating.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, so that's what it's called. Interesting. For me, it's not with overeating, but certain things can trigger it. Like eating a full meal and then eating one piece of chocolate afterwards, or a chewing gum. Or cold air, for some reason, that's never good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I occasionally get a lurch down low after eating and I need to go immediately. I'll feel fine one minute, then like a light switch there's ass lava pushing at the doors of the dam coupled with crippling pain. Heavy sweating and nauseousness. </p>
<p>I've had steamed spinach go through me in a half hour. Other veggies as well.</p>
<p>My episodes usually happen if I don't eat for many hours and then have a smaller meal. </p>
<p>Most of my IBS is just loose/liquid stool 3 times a day but those lurch episodes suuuuuuuuck. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh... The Gastrocolic reflex is perfectly normal and occurs every time anyone eats anything. Needing to open your bowels after a normal sized meal is perfectly normal. In people that go more than once per day, it's more common, as people that only go once per day tend to go first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>Yes, things go wrong in IBS, but this isn't because the GCR is inherently bad. As I said, it always occurs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I should have been more clear with my wording.  The issues are when an over-reaction is experienced.</p></div>		</li>

<p>EVERY SINGLE time.  Yet she'll still gorge on the shit.  Carbs are fucking addicting, man.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a follow up question:</p>
<p>I'm currently pregnant, so I've been throwing up <em>a lot</em> recently.  </p>
<p>Why do some foods take forever to leave my stomach and others seem to be gone relatively fast? Like, if I eat an apple for breakfast at 6:30am, and throw up at 2:30 pm, frequently there will still be (recognizable) apple pieces.  That one I could maybe understand - the apple has lots of fibers and pieces that need broken down... but peanut butter and rice have the same problem.  Why?</p></div>		</li>

<p>For this reason, symptoms of food poisoning don't usually set in until 6-9 hours after eating something bad</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been pretty much exactly my experience and until you posted I was starting to think that I was the only person on earth who hasn't experienced instant-onset diarrhea from eating bad food.</p></div>		</li>
