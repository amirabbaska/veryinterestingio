<p>Second, forgot all this stuff about turning off lights, not using plastic bags etc. It's a lie created to allow industry to blame individuals for something that can only be dealt with collectively. You going green in these small ways is great but it's a drop in the ocean. Everyone wants change. No body wants to change themselves. We're been trying to convince people to change their habits for 40 years, and yet here we are. But do try and get governments to enact policies that address this, collectively, and tell anyone who'll listen how important it is.</p>
