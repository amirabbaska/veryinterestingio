			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this a little, antiseptics/disinfectants (disinfectants are like antiseptics but for not living surfaces and tend to be more abrasive) tend to operate via different mechanisms when compared to antibiotics. Things like alcohol, bleach or hydrogen peroxide will react with cell walls causing lysis while classes of antibiotics may inhibit reproduction or stop future generations from growing a cell wall.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Antibiotics have to be more selective since we put them inside our bodies.</p>
<p>Also, I don't think alcohol has much effect on the cell wall, but it's good at disrupting cell membranes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Obviously the outside of the body is composed of cells too, so what differentiates skin cells in this case? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antiseptics are generally analogous to detonating a nuclear bomb in an area. It kills living things de facto. Antibiotics are analagous to releasing plague infested ticks in an enemy area. It's kills by a specific mechanism, which the bacteria may have a chance to become resistant to. </p>
<p>...right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds accurate. Also important to note that an antibiotic is designed/chosen to have the least toxicity to <em>your</em> cells as possible.</p>
<p>Drowning the patient in a vat of formaldehyde <em>would</em> clear that bacterial infection right up, but the patient wouldn't thank you for it afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Anti-bacterial” actually can mean “bactericidal” (kills bacteria outright) or “bacteriostatic” (inhibits bacterial growth).  Triclosan, the (until recently) popular antibacterial soap active ingredient, is a bacteriostatic agent and only kills bacteria directly when in ridiculously high concentrations that aren’t seen in commercial products.</p></div>		</li>
