			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair enough. How small of a percentage are we talking about? If it's more than 1%, my point should still stand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uranium ore typically contains between 0.1% to 1% of actual Uranium, and U-235 (the isotope of Uranium most suitable for fission) accounts for less than 1% of natural Uranium, so that number is very far off. <a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-markets.aspx#ECSArticleLink0" target="_blank">This source</a> suggests that the global annual consumption of Uranium itself for nuclear fuel is only about 60,000 metric tons. So you're off by a factor of 1,000!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't most uranium fuel get tossed out when the fuel rod is only &quot;partially&quot; spent?</p>
<p>Would fusion have this same issue?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Part of the problem with uranium is the poisons that build up. The daughter products of an induced fission actually shut down the chain reaction. Eventually it's too difficult to maintain criticality at end of life (and have it be a safe fuel assembly at beginning of life too) that the fuel is removed from the core.</p>
<p>We could reprocess it, remove the poisons, but there are treaties and laws restricting that in some countries. Also, making fuel from fresh or may actually be more economical than recycling.</p>
<p>Fusion doesn't really have the issue with daughter products stopping the reaction.</p></div>		</li>
