			<div class="markdown"><p>Same in Germany. </p>
<p>I also don't know what kind of Turkey is used in the US, but for Christmas dinner my UK friends have turkey that has very dark meat. Whereas all turkey sold in sandwiches or cold cuts in Germany is the completely white kind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cold cut might be made from waste/leftovers from other processes. If it's real meat (you know, the dry kind) it's likely made from the breast, which usually is very pale. Legs tend to be darker and more tender. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, they are native to North America but the bird had found its way to Turkey before the English went to colonize America. So when they saw the bird, they noticed it looked like the birds they saw in Turkey, which is why they are called Turkey. Sort of the same thing with Indian, they thought they Landed in India and just never changed the name. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking at the website of the largest Dutch supermarket chain it's easy to see which one is more popular here. They sell a measly 2 types of pre-packaged sliced turkey filet <strong>vs</strong> 14 types of pre-packaged sliced chicken filet <em>and</em> 9 types of freshly sliced chicken filet. </p></div>		</li>
