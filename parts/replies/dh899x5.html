<p>If nations could claim them, how would they be divided up?  By area?  By population?  Is a country with no space travel at all entitled to a cut?  What about North Korea, does SpaceX Mining have to pay Kim Jong Il a cut for the mining rights?</p>
<p>Who gets to pick?  Cause that's the trillion-dollar game right there.  Most asteroids are worthless rock, some may be a huge lump of gold.  Whoever knows gets to pick and own the world.</p>
<p>If not, a lawless claim environment is scary.  SpaceX Mining may send a mission to a mother lode find of platiunum, and  China follows the trajectory, figures out where they're going and sends 6 ships to start mining 20 ft from them and start taking it.  Maybe even beat them to it.  Someone's gonna get murdered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Space mining exists in a grey area mostly, I think, because it was not feasible at the time most of the international treaties relating to space exploration and use were being negotiated. My understanding is that ownership of resources extracted from an asteroid will be created by the act of removing the resource. Basically, no nation has sovereignty over the asteroid itself, but once a resource is removed it becomes subject to ownership--although currently that is just a theory that would permit mining not an actual agreement.</p>
<p>While not directly applicable to asteroids, there is a treaty called the Moon Agreement that can be read to permit ownership of extracted Lunar resources using the above premise, but the agreement states that once Lunar resource extraction becomes feasible actual rules should be written and agreed upon. None of the major space faring nations have ratified the Moon Agreement however, so it may not be useful in determining the legality of Lunar resource extraction conducted by American, Chinese, or Russian entities--France, Japan, and the UK have ratified the treaty while India has signed it.</p>
<p>How extraterrestrial mining will work legally will ultimately be resolved once someone actually puts space-pick to space-rock and forces a regime to be developed. The currently rules were only developed once the space race was well underway (the late 1960s). Before then each nation had the right to do what they could technologically and politically achieve.</p></div>		</li>
