			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been searching for this quote that says (paraphrasing): a false theory is not a problem - it will be found out soon enough by experiment, but a false experimental result is a real problem because it sends the theorists running in the wrong direction. Does anyone know the actual quote? I thought it might be Einstein's quote and in answer to your question I thought of his cosmological constant in GR, which he called his biggest blunder but now it seems strangely appropriate given the accelerating expansion of the universe. Maybe this is not so much of a false positive though - just a lucky mistake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure what the exact quote is you are looking for, but since I have some spare time I did a search. Here are some relevant quotes that I found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A theory can be proved by experiment; but no path leads from experiment to the birth of a theory.   </p>
<ul>
<li>Manfred Eigen / Albert Einstein</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There may thus well exist better scientific evidence for a false theory, which will be accepted because it is more scientific, than for a valid explanation, which is rejected because there is no sufficient quantitative evidence for it.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Friedrich Hayek</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no great harm in the theorist who makes up a new theory to fit a new event. But the theorist who starts with a false theory and then sees everything as making it come true is the most dangerous enemy of human reason.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Gilbert K. Chesterton</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A hypothesis or theory is clear, decisive, and positive, but it is
believed by no one but the man who created it. Experimental findings,
on the other hand, are messy, inexact things, which are believed by
everyone except the man who did that work.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Harlow Shapley</li>

<p>I disagree. Lots of theories came from an experiment that didn't do what it was expected to do. The whole electromagnetism theory was because people observed that electric current would cause a compass needle to move. I beleive that xrays were disvovered by accident as were microwaves when a person trying to make a new radio found out it melted chocolate in his pocket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the false idea that consuming fat is bad for your health and should be avoided. If I remember correctly, there was a scientist that did a study in the 50s or 60s correlating diets that are low in fat with better health. He purposefully excluded France from the study, as people there were healthy and ate a lot of fat. </p>
<p>What happened next is that this research influenced official dietary guidelines and to this day the notion that fat is bad persists. As people reduced their fat consumption, and food corporations started marketing low-fat &quot;healthy&quot; products, the amount of carbs, specially sugar, people consume skyrocketed. As carbs don't offer the same satiety feeling as fat, people ended up consuming a lot more calories, and this is one of the main reasons we have an obesity epidemic today. </p>
<p>I don't remember the details very well, but there is really good and long NYTimes article about this, I just can't seem to find it now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest &quot;problem&quot; is the discredit it brings to science and academia, especially by those on the outsider and without a firm understanding of what is and isn't going on. I know someone who fervently denies climate change and he uses things like this as evidence it's all a hoax. &quot;see man, research - it's all lies. They just manipulate the experiments and the results until they get what they're looking for. And what they're looking for is a result that justifies their work and their continued employment because some results get more grants and other results don't&quot;. </p></div>		</li>
