			<div class="markdown"><p>This kinda-sorta answers the question but not really. Mosquitos are on the extreme (lightweight) side of things and they do live by slightly different practical rules. But what about creatures at the size scale of a few grams let's say, they're not going to be pushed away by the &quot;bow shock&quot; of the raindrop, but they're taking a hit from an object a few percent of their mass at high speed. They're resilient (cube-square law) but the kinetic energy must be significant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the exoskeleton of bugs is much stronger than the surface tension of the water droplet.   The impact of the water is only about the same as you jumping off a 3m / 9' tall diving board or less (20 mph or less).  </p>
<p>A flyswatter kills flies because you crush them between two solid objects.  If you hit a fly midair with a fly swatter, it'll just bounce away.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Kinetic energy is absolute: small things are almost as resilient as big things, only it takes less &quot;damage&quot; to kill them. In D&amp;D terms, a fly still has AC 14 but a low hp. Rain doesn't harm them because it's not energetic enough to hurt them.</p>
<p>Getting hit with a flyswatter would hurt a human, but not much. &quot;Not much&quot; is still enough to kill a fly.</p></div>		</li>
