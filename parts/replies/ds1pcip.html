<p>Edit: Thank you for my new most updooted comment. Broke my ankle about an hour after posting this. 2018 comin' in hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My younger brother's birthday is new years day. So we set off fireworks for him. He lit the first one without my knowledge and subsequently set the yard on fire. I was gonna run and stamp it out but it got pretty big pretty fast. Ran inside and got my extinguisher put it out. Turned around to go back to the house and move out of the way of the cloud of fire extinguisher powder. Stepped in a hole, ankle twisted, and I hit the ground. Got a nice mouth and lung full of salty/bitter powder and a broken ankle. Kinda tasted like baking soda.</p>
<p>0/10, would not recommend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the first strike must contain enough power to accommodate for the minimum energy required to break each successive brick along with the amount of energy lost in the process of breaking each brick. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. You're ignoring the significant potential energy inherent in the gaps between successive layers of stiff but fragile material supported only at the extreme ends (which is normally how these things re set up).</p>
<p>You smash through one layer. You've given it a boost, sure, but it's also being pulled down by gravity. The sum of the two just has to be enough to break the layer underneath, then there's most of the mass of TWO layers smashing onto the third. Then most of three onto the fourth. And so on. Within a few layers, gravity's doing all the work, and you're getting all the credit. Dominoes, like the first reply said.</p>
<p>(Fragile materials: Anyone who's ever done any paving knows this one. Take - say - a common-or-garden cement paving slab; support it flat at two opposite edges only. Hold another a few inches above it, parallel to it, then let go. If the two don't both shatter, you're lucky.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you only need to break the first layer then?  The rest is achieved with potential energy and gravity?
If that’s the case this exercise of breaking bricks is all a kind of scam made to look more difficult than it is? We’ve been had?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figured it was something like that. But the pieces of the top bricks don’t hit the center of the bricks below, yet they all seem to break right down the center. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've broken stacks of bricks before. They don't break very neatly or directly down the center. The breaks are not a straight line and sometimes a few smaller pieces break off. </p>
<p>Also any decent martial artist knows they need to aim for the ground below the bricks, so their hand will travel all the way through the stack of bricks, hitting each one near the center.</p>
<p>When it comes to the thin paving stones that my school uses, after about 7 bricks, all the weight from the top bricks will be enough to break the bottom ones. Any more than 7 is just for show.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! To be fair I’ve only seen videos. There was a front page reddit post where Jackie Chan did it while holding an egg. It didn’t look like his hand even passed the second brick. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The force of the impact is concentrated in a small area, but (at least for wood) it tends to spread out along the grain. Bricks don't have a grain like wood does, but the break generally still happens along a line starting from the point of impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the trick is to use long skinny bricks with those spacers.  This applies the maximum leverage to the center of the brick, where it is most likely to break even if hit a little off center.  The bricks are not being shattered, there are being bent using leverage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to add those people would not be able to break all those boards with no spacers, in ours will at max stack 2 one inch boards on a brick with no spacers or a 2 inch board on top a brick with no spacers, and if you do it extremely right the wood won't break and the brick will, board and brick breaking is all about demonstrating proper technique. White belts, start out with just the 1 inch board etc and no brick.</p></div>		</li>
