			<div class="markdown"><p>I find your point about compassion/empathy giving you a +1 immunity boost particularly interesting.   I guess caring for people like this and really feeling like you are making the difference must also help stave off things like depression (which in turn would lower the immune system)</p>
<p>I also wondered if perhaps you guys get quite sick regularly to start with and build up an immunity to many strains of viruses?    Also getting used to stress must make you tougher in the long term.</p>
<p>With me for example,  I don't have a particularly stressful job, I get up when I want, although I do have to work quite long shifts into the early hours sometimes (but not a great deal of hours overall in the week).  However it seems like every single time I get stressed at all I get ill (could just be a small thing like a sore throat for a day or a full blow cold for a week- which I recently had strangely during summer).  It could be something to do with the fact that I'm a bit depressed and I don't really go out at all (apart from work) as I have bad anxiety about illness.  So it's almost like by removing myself from all stressful situations I don't build up any tolerance to stress at all - do you think there is any truth in this theory? </p>
<p>I honestly don't know how nurses/doctors do their jobs, from someone with emetephobia like me. I'm really in awe of you guys.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's true that the knowledge that you're needed can really help to give you energy, and let you take a certain pride in yourself. But even so, medical personnel are among the professions with the very highest suicide numbers. It has been that way for a long time, and it's seen in many countries.</p>

<p>I can say that for part of med school, especially the first clinical year, <em>everyone</em> was sick almost all the time. Not super sick, but still. I think I had 8-10 serious bouts of the cold per semester, and I got the flu at one point which sucked (we get vaccinated for free but the vaccine's effectiveness varies from year to year). More than a few got mononucleosis, which isn't very fun either. The older doctors laughed and said that they had all gone through it and it would get better.</p>
<p>For your own state, I'd say that trying to get out will do you a lot of good! It doesn't have to be actually talking to people, but taking a daily walk in some park getting some light exercise and fresh air and simply <em>seeing</em> other people around will help you feel better. Exercise is surprisingly effective against depression, and it's also very good to have a habit: a task you try to do around the same time every day, if possible of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks.  I do take lots of walks and go to the gym, but I don't really have any friends (not trying to get sympathy here just telling the truth, and it's by no fault but my own) and have quite bad digestive issues likely related to anxiety so don't really go out socially.  </p>
<p>Thanks again for your help</p>
<p>(ps. yeah mono sucks, I got it 2 years ago and probably has increased my anxiety about illness a lot as a I fear my immune system has been compromised a lot because of mono - and it's quite uncertain how long it lasts)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an anecdote about health professionals being less sick:</p>
<p>When H1N1 was a big thing, my mother, a mammography tech/xray tech, had her employer offer free flu shots for any employees immediate family. I think I remember her flu shot was mandatory, if not every year then at least that year. The idea being the less sick family members, the less sick employees.</p>
<p>Though, besides lots of other health issues, she had colds about the same as anyone if not ever so slightly less.</p>
<p>Oddly, I worked retail for years, so was in constant contact with &quot;healthy&quot; people, but had some version of upper or lower respiratory issue from September through April (later May-June as my allergies have increased). While a health worker wash hands nearly constantly, in retail I held endless handfuls of the dirtiest grosses thing on the planet (cash) for hours at a time. The few times I could wash my hands, despite looking clean, the suds would be BLACK. A coworker was neurotic about it, constantly washing, hand sanitizer or wet naps, and had constantly chapped hands that cracked and bled all winter... Literal mummy hands. He has less colds, but worse allergies.  Probably lots of disease transmission science theories in this paragraph.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I both agree &amp; disagree with your post. Hear me out. I agree with you that getting outside, walking around, getting fresh air, etc., is extremely beneficial to anyone. I can see all the people I want to see on television. I don't have to personally see them to know that they're out there, in fact, I really don't want to see or interact in any way with other people. I'm quite fine with that. There are some people that are total recluses that are healthy and sane. I know and understand what the social norm is here, I just choose not to follow it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many thanks.
As for the getting stressed =&gt; getting sick, there are differing opinions on this. Some folks may say:
Change of weather results in allergy like symptoms,
Your body may have a stress reaction when there are no &quot;new&quot; stressors present,
The mind is a very powerful thing, so if you think about getting sick, then you would likely get sick. Confirmation Bias can play a huge role in this. I'd have to dig up some articles to back up the science on this, but its out there. Maybe the folks at r/science might be of help? </p>
<p>Your note about having emetophobia (fear of vomit) is one thing, however there are many other fields where a nurse would have a very low chance of seeing bodily fluids (something like public health nursing, disease investigation, diabetes education, being a nurse instructor, etc). You could even be a blood bank manager if you can handle blood but not vomit. Just a thought. </p>
<p>There is some element of &quot;getting used to stress&quot;, however we are still human beings. There is a reason that many nurses (and doctors) experience burnout. Much is expected of us with little room for grace. Your recognition is much appreciated, thank you. </p></div>		</li>

<p>ah I thought it was a fear of illness (which I have),  but think for clearing that up.  I guess I also have a fear of vomiting as an offshoot of this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My mum was a public health nurse for 40+ years, and judging by her stories, you couldn't be more wrong. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With the slight depression and illness anxiety it is very possible (as is the case with me) that the stress sicknesses you get are psychosomatic and not virus-based.  That doesn't mean &quot;it's all in your head&quot; in the sense that you don't feel what you feel, but it does mean that your body is mimicking the symptoms of the various viruses that it's had before as a reaction to the stress, not necessarily that you've caught the actual virus.   Depending on severity, anxiety can have similar symptoms to many common viruses (dry throat causing the scratchiness, anxiety tying up your digestive track making you feel off, or bloating, and then fatigue from the impact on your gut etc.).  That's not to discount that those two do typically affect your immune system, it just isn't so simple as that. </p>
<p>Further, if you have anxiety about illnesses, then you will be hyper vigilant about the symptoms, so while others might not notice or think anything of an isolated day of sneezing or a sore throat that doesn't last, you immediately focus on them because you are worried about getting sick (I do the same thing, also I'm a mental health clinician)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/RonSwanson23,</p>
<p>I'd also like to add a little something by saying that most of it can be prevented by using proper sanitation methods and care (like wearing gloves and a mask).</p>
<p>And, washing your hands without soap in a hospital (or any place in general) can actually cause more harm than good as water (without soap) isn't sufficient enough to kill the viruses and bacteria (since most bacteria operate through water better than they do through air)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work as a nurse assistant in a retirement home. Obviously this means that most of the time, no precautions have to be made as these people need care because they're old and either can't take care of themselves for physical (unable to walk, bend over etc) or psychical (dementia) reasons. However, if someone does get ill here we take quite immediate action: they can't leave their room, number of staff entering the room is reduced to a minimum, those who enter have to wear isolation gowns, masks and gloves, nothing leaves the room except in a special double-bag system (being in bag one, stuff everything inside, take it out and drop it into bag two just outside the room). And you wash and desinfect your hands a lot (which we do anyway, but even moreso then). All to contain the virus where it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my hospital, patients with communicable diseases (or, in some cases, a history of certain infections) get signs on their doors with instructions for staff to wear PPE.
If you've had MRSA, for example, staff will wear gloves in your room at all times.  If they're going to be in contact with your belongings, bedding, fluids, or person, then they'll wear gloves and an impermeable gown.</p>
<p>C-diff requires a gown and gloves at all times, plus hand washing with soap &amp; water rather than with sanitizer.</p>
<p>Varicella (chicken pox) requires airborne precautions or demonstrated immunity for staff.</p>
<p>This is typically determined by the infectious disease folks at the hospital, and does wonders for reducing staff illness and the spread of infection within the hospital.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>
