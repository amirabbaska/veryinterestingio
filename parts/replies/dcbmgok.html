			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a sneeze-muter simply because my regular sneeze, while not obnoxious, is loud and often painful. My eyes will water and my head will start throbbing. If I pinch my nose shut before a sneeze, it eliminates the noise, the pain, and the eye watering. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like you either have significant sinus problems, with the head throbbing and such, which is common among people who are regularly sick. I have a friend who is always stuffed up and doesn't realize that it's not normal. Always heavy sneezes, head throb etc. Get your sinuses checked. That's a good start</p></div>		</li>
