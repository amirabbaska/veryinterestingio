			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right: eyelashes and eyebrows are an interesting one. Unlike regular head/body hair, it has a very specific biological function; to protect your eyes. Eyebrows help divert fluid from entering your eye area, and eyelashes trap dust and debris from getting into your eyes.</p>
<p>Your body will attempt to restrict eyelash length to a certain length that it feels is genetically appropriate - people whose genetic background is in sandy/dusty countries tend to have lusher, thicker, longer eyelashes because their ancestors had more of a need to filter out dust from their eyes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if you apply a certain protein receptor to your eyelids (Prostaglandin F), you can override this &quot;genetic length&quot; and grow super-long eyelashes that follow the same &quot;fall out when degraded&quot; rule that other body hair does. This is the chemical used in Latisse eyelash extender.</p></div>		</li>

<p>and theoretically grow to infinite length.</p>

<p>Unless you've found a reliable way to genetically engineer people then this statement isn't even remotely true. All non-vellus hairs cycle through 3 distinct growth phases, anagen, catagen and telogen. Anagen is the growth phase and for different follicles it has a somewhat fixed period, only a handful of months for arm or leg hairs and several years for scalp hair. There is additionally a fair bit of variation from individual to individual so some folk achieve much longer hair than others.</p>
<p>As such it is not the case that all people can achieve 18 feet long hair and as all mature follicles will enter the telogen phase and shed it is certainly not the case that hair can grow to infinite length.</p>
<p>Please correct your answer to reflect what we actually know about hair growth.</p></div>		</li>
