			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does light red get its own name (pink), but not light blue, or light orange?  When does a greenish blue become a shade of green?  Why do the &quot;7 colors of the rainbow&quot; include indigo and violet?</p>
<p>You see, the labels we attach to colors is cultural.  If there isn't a lot of specifically-blue things in your everyday life (and back then there wasn't), there isn't really a need to differentiate it from greens.  It never comes in handy if you never have to say things like &quot;...no, not that one, the <em>blue</em> one&quot;.  No need to clarify which color you mean when you talk about the sky/ocean because everyone already knows that color, and there's no need to distinguish it with another color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Historically, Turks had two native words for different shades of red, but no words for pink and orange.</p>
<p>Al is blood red or rose red, and kızıl is sunset red or amber red.</p>
<p>These words are still in use, but this differentation proved to be unpractical and the difference got lost in time.</p>
<p>So they took different set of words for shades of red from Persian. Kırmızı (simply red/qirmiz is a precious natural dye), turuncu (orange/turunch means orange fruit) and pembe (pink/panbe means cotton).</p>
<p>Kırmızı, al and kızıl are considered synonyms nowadays, yet redheads are called kızıl.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are names for a panoply of colors, but the vocabulary isnt well known, and you won't hear words like cerulean, cyan or mauve as often as pink or brown. I agree that there's a cultural component but I think it's a component of the Greek language's vocabulary overall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But bronze is so far away from blue that it's weird that they'd call the color of their shield and the color of the sky the same name. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>They encountered plenty of what we would consider to be blue, but it isn't obvious that one should separate hues at any specific point. Why would you make blue different from purple if you didn't already have that distinction?</p></div>		</li>
