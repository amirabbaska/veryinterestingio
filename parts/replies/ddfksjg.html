			<div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that if we ate our food raw we'd spend most of the day laying around and digesting, like lions or so. Instead we can walk around and get stuff done. So we don't cook our food because we're so advanced, we're so advanced because we cook our food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another factoid I stored away was that cooked food allowed our digestive system to shrink, helping it fit in a smaller abdomen more efficient for standing upright. Can anyone confirm?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also helps that most carnivores eat their food extremely soon after the food is killed. By the time meat is butchered, processed (and possibly sold), it will have been dead for hours, days or even weeks (if it was frozen, salted or dried). That's plenty of time for bacteria to start to build up.</p></div>		</li>
