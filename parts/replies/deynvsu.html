			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the current development in Car industry I think one of the most impactful changes will be that no one will own a car anymore.
You will just use your mobile phone to &quot;call&quot; a fully automated driving car to get from a to b.</p>
<p>Edit: it did not meant that no one will use a car as some imply.
I did not meant the factor of &quot;fun&quot; to drive whatever type of car for pleasure.
I'm saying that the environment including government and also insurance companies leverage the use of automated cars as they are cheaper, less pollution producing, safer etc. so they will incentive you using them. Leaving you with your car for pure pleasure but not because it makes economic sense.  </p>
<p>I love the example of horses back then by u/athousandwordss when automobiles were emerging. Yes cowboy you will still ride your horse in 100 years- majority won't. ...</p></div>		</li>

<p>This. In the future, you will ditch your car because <em>you want</em> to ditch your car.  </p>
<p>As someone who lives in the motor city and drives a <em>completely</em> impracticable 2-door Wrangler because it's fun, and rides a Harley for the same reason, there is no doubt in my mind that people will ditch their vehicles the moment it gets cheaper to push a button than get quotes from auto insurance companies, go to the DMV, constantly re-fuel it, pay in money <em>and time</em> to maintain it, etc.  </p>
<p>I also lived on the East coast for 3 years. Was planning on getting a car but never did because the public transit was so good. It was <em>fantastic</em> not to have to bother. When it is actually <em>more of a hassle</em> to acquire a car <em>and more expensive</em> as well, people will not be doing that in droves. Owning and driving yourself around in a car will be for enthusiasts. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm in sales and the thing car enthusiasts don't get is just how much most people dislike cars and just see it as something they have to have/do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll take you up on that. I bet a majority of people will still own a car 100 years from now.</p>
<p>Edit: This mostly has become a discussion of autonomous vehicles but the original point you made:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>no one will own a car anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is the only one that I refuted. Whether or not humans will be <em>driving</em> their cars isn't what I was refuting. I'm saying that plenty of people will still own their own vehicles in the future. There have been some good arguments against that, and I'm sure vehicle ownership will decline, but I think plenty of people will pay a premium for their own personal vehicle (regardless if it's autonomous or not).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm with /u/suzu85 on this one. Why do you think people will still own cars a 100 years from now? </p>
<p>First of all, a 100 years is a long long time to expect anything to remain the status quo. Secondly, it'd be much more economical, eco-friendly and convenient to have a car show up whenever you want. There would be no barriers to calling a car anywhere, everything would be much more accessible, and it's be much more convenient.</p>
<p>The cars would be autonomous and be controlled by some sort of centralised software which monitors car density in different areas and maintains them accordingly.</p>
<p>Of course this is just speculation, but I'd like to see why you think this won't happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could see it going either way, really.  All about the cost.  </p>
<p>If Uber or the likes stocks the roads with fully automated cars that can pick you up in seconds, and be as cheap or cheaper than owning the car yourself, I can't see why people would bother.  Factor in payments, maintenance, insurance, gas and tolls and I could see this being a viable for many, myself included.   And cars are a bit of a hassle.  This model you'd never have to worry about being stuck with a car that needs repairs, never have to deal with mechanics or salesmen again, hell, not even have to worry about stopping for gas.  Just get in and go.  Which I'd even pay a bit of a premium for.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of strides to be made in terms of renewable/clean energy. We could reasonably expect that we'll have made great advancements in the next 50 years. </p>
<p>Computing is an area where we seem to be on the cusp of a revolution. Quantum computing and organic computers seem to be right around the corner.</p>
<p>Means of space travel are becoming increasingly researched. One of the problems with traveling through space is cosmic radiation exposure. If we could design a way to effectively reduce the exposure, that would be one more thing out of the way in our quest for interstellar travel. </p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is an area where it wouldn't be entirely surprising for breakthroughs to be made. There is research being done to give AI emotions (as terrifying as that is), and that could potentially be an area where we could see breakthroughs relatively soon. However, first we would need to have true AI, which doesn't seem far off. </p></div>		</li>

For example counseling or comforting someone, if it can empathize it may have a greater chance of successfully handling the situation.</p></div>		</li>
