<p>Does the &quot;meat&quot; of our body immediately enter into a state of decay or is there a chemical release of some kind before that? Also what type of brain activity actually happens during this phase and what is its purpose?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It enters into a state of primary flaccidity, followed by stiffness (rigor mortis): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigor_mortis" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigor_mortis</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.gro.gov.uk/Images/medcert_July_2010.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> are some guidelines on death certificate writing in the UK. Pay close attention to section 5.3, mentioning the criteria for issuing old age as the sole cause of death. In these situations it is not just old age that killed the patient, they likely had an unexpected vascular event of some kind that is not worth the effort to image for and diagnose. So old age is not the actual cause of death even though it may be listed there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I wasn't clear, I was talking about your statement re:doctors not putting 'old age' down in a death certificate. It does happen very frequently. </p>
<p>You are obviously right that it isn't a true cause of death but if it wasn't used, there would be a lot of distress for families who now legally have to have a post mortem on their 90 year old gran. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, failure to thrive isn't a true medical diagnosis in the sense that it doesn't have a unique underlying pathology. It is a blanket term for &quot;not doing so great&quot; characterized by excessive weight loss. This is always going to be secondary to some underlying condition (infection, liver failure, malabsorption, etc), and while it may not be worth the effort in some cases for an autopsy to be performed to discover the cause of the failure to thrive, the failure to thrive was not the causative agent in the patient's death. </p></div>		</li>
