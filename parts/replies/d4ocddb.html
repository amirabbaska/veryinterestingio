<li>The Wikipedia page says the object has an &quot;absolute magnitude (H)&quot; of 24. Magnitude is a way of defining brightness and the smaller the number, the brighter it is. For comparison, <strong>the moon full has an H value of +0.25</strong>. I think a difference of 1 in absolute magnitude translates to a 2.5x decrease in brightness (I may be wrong with the exact figure). So +24 is extremely dim. You would probably need a huge telescope to see it.</li>

<p>The fifth root of 100 to be exact, so a difference of 5 magnitudes corresponds to a difference of 100. </p>
<p>~24 magnitudes difference = (100^(1/5))^24 = 100^(24/5) = 10^(48/5) = 10^(9 + 3/5) = 10^9 * 10^0.6 â‰ˆ 10^9 </p>
<p>So the difference of brightness is in the billions, but not in the tens of billions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Convention. The greeks or chinese or some older civilisation created the apparent magnitude system, 1 to 6, with 1 being the brightest star they could see and 6 being the faintest. The 100^1/5 was just the way it worked out</p></div>		</li>
