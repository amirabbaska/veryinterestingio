			<div class="markdown"><p>First, thank you very much for a great answer.</p>
<p>Does it happen that people write the wrong character? Or that a stroke is a little too long so it becomes another character?</p>
<p>Also, &quot;Home I am&quot; isn't something a native English speaker would accidentally write meaning &quot;I am home&quot;. But e.g using &quot;who&quot; rather than &quot;whom&quot; is common. &quot;Its&quot; when it should be &quot;It's&quot;. Are there any such common mistakes in Chinese?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually it's only when you're not fully fluent (like me LOL), you tend to mess up the characters or miss a stroke here or there. Also doesn't help that now with the modern keyboard and the lack of writing on the internet, there's no longer a need to memorize how characters are written, all you need to remember is how they're pronounced and how they <em>kinda</em> look and the phone/computer inputs for you.</p>
<p>Just an example, I can type out 橘 (tangerine) coz I know how it's pronounced and vaguely remember how it looks, but if you asked me to WRITE it, I'd probably draw a blank.</p>
<p>Well, I guess it's a bit hard to make grammar errors since the language is like lego, you piece words together to form a sentence and there are no tenses involved. But I guess sometimes if you are in a rush you'd miss out a word and that makes the sentence wrong, like writing 跳 (jumping) when you wanted to write 跳舞 (dancing).     </p></div>		</li>

<p>Non-native Japanese speaker here, though I speak, read and write every day as part of my work.  I'm quite a fluent reader and writer when I'm typing, but with a pen and paper, all I can come up with is my address and some other really common characters.  For everything else, I have to type them into my phone and then copy off that using pen and paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually not that hard to make grammatical errors - especially when you're first learning the language. For example, a common error is using the wrong &quot;measure&quot; words. English doesn't have a notion of measure words, but here's a list of the ones in Chinese:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.languagerealm.com/chinese/chinese_measure_words.php" target="_blank">http://www.languagerealm.com/chinese/chinese_measure_words.php</a></p>
<p>So, in Chinese, the construction is <number>+<measure word>+<matching object>. If there's no standard measure word for an object, the generic 个 (ge) is used.</p>
<p>So, not a misspelling, but grammar is easy to mess up...in pretty much every language!  :-)</p>
<p>EDIT:  Sauce: I studied Chinese for 4 years at the local college in an adult continuing ed program. I'm not fluent, but wish I was. The class wasn't taught by a language professor, so not enough time was ever spent on speaking and listening to the language. I can read and write pretty well though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A kind of typo not mentioned above is based on pinyin (Latin alphabet) input on a keyboard, which most people use.</p>
<p>If you type &quot;cao ni ma&quot;, it will pop up characters for you to choose from.  If you're inexperienced/careless/let the computer pick, it might write the characters for &quot;grass mud horse&quot; when you really meant &quot;fuck your mother&quot;...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Characters can look incorrect when you cross in the wrong place or don't use correct proportions. For example the character 我 (wo, Mandarin for I/me). The left side when hand written is expected to be a bit smaller than the right side. The character can appear incorrect if you use the wrong stroke or don't  use a hook where you should. You also have to be careful about stroke placement in relation to each other and the angles at which the strokes are made. Heng, or horizontal, strokes are usually written with a very slight upward stroke. When talking about proportions take the character for zai (one use is to create the present progressive tense (-ing). 在 is zai. Look at the inner element with the cross. The top stroke of the inner element must be shorter than the bottom/last stroke. If it is longer or equal the character is incorrect. </p>
<p>Edit: I would suggest maybe watching videos of people talking about writing characters. They will really go into detail about what happens when you make certain mistakes. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There are characters which their shapes are similar while their pronunciations and meanings are completely different. If they are hand-written, people can guess the intended characters from context and not considered as wrong (unless they are written blatantly wrong). <code>田, 由, 甲, 甴, 曱, 申</code> all have different meanings. Another (more subtle) example is <code>己,已,巳</code>. Generally people are more cautious when writing these characters which can be easily confused.</p>
<p>There are, however, characters with slightly different strokes but considered as the same word, e.g. <code>戶, 户</code>, or <code>告, 吿</code>.

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife is Chinese and she experiences something like this with her name.</p>
<p>Her name is supposed to be a &quot;real word&quot;. But when her parents were naming her, they got one of the Chinese characters wrong, so it does not transcribe the same way as the &quot;real word&quot; does. She constantly has to explain to Chinese-speakers that &quot;it's not spelt how you expect&quot;.</p>
<p>Kind of the equivalent of an English-speaking parent naming their kid &quot;Krystal&quot; or &quot;Lileee&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something to note is that Chinese is a &quot;tone language&quot;. In other words, words that seem to be pronounced the same way could be completely different based on the tone used. There are for example at least 4 different words pronounced &quot;ma&quot; all different depending on the tone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>妈 (ma1) - mother</p>
<p>麻 (ma2) - numb</p>
<p>马 (ma3) - horse</p>
<p>骂 (ma4) - scold</p>
<p>So yes, a sentence like &quot;Numb mother scolds horse&quot; (麻妈骂马) is essentially &quot;ma ma ma ma&quot;.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer, &quot;numb mother&quot; isn't really a thing? But it's funny so I kept it.) </p></div>		</li>
