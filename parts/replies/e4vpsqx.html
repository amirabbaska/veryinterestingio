<p>Integrated circuits are most vulnerable to this radiation which is difficult to shield. Over time this can degrade IC chips to the point where they lose function. There is no simple solution to this problem.</p>

<p>I tested a box sized component used in a payload. Before we shipped the boards, they were sealed with a translucent purple plastic. I believe this will prevent radiation exposure and prevent the soldering from forming whiskers. The boards were surrounded by a large metal box. And that box had a black paint coating specifically designed to prevent radiation - which was very expensive. </p>
<p>The amount of work to protect a small circuit board (1 foot x 1 foot) that sits inside the larger satellite was really eye opening. Space is a really hostile and lonely place. And to add complexity to the problem, these components need to work independently for 30 years. No one is there to fix it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time out.</p>
<p>You're saying that our next generation of space telescope is going to take proverbial gut punches without shielding? We're going to deliberately allow it's mirrors to be damaged and just work around it?</p>
<p>Am I crazy or does that sound crazy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. The main segmented mirror is fairly exposed, however there is a large sun shade blanket several times the size of the mirror to block glare from the sun. This will also provide some ballistic protection. </p>
<p>Moreover, small scale damage to the <em>back</em> side of the the mirror isn't of much consequence. So at a minimum, the  reflective surface of the mirror is protected from around half of micrometeoroids, if one assumes that they come from completely random directions. </p>
<p>Note that the overall shape of a mirror doesn't affect it's resolution or magnifying power, max resolution only depends on diameter. </p>
<p>Damage to the mirror surface merely affects it's light collecting ability, and also causes small amounts of fringing effects. So, if you were to drill thousands of randomly sized holes in a telescope mirror, it wouldn't affect it's resolution, it only means collection light from the whole field of view is harder. Generally you'd have to take two images with the telescope aimed slightly differently angles, then use software to create a composite image. In other words, you'd need to collect light for twice as long.</p>
<p>Anyone who has worn glasses can tell you that dirty lenses mainly cause the image to be cloudy/hazy, but doesn't affect the corrective ability of the glasses.</p>
<p>It's my understanding that due to the large diameter and area of the JWST mirror, over the expected lifetime of the craft damage to the mirror was considered to be acceptably low.</p></div>		</li>
