			<div class="markdown"><p>A ballistic shield would. a riot shield. probably not for long, but neither did a wooden shield either.
making a shield with modern materials would probably be a nice upgrade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean imagine a modern sniper against a small medieval army. Put a stone roof over his head to block arrows and he'd basically both be invincible and able to kill anyone at any distance by the standards of the time. Guns are really OP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Snipers aren't really designed to handle large forces. They're precision units meant for scouting and removing specific threats from a zone so that a larger friendly force doesn't have to. They're not gods of war that video games make them out to be.</p>
<p>If you really want one-man overpoweredness, get a mortar and an automatic weapon, maybe some grenades. Large groups of standing armies in bright colored clothing against artillery and grenades? It'd be the French front of WWI all over again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about killing an entire army, it's about routing an entire army. If they can't even see the man killing them they won't stick around very long. I mean it'd basically look like people's heads are exploding for no reason even with armor. That's some black magic most armies of the time would not want to deal with.</p></div>		</li>
