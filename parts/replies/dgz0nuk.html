			<div class="markdown"><p>College class prof used robin's blue eggs as an example of measured directional selection. Studies (nope, don't have sources handy as class was taken years ago) found that bluer eggs were found in areas with higher incidences of brood parasites (like cowbirds or cuckoos). My fuzzy memory even says that robins were documented quickly  shoving the easily distinguished cowbird's eggs out of the nest soon after their appearance.</p>
<p>Edit: couldn't leave it be and had to look up at least one reference. N. American robins do reliably reject the eggs of brown-headed cowbirds (bright blue, unspotted eggs vs white and brown spotted eggs).
