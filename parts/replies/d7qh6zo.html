<p>TLDR: liquid and solid are insufficient terms for defining the range of materials we have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A really good example of this is also the Pitch Drop experiment. </p>
<p>Almost 100 years ago, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/University_of_Queensland_Pitch_drop_experiment-white_bg.jpg" target="_blank">a professor put some pitch (essentially, tar) into a funnel over a cup.</a> Since then, only about 10 drops have dripped through the funnel, approximately once per ten years. On the timescale of a human looking at it, it's practically solid, or at least a soft gel like material. Even when <a href="https://youtu.be/yCj5krgpX9M?t=9" target="_blank">a drop breaks off, it doesn't mix into the material below, but settles onto the top like a fallen tree branch.</a> It then takes another enormous amount of time for the fallen drop to 'flow' down and take the shape of the cup, like a liquid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this the experiment where the professor who started it never got to see any of the times the &quot;liquid&quot; dripped, and even after they set up a camera for recording, he still missed it because the camera setup had some kind of technical problems when the drip happened? And then the professor died without ever seeing it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be exact, the original Queensland experiment was started in 1927, making it 89 years old, and exactly 9 drops have fallen, the most recent in 2014. </p>
<p>Wikipedia also tells me it holds the Guinness record for longest continuously running laboratory experiment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, it depends on &quot;fragility&quot; whether the change in viscosity is much larger close to the glass transition than at other temperatures: <a href="http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/Publications/Highlights/2003/HRRS/HRRS09" target="_blank">http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/Publications/Highlights/2003/HRRS/HRRS09</a></p>

<p>The classic definition of a liquid is something that flows under its own weight so peanut butter would not be a liquid but it's not really solid either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely that's dependent on the amount of material present, though? A jar of peanut butter won't flow under its own weight, but a very large amount absolutely will. Also, how quickly does it need to flow? Various obviously-solid rocks like granite have been <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110002299397/&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DIto%2BHidebumi%26hl%3Den" target="_blank">shown to flow even under very small loads</a>.</p>
<p>For that matter, if you get enough of <em>anything</em> together in one place it will flow under its own weight just like a liquid (hence all bodies above a certain size being spherical).</p>
<p>I wish I could remember where I read it, but I recall reading a scientist claiming that there's no real distinction between a solid and a liquid other than solids having extremely high viscosity. Not sure whether other scientists agree with his claim, but I did read it somewhere :-).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Under its own weight isn't really great wording. I should say that fluids with yield points aren't classically considered liquid but rather structured fluids. Honey, oil, water, alcohol are all liquidous but ketchup, tooth paste, etc. are yield point fluids. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ketchup is also good example of a non-newtonian, shear-thinning fluid.  I.e., when it starts flowing it becomes less viscous, hence why it tends to not leave the bottle until way too much does.  </p>
<p>There's also shear-thickening fluids, like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GWhOLorDtw" target="_blank">famous</a> corn-starch+water mixture.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually it will.</p>
<p>Try inverting the jar when you put it back on the shelf and leave it that way for a month or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on brand. Natural peanut butters, you are right. But some brands have additives that prevent exactly this (which also prevents separation of oils during shipping and storage). </p></div>		</li>
