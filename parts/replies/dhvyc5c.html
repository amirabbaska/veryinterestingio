			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine you're talking about the United States (apologies if not, but people on here tend to be unless they state otherwise). In the UK if you are stopped by the police and don't have your driving licence with you, you have a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/stopped-by-police-while-driving-your-rights/overview" target="_blank">week</a> to show it at a police station, as well as your insurance docs and MOT (MOT stands for Ministry of Transport, and is a certificate that proves that your car has been declared fit and safe to drive), neither of the last two being things you are likely to have on your person or necessarily in your car. In theory that means you don't have to carry your licence and registration etc when you drive, but it doesn't actually make it much more straightforward.</p>
<p>That said, the one time I ever got pulled over by the police, I saw that they do have access to a lot of your licensing information through online police databases anyway. I did actually have my licence, so they looked at it, but only to check it was me in the picture, then they asked for my name and postcode (zipcode?), they radio-ed it in, and with just name/postcode they came back with all my licence details, the date and year I passed my test, my insurance details, my MOT certificate dates, and everything. Once they checked all that they gave me a mild bollocking for having indicated too late on a turning and let me go.</p>
<p>I didn't have to have any details on my phone, and even without my licence and just my personal details they were able to get all that information there and then in the police car. As I say, this was 2007, if they could do it then, they surely would be able now to get even more convenient access to it, without putting any onus on the driver to have a charged (smart) phone.</p></div>		</li>

That somewhere, at least once<br />
Police officers pulled someone over and gave them a good bollocking for shitty signalling?<br />
That makes me so happy!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying you're wrong with your question here, but think about this from the public's perspective: Changes like this cost money and because computer systems are unreliable (complex, secure systems are difficult to maintain and protect against hackers), they cost a lot of money in upkeep.</p>
<p>So, are you willing to take a tax hike just to provide <em>some</em> people with a <em>mild</em> convenience?</p>
<p>Next, this creates precedent for some state or county to say &quot;listen, 80% of our people use the cloud system, so we're going all in and getting rid of paper all together&quot; this would place a severe financial burden on a lot of people who can't afford it. Health care is one thing, that's life and death, but forcing people to have dataplans would cause riots in the streets. Then you have people who are too impoverished to afford it &quot;well they can get one from the government&quot; then you have to contend with trying to convince people to be okay with another tax hike to put together a program for those people.</p>
<p>Finally, security. You can hack a phone. You can't hack a piece of paper. Hacking data centers is something that a lot of people can do. But to physically steal information takes leg work and resources and time. Dig through trash, construct life info, discover locations of accounts and other things. Some can be pulled from the internet, but some does require hoofing it over there. Its easier to fake digital credentials than it is to fake physical credentials (like driver's licenses).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now imagine handing over your phone, unlocked, to a cop who you know nothing about. Maybe you've got nothing on there or maybe you still have the nude picture your ex girlfriend sent you. Now that cop has access to it as he runs your information... in his car. Maybe that picture ends up on the internet... and you're the only one she sent it to. </p>
<p>What a shistorm right? Odds of that happening seem pretty low but there has to be a lot of guidelines and tape to prevent situations like this from ever arising. To protect not only citizens but the police as well... and getting those guidelines requires legislation, getting bipartisan agreements, and support to see it though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was once pulled over, with no reason given. I showed him my license and registration papers, and showed him proof of insurance on my phone.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry, I need the actual insurance.&quot;
&quot;Actually, sir, California law says having proof on my phone counts. I can pull up that law if you'd like.&quot;
&quot;That's OK. I'm sure the judge will dismiss your ticket when you show him.&quot;
&quot;Yes sir, the law would require them to. The law also doesn't give you a reason to write me a ticket.&quot;
&quot;Are you arguing with me?&quot;</p>
<p>At that point the cop got a call on his radio and left, which is definitely for the best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this, how does the cop know who you say you are? Your ID. He can look up the person who you say you are, and that person can look like you, but beyond that he doesn't actually know himself if that's true.</p>
<p>Your ID proves who you are unless it's a fake, and cops have ways to check for fakes. Then registration proves that your car is yours, or someone else's and that they gave you permission to drive said car. If you stole a car, showed the registration and that car is reported as stolen, bam, cops caught the crook, or a poor guy who has been bamboozled by the crook.</p></div>		</li>
