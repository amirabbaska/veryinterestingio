			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody else said it yet, but thanks for this post. It's a great wall of text. I think a lot of times reddit believes that current science MUST be the truth, but for a lot of things there is a decent amount of grey area. It's exactly like you said, we're not even sure if dark matter exists, and it may not.</p>
<p>People don't want to hear &quot;we don't know&quot; though, it makes them feel less in control, even though in this example not knowing doesn't really affect them much. Well I guess it might, but they won't know until they know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for giving an answer starting from scratch and teaching us lay-men the basics of the situation! This is why I love /r/askscience !</p>
<p>However, let me follow up with a question. I've only studied basic physics and math, but you learn quickly that if your calculations don't match the answer, the problem likely lies with your calculations, not with the answer. So when I read</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can calculate the mass of a galaxy based on how much light it emits. From that we can calculate how fast it should rotate using updated versions of Kepler's Laws for orbits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it seems to me that we are assuming quite a few models, laws and theories are true when making these calculations. I understand that there's no way the calculations are wrong, but couldnt the very rules we set for those calculations be? </p>
<p>It seems more logical for me to question the method we used to reach our incorrect answer, rather than invent new theories to make our answer the correct one. </p>
<p>I understandthere's a reason they assume they are right, otherwise they wouldnt have spent so much time and resources developing and experimenting with the Dark Matter theory. But I'd love some help in understanding why they are so certain that their calculations are correct!</p></div>		</li>

<p>The rules we have work just fine on smaller scales, like our solar system.  But you're right, they could work differently on larger scales.  There's actually a name for that theory: MOND, or Modified Newtonian Dynamics.  It solves some problems, but presents others.  The point is, this isn't something that we understand very well, and there are multiple competing theories that are difficult if not impossible to test experimentally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fundamental problem is that we can calculate speed of rotation in two ways, but they don't match. One uses the Dopler Shift of light from stars moving toward us on one side of the galaxy, and away from us on the opposite side. This one is fairly reliable and more direct. The second way to calculate speed is to measure the mass of the objects involved as best as we can, then use what we know about gravity to figure out what the speed should be. This method is more indirect. But it works with every object in our solar system, stars we've seen near by, and it works perfectly well near the middle of galaxies. </p>
<p>The only place it doesn't work is near the edges of galaxies. </p>
<p>The important question left to be answered is why not? Either we missed something in our measurements or we're using the wrong equations to model the world. The equations have been very very well tested on Earth and in other observations. If there is something wrong with them, we'd need to find new equations which account for the difference but also have the same level of precision that we got with the old equations in the areas where the old ones were tried and tested. Part of the appeal of Newtons Laws is that they seem to apply <em>universally.</em> (Except if you're going very very fast, which is why we have Einstein's Relativity.) </p>
<p>There is a theory which tries to account for the &quot;missing mass&quot; by adjusting the equations called MOND (MOdified Newtonian Dynamics). It has a few issues of its own, but I'm glad people are exploring it. </p>
<p>Basically, scientists want to explore Dark Matter as fully as possible, before they turn to Newton's laws and say they're not quite right. There isn't a good replacement like there was for Relativity. The adjustment for  relativity was a simple factor of 1 / ( sqrt ( 1 - v^2 / c^2 ) ) . If we can improve MOND to better reflect our observations it might become the standard theory, but until then, Dark Matter requires us to make fewer fundamental changes in well tested laws of physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I hear anyone talking about a model as the absolute truth, I make it a point to explain what a model is with an example. It goes something like this: </p>
<p>Say we are investigating persons A, B, C and D, and we can see their current bank account balances, A=100, B=50, C=25, D=25. We also found an ATM ticket dated a week ago from A that says he had 200 dollars. So, model 1 says A transferred 50 dollars to B, 25 to C and 25 to D. Model 2 says A transferred 100 dollars to B, then B transferred 25 to both C and D. Model 3 says A transferred the 100 dollars to an unknown bank account E we haven't found yet, and Model 4 says the ATM ticket we found was printed last wednesday on an epson and all bank where actually opened yesterday with their current balances. Without any further evidence, all models are equally correct. We just values for A, B, C and D, and any possible valid equation that involves those numbers. The models are just explanations that apply our knowledge of the banking system, and how people use their money to those working equations to explain what happened. Some of them seem more plausible than others, and some certainly make less assumptions and are simpler while others make more assumptions and seem therefore less likely, but they are all equally correct explanations of what happened. When we find additional information, say, a paper trail showing a transaction of 25 dollars from B to C, it discards some models and points towards model 2. But that's all they are, models. </p>
<p>We have an equation that roughly works with our current knowledge of the universe, and we know what most of the variables are in real life. Then something comes up, and the equation is no longer balanced, so we fix the math in several possible ways, but now we have new variables introduced and we don't know what they are, so we try to put names on them and explain them based on our current knowledge, but that doesn't mean it's true. TL;DR: Any possible models that don't contradict our measurements, no matter how implausible, are equally valid. </p>
<p>This kind of example has worked fairly well for me to try to explain this to people, but they find this truth disappointing. I follow up by telling them to get used to it, since it's the nature of the Universe. Some things, we will never know for sure. We'll only have valid models to explain them. No matter how much hard data we collect, we'll never be able to actually empirically experience more than 3 dimensions, or observe the birth of the Universe. Many things, we won't ever be able to wrap our heads around. We might be able to do the math correctly, but our minds are simply not equipped to intuitively understand certain concepts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love it. </p>
<p>In my 7th grade science class we divided up into groups and each group got a sealed shoe box. The shoe boxes had regularly spaced holes in sides and top and we got metal rods that fit in the holes. &quot;Describe what's in the box&quot; said the teacher. We all poked the metal rod into the holes and took measurements, it was a fun day. Eventually we made a plot of the data and we could get a picture of what was inside. One group had more holes per inch and got a better picture. One group thought they knew what the object was, so they drew between the data points. Other groups just did straight lines, or slight curves. The teacher asked us if the objects were hollow or solid. There was no way for us to answer.</p>
<p>It was a great lesson about how to use incomplete data to draw conclusions. It also showed us the limits that you can run into, and how improving your measurements gives you a better idea of the world around you. </p>
<p>We don't have perfect tools, and we don't have perfect theories. We're constantly improving them and I think that's the exciting part of being alive, especially today when progress is happening so quickly!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is an absolutely amazing teaching technique, I wish my teachers had done anything so interesting back in school. Actually, I would totally buy a board game based on that premise. </p>
<p>And, yes, indeed being alive is exciting. Some people feel like we were born too late to explore the earth, and it is partially true, but we were born at the right time to explore the Universe. I could never understand how some people find the weight of live unbearable, or boring, or simply uninteresting. There is so much that we learn every day, and we have almost unrestricted access to all of the world's knowledge as it's being acquired daily, I find myself amazed like a little kid daily with humanities achievements, both with what others do, and that infinitesimal part I contribute to it. </p></div>		</li>
