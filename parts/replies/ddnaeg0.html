			<div class="markdown"><p>Its worth mentioning that the reason people are more likely to mess around installing 3rd-party firmware on phones is that phones are far more locked down to begin with. I can install software and operating systems from anywhere on my PC (OK I might have to turn off secure boot - but it's just a setting) without much hocus-pocus. On a phone if you're not installing something from the Google Play Store or the Apple Store you're basically stuck unless you install a custom ROM.</p>
<p>This makes said custom ROMs much more useful and popular, so something that is essentially pointless on PCs is necessary for some functions on phones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh on android at least you can easily install apps from 3rd party sources. You just need the APK.</p>
<p>edit : my comment was only to address /u/F0sh's point that installing apps from 3rd party sources is not easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you can't unlock your phone for use on any ISP easily, or change hardware drivers easily, on Android any more than you can on other platforms.  The good ones come unlocked, but most are limited on purpose to increase profits.  This is why phones are broken more often - computers are delivered not-locked-down, so your average computer will work on Cox and Comcast and Bell and whatever else, whereas a computer locked down like phones would only ever be able to connect to Comcast without rewriting firmware - and potentially bricking the computer - to unblock that artificial limitation.  </p>
<p>It happens &quot;more easily&quot; on phones because it happens a lot more often on phones.  Artificial limitations have made this a necessity, and other forms of lockdowns make it worthwhile as well.  Your average Dell or HP or Apple computer will probably come with bloatware applications you don't use or want, but you can remove them.  Your average phone does too, but often you can't remove those apps without modifying - and potentially bricking - the device.  If you don't like the operating system on your computer, it's trivially easy to replace it, and not specifically blocked.    Lots of people reload their OS with something that was never sent from the factory, and in fact the OS of both iOS and Android are based on these commonly use non-factory operating systems preferred by many.  Doing this on a phone risks bricking, because of artificial lockdowns placed there intentionally.</p>
<p>Lockdowns are artificial limits to what you can do with your own property.  Bricking is a side effect of removing those lockdowns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not all unofficial apps will work without root access, which usually requires installing custom firmware, which risks bricking the device. If you want an application that lets you change the MAC address of your android phone, you need root access, say if you are trying to run your own Nintendo zone for streetpassing on a 3ds. It is also required to install anything unoffici on an iphone. </p></div>		</li>

<p>How long are we talking? Resetting the BIOS has been a thing for like 10+ years. In recent years (5?), we have UEFI, which has different mechanisms in place, but we're talking about BIOS, not UEFI. Also, if there are no jumpers, you could also reset it by popping out the battery, which fixes it well enough that you can at least try to reflash.</p>
<p>I also try to buy Gigabyte boards since they've had a backup BIOS for quite a while now. I've never had to use it, but I like knowing that I've got a backup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say this but since he said break I'm assuming he's talking about corrupting or installing the wrong thing.  In that case 95% of the time the jumper won't help.  The jumper just resets the memory holding the BIOS settings, few boards actually have backups.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are a lot of decent reasons to use nonmanufacturer bios, well at least there used to be. I got an old dell vostro lga 775 system running a xenon LGA 771 CPU, latest Mac OS, and Sata mode instead of IDE (jut mode, always been physically Sata)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bios mod only has to deal with the fact that It was a Dell (vostro 200, I found it in a dumpster at my office building). The dell bios only allowed the system to boot in IDE mode. The bios hack added raid and sata support which are compatible with hackintosh. You won't need this if your mobo already supports everything needed, which most nonoem will. </p>
<p>If you already have Windows on the system the easiest way is to dual boot MacOS is to pull your windows drive, install sierra using clover (using legacy bios mode not ufi) onto a new drive (i used spare 840 evo 120gb, they are cheap now), then when it's up and running you can plug the old windows drive in and choose which one to boot from the new clover drive. Just google &quot;install sierra clover&quot; really. </p>
<p>If your system is capable of support a CPU with over 60w you can also add a quad core lga 771 xenon chip which can be had super cheap on eBay if you do the lga 771 pin hack. Or skip that, get a little more expensive lga775 core 2 quad. I ran the system at first with a e8500 and 4gb ram and it handled Sierra like a dream. I put together a full list of lga771/775 cpu's and their eBay prices as of a couple months ago if you want it. </p></div>		</li>
