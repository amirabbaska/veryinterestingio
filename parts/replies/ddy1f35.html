			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not specific to him, it's a VERY common thing. </p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons is HGH production while asleep and when it occurs.</p>
<p>Your body takes about 3 weeks of consistent sleep to maximize HGH production (one night a week, sometimes two, of an abnormal sleep time won't destabilize this much)</p>
<p>This HGH production is going to occur every point in the day, at the same time. However, it peaks when produced during a certain sleep stage (I believe it's the 4th stage). So if my circadian rhythm has me releasing HGH at 4am every night, but I'm not even asleep at 4am, I miss out on 100% of that HGH for the day. </p>
<p>The sleep researcher also said this naturally occurring HGH is &quot;the fountain of youth&quot; and was tied to far more than energy, but immune system and the likes. </p>
<p>It's why people working rotating shifts have significantly shorter life spans than people working consistent shifts (even if those shifts are at odd hours). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, what I suggested isn't entirely different from what you suggested, except as far as how common it is. In my experience and others I've spoken to about it, I have not seen much of an issue with time of sleep (other than, if you can't fall asleep because of it). But completing sleep cycles and waking up at the right point in them would have a bigger effect (so that if a cycle is 4 hours as it often is, sleeping 8 hours regardless of when, works great, but 7 or 9 not as good...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going off of a lecture I attended from a doc at UNMC who studies sleep for a living, so it's not really my info or suggestion, just what I learned. </p>
<p>And what you're is still incorrect unless I'm misinterpreting it.. So even if I get 7-9 hours of sleep every day, if I'm not doing it the exact same time every day it'll be extremely harmful. </p>
<p>The doctor actually went so far as to say in the Q&amp;A that going to bed at the same time every night and getting 5 hours of sleep is healthier than getting 7-9 at different times each week. This was because of that HGH release occurring at the same time every day for people.</p></div>		</li>
