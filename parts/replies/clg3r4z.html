<p>It's great when you can sell a less expensive product for more money.  But when you lose whatever product quality you had, eventually a competitor with a superior product will take your market share.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I went to buy a mattress around 6 months ago the guy at the original mattress factory was spot on, gave me the entire history of the mattress world.  </p>
<p>I had sat on some mattresses both cheap and expensive at a couple other stores and just listening to him talk I was blown away.  He was actually a matteess salesman.  Left that day with a delivery date.  Consumer reports has their mattress as some of the best value spring mattresses.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the exact same experience at The Original Mattress Factory. I asked him what the company was and he gave me a very brief and accurate description of the industry and its history. The guy was the least salesy salesman I have ever experienced. I needed three mattresses. I knew what I wanted in a bed. He showed me a couple of options. I rested on a couple of mattresses. I bought them. The actual sales part of the interaction was five minutes of paperwork to arrange delivery etc. All in all a very pleasant experience since I generally hate shopping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I no longer trust Consumer Reports. They gave a Hoover WindTunnel vacuum their highest rating.</p>
<p>The belt falls off every 3 weeks, and it's a motherfucker to replace.</p>
<p>There's a YouTube video by a vacuum repair guy who explains how to repair the Hoover yourself-he says it's the machine he sees most often in his shop.</p>
<p>The head of Consumer Reports clearly will take a blow-job in exchange for a high rating.</p></div>		</li>
