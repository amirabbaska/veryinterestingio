			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly what I'm getting at. Think about it this way:</p>
<p>If you sit in a pool with a hoolahoop round you and you spin it, if we ignore the adhesive property of water, so see no waves. If instead i give you a single float and you spin it about yourself in the water: waves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This whole line of questioning really does belong on /r/askphilosophy, honestly.</p>
<p>Moral systems are human philosophical constructs.  Further discussion would have to first identify one true objective moral viewpoint before deciding how that moral system would classify such an action.</p>
<p>Note that I am using moral in the philosophical sense.  If you are using it in any form of religious sense, there are even deeper disagreements regarding the measurement of moral vs. immoral than the philosophical one.</p>
<p>However, in the short term, given the high value sentient life places on its own existence,the consensus view will probably agree that yes, this is immoral.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the person who presses the big reg button... their moral system may actively consider it a moral act.  Without a confirmed objective &quot;true morality&quot;, whether that is in fact the case remains an open question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, what you're saying is that if the shape of system doesn't have continuous rotational symmetry about the axis of rotation, then it will emit gravitational waves. </p>
<p>As examples: a spherical body rotating about an axis going through its center won't emit, a ring rotating about its natural axis won't emit, an ellipsoid rotating about a non-symmetric axis will emit, and any two discrete bodies orbiting each other will emit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or mathematically, gravitational radiation must be at least of quadrupole character. So in order for a system to emit gravitational radiation, it must have a time-dependent mass quadrupole moment (technically it must have a nonzero third time derivative).</p></div>		</li>
