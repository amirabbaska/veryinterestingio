<p>That is the balanced equation for photosynthesis. Water and CO2 together with energy from the sun, re-arrange to make glucose with oxygen as a by product. This is biomass (plant matter), with the C in the glucose molecule acting the &quot;carbon sink&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As our emissions don't increase exponentially I believe your calculation is wrong - shouldn't we just have to plant 1.5% of <em>todays</em> tree mass annually instead of a fixed 1.5% of each years mass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the original calculation is definitely wrong. It would be 1.5% of the 2016 forest size with minimal growth over time not 1.5% of the present forest each year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is no need for exponential growth.  We simply would have to keep up with increases in carbon emissions, which are leveling off.  </p>
<p>Further, the natural Carbon Cycle absorbs 60% of human carbon emissions.  So if OP's 9.38Gt is correct, then we need only absorb 3.75Gt per year to make up for our emissions.  </p>
<p>That means we need only increase forest biomass 0.5% per year over current mass.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Citation? Every single source I know of shows annual global carbon emissions still growing massively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately we are decreasing biomass in the rainforest rather rapidly, unless we get into the reforestation of deserts it'll look rather bleak. Algae in the oceans isn't a stellar solution either, they would tend to converge to certain spots in the oceans due to currents, and pretty much kill all oxygen reliant life there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tacking onto your Algae idea, there is a fern Azolla that had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azolla_event" target="_blank">huge bloom event in the arctic ~50m years ago</a>. It's speculated that it was a major contributor to our planet's transition from Greenhouse Earth to our current Icebox Earth. When the Azolla died, it sank to the bottom of the arctic taking all that carbon with it.</p></div>		</li>
