			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true. Since the Earth and Sun are both moving, most people would assume that the force of attraction from the Earth to the Sun would point at where the Sun was 8 minutes ago- but this is not the case. The line of attraction points to where the Sun is now- even though changes in the gravitational field take 8 minutes to reach us. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Woah...I had never considered this or heard it discussed. That is awesome. Is there some theoretical explanation for how this works? Since no info is being passed, how does the Earth &quot;know&quot; where to point for the next 8 minutes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It only works in a very specific case- when both bodies are moving only under the influence of a gravitational field. That is, if the Sun had a booster rocket, and moved itself somehow, the line of attraction would not longer point directly at the Sun. We know why it happens, and it is simply a quirk of the fact that the relativistic effects (with length contraction/time dilation/etc) will always change the angle of the force of attraction just enough so that it is always pointing right where the Sun is now, instead of where it was. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that the Sun communicated to the Earth how it's going to move.  So long as the Sun sticks to the plan then the Earth will know where the Sun is, as opposed to where it was 8 minutes ago.</p>
<p>If the Sun changes its plan, for example something collides with the Sun, then the Earth will not know about it for 8 minutes.  But so long as the only influence upon the motion of the Sun and the Earth is that due to gravity, then both bodies will always know where the center of mass is one another in 'real time' so to speak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this may not be relevant to the case where the sun is accelerating (orbiting around galaxy for instance)</p>
<p>but let's assume the sun is stationary, and the earth is orbiting it.  Every thing is fine, force towards sun, elliptical orbit, etc.</p>
<p>Now, get in a space ship and fly by the sun/earth at a high speed.  Now, in the frame of reference of the ship the sun is moving, and the earth is orbiting around it in a kinda slalom pattern (to some extent, or sliding cirlces, however you want to call it).  </p>
<p>However, nothing has changed really, you are just viewing it from another reference frame.  So the even though you measure the sun as moving, and the earth as moving translationally with the sun as well as orbiting,  it is still a perfect orbit.  The sun 'moves' but the earth somehow is pulled to where the sun 'will be'.</p>
<p>(this does not apply to accelerated frames)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if I understand correctly, the gravitational field of the sun through time cannot be considered static, since the sun is always accelerating. So, while we do not gravitate toward the location that the sun <em>was</em> 8 minutes ago, we also do not gravitate toward the location that the sun <em>is</em> currently. Rather, we gravitate toward the location that the sun <em>would currently be</em> if it hadn't accelerated in the past 8 minutes. This effect is probably minute though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do gravitate towards where the Sun is now. It doesn't make sense to state that we gravitate towards where the Sun has moved from in the last 8 minutes if we don't specify in relation to what the Sun moves.  It wouldn't work the way you described it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the behavior you describe involve propagation faster than light? The article you linked seems to be very specific that <em>only</em> artifacts caused by changes in reference frame are instantaneous, since they do not require information propagation. Acceleration is inherently <em>not</em> an artifact of reference frame changes, since reference frames <em>must be non-accelerating</em>. Wouldn't acceleration cause an actual change in the field, which would then need to propagate before taking effect?</p>
<p>To clarify, I <em>do not</em> believe that the earth accelerates toward the location that the sun was 8 minutes ago, as your comment seems to imply. I believe that the earth accelerates toward the location that the sun would currently be if the sun had not <em>accelerated</em> for 8 minutes and instead remained in its inertial reference frame. This location would be approximately equal to the actual position of the sun, but not exactly equal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I see it, the gravitational field of the sun also carries with it the information of the sun's velocity. So conservation of information is still obeyed, the earth just gets to move towards the &quot;real&quot; position of where the sun should be, based on the gravitational field the earth is experiencing. Any change to the sun's velocity will still take 8 minutes to reach us (which is why this is only useful in the case of static fields).</p></div>		</li>
