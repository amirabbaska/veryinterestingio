<p>Very common experiment. They use fluorescent particles/dye and UV lights to see the flow. Put a sphere (close enough) into laminar flow (laminar = straight line) and you get turbulence.</p>
<p>Same thing as when you light a cigarette or incense in still air, the smoke rises in a straight line and then becomes turbulent and dissipates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/cGBIbi0.webm" target="_blank">You might also find this clip of laminar flow in corn syrup interesting</a></p>
<p>Essentially, they don't mix the corn syrup fast enough for the dye to get turbulently mixed into the solution, so when they apply the exact opposite force (spinning the crank the other way), the dye reverts to its original position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yield is one thing, specifically the energy released by the explosion, destructive damage is a totally different and more complicated thing.  So you have a bomb with some yield in the kT range, how do you best use the thing?  The radius of the shock wave will actually be greater if detonated in the air than if it was detonated on the ground.  By studying how the shock wave propagates you can develop methods to get the most &quot;bang for your buck&quot; as the saying goes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the pressure wave hits the ground and reflects you get a Mach front overpressure.  Its this followed by the vacuum that does most of the damage.</p>
<p>An air detonation will cover a larger radius and you get much less fallout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine writing clear text on a clear background.  You wouldn't be able to see the text, right?  In this case, the smoke from those rockets becomes a sort of &quot;ink&quot; that allows them to see where the air moves as a result of the explosion.  So while the transparent air would move in the same way with or without the smoke, the smoke allows us to see the movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That, sir, is super neat. Same general concept as the smoke used in wind tunnels, right? Do you know of any other applications like this? Or even better pictures of a similar application with a bit of explanation on what's going on? My initial brief googling didn't turn up much.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Kind of -- smoke used in wind tunnels for flow visualization <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBBZF_3DLCU" target="_blank">like this video</a> is released upstream from what you want to study, with the smoke following the path of the flow (parallel) so you can see the streamlines. In the case of the sounding rocket you have a stationary tracer that is deformed orthogonal to the motion of the fluid flow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you know of any other applications like this? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could say it's similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqexY7hObik" target="_blank">this wind tunnel experiment</a> in a stationary vs moving reference frame. In this vid they're creating a vertical tracer line orthogonal to the flow direction and the lines deform in the same manner as the sounding rocket paths do in the explosion. In this case I believe the vertical tracers are usually made by brief pulses of a wire in water to create hydrogen gas bubbles that work as passively advected tracer particles.</p>
<p>Most experimental flow visualizations utilize some form of tracer particles, it's just a matter of how you interpret them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=interferogram&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=950&amp;bih=948&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJ-L7d56nKAhUBx2MKHUERAWwQ_AUIBigB#tbm=isch&amp;q=interferogram+supersonic" target="_blank">&quot;Interferograms&quot; <em>superficially</em> look similar to the rockets, but they're really based on totally different phenomena.</a> In this case, wave patterns are projected and deformed by the gradients in density, so it's useful for supersonic imaging where you have large density changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The second video looks like it is an excerpt from several video on fluid dynamics from the 60s.</p>
<p>The fluid they are using is water, if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>The cool part about it is how they produced the tracer: a thin wire is places top to bottom some distance in front of the wing and current is ran through. Hydrolysis creates tiny gas bubbles, which make it appear white. </p>
