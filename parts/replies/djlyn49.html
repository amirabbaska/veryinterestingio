<p>There is debate over whether HDL is actually protective. This was highlighted in the AHAs statement on coconut oil </p></div>		</li>

<p>The AHA has been continually behind science by a decade or two for a long time. I'd take at least as much of a skeptical look at their recommendations as I would anyone else's; there is a pretty good consensus across all contemporary medical literature, to my knowledge, that HDL correlates positively on the important outcomes. The bigger area of contention right now appears to be around LDL distinction, as lumping everything together with VLDL appears to be about as diagnostically useful as saying lauric and palmitic acid are the same just because they're both &quot;saturated fat.&quot; </p></div>		</li>
