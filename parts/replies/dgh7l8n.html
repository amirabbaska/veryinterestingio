<p>In space, you have effectively infinite room, you have 24 hr/day sunshine, and you have increased w/m2.</p>
<p>The goal would be 1000 sq/km of ultra light weight &amp; cheap of solar panel anchored at a lagrange point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And sending that power to where on Earth? If you are at a lagrange point then your beam would be cruising along the surface at roughly 17000 mph. Also that high in orbit you run into all kinds of debris. The panels would be shredded in a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are plenty of issues with space-based solar power but storage is not one of them. In a 1000 km orbit you can have satellites with direct lines of sight to both the sun and any location on Earth's night side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To build on this, there are many different ways that large scale storage can be managed here on the surface - superheated water, molten salt, or good old-fashioned chemical batteries.  But these are <em>easy</em> on Earth.  I mean, how hard is it to lug a bunch of tubes to a random spot in the desert and then fill 'em with water?</p>
<p>But to do this in space?  Nope.  Water and salt are both VERY heavy, and so are chemical batteries on account of all the metal they need to manage their reactions.  So an orbital solar farm would need a way to move storage up into the inky blackness beyond the atmosphere and that is expensive as all get-out.</p>
<p>Tack on the fact that you'd then need to find a way to move electricity down - I guess a geostationary anchor and tether with a wire?  I mean, that'd work, but electricity does not transmit well without losing juice.  Geostationary orbits are around 22,000 miles,  and at that point the efficiency of transmission would be very low.  Or you could constantly lift and drop batteries, but again - that's expensive.  I guess you could do a completely balanced battery escalator and only need enough juice to make two batteries move, but then you have to use the electricity in those batteries somewhere, which would involve moving them around....all in all, it's a very inefficient process.</p>
<p>It's a good question, but the physics and reality of electricity transmission stand in the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean I agree it's not super feasible, but you'd do the transmission to earth before you did the storage. There's no advantage to doing the energy storage in space and then transmitting afterwards. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Transmission over 22,000 miles would have a loss rate somewhere around 75% or higher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could actually use a huge pressure cooker as both part of the transmission system and a storage system.  Focus a microwave laser from the satellite on the pressure cooker and you can drive turbines off the pressure for hours afterward.</p>
<p>This would only be effective if we found a damn good way to cool the solar cells and protect them from UV.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You don't have to guess. One is being developed now, feel free to peer review.</p>
<p>Otherwise at least some investors and JAXA think it's a good idea.</p></div>		</li>
