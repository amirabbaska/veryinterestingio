<p>Ha-Satan, which means 'The Adversary.' Think of him as a celestial District Attorney that lays out your sins when you die and stand before God and are judged. He also has a spot in Heaven and converses with God on a regular basis.</p>

<p>I think the story of Job also had him testing mortals.  Something about him betting with god that a devout rich man with big family was only devout because he was rich with a big family.  So god killed his cattle, killed his sons, afflicted him with boils.  By the end, even the mans wife was saying &quot;Why not curse god?&quot;  And still the man did not.  In compensation for his pains and faith, God gave him new sons, new cattle, healed his boils, etc.</p></div>		</li>
