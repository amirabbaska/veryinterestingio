			<div class="markdown"><p>Another reason companies sell different things of the same kind:
Shelf usage.
It's important to occupy much space in the shelf.
For one you see more of this brand and are more likely to buy it and you give less space to your competition.</p>
<p>If there are 100 Oral B brushes in the shelf and only 50 Crest one.. It's more likely that you buy a Oral B one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You ever try switching toothpastes it's weird as fuck. Like use one toothpaste your whole life then you go on a trip and use one of those small travel ones and it tastes all wrong and shit. I'm like the least picky person when it comes to tastes but toothpaste man. I don't think it's possible for me to switch at this point in my life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>dominating the planogram is probably the single biggest part of it. sales for firm and medium are probably &lt; 10% of sales. also those goals probably trickle up and down. sales guys demanding more skus to milk every last cent of revenue, directors wanting to own the entire shelf, the store wanting more variety, and a supply chain guy crying over the complete waste of money and energy spent getting all these stupid SKUs on shelves.</p></div>		</li>
