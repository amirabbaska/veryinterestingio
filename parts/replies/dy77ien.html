<p>Of course thinking about it, the same plant that makes enriched uranium for power is going to be the same as an enrichment plant for weapons-grade material; the only thing coming out of the power plant is going to be depleted uranium.</p>
<p>Can you get depleted plutonium? </p></div>		</li>

<p>It does - you get Plutonium out of breeder reactors.</p>
<p>The reason that all our fission reactors are built around a Uranium-Plutonium cycle is that the research that led to them was entirely funded by the military to produce bomb-making material.</p>
<p>In the first instance we'd learnt to refine Uranium for atomic bombs, and it turned out you could use a less refined material (not quite weapons grade) in breeder reactors to make Plutonium, and you'd get a bunch of heat out of it.</p>
<p>Using the waste heat to make electric was just a happy side-benefit.</p>
<p>The world's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sellafield#Calder_Hall_nuclear_power_station" target="_blank">first commercial power station</a> was quite openly dual-purpose.</p>
<p>If the early research had actually been for peaceful power purposes we'd be rocking Thorium plants, and nuclear proliferation would be a non-issue. You could give Iran Thorium fuel knowing that there was no way it could be used for a weapons programme (and giving them no excuse to have centrifuge labs which could make fuel-grade, but also weapon grade material).</p></div>		</li>

Because they are enriched to a much higher percentage these materials rack up decay chain and daughter isotopes at a relatively high rate. I've read that the majority of our waste still comes from weapons reprocessing, though I cannot locate that source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, yes</p>
<p>In practice, it'd take a lot more precision and engineering than simply putting it in a box.  The timing and spacing(distance) of the explosives needs to be precise in order to compress the plutonium properly to instigate fission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically....you don't need any explosives to initiate fission. Most forms of Plutonium are quite capable of spontaneous fission. PU^240 for instance is unsuitable for use in weapons precisely because it likes to spontaneously undergo fission. Other forms (PU^238) generate significant amounts of decay heat and require cooling.  </p>
<p>Most PU weapons involve a sub-critical mass, surrounded by a tamper (which acts as neutron reflector). The explosives compress the material, and the neutrons initiate the reaction. Without the neutron reflector, it would just be a dirty bomb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres a lot of ways to make nuclear explosions and using another explosion (e.g. TNT) is one of them. This works by compressing the nuclear fuel and making them reach a critical point, which is a point where nuclear reactions increase rather than decrease.</p>
<p>Sometimes when nuclear materials are too spread out e.g. when mined straight out of the ground, the material is too spread out. The reaction works because the &quot;product&quot; of one reaction makes more reactions happen, but when too spread out these &quot;product&quot; can escape without getting to do its job and make even more reactions.</p>
<p>So one way of making the reaction make even more reactions and then a lot more reactions and so on (nuclear explosion), some methods to trigger a nuclear bomb relies on explosives around the nuclear material to create an implosion which compress the metal just enough to make is dense. Being dense/compressed, the requirements for the amount of the material to spontaneously explode by itself is lower, hence if a lump of mass needs to be 10kg to explode on its own and then you lump 9kg of the stuff together, its not too dangerous to handle but there are ways to make it so that you dont really need 10kg to explode</p>
<p>Some methods rely on reflecting the &quot;products&quot; of the reaction back into the nuclear fuel rather than let them fly out and leave. Here's a sad story about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core" target="_blank">[Demon Core]</a>.</p>
<p>Another method is just to pile a lot of nuclear stuff together. Old bombs literally have two chunks of nuclear fuel that wont explode by themselves and then they slam two pieces of the stuff together to make it one chunk to reach the requirements for it to explode</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, nukes need VERY precise explosions, timed within fractions of seconds, to actually go off in a nuclear fashion. Thus, damaging any of the explosives would just make a very big dirty bomb, over a nuclear device. That's how anti-nuke defenses work, preventing it from going off, or failing that, making it detonate in such a way that nuclear reactions aren't possible. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There was enough margin of error in an electrical signal travelling in basically around 1 meter of wiring that they had to be even more precise.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be impossible to detonate an ICBM warhead on the ground.  The PAL (Permissive Action Link) system includes something called Parameter recognition. The weapon basically won't detonate unless it experiences the outside environment that it expects. </p>
<p>Inside the weapon's safety sensors like the accelerometer in your phone are constantly active when power is applied. On an ICBM, a the  warhead would first be exposed to a strong acceleration, and then a period of free fall and perhaps more gradual buildup of G forces and pressure as the atmospheric drag acted on it. </p>
<p>Unless the warhead experiences all of these expected forces in the proper order it will fail safe and permanently break itself if the detonation circuits are active out of sequence.</p>
<p>Also if you ever need to break a nuke on purpose just enter the wrong code over and over. After so many times the device will intentionally break itself in such a way that isn't easy to repair.</p></div>		</li>
