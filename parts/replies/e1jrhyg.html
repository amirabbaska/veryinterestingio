			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are sitting still and the light source is moving toward you, it's going to be &quot;blue shifted&quot;</p>
<p>Basically, visible light has a wavelength of 400-700nm.</p>
<p>Assume the lines on the diagram at the wavetops.</p>
<p>If the source of the light in the picture is emitting 700nm light and moves 300nm toward you in the time between wave tops (the lines on the picture) what you would see at the red dot is light with 400nm between wavetops.</p>
<p>(someone emitting red light and travelling toward you at just under half the speed of light will be seen by you are emitting blue light)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does time dilation factor into this?</p>
<p>Consider the waves of light are tied to a clock tick such that each wavelength is determined by the length of time between two ticks. The &quot;stationary&quot; observer would see the moving clock tick slower than his own, increasing the wavelength.</p>
<p>In your example, length contraction shortens the wavelength by 300nm, but wouldn't time dilation lengthen the wavelength as well? How closely tied are time dilation and length contraction? For instance, if distance is contracted by 50%, is time dilated by 50% as well, cancelling out the effect?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on your speed/direction (velocity) relative to the other observer. Let's simplify a little bit.</p>
<p>Say you had measured your position in space, and found it to be relatively stable based on visible bodies (not every other star you can see is moving left, right, up, down, towards you, or away), we can say that you believe your planets/ships movement to be a relative zero for the sake of this discussion. You think you're not moving through space.</p>
<p>You would observe a ship coming towards you at a high percentage of the speed of light, flashing a blue light at you rapidly.</p>
<p>Now let's change your speed (and thus your reference). Let's say now you're traveling in the same direction at the same speed (zero relative velocity) as the ship in question. You would now see a stationary ship hung in space with a white light flashing steadily.</p>
<p>Now, the fun one, if, from the first situation, we find that the ship is traveling 75% the speed of light, and we assume that that speed stays constant through all of these experiments (based on measurements from something else), let's assume that now, your reference point is traveling towards the ship, also at 75% the speed of light based on measurements taken referencing an outside point which has identical relative velocity to both you and the ship. </p>
<p>If you were traveling towards each other like that, you would see a ship traveling towards you at 0.96% the speed of light, and the pulsing light would be so blue-shifted (the frequency would be increased so much) that it would be well outside of the visible spectrum.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to understand this in a way you can relate to, think about somebody playing loud music from a car, or a car with a siren. And then imagine three different observers. One in the car, and one each half a block in front of and half a block behind the car.</p>
<p>The pitch of the sound will remain constant for the person in the car while the person in front of the car will hear the pitch rising and the person in the wake of the car will hear the pitch falling.</p>
<p>Who is right? Who is wrong? Well, it's all relative. Same thing with light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could choose a frame of reference where you're the center and instead of walking on a street, you're pushing the street under you with your feet. Of course, some observations would make little sense, but it would agree with certain other observations.</p></div>		</li>
