			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply. So maybe the measuring device is rising? </p>
<p>If the measurements were accurate would it be possible to have long-term mean sea level decrease 50cm in one area of the planet and a 50cm increase in another? Or is that just impossible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Stika, Alaska the measuring device is rising because the land is rising.</p>
<p>Over enough time, say several centuries, there could potentially be a 50cm increase in altitude in one location and a 50cm decrease in another, but that would be quite dramatic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A full cm (10<del>0</del>mm) isn't likely to happen unless you're measuring time in decades.</p>
<p>You could show a 2mm decrease in Alaska vs a 2mm increase in Mumbai, in the same year.</p>
<p>Edit typo claiming cm=100, fail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you saying we can't keep satellites at an even distance to measure perfectly? Even if they don't stay in perfect orbit, I would think we could calculate the offsets. Or is it just because the earth isn't perfectly round?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the Earth is not perfectly round. But, also we have difficulty in measuring the tiny variations that this requires.</p>
<p>Jus think of measuring sea level in the middle of the ocean. Waves, barometric pressure, and temperature can all have an effect larger than the long term changes.</p>
<p>I always like to point to <a href="http://academics.eckerd.edu/instructor/hastindw/MS1410-001_FA08/handouts/2008SLRSustain.pdf" target="_blank">the example of Venice</a> (page 12), as a place where people have been very focussed on sea levels.</p></div>		</li>

<p>According to the above paper (Page 9.) they can get a measurement accurate to 1mm from the centre of the earth when they have 5 years worth of continuous GPS measurements (IIRC - once per 30 seconds...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth is not only not perfectly round, but its gravity varies from place to place independent of your orbit's height. America's Rust Belt, for example, has huge iron ore deposits near the surface. They're denser than rock, so the surface gravity's a tiny bit higher there.</p>
<p>Likewise, rock is denser than water, so the gravity over a continent is normally higher than over the ocean. These are tiny, tiny differences, but accumulate with every orbit, so are more than enough to screw up the kind of measurements you're talking about.</p>
<p>So, correct, we can't keep satellites at an even distance, except by constantly burning thruster fuel to make tiny corrections. And of course, that greatly limits the lifetime of the satellite since there's currently no way to refuel it. GPS satellites have to make frequent corrections, and running out of fuel is generally why they need to be replaced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And sea level isn't level. Different parts of the planet have sea levels varying as much as +/- 20 cm from the average.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. The <a href="http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/globalsl.jpg" target="_blank">relative sea level height map</a> at the top of that article shows a +20cm area right next to a -20cm area (both south of madagascar). Still confused, but not as much as when I posted this question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, everything is moving, even the continents aren't stationary. This makes it very challenging to measure something that is down in the mm/year rate. Not impossible, but difficult.</p></div>		</li>
