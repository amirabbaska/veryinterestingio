			<div class="markdown"><p>So... does this mean that if you have a very, very long pole, and two perfectly synchronized timers, you can measure the length of the pole just by pushing one end and measuring how long it takes the other end to move?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a very oversimplified level this is the exact principle behind all forms of radionavigation (radar, GPS, etc.), except instead of dealing with mechanical waves travelling through a pole you are dealing with electromagnetic waves which travel at the speed of light. This is why accurate timing is so important to the field of navigation.</p>
<p>Technically what you described is a form of sonar ranging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would you care for how long it moved? It should only be necessary to measure the time which both ends started to move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also measure lengths of transmission lines in a similar fashion, only the propagation speed is a fraction of the speed of light rather than sound. By leaving the end of the line unterminated, and launching an electromagnetic pulse from the other end, you can measure the time it takes for the pulse to bounce off the unterminated side and return. Knowing the propagation constant of the transmission line, you can then calculate length using simple s = v*t, where t is half the time you measured.</p>
<p>So in theory, you wouldn't actually need two perfectly synchronised timers. One will suffice. Just embed one end of the pole in a concrete wall, and hit the other end with a hammer. Time how long it takes for the impulse to bounce off the wall and return to you. Halve the time and knowing the 'propagation constant' of the pole, use it to calculate the distance as above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The forces will travel from both ends towards the middle of the pole. Both forces will cancel each other out there. Though the material might crack if enough force is applied.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, an important note, If you applied a force that exceeded the inertia of the material, you would see a shock wave, not a sound wave travel through the material, which is faster than the speed of sound.  Picture someone pushing the end versus igniting an explosive.</p></div>		</li>
