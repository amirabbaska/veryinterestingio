			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the real answer OP is looking for. In the US midwest especially the jet stream flip flops all over the place in winter. It's why we had a high of 80 degrees yesterday and in two days it's supposed to be below freezing.</p>
<p>When the wind is blowing up from the south we have winters almost as mild as California. When the wind is blowing down from the north we have winters almost as bitter as Michigan. </p></div>		</li>
