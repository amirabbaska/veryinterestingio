<p>For what it's worth, I agree with you.  The biggest issue here is political corruption.  Comcast is wildly influential in Washington, meaning that the DOJ most likely won't even <em>attempt</em> to challenge the merger.  They'll probably let it sail through with only minimal concessions by Comcast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your &quot;*&quot; is correct.  Look at any issue at all and you will find that the vote goes to the special interest and not to the people.  Twain said the definition of an honest politician is one who, when bought, stays bought.  That is more true today than ever.  Politicians are concerned only with what the benefit is to them and the only time they give any care to the issues of the citizenry is when they are campaigning and they forget about us again as soon as the ballot is cast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SOOOOOOOO many things wrong could be solved by not allowing corporations to be &quot;people&quot; and limit what they can give to politicians. If Comcast could only give these dicks in Washington a few thousand dollars legally just like you or me then I bet the politicians wouldn't care as much about them.</p>
<p>I still am in shock that this is not the case.</p></div>		</li>
