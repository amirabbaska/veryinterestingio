			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also important to know difference between end focal length on crop sensor and full frame. 135mm on full frame feels like 84mm on APS-C. As most people who don't know how it works take cropped photos due to their cheaper hardware it gets more confusing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone curious, everything up to the EOS 6D is a crop frame in the Canon world, and to get the actual focal length on crop frame cameras, you have to multiply the focal length of your lens by 1.6 (for Canon) or 1.5 (for Nikon). </p>
<p>For example, a 50mm lens on an 80D acts sort of like an 80mm would on, say, a 5D.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's my impression as well! I prefer the 85mm look (mostly using the fuji 56/1,2 for portraits), and usually will only go farther if I need to further blur the background for whatever reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC it’s not actually the focal length that does this, but the distance from the subject. I <em>think</em> that if you had a 20mm lens 50ft away from a subject and an 85mm lens 50ft away from the subject, and you cropped them to be the same, they would look the same. So in practicality it is the focal length, but I think it’s more nuanced than that. I could be wrong though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you are correct, the distance to the subject affects the outcome. But if you have a really short focal length and are really close to the subject, as a snap photo would probably be, you'd start to notice the distortions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is pretty cool. I’m a broadcasting student so I work a lot with cameras. I can tell you that first off the lense is only one of the factors distance and lighting also make a pretty dramatic difference. Also the skill of whoever is taking the picture.</p>
<p>Edit also that thing with reversed images and suck in the mirror.</p></div>		</li>
