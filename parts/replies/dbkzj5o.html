<p>&quot;Fleeson and Gallagher (2009) found that extraverts regularly behave in an introverted way, and introverts regularly behave in an extraverted way. Indeed, there was more within-person variability than between-person variability in extraverted behaviours. The key feature that distinguishes extraverts and introverts was that extraverts tend to act moderately extraverted about 5-10% more often than introverts. From this perspective, extraverts and introverts are not &quot;fundamentally different&quot;. Rather, an &quot;extravert&quot; is just someone who acts more extraverted more often, suggesting that extraversion is more about what one &quot;does&quot; than what one &quot;has&quot;.</p>
<p>Humans are complex and unique, and because introversion-extraversion varies along a continuum, individuals may have a mixture of both orientations. A person who acts introverted in one situation may act extraverted in another, and people can learn to act in &quot;counterdispositional&quot; ways in certain situations&quot;</p></div>		</li>
