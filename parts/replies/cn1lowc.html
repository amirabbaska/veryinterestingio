You complain about them being lazy, while not botherng to gather the facts of the arguments YOURSELF before posting.<br><br>You deserve to be down voted into oblivion, you just proved you are nothing more than a lazy piece of shit, calling the kettle black....</p>		</li>

			<p>Sheesh! He gave a reasonable answer.  All you did was rip him a new one.  I hope you don't speak to all others who have a different opinion the same way or you'll have a loooong road ahead.</p>		</li>

			<p>It was actually a pedagogical tool. Telling people stuff doesn't work. But if they have to find the evidence on their own, I'm hoping they'll think a little deeper about the assumptions in the original post.<br><br>It's not hard...<br><br><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/homeownership-is-historically-weakdont-blame-millennials/382010/" target="_blank">http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/homeownership-is-historically-weakdont-blame-millennials/382010/</a><br><br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/sunday-review/the-end-of-car-culture.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/sunday-review/the-end-of-car-culture.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0</a><br><br>Are millennials really worse off? Or is the OP using unrelated (?) demographic trends to support the not-necessarily-true assertion that millennials have it 'worse off'? Like I said: If we use cell phone ownership or internet connectivity as an index of living standard, then millennials are better than others. </p>		</li>
