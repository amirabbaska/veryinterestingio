			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be more %-based than number of people based, as each country has different tools so +/- 10,000 would not be appropriate when comparing United States population to Spain's population. </p>
<p>As mentioned above, also depends on the quality of that country's data. Many developed nations run Census counts to try and count everyone in the country at one time. That data will have variance but will be subject to less variance than a country without a Census where proxy measures are used. </p></div>		</li>
