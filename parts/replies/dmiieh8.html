			<div class="markdown"><p>100-120 times a minute, push about 1/3 of the depth of the person's chest. Make sure you allow for full recoil. It's not easy like it looks on tv. You literally have to put a lot of your weight on the person's chest. If you are the first one starting cpr on an older person, you will more than likely break their ribs. </p>
<p>Take a CPR class. You'll get plenty of opportunities to experience the technique. It's not exactly accurate (a plastic mannequin can't quite replicate the combination of bone, cartilage and tendons in the chest) You might never have to use it but you will help so much if you take it and know at least a little of what to do. </p></div>		</li>

<p>To clarify, many people teach a BLS rule of thumb: compress to the tempo of &quot;Stayin' Alive&quot; by The Bee Gees (approx. 100 bpm). It's got a fairly unmistakable tempo that most people, even those that don't have a very good natural sense of rhythm, can &quot;feel&quot;. Plus, I mean, that extra layer of irony is just too good to pass up.</p>
<p>EDIT: if The Bee Gees aren't your thing, these other songs also have a tempo between 100-120 bpm:
Sweet Home Alabama -- Lynyrd Skynyrd
MMMBOP -- Hanson
Hips Don't Lie -- Shakira
Another Brick In The Wall -- Pink Floyd
Float On -- Modest Mouse</p>
<p>...and many more! All for the low low price of $17.99! Now That's What I Call Compressions XXIV! Available on Compact Disk or Zune!</p></div>		</li>
