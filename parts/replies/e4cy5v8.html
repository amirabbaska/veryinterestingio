			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes, but if your primary concern is bee forage there are plenty of non native plants that work well. In arid coastal climates like ours in No Cal, echium are popular non natives (Canary Islands). They love apple trees and those arenâ€™t native either (Kazakhstan). But I do try to stick to natives as they are forage and refuge for far more than just bees. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>This is particularity acute in the Americas since the bee population is not natural and was genetically bottlenecked by being imported from the Old World.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Apis mellifera</em> the Western honey bee that we generally use for beekeeping is not native to the Western Hemisphere. It was imported early in the 1600s to Virginia (and likely a little earlier to Spanish Florida but the records if any are in Havana and no one has looked). There were limited importations of honey bees from that time until 1922 when the <a href="https://beeinformed.org/2012/01/13/tracheal-invaders/" target="_blank">Honey Bee Act</a> stopped all importation into the U.S.  The main strains were the black bee from England followed later by the Italian strain in the mid 1800s. After 1922 there have been almost no importations of genetic material into the U.S. We brought Russian material over in response to varroa, there is a darker strain the Carniolan from the Balkans and the most recent influx of African genes (1957) with Africanized honey bees spreading northwards from Brazil.  Even those importations were small. The total number of African queens that escaped in 1957 was 26 so all Africanized bees on both continents are descended from just those 26 producing a limited gene pool. The vast majority of bees in American are Italian mutts descended from the limited importations that happened in the 19th century. </p>
<p>How ever many actual importations came over its a smaller gene pool than the sum total of what exists in Europe, Africa and Western Asia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow mind blowing. I am fascinated by what was in America before Columbus. </p>
<p>Any chance you can briefly highlight the bee situation in America before the importation? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are 400 years not enough to gain some new genetic diversity? Especially with all those imported subspecies which add countless new combinations.</p>
<p>Side question: Are the Russian bees you mentioned immune/more resistant to the varrora? How? Sounds interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Apis mellifera</em> are also competing with bees native to the US (and other areas where Apis is non native). So rather than need more beekeepers, we should be calling for less habitat destruction and more focus on our native bees, unless all we care about is our crops and food and not our beautiful environment of native species...</p>
<p>Edit: It seems you may be aware of this already, but I didn't doubt you were.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That damage is probobly done. A. mellifera has been here for 400 years and already wiped out any native species it was going to.</p>
<p>There is also an old world/new world division in plants. A. mellifera doesn't do as well with many new world plants (like ones which require buzz pollination) and some they avoid in preference to old world ones. The same would be true for the native species. A Southern Blueberry Bee for example isn't going to be any good pollinating oranges because they focus only on blueberries and only do so for a few weeks while those bloom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well most Old World plants are indeed what they are: old world and not new world. They are also not native and compete with New world plants. Whether or not the New world plants are adapted to being accompanied with the old world species is also not the only issue if some Old world species not yet in the new world arrive, and they have the tools to spread quickly if Apis pollinate those. The caveat with this issue though is native generalist bees and insects pollinating these, but species diversity of insects in a particular ecosystem matters here.</p>
<p>As for if the damage has already been done, the claim would have to be based largely on speculation. Bees are different from higher animals in that we are far less sure if all populations are truly extinguished. I already know of insects whose habitats are destroyed but are still around. In addition, I wish there was a method to knowing how many years it would take for something to be completely integrated in the ecosystem or to wipe out all the species it could already.</p>
