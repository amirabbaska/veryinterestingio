Sure the police can photograph it and what not but assuming its owner is never found then what? I know they can't bury it or anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do you think they wouldn't be able to bury it?</p>
<p>If the police fine unidentified remains, whether whole or partial, they will be handed over to the forensic examiner of that area. They will try to gain as much information from those remains as possible. That can be DNA, finger prints, photographs, dental x-rays, general information about the body that can match medical history (were there any injuries, any sign of previously healed broken bones, any surgery) all depending on the state of the remains.</p>
<p>Afterwards, when all the information has been properly catalogued, what will happen depends a bit on the resources in that area. Sometimes, remains might be retained at the coroner's office for future identification. If there is no room for that, the choice will be made between either cremating the remains (cheaper) or burying the remains in a unnamed grave (more expensive, but can be useful if other information is needed in the future, if the unidentified remains are identified and the family would like them) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former funeral director here. While not extremely common it's not unheard of to happen. Often the remains are held at the medical examiner and then placed in to storage. I've spoken to some ME's that said they still had partial skeletal remains in storage from the 80s. </p></div>		</li>
