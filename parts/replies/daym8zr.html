			<div class="markdown"><p>The sorts of arguments used by global warming skeptics that I don't see addressed are that:</p>
<ul>
<li>CO2 only absorbs IR in a few very narrow bands. The greenhouse effect is almost entirely dominated by water vapor.</li>
<li>In these bands there is a limit to how much adding more CO2 can change anything, since some already entirely block all IR within a few meters of the earth's surface, and so adding more CO2 does absolutely nothing to increase the greenhouse effect in such cases.</li>
<li>Adding CO2 can actually <em>decrease</em> the earth's temperature because it is a better blackbody emitter in the IR wavelengths. Whether it increases or decreases the temperature depends on extremely complicated models of atmospheric temperature gradients.</li>

<p>CO2 is heavier than air.... how is it getting into the atmosphere?</p></div>		</li>
