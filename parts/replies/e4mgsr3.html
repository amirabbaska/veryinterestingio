			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice addendum: cursive comes from the latin for flowing, running, as when writing in cursive you're faster and the pen flows as it rarely needs to be lifted from the paper.
The etymology of stamp is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Now let the battle cursive vs stamp begin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's just Australian. I was taught cursive (southeastern US), but my mother, 84 years old, always just called it writing and printing. To her writing something means in cursive, and if it was not in cursive, you were printing. She was taught in a Catholic school in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule" target="_blank">Non-cursive minuscle existed way before printing</a>. There doesn't <em>need</em> to be a lower/upper case split, it was created by writers embellishing the first letters of paragraphs etc, using the old stone-chisel letter forms for those.</p>
<p>Spot on about the names though, they derive from printing.</p></div>		</li>
