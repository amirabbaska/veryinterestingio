			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one example of a conflict that could turn into a war. It would not come as a surprise for the North Koreans if the US Army showed up. And if the US Army shows up then China have said that they will go to war against the US so it would trigger a war declaration from China. So this is an example where the threat of war declaration is preventing a conflict from escalating. Note that the situation between North and South Korea is on the boarder of what you would call a war. Formally they are still at war and there are skirmishes happening from time to time. Not only on the boarders but you have artillery strikes, insurgencies, propaganda and commando raids all over the peninsula.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with the current situation between NK and US is that both countries have narcissistic heads of state who cannot let something die down quietly.  They both demand &quot;the last word&quot;.</p>
<p>It is fortunate for all of us, US, NK, SK, Japan, China, indeed the whole world, that the monster in the Oval Office cannot declare war - only Congress can do that, and getting all of congress to point in the same direction right now is rather like herding cats.</p></div>		</li>
