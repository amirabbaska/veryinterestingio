			<div class="markdown"><p>I would hazard to guess and say it is because of the rate at which you are breathing during periods of high physical stress.  Rapidly breathing or taking in air through the nose can dry out the nasal mucosa.  Mucous membranes like to be moist and can become damaged and painful if dry for too long.  Additionally, a dry membrane is less flexible/pliable/resilient to the constant expansion and compression associated with breathing.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand the breathing I  through your nose part and how it calms you and give you a sense of well being but for some reason breathing out through my mouth feels unatural and I feel pressure in my throat compare to just breathing in and out through my nose with my mouth  closed any idea why this could be? Thanks </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the turbinates in the sinuses create obstruction that slows the exhale down. This creates backpressure in the air-system, the air already in the lungs and undergoing the alveolar-exchange process is optimized via this turbinate back-pressure obstruction function. </p>
<p>I know this, and I know the inhale and refreshing swirling of inhaled air the turbinates and natural sinus structure facilitates, because I had huge pieces of my sinuses cut out, namely the collumula part of the septum, and the inferior turbinates, including soft-tissue, mucosal membrane, and even the inferior turbinate conchal bone. </p>
<p>The air now feels &quot;empty&quot; going in, and just &quot;rushes&quot; out. This is because the natural sinus structure has been destroyed and the mucosal membrane in the sinuses that optimizes the air has been destroyed too. </p>
<p>So the air optimization on the way in, and the backpressure on the way out, those two functions are gone. It feels like death. </p>
<p>Specifically you were talking about exhaling out of the nose feeling good, this is the back-pressure obstruction function the turbinates provide that optimizes the lung organ alveolar-exchange process. Now that I am missing this function I have to stick things into my nose to simulate it. </p>
<p>Edit: Additionally some ENT's do these procedures without consent when you are sedated, and afterward make up excuses for not having consent <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/TgxcD" target="_blank">example</a>. And they also admittedly do this and other unnecessary surgery to as many patients as they can <a href="https://youtu.be/SNUEYs5lQz0" target="_blank">video example</a> (youtube) saying &quot;I do it because I do it&quot;, and &quot;every patient gets one&quot;. Also hospitals encourage unnecessary surgery for profit <a href="https://youtu.be/cSCBrenXPao" target="_blank">one of America's largest hospital conglomerates asking doctors to do unneccessary procedures</a> (youtube).</p></div>		</li>
