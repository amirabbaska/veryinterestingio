			<div class="markdown"><p>I was diagnosed in high school and was very surprised because I rarely swore and only when sufficiently angry (now I do conversationally depending on who I'm taking to, but it was always something I controlled). My tics were mostly squeaking noises, and it caused terrible with the teachers until I brought in my diagnosis (even then everyone was like, &quot;but you don't swear?). I do it a lot less frequently now, but when it happens it sometimes sounds more like an oink. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, might be nice to note, for people's understanding, that for someone to be diagnosed as Tourette, there has to be presence of both muscular and &quot;auditive&quot; (I only use english as a second language, I just can't find a better word).</p>
<p>Where people expect people with TS to swear, or say words, it's really a matter of &quot;making noises&quot; (a bit different that &quot;making sound&quot;, which to me kind of imply them being vocal).</p>
<p>Myself, I blow air out of my nose, or breathe in, noisily. (And fuck (not TS induced) does it bother people on the bus, it's like I have a cold and never learned to use a tissue...)</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's like saying you wish you were in a wheelchair, so you could park in the handicap space.</p>

<p>That's a great point... it <em>would</em> be pretty convenient!</p></div>		</li>
