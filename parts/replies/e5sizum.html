			<div class="markdown"><p>The QuikSCAT satellite measured winds at the surface of the ocean by bouncing radar off the surface and measuring the scattering by ripples on the surface.  Faster winds means more ripples.  However, this technique doesn't work well in a hurricane because the waves are too huge.</p>

<p>ESA's new satellite Aeolus works by firing an ultraviolet laser into the atmosphere and measuring the Doppler shift of the scattered light.  It's brand new, and I don't think it's been integrated into the world weather forecasting system.  It also won't work well in hurricanes, because the winds at the ground will be obscured by clouds.</p>

I'm not sure about remote though.</p></div>		</li>
