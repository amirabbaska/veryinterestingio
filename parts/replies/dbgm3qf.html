<p>It doesn't take long for an antimatter atom to find some matter and pop.
So it never accumulates. </p>
<p>It's possible that in some far off corner of the universe, antimatter makes up all the stuff &amp; regular matter is the stuff made in antimatter supercolliders. </p>
<p>It's potentially possible that antimatter can be made &amp; stored on purpose by using elaborate magnetic fields in a vacuum to keep it from annihilating premature. But this is purely theoretical at this point. &amp; mistakes would be punished harshly.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thinking about the fact atoms are mostly just space, how 'close' do antimatter and matter need to become to annihilate?  and what happens in the 'space between' the component parts of the antimatter and matter particles that have gotten close enough to each other to initiate the process of annihilation?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't it likely, considering we have no explanation for why there would be more normal matter than antimatter formed at the universe's beginning? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antimatter is actually used in PET scans. PET is an akronym for positron-emission-tomography. They inject you with a radio active isotope, that emits positrons by decaying. These positrons annihilate with electrons in your body and this annihilation creates gamma rays. The detector maps the emissions of this gamma rays and so spots in your body with higher than usual metabolic rate are visualized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all of their mass if turned into energy. Some of it might. But they can also form more massive neutrally charged particles. For instance, an electron and positron annihilation (at the right total energy) can lead to the formation of a z-boson - neutrally charged, but more massive</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would any anti matter annihilate with any normal matter or does it have to be the appropriate counterparts, for instance, a positron and an electron.  If it must be the appropriate counterparts, why is that?  All matter and anti matter are ultimately the same &quot;stuff&quot; correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question, the answer is no, only certain processes can occur, the easiest way to tell is to check if certain conservation laws are upheld. For instance, lepton number must be conserved (regular electrons, neutrinos and their cousins have +1 lepton number while their antimatter counterparts have -1). So an electron (+1) and a positron (-1) and annihilate to create a photon (0). Other conservation laws involve all types of charge (electric, color, isospin) helictites, maybe baryon number.</p>
<p>We can also look at these processes in &quot;mirrored&quot; systems, Charge Parity or Time Reversal can be examined individually or in any combinations. Some processes violate CP which is when you mirror the process in space and exchange charges. We don't expect any process to violate CPT, that would imply something is not Lorentz invariant which is a whole other can of worms</p></div>		</li>
