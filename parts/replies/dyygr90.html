			<div class="markdown"><p>I also want to add about why they devided time in 12 based segments.
Sumerians when counting on their hands were counting not fingers, but rather phalanxes of 4 fingers with thumb as a counter (4 fingers with 3 phalanxes each equals 12). When counting with two hands, they folded fingers of the second hand as a multiplyer. Therefore you could count up to 60 (12 phalanxes of one hand multiplied by 5 fingers of the other) quite easily.</p>
<p>Ans Sumerians had symbols for every each of these 12 numbers and they could do math in the same way we do with 10digit Arabic numbers.
It is funny how they lived thousands years ago but we still use some of their cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Why we count in tens and not dozens is that western culture inherited this from Romans, that used 10 as number of fingers on both way a simpliest way to teach math in the army. Legoiners spread it around the world, this added with 10 Arabic digits and simplified version of math was born. </p>
<p>Ps
I’m not sure that Romans were the first to use 10 digits, would be nice if someone could prove it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Close! It's phalanges, even though the singular form is the phalanx bone. Phalanxes is correct when referring to the military formation, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it seems strange to us, it's worth pointing out that there are a lot of practical advantages to the number 12 if you need to divide things into even parts.  12 can be divided by 6, 4, 3, and 2, whereas 10 can only be divided by 5 and 2.  So, &quot;base 12&quot; systems are inherently more &quot;natural&quot; for even subdivision of parts and things like time or the phases of celestial bodies.</p>
<p>When you think about mathematics as being useful primarily in terms of geometry rather than accounting, doing something like &quot;360 degrees in a circle&quot; makes a lot more sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is important.  </p>
<p>All of the things you think make sense about a base 10, still work in a base 12 so there's not loss there.</p>
<p>If you imagine 10 represented by a new symbol ♪ and 11 by a new symbol ♫ the way we count in group is still the same. (12 become 10)</p>
<p>5,10,15,20,25,30 = 6, 10, 16, 20, 26, 30</p>
<p>25, 50, 75, 100 = 30, 60, 90, 120</p>
<p>2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24 = 2,4,6,8,♪,10,12,14,16,18,1♪,20</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The practical value of the extra whole fractions in base 12 and base 60 cannot be overstated.  The way math was written (notation) and uses and concept of zero were very different.  What we today would write as 1/60 or 0.01666...  would have been quite elaborate and difficult to write/read/understand if this ancient system was base 10.</p>
<p>This natural subdivision gave ancient people a practical way to deal with smaller fractions that came up in their lives, until the current zero made its appearance about 5200 years later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Roman numerals aren't exactly a base 10 system. It's an important number in the Roman numeral system for sure, but not in any way more special than 5 for example. Additionally Romans had no zero, so they <em>couldn't</em> use a numeral system based on any particular number.</p>
<p>So while it <em>looks</em> like it's based on number 10 (X), Roman numerals din't really have a <em>base number</em> per se. Instead, they use addition and subtraction to write shorthands of numbers: I is 1, V is 5, X is 10, L is 50, C is 100, D is 500, and M is 1000 (and that's pretty much as far as the Romans had any need for).</p>
<p>So for example year 1998 in Roman numerals was written as MCMXCVIII, which actually reads as M (1000) + CM (1000-100) + XC (100-10) + VIII (5+3), coming to a total of </p>
<p>1000 + (1000 - 100) + (100-10) + (5+3) </p>
<p>= 1000 + 900 + 90 + 8</p>
<p>= 1998</p>
<p>By contrast, a numeral system with a definite base number goes like...</p>
<p>N*k^n +... + D*k^3 + C*K^2 + B*k^1 + A*k^0</p>
<p>where A, B, C, D, ... , N are either zero or some positive integers, and k is the base number which is a positive integer. In the case of year 1998 in decimal system, this would be </p>
<p>1*k^3 + 9*k^2 + 9*k^1 + 8*k^0</p>
<p>where k is of course &quot;ten&quot; as it is the base number here - although this can be misleading because &quot;ten&quot; is technically the base number regardless of <em>what</em> the base number actually is in the decimal system. 10 in hexadecimal system is equal to 16 in decimal system, and 10 in binary is 2 in decimal system, but at least for me it's easiest to just pronounce as &quot;ten&quot; even if it's <em>not</em> the base number of decimal system &quot;ten&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're trying to say is that Romans didn't use positional notation.  However, Roman numerals were based on finger counting.  Each finger was worth I and the thumb was V  (or X on the other hand).  That's why it appears ten based.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>A 100degree circle is actually used to a large extent in my profession (land surveyor) where a circle has 400 as its base, called Gon instead of degrees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add to this, if you're using a calculator (or computer) you may see a little &quot;D&quot; or &quot;Deg&quot; symbol.</p>
<p>That's to tell you that you're using &quot;degrees&quot; as your unit of angle; where 360° makes a full circle.</p>
<p>But you may have noticed that there are other options; usually R (or &quot;Rad&quot;) and G (or &quot;Grad&quot;).</p>
<p>The &quot;G&quot; stands for &quot;<strong>gradian</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>gon</strong>&quot; and is a different unit for measuring angles. There are 400 gradians in a circle, or 100 gradians in a right-angle. Often it is written with a little g; so 1ᵍ = 9/10 °.</p>
<p>The gradian was developed during the French Revolution as part of their &quot;metric&quot; system. The same thing that gave us the wonders of metres, kilograms (based on 10) and all those other lovely units, also came up with the gradian or &quot;metric angle.&quot; It didn't take on, aside from in specialist areas such as surveying or French artillery.</p>
<p>The more important one is the &quot;R&quot; or &quot;<strong>radian</strong>.&quot; It is currently the SI unit for angle. Unlike the degree or gon, which are based on completely arbitrary numbers (400 or 360), the radian is based on the main fundamental property of a circle - its radius. A radian is the angle where if you draw an arc with a certain radius from that angle, the length of that arc is the same as the radius. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Circle_radians.gif" target="_blank">This wonderful graphic</a> helps explain this. This also means that there are 2π radians in a whole circle, π in half a circle, π/2 in a right angle and so on (some people prefer tau for this, as it gives tau radians in a whole circle, t/2 in a half and so on). A radian is about 57°.</p>
<p>The radian (written as 1 rad, or sometimes just 1 - particularly when there's a π being used) is particularly common in mathematics and physics - in some places it is vital. It works as a kind of &quot;natural&quot; unit of angle, and gives some really neat results (particularly when differentiating or integrating).</p>
<p>So... if you really want to annoy your friends who are doing work involving trigonometry (sin, cos, tan) on a calculator, see if you can change their calculator to a different angle unit. Radians will give them the wrong answer, but gradians will really throw them as it will give a wrong answer, but really close to the right one (given how similar they are to degrees).</p>
<p>But don't do this for exams or important tests. That is mean, and being mean is bad. And be on hand to explain and fix things after the amusement ends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read the other replies, 360 was not arbitrarily chosen.  Arbitrary means random or whim, 360 was not a random number used for circles. Its not as useful as rads, but that doesn't make it arbitrary. I don't mean to call you out specifically, many people here are misusing or misunderstanding arbitrary</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are different definitions of &quot;arbitrary&quot;, which might be the confusion.</p>
<p>Some definitions require it to be strictly without reason. Others merely require it to have some element of personal choice.</p>
<p>In mathematics, arbitrary usually means any, rather than a specific. And in a pure mathematics sense there is nothing special about 360; it is just as good as 361 or 359. Practically it is far more useful, but in theory there is no difference. So mathematically, any division other than radians (or &quot;diameterians&quot;, or &quot;circumferencians&quot;) is arbitrary.</p></div>		</li>
