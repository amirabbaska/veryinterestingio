			<div class="markdown"><p>Why couldn't the mirrors be the nodes?</p>
<p>The cavity only allows certain wavelengths to form standing waves. Close enough to standing wave also works with some losses so the beam in laser cavity has some width. There are also always several modes if only cavity geometry is limiting.</p>
<p>The wave is inside like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Longitudinal_mode_v2.svg" target="_blank">this</a>. Except the wave is beam shaped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what if a wave was emitted going towards the mirror from 1/3 the wavelength away from the mirror. Wouldn't it not reflect at a node or antinode and therefore not be a standing wave?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure this is the same effect as with waveguides (or at least close). The light is a wave and waves don't have proper edges. Even if according to ray optics all of the light is inside there is evanescent field on the outside. If the interference inside isn't right (happens to forms a standing wave) the evanescent field on the outside will propagate out.</p></div>		</li>
