<p>Also, all of these comments suggesting we don't know why isn't exactly accurate. We absolutely can predict this behavior with the laws of quantum mechanics that we actually understand quite well. I mean technically we don't know why quantum mechanics is the way the world works, but if we accept that than we very much can explain and understand fully why this happens. It's just unexpected.</p></div>		</li>
