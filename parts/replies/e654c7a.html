			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I was more thinking in terms of when I use my phone at night (which I shouldn't do) and need to take a break and look at something far away to relax my focus, whether I had to actually look at something far away or could just stare at pure darkness to relax focus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both would work.</p>
<p>That's the vergence system you're trying to relax. If your eyes have no stimulus on which to focus, they will take up their natural rest position.</p>
<p>When you say far away though, it doesn't need to be super far. The other side of a room is enough to allow the muscles responsible for your vergence to relax enough compared to when converging on your phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it true that to have healthy eyes you have to look at objects far away some times a day? In other words is looking close-by all the time bad for your sight? If so, how could I do this best with all the buildings and all that killing far-away views?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for reading and maybe even thanks a lot for responding as well ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Optometrist here also. If you ever watch videos of people in complete darkness using night vision cameras you may notice their eyes look kind of wonky. That isn't the camera...the eyes have nothing to fixate on and relax to their non-converged position. Docs like me measure the position of your unfixated eye using a &quot;cover test&quot;. The magnitude and position of your eyes when not fixated gives a lot information about the comfort and strain your eyes go through daily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can make my eyes stop converging at will, but I noticed that when I'm very very sleepy but still looking at something they will diverge much, much more than when I just relax them. What's up with that?</p>
<p>I haven't been able to film me doing that, as that wakes me up, but I suspect it'd look like my right eye is looking right and my left is looking left. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can see the faintest image of something from a comfortably-focusable distance the eyes may focus on it. If it's truely black and there's no light whatsoever (frequently impossible/never-the-case), they won't focus, since there's nothing to focus too.</p>
<p>That said, anything close to the face will have the effect  of causing eyes to not focus because it's too close for the eyes to focus on (regardless of the light; since eyelids don't block all light either obviously)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I usually see billions of tiny flashing lights in complete darkness, could you explain what those are? I was under the assumption that they were either high energy particles hitting my retina, but another article said they were white blood cells</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are generally just white noise supplied by your brain/nervous system in lack of any stimuli - all those receptors and their processing systems go from getting massive amounts of information in all visible directions to sheer nothing in complete darkness, and so you get a lot of noise.</p>
<p>You'll get nowhere near the volume of high-energy particles to be continually visible if you're still on the Earth, and white blood cells aren't visible like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey I have that too! Also believed it might be related to particles, thought it was my superpower as a child!<br />
I can most clearly see them when I close my eyes, a bit less clear in the night. They are present even during the daytime however, if I choose to focus on them.<br />
My guess is, after looking at some articles, that it could be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow" target="_blank">Visual snow</a>. Check around for some more depictions online, I find the Wikipedia one to be much more intense than my experiences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have MS and my optic nerves have suffered a fair amount of damage resulting in vision loss and that fuzzy/visual snow effect. I'm curious as to whether or not your vision is normal as the only other people I've met who have had this also have some aberration in the visual processing system.</p>
<p>Edit:The Visual Snow description assumes black and white dots, but the ones I experience can also be many other colors as my nerve is reporting the wrong information to my occipital lobe. I have had occular migraines that result in red flashes and an effect called Scintillating Scotoma where the peripheral vision appears to be wavy as well.</p></div>		</li>
