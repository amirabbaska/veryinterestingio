			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems implausible, though. Fiji and Tonga formed relatively recently, and they have never been connected to continental landmasses.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've taken a look at the article you linked. They raise an interesting possibility regarding Fiji and Tonga bearing some continental sediments from Australasia. As the authors themselves acknowledge, though, I think this issue needs a lot more geologic and fossil evidence to support it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah... so? The timing of  Tonga/Fiji and the genetic isolation are completely separate- these Iguanas ended up on Fiji/Tonga, but they didn't evolve exclusively there necessarily!  </p>
<p>Heck, they could've Island hopped for 60 million years- this could be just there most recent stop! </p>
<p>I don't know much here other than that's pure conjecture- but had to point to the faulty logic.</p></div>		</li>
