<p>Edit: Plus it's a very entertaining movie that's very well done to explain what can be very dry/boring terms/subjects. With basically an all-star cast with Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling and Steve Carrell</p>
<p>Edit 2: Couple of other big names that I left out that others have kindly reminded me of: Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie (best scene in the movie, IMO....)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can avoid them with restrictions. Don't allow loans to be packaged and sold or limit how many times they can do this. Increase the amount of capital banks have to have on hand at any given time. Make sure that these bets are rated fairly. One of the problems with the 2008 collapse is that rating agencies were falsely saying that the housing market was still good when there were tons of subprime mortgages packed into these packages. Essentially they lied. You can also discourage lending with higher interest rates. I think the problem we have now is that everyone loses their mind when interest rates get above 5-6% but you need those times of high interest rates to discourage borrowing temporarily. Sure, the builders will also take a hit for a little while because no one will be buying homes but they'll also hopefully be saving money so that they can either buy with cash or won't have to borrow so much when interest rates do come down. (This is a sweet balance. You don't want interest rates to be too high to kill the economy but too low encourages risky lending.) You can also put regulations in place to prevent predatory lending - lending to people you know can't make the payments so that you walk away with their house and a few years of payments and the loan insurance payout. Basically, you have a legal obligation to make sure people can make their payments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so good times and bad times, ie cycles, are normal. But these boom and bust cycles are BAD. The last big one before 2008 was the great depression starting in 1929. Many regulations were put in place in the aftermath to help prevent another huge crash, and it worked! Then, starting in the 80s, regulations were relaxed. This is by republicans and democrats. </p>
<p>After 2008 the obama administration pushed new regulations to help prevent this in the future, but primarily due to republican obstructionism (and democratic pandering to conservative voters) these regulations were very weak, and quite a few of them have been repealed by the trump administration. This is why many people are pessimistic about the future.</p>
<p>So why does the economy look so great now, if all that is true? Well, a lot of it is unrelated, but one of the factors is the same that it was in the lead-up to 2008 - the illusion of value. So back then (and now), homes were increasing in price because people were able to get loans that they weren't able to pay back because the banks didn't care because they had insurance and they sold the loan. People were able to get big loans so they were able to pay more for houses, so houses were being built nonstop.</p>
<p>The mortgage industry said &quot;look, we've got 10 homes here, each is worth $100k, but their mortgages are worth an average of $150k. With 10 homes that's 15 million dollars we have here, guaranteed to arrive over 20 years!!&quot; The banks called that &quot;assets&quot;, valued in our example at $15m. When 9/10 of those homeowners stopped paying their mortgages, suddenly it was worth only $150k plus the value of 9 homes. But no one is buying homes because no one can get a loan. So now those 9 homes are worth only $100k total for all 9! So now the bank has an asset that they used to value at $15m but now is worth only $250k. That's a loss of 14.75 million dollars!!!</p>
<p>So the economy can look good, but it can all be a mirage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>His whole analysis isn’t that great tbh as it misses the MAIN part: the bubble.</p>
<p>Mortgages and the whole bundles and insurance and everything actually works just fine, the problem is that it connects everything together so a crash in one area spreads out to others.</p>
<p>The REAL reason for the crash is that the whole market was based on the idea that housing prices would continue to rise, making buying a house or giving a mortgage seem like a really good idea.</p>
<p>When housing prices started to get so high that people stopped buying, THERE you had the real shock that went through the economy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll lose way more than 200k.</p>
<p>I'm looking at my own mortgage of 350k and the end repayment cost is over 1 mil including taxes, intrest, all other costs, and assuming minimum payments over 30 years.</p>
<p>If my home value drops to 200k, I'll be over paying on my mortgage by over 250k over 30 years. Add in the 150k I've lost in home value and I'm screwed out of 400k.</p>
<p>I really need to cut back on avocado toast.</p>
<p>Edit: I guess it's not as clear cut as overpaying by 250k, because that assumes my house immediately lost all of that value. There would hopefully be some sort of gradient instead of a disastser of some sort immediately dropping the value on day one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an economic slowdown, the low security jobs (not necessarily low paying) are the first hit. But in a near collapse like we saw last decade, even a lot of &quot;secure&quot; jobs got hit, depending on industry. A lot of high paying finance jobs were lost, a lot of solid construction jobs were lost, and when people stopped buying things, a lot of good paying jobs in retail and marketing were lost. I would argue it also accelerated offshoring of other high paying jobs (manufacturing, engineering, programming), and eroded union power which leads to lower wages.</p>
<p>But the funny thing is, the unemployment rate peaked at 10% (USA 2009). It is currently 4.5%, which means at the worst, we only had a little more than twice as many unemployed. I'm not saying it's not a big effing deal (and for a lot of complicated reasons), but far more than the loss of jobs per se was the loss of the feeling of financial security. People who kept their jobs still saw their retirement investments lose half their value. They saw their home equity lose half their value. They saw their salaries get frozen and their bonuses and benefits start to decrease. They saw their safety nets start to develop holes or otherwise vanish completely. And a lot of those who lost high paying jobs could only replace them with lower paying jobs. All this created a hell of a lot of financial anxiety so that even people with money spent less and saved more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you had bought a house and it appraises for what you bought it for, you're technically fine. But if you bought a house for $200k, watched it grow in value to $400k, then see it drop back down to $200k, you inevitably feel like you lost $200k. It's human nature, but that &quot;paper loss&quot; is depressing and adds to that financial insecurity I'm talking about.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't have the source on me, but I read somewhere that the vast majority of new jobs created since the crash are low-paying, temp jobs with no benefits. So we lost high-paying, stable jobs, and replaced them with low-paying, temp jobs.</p>
<p>2008 was a huge, huge hit to the middle class especially, and we're still feeling the pain now. The rich did spectacularly, though, as usual when there is a major recession.</p></div>		</li>
