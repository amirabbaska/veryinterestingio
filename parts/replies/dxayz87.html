			<div class="markdown"><p>I am so lost.</p>
<p>I thought the electrical circuit only involved positive and negative.  Electricity flows from the positive to the negative.</p>
<p>I thought ground was &quot;out-of-band&quot; to drain excess electricity only.  Under normal operation I thought that the grounding wires should not have much current flowing through them.  But in the event of a lightning strike or short circuit or something else that sends electricity where it shouldn't be, the ground is there to safely drain that away instead of allowing it onto the circuit where it can overheat/damage things.</p>
<p>But you are basically describing ground and negative as the same thing.  I am very confused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>TLDR</strong>: basically live is positive; neutral and ground are both negative, but you can tell when something is wrong based on <em>which</em> negative is closing the circuit.</p>
<p>The proper term for mains ground is &quot;earth&quot;.</p>
<p>It's easy to think of earth like a storm drain or the overflow on your sink, but it's more of an automatic emergency stop.</p>
<p>Ground and negative <em>are</em> the same thing, electrically. Mains ground ('earth') and mains neutral are both earthed - that is, literally connected to a bit of metal buried in the dirt. The difference is how they are used.</p>
<p>In normal circumstances, earth should have <strong>absolutely no electricity flowing at all</strong>. Current flows from live (positive) to neutral (negative).</p>
<p>If you have live wires inside a metal object and one of them frays, the whole thing becomes a deathtrap - if that wire touches the metal sides, the next person to touch it dies.</p>
<p>That's why the sides are connected to the earth wire - as soon as that frayed wire touches the sides, current starts flowing to the earth wire, the Residual Current Device detects that, and the power shuts off straight away.</p>
<p>As for lightning strikes and surges, that has nothing to do with ground/earth. When too much current is flowing and there is a risk of equipment damage, a fuse burns or a breaker trips.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does the current get to the earth through the third prong if a wire is frayed? So the current goes through the metal box, then into the ground wire? And why do only some of the things I plug in have a ground prong? Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember that for a car, plane, etc. they are dealing with DC.  It's batteries, so they're dumping electrons back to the negative side of the battery through the chassis (or a ground wire...or it's often just called negative).</p>
<p>For AC there is a difference between negative and ground, but in the end they end up in the same place at the box.  The neutral is meant to carry more current and the ground is for safety as a backup. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is that different from a neutral?
Also, if the chassis is the &quot;ground&quot; wouldn't that mean you could electrocute yourself by touching a car (if you had less resistance to ground than the chassis)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A neutral connection is similar to a ground connection. Indeed, the power company connect neutral to ground at their facilities, and often at multiple points before it gets to its final destination.</p>
<p>However, keeping the neutral and ground separate, even though they are connected together at a specific point is important for safety:
Electricity flows along a potential gradient. So, at the transformer, the potential of the hot wire might be 135 V. By the time it gets to your house, it might be down to 125 V. The current also has to flow back along the neutral. At the transformer the potential is defined as 0, but at your house, the neutral wire potential might be 10 V. This gives a total potential difference (voltage) at your house of 115 V. What this means is that the potential of the neutral wire may deviate from the ground potential. Under fault conditions, like a bad connection or a cut neutral wire, the potential can be close to the hot wire potential, and could cause shock or electrocution.</p>
<p>By having a separate ground wire, because there is normally no current flowing in the wire, the potential is the same at both ends. This ensures that potential on the ground wire (and things connected to it) like the metal case of appliances remains at the same potential as your water pipes, sink, etc. so there is no potential difference. However, because the ground wire is still connected to neutral, current can flow through it in an emergency. So, if the hot wire comes loose in your washing and touches the metal case, the ground wire will complete the circuit, cause an overload and the circuit breaker will shut off the power.</p>
<p>An electric shock is just current flow - so there has to be a complete circuit. The car's body is not connected to the ground, so even though the car has a battery (also not connected to ground), if you touch the car, you don't complete a circuit, so no current can flow, whether you touch the battery or the car body. However, if you touched the battery positive terminal and the chassis simultaneously, there is a circuit there - however, the battery voltage on most cars is too low to cause a shock even if there is a circuit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a little confused, if you don’t mind can I ask a question? You say the car is not connected to the ground so there is no complete circuit. So if I was to be on a metal latter and touch a power line, why would I get shocked? How does the circuit complete through me to the ground? </p></div>		</li>
