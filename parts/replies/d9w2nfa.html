			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if you just misunderstood /u/wellerccs, but he's saying that when we laugh, we &quot;screw up&quot; our face a bit (eyes shut really tight, face gets tight, big smile, etc.), which compresses the drainage duct that your eyes are constantly using all day long to drain out and replenish the lubrication in your eyes. When you laugh really hard, you're basically plugging this duct inadvertantly with the muscles in your face, so the 'tears' that normally just drain back behind your eyes and into your nose and throat can't drain that way anymore temporarily, so your eyes just dump the tears out onto your face instead.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is because the drainage (lacrimal) duct is compressed from us screwing up our face, therefore your normal amount of lacrimal (eye) fluid cannot drain away and thus it overflows onto your face. </p>

<p>Also, tear composition is completely different under microscope when your actually crying vs just tears that are lubricating your eyes. You can actually see the different structures, which is cool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait... crying from laughing is just the &quot;normal&quot; amount of eye fluid that you always have around your eyes that can't drain because your face is scrunched up and plugging the drain hole. That's what you said, right? </p>
<p>And you also said &quot;tears&quot; contain endorphins. </p>
<p>So by that logic, we always have endorphins in our eyes, since (as discussed above) the tears from laughing are just normal eye fluid running down our face. And that doesn't seem right.</p>
<p>Isn't there a difference between sad tears and happy tears? Like, the body produces sad tears with endorphins, which are compositionally different from the normal tears we cry from laughing? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I expect that you may be into something here, as that makes a lot of sense. I’ve seen people laughing who have an almost stupid amount of tears running down their faces, and I can’t see <em>that</em> much bring produced normally. Something else has to be going on than the duct bring constricted.</p>
<p>I’m sure that has an effect, but it seems it’s not the entire cause.</p></div>		</li>
