			<div class="markdown"><p>The standard model of particle physics has something called the Sphaleron process, which violates both baryon and lepton number but conserves baryon number <em>minus</em> lepton number. It's negligibly rare at energies we can access even in the most powerful colliders and has never been observed, but the standard model predicts it. I don't know the details though and there may be other processes I'm not aware of.</p></div>		</li>
