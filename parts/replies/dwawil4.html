			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I've never really bought that argument. Pretty much everything your body does produces heat, and you have to spend energy to cool yourself down, so I can't imagine cold water is going to be at all detrimental.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you don't have to spend that much energy cooling yourself down though (especially vs say, heating up via shivering.) most of heat loss is passive anyway. </p>
<p>I'd say the effect of heating up ingested liquids is negligible, unless it's a severe case (eg, hypothermia) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s much more relevant that your body has to spend <em>water</em> to cool down. If you are dehydrated, cold water cooling your body means that it can spend less water as sweat to cool you down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is anecdotal, but just my two cents: I've always sweat a lot, played sports all through high school and try to remain active still and am almost always the first to soak through my shirts. While I won't argue that warm or cold water hydrates better, I will say that if I'm really dehydrated I'd much rather have room temperature water because I feel my body can absorb it much more quickly and, like others have said, I can drink a lot more at once. I understand if you don't sweat too much that cold water is good to cool down and hydrate but sometimes our body's cooling system does just fine without any help (sweating profusely) and it's more important to replenish it than try and cool it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We did some calculations back in high school physics to show that drinking cold water helps you lose weight/expend energy as it has to warm the water to body temp. The calculation show that while this is technically true,it's also negligible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're working extremely hard and your body is overheating drinking cold water is actually more beneficial. It's true that it takes more time and energy to warm the water to allow the body to use and absorb it. But the body isn't working efficiently while overheated and spends it's energy trying to fix that issue before it worries about getting that water digested/absorbed.</p>
<p>Drinking cold water helps to regulate body temperature which in turn makes it work more efficiently allowing it to make use of the water faster, regardless of how cold it is.</p>
<p>If you're just extremely thirsty and dehydrated under normal conditions and you're not overheating, room temperature water is the way to go.</p>
<p>If you're overheating due to a hot environment or intense physical activity etc. Cold water is ideal.</p>
<p>The benefits of either are minimal though. Drink it the way you like it unless it's a life or death situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have a huge issue with sweating. My armpits would be soaked almost as soon as I got dressed, even though I hadn’t exercised.</p>
<p>I tried everything to remedy this, and curiously the thing that finally worked was to drink water. That’s it. As soon as I drank water, my armpits would dry up. Even if they started out wet, if I drank about 12-16 oz of water on the way to work, they’d be dry before I got there.</p>
<p>I chalked it up to the water cooling down my core, thus shutting off my sweating mechanism. But it worked equally well whether it was cold or room temperature water, so I’m not sure what the reason really. I just know that it works.</p>
<p>BTW, this only works for me for nervous sweating, not for exercise sweating. If I’m exercising, drinking water doesn’t seem to put a dent in my sweating.</p>
<p>Any idea why water works for me to shut off nervous sweating?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Go out and buy some of the cheapest, simplest deodorant you can find. I think I use Speed Stick. I used to use all the crazy anti-perspirants and they made me sweat so much. I had pit stains for most of my life. I switched to a simple deodorant and I NEVER have pit stains and I actually sweat less. I read some forum years ago about this and it changed my life. Please give it a go, and hopefully it will change yours. Pit stains fucking suck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People often don't drink enough water and are in a constant state of slight dehydration. This is especially true when we wake up, its always good to drink a big ole glass of water first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the case for you? Dehydration is a stressor and it might be adding to your body's stress response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, thanks. I'm not OP, but I've always wondered why ice water &quot;tastes&quot; better... but I wind up drinking more water overall when it is room temperature.  </p>
<p>Like, if I'm handed an ice cold water on a summer day, it'll take me about 10 minutes to drink it.  If I'm handed warm water, I just stand there and drink the whole thing at once, and I'm ready for another one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is know as the &quot;Coors Light Effect&quot;.  You are less sensitive to flavors at cold temperatures.  Drinking something &quot;As cold as the Rockies&quot; makes you not notice the bitter compounds or generally poor flavor.  The converse of this is also why high quality &quot;beverages&quot; taste just fine at cool or even room temperature.</p>
<p>This is also why melted ice cream can taste sickeningly sweet.  Ice cream is formulated to be eaten cold and the flavor profile gets thrown off as it melts.  Or you have a wicked sweet tooth like I do and actually prefer it (slightly) melted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, I mash my ice cream and wait for it to melt. I've done it since I was a kid because it made it 'taste better.' My family always thought I was weird because they didn't notice a difference. Well, TIL. </p>
<p>I was eating Haagen Dazs Dulce de Leche last night and it is fantastic if you let it melt to the point of the soft, foamy texture then eat the caramel ribbons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this for tap water or bottled water? I have the exact same thing with tap water, but as I just read in this thread, the cold takes of the nasty taste. Tap water has many stuff added for hygiene reasons, and this adds a taste which many people don't like. Filtered water is quite different in taste.</p></div>		</li>
