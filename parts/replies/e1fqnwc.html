			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that Janus deals with public sector employees, most of whom are state employees covered by their various state labor relations acts. So, it might be possible that states could change these acts to allow some limits on services provided to non-members.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is REALLY worth noting is that all of the major victories won by the labor movement were done at a time when being a union member was not only NOT legally protected, but was actually against the law.</p>
<p>Unions get their strength from numbers and solidarity. If you have those, then whatever the law says doesn't matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans are inherently greedy.  Unions, like Communism, really help illustrate this fact. Sure, collective bargaining and strength in numbers sound good on paper, but it almost invariably doesn't take too long for some greedy motherfuckers at the top to begin to take advantage of the system.  Next thing you know, you e got people paying dues to Unions that are either siphoned by Union leaders for their own benefit, or that go towards dragging feet and defending indefensible on the job actions.  Nothing is as perfect in practice as it is on paper, but some things (unions) are particularly counter-productive once humans get their hands on them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Labor and employment history in the US is really complex and interesting so realize this is going to be a super simplified eli5 to a complex issue.</p>
<p>Basically, it was a protection for the workers that limited the employers' ability to coerce employees into not joining the union.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If an employer can offer different deals for non-union and union employees, they can give a sweet deal for not joining the union, let the union dissolve, then do whatever they want. So as long as a certain proportion of employees are in a union, the contract negotiated with the union applies to all employees. This leads to a problem for employees who don't like the union, don't like union dues, etc. - they are forced to still give money to the union. SCOTUS decided that was unfair, but the requirement that the union is the only one who can bargain is still in place. Now union dues are basically insurance - if you think having a working union is in your best interests, then you can support the union by paying dues. If not, you risk losing the union. But of course, you can also gamble that the union will be fine without your dues and get a free ride, which is what causes indignation over this ruling.</p>
<p>While the logic is there, the effect is that this may result in unions being dissolved by people who don't what they've got 'til it's gone. They've paved paradise, put in a parking lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one is ever forced to join a union, in places where there is a “closed shop” meaning the union bargains on behalf of every employee, you can either join the union, pay dues and contribute to the bargaining effort, which is always aimed at bettering your working conditions and wages, or you can pay agency fees, which are essentially a contribution to the union so that they can continue to do what they’re legally obligated to do on your behalf without going bankrupt, but you are not part of the local.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how unions should attack the Janus ruling, as right of free association is also part of the 1st amendment. Forcing unions to represent non-members, by the logic of Janus, is forced association that is counter to the Constitution. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not actually a good idea. As a union, you WANT everyone in the workplace to be in the union--if you don't, then the boss can cut a separate deal with the non-members and undermine (and eventually destroy) the union. That was previously a common tactic, and it is why Federal labor law requires everyone in the bargaining unit to be represented by the union whether they are a member or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if they didn’t force the even field it would be far far worse. The union negotiates for $25/hr for all union members, the employer responds by saying, “anyone not in a union makes $35/hr.” The owner keeps this going, giving better and better benefits to non-union members until the union all quits, then it’s right back to $7.60/hr because there’s no union left to fight. </p></div>		</li>
