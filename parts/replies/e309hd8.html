<p>It's also possible that the organism they are protecting against no longer exists or at least not in that region. If the trait is not detrimental to the plant it may not get selected against.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is toxic to humans too if you ate enough chocolate, but it would be a ridiculous amount.  According to wikipedia's theobromine article, a fatal dose for dogs is 300 mg/kg, and for humans 1000 mg/kg, so 3x as much scaled to body weight.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theobromine. It comes down to metabolization. We can metabolize it quickly. For cats and dogs, it builds up, add in smaller size they basically OD since theobromine has similar effects to caffiene.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some alkaloids may not even serve a particular purpose directly. Some also may simply be a metabolic byproduct that prevents build up of an unfavorable metabolite. Natural selection can come with coincidences, a simple waste product could be extremely toxic to animals by chance. </p>
<p>A quick look at some curare toxins reveals them to be EXTREMELY complicated heterocycles. Usually alkaloids are products of amino acid metabolism as this could be as well.  I might check some journals later in the week and see if anyone has done some studies. I’m sure they have. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Often, the &quot;factor&quot; of an alkaloid that leads to it being selected for is something as simple as being very bitter/unpalatable. Simply put, they taste nasty.</p>
<p>The molecule could be a ridiculously complicated heterocyclic mess resulting from a mass of gene duplications, pathway byproduct shunting, and oxidative stress reactants, but if it makes critters less likely to get past a first nibble, it will probably manage to make it a few generations down the line.</p>
<p>(This is largely circumstantial, given how tricky it can be to tell precisely what effect a compound has in every organism that may encounter it, but I've heard it thrown around at conferences to general nodding of heads so I'm willing to run with it for now)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The less you’re eaten, the more your genes are around to spread. This of course jives well with natural selection, also a falsifiable statement that has been tested quite a bit. I do think it is interesting what the previous post said about a stressor or predator that initially provided the stress for selection of the compound may no longer be around. </p></div>		</li>
