			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a street Minister and work with many mentally ill people. They barely make it if at all. Many starve or die of exposure, violence,  or being hit in traffic, especially those who receive no government aid. Actually only about a fifth of the ones I've known are or were on drugs - they are too expensive. Those who still use either steal to get money, more of them beg, and others only get high or stoned if another one has some and shares - but mooches aren't tolerated long. About half are alcoholics, but only about half of those still drink - but the disease haunts them all the time even after stopping - that's a daily battle for them. Why do they use drugs or drink? Nearly all have zero family or true friend contact or support, usually tossed to the curb by burned out family and friends who do not believe they are autistic, schitzophrenic, have panic disorder, OCDs etc. and think they are just lazy and faking it. They feel unloved and abandoned. If they had help getting it or are cognizant enough to apply on their own, they might be getting a pittance from the government - barely enough EBT and SSI to survive in a &quot;subsidized&quot; apartment. But here, those run $510 per month for an old hotel room that is literally one tile floor room with a bathroom, no closet except a rail to hang clothes on, and no kitchen whatsoever (no fridge &amp; no cooking appliances), and no furniture - so they sleep on hard tile floors with what blankets they can scrounge or on old cardboard and eat with that same floor as a table. The water is brown and shouldn't be drunk, but its all they have, so many get intestinal illnesses that dangerously dehydrate them. Rodents and roaches are common. Electricity is included here but it's rarely reliable and goes out often. No security from other tenants, some of whom are sexual predators or violent - dangerous for females and young adults especially. No internet, but if they have EBT they can get a limited text and voice phone for free. Medicaid IF they have it (application is too complicated for most to wade through) doesn't cover psych meds at the doses the severely ill need to take, so that's more out of their very limited income ($735 month plus $163 food EBT), nor does it cover seeing a Psychiatrist. They have to rely on at least here a very poor and actually well documented to be abusive free psych hospital to get scripts. Dental care is available, but the waiting line is months long, so cavities often abcess. There is no free or covered servuce for vision or hearing correction unless it is a severe physical illness, so glasses or hearing aids are out of the question. They receive NO in home services. Bus fare to go to doctors or the pharmacy or grocery runs $4 per trip here - adds up fast in a month, averaging $32 or more for most. If they have a public vehicle phobia, which is not uncommon for autistics, they rely on cabs (VERY costly) or walk miles with heavy groceries in all kinds of weather. Illness from exposure is common as getting adequate coats etc. is costly. Simple expenses like toilette paper and soap add up. Most are out of cash and food EBT before the end of the third week of a month. So if they are ill but smart they might be able to budget and survive but it is literally a day to day struggle, and those on the street only make it if they find a homeless camp that is safe and mutually supportive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The way we treat our mentally ill in this country is deplorable.</p>
<p>I'm glad you are able to minister to these poor souls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a leaky pipe that leaves a puddle in the gutter outside of my work. There is a homeless woman that comes by every few days and drinks out of the puddle. We have tried to give her clean water but she doesn't seem to know anyone is there when you approach her. Doesn't acknowledge you or respond in the slightest. You can put a water bottle next to her hand but she ignores it. We even left a case of water next to the gutter but she doesn't touch it. Always drinks from the puddle. It's extremely sad.</p></div>		</li>
