			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to think of the difference between encrypted connections to mail servers and end-to-end encrypted email like this:</p>
<p>You write a letter and put it in a treasure chest provided by Google (an SSL connection), lock it up and send it on. No one can open the chest while in transit to google.  Once the chest gets to Google, they open the lock, pull your letter out and then do whatever they need to do with it. They can read the letter since it really was just a plain text letter the entire time, only protected by Google's treasure chest container.</p>
<p>End to End Encryption would be if you wrote the letter, then ran it through some type of cipher to encrypt the letter then placed that encrypted letter in the chest. Google would still be able to open the chest, because it is their chest, but at this point, they can no longer read your letter as the letter itself was encrypted.  The challenge comes on providing a way for anyone you send an email to to be able to decrypt it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>just to be completely clear (given some of the other answers below).  you could make a &quot;gmail&quot; that was encrypted, but it wouldn't be email.  it would be a separate, proprietary service.  if you want <strong>email</strong> - something that works with other systems than google using the standards defined for email - then it cannot be encrypted without some additional work (which so far is not widely enough accepted  / easy to use).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ELI5 version is that you send your email through a tunnel that no-one can intercept/read while in transit. Only the sender and receiver know the contents of the email, because its contents are otherwise-encrypted the entire time. Not even the server (in this case, Google) would have access to it, as literally the only ones who can read it are sender/receiver.</p></div>		</li>
