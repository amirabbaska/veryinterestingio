<p>EOs must be constitutional, so they can be challenged in the judicial branch (in fact, that's happening now with this latest EO).</p>
<p>EOs must also be legal, so legislation can render them illegal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The EO was issued pursuant to the INA. The language of the EO specifically cites section 212 (f) which states in part: &quot;Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation... suspend entry of all aliens... he may deem to be appropriate.&quot;</p>
<p>So President Trump is literally doing what the statute allows him to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's illegal and unconstitutional for many reasons, but the method by which that's demonstrated requires going through the courts.</p>
<p>It will be struck down now that it's been challenged, once it makes its way through the court system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Congress could challenge the law in several ways. For instance, Congress could repeal the statute that is the base of the Executive Order. The President would have no law to enforce. However, it would probably be a violation of the separation of powers doctrine for Congress to restrict the President's actual power. </p>
<p>The judiciary cannot actually challenge laws. An individual would have to challenge the law in the courts. To do this, the individual would have to assert that the law or order violated a right. The challenge with the &quot;Muslim Ban&quot; will be difficult because it is aimed at people outside of the United States- potential immigrants. People outside of the US do not have the same rights under the Constitution that Americans within the US's borders do. Even if the law were successfully challenged, President Trump's executive order falls under national security, so the Courts will give strong deference to the Executive Branch. </p>
<p>If you want a historical example, look up Korematsu v. United States, which deals with President Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066 and the Japanese internment camps. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Does your 2nd paragraph hold true for green card holders? Are they not protected?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Green card holders or Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) are afforded more protections if they are within the United States. If they are outside of the US, such as visiting another country, then it could pose a problem. The specific protections are unclear, as they usually go on a case-by-case basis depending on the facts of the situation. If you are  in a position where your status within the US is going to be questioned, my suggestion is that you get in touch with a lawyer who specializes in immigration and have them answer any specific question you may have. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Courts have Judicial review over executive orders. The legislature can only really challenge it, by passing a law specifically banning whatever the order was doing. Assuming the President would veto such law, you'd need 2/3 support in both houses of congress.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think we need to change the rules about EOs. It shouldn't be so easy to make such a mess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The purpose they serve is a valid one. If congress wants to replace the Golden Gate Bridge, and provides funding but no other instruction beyond that, you need someone in the authority in government to say I want this Bridge to be Blue, I want it to be a suspension bridge, and I want it 400 feet above the water, because I think it's more aesthetically pleasing that way. That's what Executive Ordes are for.</p></div>		</li>
