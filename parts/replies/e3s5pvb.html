			<div class="markdown"><p>Palm trees are not grass, though they are more closely related to grass than they are to other trees. They can grow in clumps where the whole clump is a single organism, but the fronds are just an organ.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even in grass, the frond or leaf isn't a new organism.  The <em>clump</em> of grass, which has multiple leaves growing out of it, is equivalent to the palm tree with multiple leaves growing out of it. A single grass individual/ramet works like <a href="http://vro.agriculture.vic.gov.au/dpi/vro/vroimages.nsf/Images/sss_gen_grass/$File/gen_grass.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>.  The individual grass blades aren't their own independent plant because they all connect to the same base stem and grow from the same root node.  Likewise the palm leaves all connect to the same palm trunk and grow from the same roots.</p>
<p>When I'm talking about different grass parts each being their own plant, I'm talking about different, but connected, clumps of grass.  Like <a href="http://ipm.ucanr.edu/TOOLS/TURF/IMAGES/KEYIMAGES/grassplant_1.jpg" target="_blank">this</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atom does mean that.  It's a greek word.  Individual is derived from Latin.   In = prefix meaning &quot;not&quot;....like &quot;insane&quot; and &quot;inconceivable!&quot; and &quot;inappropriate&quot;.   Dividual = from Latin &quot;Dividuus&quot;  meaning &quot;divisible&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well the concept of individuality becomes really fuzzy when talking about anything, really.</p>
