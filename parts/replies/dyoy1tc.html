			<div class="markdown"><p>A specific isotope of iron (iron-56) is the most radioactively stable element. It has the maximum amount of binding energy per nucleon, making it the most “efficiently bound nucleus.” I would guess you are correct about iron in stars—it makes sense for iron to be the end product of nuclear fusion due to its stability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The binding energy per nucleon for 56Fe is about -8.7903 MeV however for the case of 62Ni it is -8.7945 MeV.  (Note the negative sign, should be the lowest value, bounded systems have negative energy etc. but of course this is context dependent etc. etc.)</p>
<p>So 62Ni should be more stable than 56Fe.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, iron-58 and nickel-62 have the highest binding energy.  But, stars form heavy elements by adding helium nuclei which have 4 nucleons, 2 protons and 2 neutrons. The short version is you get isotopes with multiples of 4 nucleons. Nickel-56 has the highest binding energy of nuclei is this sequence.  So, Nickel-56 is the end product of nuclear fusion because producing zinc-60 absorbs energy. Nickel-56 decays to iron-56 with a 6 day half life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The iron threshold is just the point where the reactions caused by fusion turn from an exothermic reaction to an endothermic reaction. In everything earlier than iron, the exothermic reaction gives off energy which causes an outward pressure that keeps the star from collapsing under its own gravity. Once a star begins to fuse chromium into iron, the star begins to collapse because of the endothermic reaction. Fusing into iron does not give off energy, it actually takes energy. The endothermic reaction no longer gives energy and, therefore, does not create the outward pressure and the star collapses under its own gravity. Fusing iron, or anything heavier, does notgive off any energy and that is when the star dies. There are other factors that cause the dying star to become a neutron star, black hole or explode in a supernovae. All of these are related to how much matter the star begins with. Depending on the size, the star will collapse into a neutron star, a black hole or cause a supernovae explosion. A supernovae is how elements heavier than iron are formed. Iron and any element lighter than iron can be created by fusion throughout the life of a star.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's impossible to fuse elements heavier than iron, but doesn't this also mean it's impossible/highly inefficient to split atoms lighter than iron? Because they're too loosely bound to give off much or any energy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iron has the lowest mass per nucleon, meaning it is the most stable atom, and has the least energy.</p>
<p>The reason why is because the electromagnetic force pushing protons away from each other begins to dominate the nucleus (because it goes like n^(2)), and because the limited range of the strong nuclear force means that as the nucleus gets large the protons and neutrons on one side can't really affect those on the other side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is slightly, but significantly, incorrect.</p>
<p>Iron-56 (26p, 30n) has the lowest <em>mass</em> per nucleon.</p>
<p>But Nickel-62 (28p, 34n) has the highest binding energy, because it has a greater percentage of neutrons, which are heavier than protons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While true, that explanation is kind of the wrong way around. Yes, the mass of the products is less than the mass of the inputs, but that's not <em>why</em> they give off energy, it is <em>because</em> they've given off energy. It is just easier to measure the change in mass than measure the energy given off.</p>
<p>A better explanation for why energy is given off from fusion or fission is to think about the strong interaction; how as nucleons get closer together they give off energy (or gain it in the form of kinetic energy, although that eventually has to be shed in some form). Same way as how if something falls it gains kinetic energy that it eventually sheds as it hits the ground.</p>
<p>So when you get two really small nuclei and smash them close enough (to overcome the e-m forces and engage the strong force) they crash into each other, sticking together and giving off a lot of energy. Fusion.</p>
<p>In a really big nucleus, the nucleons are spread out enough that nucleons on one side don't really pull on the ones on the far side. They're not very stable; and fall apart fairly easily. In smaller nuclei they're all bunched up a lot closer together - so in a lower energy state. Kind of like how if you have a really big pile of (magnetic) marbles, the pile will be unstable; throw a marble in at a high speed and marbles will go everywhere; and the resulting piles will be smaller, but stabler (lower average height, so lower energy state). Fission.</p>
<p>So with fission we have to put energy in (the first marble) to overcome the strong force a bit and break the nucleus up (scatter the marbles) but when they re-clump they do so at a more stable, lower energy state (on average, closer together), so give off energy.</p>
<p>It's a bit more complicated than that, obviously, but then this is ELI5, not askscience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems like a good place for this fun fact: </p>
<p>The nucleus of a Carbon-12 has 12 nucleons: 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Correspondingly, it has a mass of exactly 12 atomic mass units, or AMU. This is because the AMU is defined as 1/12 the mass of a Carbon-12 atom.</p>
<p>Notice that 1 AMU is not defined as the mass of one proton or neutron. Because of nuclear binding energy, 1 AMU is actually slightly less than the mass of either nucleon. If you take a C-12 atom apart, the nucleons have more mass than the original atom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the weight of a single proton or neutron isn't constant but dependent on how many bonds it forms? Is it possible to say a proton has x gramms when it's alone and y gramms when it's part of a Carbon-atom for example?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes ish. It's not about how many bonds, per se, but about how it's being acted on by nuclear forces. This level of physics is a bit beyond my depth, but my understanding is that the nuclear strong force does really weird stuff, including causing some conversion between mass and energy. But it only works at very short ranges, which is why this occurs in nuclear bonding but not the chemical (valence electron) bonding you studied in chem class.</p>
<p>I may get corrected about the nuclear physics, but your end statement is correct. Protons and neutrons have a different mass when free than when tied up in a nucleus.</p></div>		</li>
