			<div class="markdown"><p>It also matters how unique the information is. Birthday dates can be hard because you have to remember new dates all the time, and you probably have a lot of birthdays to remember to begin with. The dates all feel similar, because they are, and you don't have much else to tie the data to, making them difficult to remember.</p>
<p>You remember the atomic weight of cobalt because it was so specific. Your brain has probably tied together the rather unique pieces of information together, making it easy to remember: Ghostbusters, cobalt (not unheard of, easy to remember name of), and the number. </p>
<p>You wouldn't have remembered it if they mentioned the weight of cobalt, mercury, gold and led in a science classroom that you attended weekly that always had that type of information tied to it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My COD4 key remembered since 8 years, it’s the clearest memory I can vision, branded into me.
I never studied it, just installed it a couple of times on LANs.</p>
<p>Yet I can’t remember my mother’s/fathers/brothers birthday.
I can’t even recall the 12 months in right order.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's been a lot of discussion already but one thing with dates is that they all blend together. If one's friend birthday was a precise scotch and the other friend's birthday was the Everest mountain, you'd remember which is which. But instead you have to remember dates for your appointments, dates for work or school, birthdays, etc.</p>
<p>Also, just thinking about JEEG is probably enough to trigger the memory of the rest. Thinking about May or about 12 is not enough to trigger the eat because it could be whatever.</p>
<p>I also have imprinted memories from a young age. My first computer had a Pentium II 300 MHz processor of the SL2W8 series. I can still see it being written on the processor. These were under clock 450 MHz processors because Intel had not produced enough of the 300 MHz, and were therefore easy to overclock. Not a year pass though where I don't remind myself of that noe useless information.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My dad and I are like walking encyclopedias because of this. </p></div>		</li>
