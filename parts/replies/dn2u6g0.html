<p>Do you have a standard dilution protocol for each sample? If so, do you ever get surprised by the amount of heat in a sample?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes I will get a brief description of the sample but I've never had a &quot;this should be 24,000SHU&quot; I've learned from experience what each sample typically is from looks, or I taste a little raw.</p>
<p>I will do my testing knowing the values, and one I have come to a conclusion, I will ask a colleague to do a blind taste of my sample.</p>
<p>&quot;The hottest&quot; comes in 3 categories,
Raw chili was around 150,000SHU,
Spice blend/sauce was a lot lower around 80,000.
Extract was a dizzying 22,000,000SHU, but would only be used as a flavouring, never raw.</p>
<p>Yes the method is standardised, so samples are broken off into heat categories, then the dilutions are listed per category.</p>
<p>And I definitely have been caught out, the 22,000,000 was labelled as a sauce not an extract, so I prepped it assuming it would be max 100,000. I did not like that client for a few days after that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would an HPLC test be expensive? If you have standards it seems like a basic case of setting a calibration curve, running your sample, and checking the result. What am I missing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes we do! </p>
<p>I make a solution up that has no capsicum in, and one that has juuuust enough to be detected. </p>
<p>If both are tested positive or negative, the test is delayed by a few days. Or a warm 5% sucrose solution can swilled round the mouth to cleanse the pallet.</p>
<p>Reasons for negative are colds and eating a lot of dairy in the morning.</p>
<p>Reasons for positive are if something spicy has been eaten that morning, or sometimes even the night before.</p>
<p>I do get funny looks when I say I need to calibrate someone's tastebuds for a blind taste test.</p></div>		</li>
