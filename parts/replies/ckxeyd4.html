			<div class="markdown"><p>That's certainly part of it. Aerosolised ebola <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak_(film\)" target="_blank">is the stuff of medical horror films</a>!</p>
<p>Also it survives poorly outside the body (although there are contradicting voices on this topic). Check out the /r/science Ebola megathread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aerosolised ebola  is also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reston_virus" target="_blank">highly speculated</a>, kindof. </p>
<p>Reston is very interesting, as it is essentially the sum of our worst fears; an Ebola strain that can be passed through the air*, that found a home just outside of Washington DC. Thankfully however it is non-pathogenic to humans, despite it's stunning similarities with other Ebolavirus species. </p>
<p>There is little doubt that the big evil is out there somewhere.. I just hope not to be around when some unlucky soul stumbled upon it. </p>
<p>* Disclaimer: as far as I am aware, this has not been proven to any scientific rigor, as testing Ebola in such a way is in breach of the Biological Weapons Convention, thusly we only have evidence from the initial outbreak point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a nice paper that compared ZEBOV, REBOV and MARV with regards of their survivability in air under various circumstances:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20553340" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20553340</a></p>
<p>From the discussion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The infectious dose of filoviruses, via the aerosol route, in nonhuman primates (reviewed in Leffel and Reed 2004) and in susceptible mice (M.S. Lever, personal communication), is very low. Such data, obtained from experimental animal models, combined with the aerosol decay rates determined in this study, would suggest that filovirus, at infectious levels, may remain a potential aerosol threat for at least one and a half hours. Epidemiological evidence, however, would suggest that during outbreaks, filoviruses are rarely transmitted by the airborne route.</p>
<p>The lower decay rate observed for REBOV in our study may support observations made during the original outbreak in captive primates and subsequent studies where airborne transmission may be involved in the spread of filoviruses (Jaax et al. 1995; Johnson et al. 1995 and Jahrling et al. 1996). The ZEBOV and MARV used in the studies are from human clinical isolates, whereas REBOV is nonpathogenic in humans. This might suggest that the factors that cause a decrease in virulence in humans also contribute to an increase in aerostability. In the future, sequence analysis, protein structural information and characterization of protein expression from the filoviruses after aerosolization may yield further insight into the survival characteristics of the viruses.</p>
<p>This study has shown that human pathogenic filoviruses may survive in an aerosol in the dark to detectable levels for at least 1Ã†5 h. If filoviruses were deliberately (Borio et al. 2002; Leffel and Reed 2004), or accidentally aerosolized during normal laboratory or clinical practices (Dimmick et al. 1973; Bennett and Parks 2006), they may pose a significant threat to humans, as they are able to remain infectious over a significant period of time. The results presented in this study are able to provide basic survival data on which hazard management, risk assessments, decontamination and control measures can be implemented to help prevent infection and transmission of disease.</p>

<p>Edit: Sorry, yielding acronyms like there's no tomorrow:</p>
<p>ZEBOV = Zaire Ebola Virus (the strain of this outbreak and the most deadly)</p>
<p>REBOV = Reston Ebola Virus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reston_virus" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reston_virus</a></p>
<p>MARV = Marburg Virus, a close relative. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marburg_virus" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marburg_virus</a></p></div>		</li>
