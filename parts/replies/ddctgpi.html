			<div class="markdown"><p>this is what we saw happen this go around. very low turnout, yet the undesirable candidate was still able to take it. timed false media campaigns as well as misinformation fed to actual media sources caused the election to look like it would be a landslide victory for one politician(that not many people really wanted anyway due to some facts but also a lot of lies) making a lot of potential voters say, &quot;ah hell, I don't even have to vote for her and she will still win. cool, I don't wanna really vote for her anyway.&quot; meanwhile the other supporters are hearing false reports of massive voter fraud in clinton's favor, so they rally the troops and all vote, a few of them multiple times, leading to the only real voter fraud(that was found anyway) this go around. this type of &quot;propaganda&quot; is truly toxic. </p></div>		</li>
