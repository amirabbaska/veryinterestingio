			<div class="markdown"><p>And since the rocket tanks are about the same thickness as a soda can, they actually need a little bit of pressure to prevent a vacuum within the tank, so it doesn't collapse as it consumes fuel (like sucking the juice out of a juice box).</p>
<p>There are a couple ways to pressurize a rocket tank. Autogenously pressurized tanks use the gas from boiling oxidizer to pressurize the tank itself. However, most rockets have small helium tanks that pressurize the tank with helium as the rocket consumes fuel and oxidizer. Helium is used because it is extremely good at pressurizing tanks, it expands to fill a container very rapidly with very little gas. The downside is that it is expensive.</p>
<p>So there is a spread of solutions that can potentially be used instead of helium to help bring the cost down. One trick is to use something other than helium, nitrogen for example. Nitrogen is less effective at expanding, and performance is lower when used to pressurize tanks.</p>
<p>Then we have other solutions, like having a giant cylinder/piston at the top of the tank, push down as fuel and oxidizer is consumed. So the volume of the tank is variable, there is no subsequent pressure delta (i.e. vacuum) created during fuel consumption. I'm not sure if pistons have ever been used, but it's a cool concept. Maybe small, low performance rockets use them. They're a relatively heavy and complicated solution.</p>
<p>If you really want to squeeze as much performance out of your helium, you also have the option to heat it. So you can do more expansion with less helium.</p>
<p>Rocket tanks are kept at about 1 to 2 atmospheres of pressure. Since their walls are so thin, a lot of their strength comes from tank pressure. Bi-propellant rockets are basically big balloons.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/c5qEJncn8Ms?t=29" target="_blank">Here is a video</a> of an essentially empty, but pressurized, rocket exploding. It basically just 'pops.' The little fireball is what leftover smidgen of fuel is left in the thing. Most of that explosion is from the pressurized tanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of - in an environment with both liquid and gas phases, the temperature is basically stuck at the boiling point of the liquid at that pressure until the liquid is gone (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram#/media/File%3APhase-diag2.svg" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram#/media/File%3APhase-diag2.svg</a>).  The whole system is then at the vapor pressure of the material at that temperature - this is how your air conditioner works. (Source: certified HVAC technician).</p></div>		</li>
