			<p>Which explains the long time it took to film. Should have added that to my original answer I guess. Project I worked on myself had a much shorter deadline and to make sure all the footage was there, they ended up having to fake 4-5 shots in the entire movie. <br><br>Planet Earth is on a whole other level when compared to most documentaries and nature movies. </p>		</li>
