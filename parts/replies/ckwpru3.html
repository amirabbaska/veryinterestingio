			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to be immortal thanks to time dilation.  Travel to a star 1 billion light years away at 99.99999999% the speed of light and.... Damn I'll actually do this calculation....  It will only take 14,000 years.   There, instead of dying a little less than a billion years before you reach the destination, you will only be dead for around 13,920 years before you reach the destination. Assuming you live to be 80 and launched as soon as you were born. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just being sarcastic and not implying that you would actually survive that... That's why I said you would &quot;only&quot; die 13920 years before reaching your destination (relative to your clock) where someone on earth would see you die much further from your destination in both space and time.  To survive the 1 billion light year journey, you would just need to add some more zeroes to the given fraction of the speed of light, but my calculator can't handle that and I'm too lazy to do by hand.  Essentially you would feel like you lived a normal length of time, and also your &quot;body&quot; clock should be totally in sync with the ship clock , where the time dilation is fully accounted for by the fact that your trip takes 14000 years as opposed to 1000000000+ years relative to the earths frame.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The operative statement here is 'faster than the speed of light'. First off it is an impossible situation since you and whatever you are traveling in have mass and thus cannot travel at that speed. Also, your speed has to be relative to a given point. In this case it will be Earth, your implied starting point. </p>
<p>But if you could travel faster than light, you may have a different problem. My physics may be broken here - please correct me if I am wrong. But it is a fun thing to think about. </p>
<p>As you approach the speed of light time slows down for you relative to an independent observer. This is time dilation, which you have read about elsewhere in this discussion. It is best reflected in the twin paradox, a twin gets in a spaceship and travels at 0.9999999999999999999 times the speed of light. The other twin stays put. The first twin travels for a year, realizes there is no reddit in space, then turns around and returns to Earth. One year up, one year down traveling at the same velocity. That twin will get quite a shock returning to Earth - the other twin is long dead as is human civilization and possibly even reddit. Depending on how many decimal places you go, time on Earth will be magnitudes of order longer than your 2 year experience. </p>
<p>The faster you move, the more time slows down if measured against a reference point. Things get more interesting if you move at the speed of light. At that point, time slows down to nothing - from your perspective you reach your destination at the same time you leave. Relative to another observer moving at a slower velocity your journey would have a beginning and an end - but to you cause and effect are not separate events. As a result, from your perspective you would reach the star at exactly the moment you leave, and you would die a quick fiery and radioactive death inside a star. Because you travel at the speed of light, you arrive at the star in the same state you observed it. By then, your mass would be something near infinite compared to when you started (I wince when writing 'when'), so there would be a lot to burn. Of course, adding all this fuel to the star may impact its longevity and quality of supernova, so in this case you have changed the future event and it may have disappeared before you observed it. </p>
<p>If you move faster than light - as this commenter suggested, things get really weird and hard to calculate. This is an impossible situation for a number of reasons, you would never actually reach your destination in space and time because now time moves backwards for you. You arrive at the star before you observed it. I really don't know what has happened to your mass at this point but I assume it is not good for you. </p>
<p>As an aside, this is already happening but in the opposite direction, if you consider the expansion rate of space you are already moving at faster than the speed of light from the perspective of the star as you read these words, but in the opposite direction. In this case it is not you in motion so much as the space in between. </p></div>		</li>
