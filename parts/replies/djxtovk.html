			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not entirely true. As a creative person many of my most successful efforts came when not focusing on the task at hand. Yet when I was doing nothing, sleeping, driving to work, or busy doing something else the solution I was seeking just popped in my head and I had to stop whatever I was doing and go write it down so I would not forget. Sometimes that other unrelated task I was doing turned out to be the solution to what the problem I was trying to solve. For example putting up paneling could be the solution that involved rather than render a complex perspective image in a 2D program, layer a 2D image on a 3D model.</p></div>		</li>
