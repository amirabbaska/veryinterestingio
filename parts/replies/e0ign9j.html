<p>What evidence is there that the information is stored in the networks and not in the cells that are connected by the networks? </p></div>		</li>

<p>In both cases the cells in the brain that would be responsible for &quot;storing&quot; memories are either moved or completely eliminated, and yet their behavior proves that the memories are retained. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neurons have no mechanism that we know of to store information within themselves. They either undergo depolarisation it they don't. Depolarisation is a very brief action, not persistent at all and is completely reversible within a hundredth of a second (sometimes much less than that). </p>
<p>The precise times at which the neuron depolarises (you could say it 'fires') are determined by things like its inputs from other cells, the surrounding chemistry of the tissue (some neurotransmitters increase firing rates and others tend to decrease them) and other factors like oxygen, glucose, caffeine and stuff.</p>
<p>Most of those factors are not related to learning - caffeine, for example, might help you learn but it isn't the basis of memory storage. Same with oxygen and glucose.</p>
<p>Since the cell itself has no mechanism to store memories - we know this because we've looked in tiny tiny detail at lots of cells from lots of brain regions in lots of species at lots of times during the learning process and there is nothing we can identify that looks like it holds memories or which changes in a way that correlates to memories - and, since the synaptic connections between neurons do change in ways that correlate with memory, that's where we believe memories are stored.</p>
<p>There just doesn't seem to be a place within brain cells themselves that could store memories. It's tempting to think that, since there are so many cells, maybe they act like the memory units in a computer. But that's not how it appears to work. </p>
<p>There have been lots of proposals for how memory is stored but none have withstood close scrutiny except the idea of selectively reinforcing synaptic pathways through repeated activation of neural networks. </p>
<p>It's not fully understood yet but memory storage seems to be to do with the connections between the cells and the way cells interact in large circuits rather than individually.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wonder if there'll ever be this kind of attack one day on the distant future (no longer shoulder-surfing for a PIN, but brain surfing to ascertain metadata about the length/complexity). I guess it would still be encoded by the individuals 'neural uniqueness'</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I certainly agree, but what about the neuromechanics/biomechanics that drive these processes; these are important subjects regarding how the brain and body functions. The explanation of neurobiology/neurology/neuroscience of the mind and how it is fine tuned is lacking an actual physical mechanism that explains how the brain is capable of functioning at the speed it does, while carrying out homeostatic functions, while allowing for both conscious and reflexive behaviors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biomechanics is outside my sphere, but these are good questions. I don't know how many of the answers are known at this time, but it's a field in which every answered question seems to raise about three new questions.</p>
<p>Complicating factor: if you want to study consciousness you have to define it first, and last I checked there was no agreed-upon definition. Do chimps have conscious thoughts/behaviors? What about macaques? What about non-primates? Rats, mice, songbirds? etc. Where's the dividing line and what is it? In contrast, the dividing line between species in which it is or isn't possible, affordable, and morally acceptable to do optogenetics and/or virally-mediated CRISPR/Cas manipulation is a lot more clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You bring up an interesting point; and of course there is no consensus in its definition, yet consciousness is less abstract than simply focusing on the mind within itself. This is opinion only, but I'd argue most if all animals are conscious to some extent, yet humans and primates are capable of complete and conscious control of their movements when performing purposeful activity/motions. At the same time, humans have the ability to unconsciously perform consciously learned tasks within a given arousal range. </p>
<p>We can drive cars for 15 minutes w/o paying close attention until there is a direct need to pay attention. During these moments, the mind wanders, sometimes seemingly timeless, as we move from point A to point B, for whatever reason. We know the mind can have physical, and permanent effects on the physical structure of the brain, neurons, and neuroendocrinology. </p>
<p>Consciousness is a structure/is limited between species, yet is capable of expanding via learning novel tasks; physically, a given species is capable of a given task as a result of their biomechanical/anatomical structure. Unfortunately, a dividing line is next to impossible to draw; drawing one will require crossing legal lines. In order to ever get to the thruth, science in itself cannot be concerned with ethics; yet this is necessary to avoid exploitation of subjects. The mechanics, or possibibly quantum mechanics of genetic mutation/genetic modulation/expression (and epigenetics) must be studied to advance current understanding of the brain, and mind.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>tl;dr: My spelling and grammar is horrendous, but I generally rely on computers to fix that for me.</p>
<p>Don't forget AI and machine learning!  It, as far as I know is the closest we have come to replicating biological neural networks.</p>
<p>To try and explain the sheer scale of the problem, I have an analogy that might fit for understanding these problems.  It's not 100% accurate, but it helps.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a large fish tank filled with marbles. Take a glass of water and pour it directly in the center of the tank.  The water is going to take hundreds of paths between those marbles but one path will get to the bottom of the tank first..  Every marble that is touched by any bit of water gets a score of +1.  When the first bit of water reaches the bottom, the goal has been achieved and any additional +1 points for each marble stops at that instant and the rest of the water settles to the bottom of the tank.</p>
<p>So, take another glass of water and pour it in a different part of your contianer of marbles.  Play the same game: Give each marble a +1 of it gets touched by water. Stop the count when the first path between those marbles reaches the bottom of the tank.</p>
<p>Assume for a second, that the &quot;score&quot; of each marble improves the attraction of water to itself.  By the 10th or 15th glass of water poured on random places of the tank, you have started to establish an optimum path for water to eventually end up at the bottom of the tank, regardless of where it is poured.</p>
<p>Now, let's go back to the old phrase of &quot;stimulus-reponse&quot;.  The glass of water is the stimulus.  Poke two random holes in the bottom of said fish tank.  One produces a negative biochemical reaction and the other, a positive one.</p>
<p>Every time a glass of water is poured into the tank, one of two results are going to (maybe) happen.  The water will hit the negative side first: Game over.  Subtract 1 from each marble that the water touched.  Positive side: You win!  Add an additional 1 to each marble the water touched.</p>
<p>Eventually, you will find the quickest route to the most rewarding experience, given enough glasses of water.</p>
<p>The +1/-1 scores are the extreme over-simplification of the different chemical responses the brain has on a global scale.  Each marble can be considered a neuron.</p>
<p>You can get extremely detailed with this analogy: What is the composition of each neuron?  What surface defects does each marble have that would deflect water a different direction?  How many times has that neuron gotten a +1/-1 score that would bias it's &quot;decision&quot; on how the water flows around it?  Infinate possibilities.</p>
<p>Hope this helped.  It was not intended to be biologically accurate but a description of the scale of the problem.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes. I know. This is prone to error and thousands of different conditions. The problem:  How do you develop a  simple  neural network? Positive/negative reinforcement.  How many times do you want to remember an experience or simply forget it?</p>
<p>Edit2: This accounts for the speed issue as each neuron acts independently based on it's previous &quot;experience&quot;.  Also, imagine that the brain has billions of neurons that are still connected to every other neural pathway.  Simultaneous actions are still accounted for by each stimuli and this fish tank analogy only accounts for a few hundred neurons.</p></div>		</li>
