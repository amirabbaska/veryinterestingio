This has an exponential effect on future flu vaccine effectiveness and spread of the virus in general. 10% saves a lot of lives over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no clue about this stuff so I'm just speculating/asking, but wouldn't vaccinating against flu strains also cause an evolutionary incentive for the strains encountering the vaccinated people's immunesystem to evolve/mutate to survive? I'm not sure I'm formulating it correctly, but maybe you understood what I was trying to ask?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>quite a few of these virii arent native to human hosts. if its prefered host is livestock or monkeys for example and a human infestation is an opportunistic accident... then eliminating human hosts wont be a problem for the virus. </p>
<p>as for creating an evolutionary incentive to evolve/mutate to survive... thats what it already does. thats why we have so many strains of flu out there and each one is trying to make a breakout. the vaccination is a combination of 3-4 vaccines for each of strains most likely to break out. thats why some years there will be articles suggesting that the flu vaccine this or that year sucks and doesnt work. its because the CDC wasnt able to predict which strains were on the up and up and instead a different strain is making the breakout. </p></div>		</li>
