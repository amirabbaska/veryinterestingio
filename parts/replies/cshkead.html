<p>F= GmM/d2 G is a gravitational constant m is mass of object M is mass of planet d is the distance between the two center of masses.</p>

<p>Is there a way to apply this equation to non object/planetary object gravitational forces? I'm guessing one would just make M the bigger thing and m the littler one in general?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually doesn't matter either way, the force on you is the same as the force on the planet. The difference is that the force against you is going to cause much more acceleration: F/m=a. You put a small mass like you in there, you get big acceleration from that force. You put a fat-mass in there like the Earth and you get almost no acceleration at all.</p>
<p>Never let anybody tell you you don't make a difference. Even the Earth moves beneath your feet.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two answers to this, and they are both yes. </p>
<p>In high school physics, you would ask &quot;What is the gravitational force between two <em>objects</em>?&quot;, and you use the objects' masses in that equation. But where do you measure the distance from, and where is the force applied? The answer to both questions is the center of mass, which is the weighted average of the location of all of the mass in the object.</p>
<p>The other answer is that chunks of matter aren't the objects you are looking at, but instead <em>fundamental particles</em> (electrons, quarks, etc) making up the chunks of matter are. For the two masses you would use fundamental particle masses, you measure between and the forces apply to where the particles will be when they interact, and to get the interaction between two chunks of matter you just add up all of the particle-particle interactions. </p>
<p>The second picture is a more accurate description of gravity, but our experience with gravity mostly deals with objects (chunks of matter rather than clouds), as well as things that are either much further away than they are big (orbits) or one of the objects is much smaller (You on the earth). In those cases, the first picture of gravity is a very good approximation as well as much easier to calculate, so we use it a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of your explanation of the center of mass is incorrect.  If you split an object in half with a plane it wont always be right where you cut.  Inhomogeneous objects are quite common.</p></div>		</li>
