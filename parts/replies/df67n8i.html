<p><a href="https://www.fcwa.org/story_of_water/html/costs.htm" target="_blank">Average cost of a gallon of water: ~ $0.0015</a> (That's .15 cents, not 15 cents!)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.premierh2o.com/blogs/news/37679553-how-much-water-is-wasted-waiting-for-water-to-warm-up" target="_blank">Average amount of water wasted, waiting for the water to get warm: 11,000 gallons anually</a> (Based on using hot water from a &quot;cold start&quot;, 10 times per day)</p>
<p>Now we just need to do a bit of math to find the break even point.</p>
<p>If you want to pay for the $65 dollar difference between the cheap shower knob and the temperature sensitive knob, you need to use:</p>
<p>65/.0015 = 43,333 gallons of water.</p>
<p>Recall that 11,000 gallons of water per year are wasted by the normal, cheap knob. </p>
<p>43,333/11,000 = ~4 years </p>
<p>This is the time it would take to save $65 at .0015 cents per gallon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The more expensive knob wouldn't save any money. The water wasted from your link is when you first turn on the shower and you're waiting for the hot water to reach the shower, not when you're trying to find a comfortable temperature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's cheaper for the builder, who doesn't give a crap about your water bill. He cares about the bottom-line profit of building the house and selling it to the consumer. If the consumer is worried about their water bill then they can install a fancy valve. Hence, 'builder grade'.</p></div>		</li>
