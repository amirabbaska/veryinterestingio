			<div class="markdown"><p>That was as good an answer as it's possible to have in a less-than-book-length format.  Since I'm poor and can't Gild you, let me just leave this comment for everyone else saying I've read Richard Rhodes masterpiece &quot;The Making of the Atomic Bomb&quot; multiple times, and this is as clear and accurate an answer as you could want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I like the shows and books that showcase the technological race for the Bomb, one of the reason I love Rhodes is that he doesn't shy away from the ethical conundrum.  He shows, for example, a gradual escalation in &quot;acceptable targets&quot; over the course of the two world wars.  Chemists in WWI were creating poisonous gas under the argument that &quot;if it ends the war faster, it will ultimately save lives.&quot;  At the beginning of WWII, the idea of directly attacking civilian populations as a legitimate tactic was unthinkable.  By the end of the war, it was inevitable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went on this tour 4 or 5 years ago, and it's just fascinating.  At the time I went it was free, hosted by the US Dept. of Energy.  The emphasis is on the remediation of the Hanford site (the vitrification facility, low-level and high-level waste storage areas, etc.), but the most interesting item is by far the B Reactor.  Just incredible that this reactor was operated with no computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned, this is a great tour. I just wish it wasn't so far from the greater Seattle area, and the tours didn't start so early. When I took the tour a couple years ago, I drove in the night before and stayed at a hotel. I should do it again soon.</p>
<p>Oh and if you find yourself coming or going from the West, stop by the wind farm on Whiskey Dick Mountain (yes, it's actually named that) and check out the mills. It's pretty awesome. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Turing's Cathedral by George Dyson also takes a great look into how the Manhattan Project drove the development of early computing and vice versa. A bit off topic but a very intriguing read I'd recommend to anyone interested in the history of computing or even just the Manhattan Project.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the most important information that the Soviets stole via spying was <em>What didn't work</em>. It allowed the Soviet political officials in charge of the program approve or deny projects proposed by their scientists while simultaneously limited who had access to knowledge / who knew that the Soviets were stealing secrets from the allies. This allowed them to build up nuclear expertise at an accelerated rate and not be held back by simply following some blueprint without understanding the technology.</p>
<p>David Holloway has a good write up on it in &quot;Stalin and the Bomb&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not according to Richard Rhodes in <em>Dark Sun</em>. The Soviets got the idea for an implosion-style plutonium weapon directly via espionage -- detailed information from Klaus Fuchs and less detailed but still corroborating information from David Greenglass. Of course, the Soviet bomb program leadership still wanted their scientists and engineers to verify that the information acquired via espionage was correct.</p>
<p>I literally just finished reading <em>Dark Sun</em> two days ago, so the info is still fresh in my mind :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two reasoning aren't mutually exclusive. Holloway simply points out that the political climate of the Soviet Union prevented the free flow of ideas, as knowledge was power and if you were the only one who knew something you might be safe from a purge. Thus the Soviets couldn't say &quot;Here is the blueprints for a bomb, build this&quot; it had to be &quot;Yes, I approve of your project (that is close to what the Americans did that worked&quot; or &quot;No, I don't think this version is promising, maybe tweak it a little in this direction.&quot; This allowed them to build up the expertise to produce their own version of the Hydrogen bomb in very short order even after the U.S. had basically purged its ranks of anyone even vaguely suspected of being a commie spy. Interestingly, the Soviet Union actually beat the United States to a <em>usable</em> hydrogen bomb. The US bomb was much more powerful, but also so large that it couldn't be air dropped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first Soviet bomb was an almost identical copy of the Fat Man bomb.  They stole thousands of pages of documents on the American efforts via an elaborate espionage network, though it wasn't until after the Japanese that they actually really started looking through them.</p>
<p>The is a fantastic 3-part BBC doco called &quot;Red Bomb&quot; that covers in great depth, the development of the soviet nuclear program.  </p>
<p>Edit: Found it. Part 1 is here:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. As I mentioned, the very existence of nuclear fission had only been discovered about 8 years earlier. It's a remarkable achievement. In a way you can blame the Nazis for that. Because their policies and militarism drove many of the finest physicists out of Europe and to the US and the UK, while at the same time being such a huge threat to the world that it caused the largest economy of the world to throw blank checks at the nuclear bomb problem based off of only a hint that the Nazis might be working on it as well.</p></div>		</li>
