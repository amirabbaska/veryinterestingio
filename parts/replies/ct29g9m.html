			<p>While I like the shows and books that showcase the technological race for the Bomb, one of the reason I love Rhodes is that he doesn't shy away from the ethical conundrum.  He shows, for example, a gradual escalation in &quot;acceptable targets&quot; over the course of the two world wars.  Chemists in WWI were creating poisonous gas under the argument that &quot;if it ends the war faster, it will ultimately save lives.&quot;  At the beginning of WWII, the idea of directly attacking civilian populations as a legitimate tactic was unthinkable.  By the end of the war, it was inevitable.</p>		</li>

All were in some way considered to be able to shorten wars ormprevent them alltogether.

			<p>It's extremely narrow-minded to attribute that exclusively to nuclear weapons.  I think the explosive growth of democracy and increased living standards in the 20th century might possibly be having an effect.  <br><br>Even from a military standpoint, the lack of a war between superpowers has a whole lot more to do with the supremacy of the US Navy and Air Force than it does with nuclear arms. <br><br>It's also making the subjective distinction between &quot;direct&quot; war and &quot;major power.&quot;  I doubt the millions of Afghans and Vietnamese that fought and died in Cold War proxy wars or the millions that fought and died in the Iran-Iraq war cared about those sort of distinctions.   </p>		</li>

			<p>I also went on this tour about a year ago, and it is probably the best tour I will ever take in my life.<br><br>The tour guides where all retired volunteers who worked on and around the plant. The 30+ minute drive to the site was spent with a man giving a geologic rundown of the area and why it was chosen as the location of the reactor. Everything from the formation of the region, how it was carved through the ice ages, to it's current relative stability. And this man spoke, even after a lifetime of work in the field, with such passion on what many might be a mundane subject. Nearly all the guides taught with similar love for the history of the project.<br><br>When you go in, it's I credibly well preserved, and almost all of it is just roped off, not behind glass at all. You can reach out and touch nearly everything there is (though you shouldn't touch, and I didn't, but you can get up very close and examine it all you like). Gasmasks, tools, turbines, buttons and control systems, it's all open to you.<br><br>And it's so well preserved, as though it where still up and running, but all the people running it left for lunch and you're getting a tour. There's all this original signage, there was even an ash tray with a matchbook sitting on it from the 1940s.<br><br>And the reactor itself is awe-inspiring. It's rises like this massive obelisk, a 70 foot cube of solid graphite, fed cooling water by hundreds of huge high power pumps.<br><br>The B reactor is unreal, so wildly different than anything else that's ever been built. If you ever have the chance to see it and learn about it, seize the opportunity.</p>		</li>

			<p>Interestingly, the most important information that the Soviets stole via spying was <em>What didn't work</em>. It allowed the Soviet political officials in charge of the program approve or deny projects proposed by their scientists while simultaneously limited who had access to knowledge / who knew that the Soviets were stealing secrets from the allies. This allowed them to build up nuclear expertise at an accelerated rate and not be held back by simply following some blueprint without understanding the technology.<br><br>David Holloway has a good write up on it in &quot;Stalin and the Bomb&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Interestingly, the most important information that the Soviets stole via spying was What didn't work.<br><br>Not according to Richard Rhodes in <em>Dark Sun</em>. The Soviets got the idea for an implosion-style plutonium weapon directly via espionage -- detailed information from Klaus Fuchs and less detailed but still corroborating information from David Greenglass. Of course, the Soviet bomb program leadership still wanted their scientists and engineers to verify that the information acquired via espionage was correct.<br><br>I literally just finished reading <em>Dark Sun</em> two days ago, so the info is still fresh in my mind :)</p>		</li>

			<p>The two reasoning aren't mutually exclusive. Holloway simply points out that the political climate of the Soviet Union prevented the free flow of ideas, as knowledge was power and if you were the only one who knew something you might be safe from a purge. Thus the Soviets couldn't say &quot;Here is the blueprints for a bomb, build this&quot; it had to be &quot;Yes, I approve of your project (that is close to what the Americans did that worked&quot; or &quot;No, I don't think this version is promising, maybe tweak it a little in this direction.&quot; This allowed them to build up the expertise to produce their own version of the Hydrogen bomb in very short order even after the U.S. had basically purged its ranks of anyone even vaguely suspected of being a commie spy. Interestingly, the Soviet Union actually beat the United States to a <em>usable</em> hydrogen bomb. The US bomb was much more powerful, but also so large that it couldn't be air dropped.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Rockets that are designed to fail and explode maybe. To shoot a  large rocket at something accurately with a payload, you need some pretty sophisticated physics, chemistry, and materials sciences. Add humans on top, and it's an even bigger problem if it blows up on the way. Add landing somewhere like the moon and being able to take off and come back without dying, and you'll see why it's called rocket science not fireworks science.</p>		</li>

			<p>Indeed. As I mentioned, the very existence of nuclear fission had only been discovered about 8 years earlier. It's a remarkable achievement. In a way you can blame the Nazis for that. Because their policies and militarism drove many of the finest physicists out of Europe and to the US and the UK, while at the same time being such a huge threat to the world that it caused the largest economy of the world to throw blank checks at the nuclear bomb problem based off of only a hint that the Nazis might be working on it as well.</p>		</li>
