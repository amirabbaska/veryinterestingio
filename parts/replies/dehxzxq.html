			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup - me too. I remember spending an afternoon as a kid licking and sticking strips of them into the booklets. One of those jobs that, as a kid, seems like it'll be great fun until you get to the third page and your tongue's fucked and there's still shitloads of stamps and it's not fun any more.</p>
<p>And the funny machine sitting over the till in the local supermarket that'd magically spit out the right number of stamps. I was very disappointed to find out they <em>weren't</em> magic, and there was a button just out of sight the cashier was pressing. </p>
<p>I was similarly upset to find out that brushing with Colgate didn't make a magic glowing halo appear round you, like in the ads.</p>
<p>Man, childhood was just one disappointment after another.</p>
<p>But yeah, Green Shield stamps</p></div>		</li>
