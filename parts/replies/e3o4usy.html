It won't catabolize that much muscle tissue unless its extreme deficit though because fat is easier for the kidneys to process. Plus after awhile of calorie restriction your muscles become more efficient and will look more full with carbs/sodium. With less sodium and carbs you are always going to look flatter/leaner but you are losing more water weight than muscle mass. This is why whey protein and creatine sell so much, they help you retain water and make your muscles look fuller.</p></div>		</li>
