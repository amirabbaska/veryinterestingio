			<div class="markdown"><p>That's all really good question and as far as I know there is no proper answer to it.</p>
<p>All we have right now, research wise, is that by observing individuals, hormones only matter when putting on weight, not when losing. When losing only the order which it was gained maters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>best answer, helped me a lot with my goals. been lifting for a while, atm i try to cut some fat off, and realised all I have to do is be persistant and keep consistency and hard work will reward. thats all. Because the first fat thats going to go off of me is the one i put on last. So if i wanna take off the fat that has been on me since i was 15(im 23 now) then I have to work and be patient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best comment in the thread in my opinion. Definitely should be further up. To piggyback off this, fats, proteins and carbohydrates are synonymously being used as fuel sources but certain fuel sources are being used to a greater extent depending on the intensity and duration of an exercise. Lower intensity and longer duration exercises are predominant by fats while higher intensity and shorter durations mainly use carbohydrates as  the fuel source. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the kind word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll add something to what you just said, which is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Carbohydrate molecule example:</strong></p>
<p>C^12 H^22 O^11 (45 atoms molecule) </p>
<p>( If you remember from school, it reads, 12 atoms of Carbon, 22 atoms of Hydrogen and 11 atoms of oxygen )</p>
<p><strong>A Fat molecule example:</strong></p>
<p>C^18 H^34 O^2 (54 atoms molecule)</p>
<p><strong>Glucose molecule is:</strong></p>
<p>C^6 H^12 O^6 (24 atoms molecule)</p>
<p>(Proteins are organs, cells, tissues, these can be huge and very different)</p>
<p><strong>The Fat inside our fat cells are tryglicides, which is</strong> (example)</p>
<p>C^55 H^98 O^6  (159 atoms molecule)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After we eat and our intestines digest our food, there are plenty of C^12 H^22 O^11 and C^18 H^34 O^2 molecules (carbs and fat respectively) which have to be turned into glucose so it can float in our blood and feed our cells. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping it super simple, you can see how breaking C^12 H^22 O^11 into C^6 H^12 O^6 is rather easy. Break the carb once in half and we almost have the glucose molecule.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Fat which is C^18 H^34 O^2 to turn it into C^6 H^12 O^6, is more difficult, we can't break it in 3 because there is not enough oxygen atoms, so it needs to bring oxigen atoms from elsewhere. This process is much slower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why carbs make blood sugar spike, while fat give a more prolonged release. Fats are slower to metabolize (got to wait for those oxygen atoms).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are too many glucose molecules in the blood, our bodies will begin to store them inside the fat cells, this is really important because if it accumulates too many glucose molecules in the blood we can die. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The molecule in which we store energy inside the fat cells, or the &quot;fat&quot; inside the fat cells, is the tryglicides, which is really energetic with about 900 calories p/ 100 grams (This is also where the, you need to burn 9000 calories for each kilogram of fat / 4000 calories for each pound of fat).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>All of these chemical reactions are made on the liver and pancreas.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One issue, how do the molecules move from outside the fat cell to inside. It does so through these &quot;doors&quot; that are on the fat cells. The problem here is that tryglicides at more than 100 atoms long are too big, and it doesn't fit through those doors. So the body has to break it in half, move it inside, then reassemble it. This is when moving inside and outside. This takes time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in your post you mentioned that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lower intensity and longer duration exercises are predominant by fats while higher intensity and shorter durations mainly use carbohydrates as the fuel source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the explanation lie in chemistry. The fat molecules are too damn big to fit in through the door. There is not enough time to disassemble it and get it through the door in a short sprint.</p></div>		</li>
