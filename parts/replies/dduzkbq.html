			<div class="markdown"><p>JS: Whale watches, when conducted appropriately, are a GREAT way to get out and see these magnificent animals in their habitat and observe them feeding and interacting with other animals, but you are correct, if done unethically or inappropriately, it can be detrimental to the animals. For example, if the boats get too close an animal can be injured by the propellers, or the constant close approach pressure from boats results in animals being driven from areas that are good for feeding or breeding. We have worked with our whale watch partners to create WhaleSENSE (<a href="https://whalesense.org/" target="_blank">https://whalesense.org/</a>) to create acceptable whale watch practices, including how close to get, how fast to manuever the boat in and out of the area, getting in front of the animals, cutting off their travel, etc. There are areas of the world that used to hunt marine mammals but have turned to ecotourism efforts to observe and protect them. When done correctly it is a powerful method of raising awareness and protection for the animals.
