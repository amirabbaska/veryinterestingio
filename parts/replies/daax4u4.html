			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort answer ... AI's don't invent anything, that's a false anthropomorphism. The &quot;maker&quot; of the AI is the patent holder. If I write a program that solves some problem, I'm the one who solved the problem even if I couldn't have done what the program did. (indeed, this is why we write such programs!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would I be accurate in saying that you'd agree with this as well?</p>
<p>&quot;obviously this would change if strong general AI existed, because a parent can't claim ownership of what their child creates just because the parent created the child-  but as long as AIs are purpose-built and non-sentient, as they currently are, that's a false equivalence.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, parents are responsible and liable for anything their child does until such an age whence the child is determined to be able to understand and accept responsibility.</p>
<opinion>So too will AI's be the responsibility/liability of the creator until such time as the AI can be determined capable</opinion></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference in the comparison is that children aren't fully created by their parents. Sure their genetic code is taken from their parents', but not only were those DNA fragments not purposefully selected by the parents, the child's life experiences and stimuli are not determined by the parents (except by influence). With AI, the coder has control over all of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As AIs become more intelligent it may no longer be clear that it is a false anthropomorphism. Referring to the star trek episode where data is on trial to determine if he has rights. </p>
<p>For example, if the AI solves problems for which it was not programmed how can the author claim credit? Do your kids achievements belong to you because you created them? Or to your parents for creating you in the first place? What if the AI writes an AI that solves a problem?</p>
<p>Edit: it seems that is was already asked. But if you could touch on the subject of AI individualism that would be appreciated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This question has a pretty easy, simple answer based on current patent law.  If the AI cannot fill out a patent application, which requires name, address, and various pieces of personal information, then the AI cannot submit a request for a patent.  If we live in a world where AI's have full names, addresses, emails, mailboxes etc., then they would already be integrated into society and no one would care that an AI is filling out a patent form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the &quot;maker&quot; of the AI is the patent holder of its inventions, do you think we could see a situation in the future where a small number of companies, who produce AI's with the purpose of invention, have a monopoly on the industry and therefore a monopoly of sorts on patents and inventions?</p></div>		</li>
