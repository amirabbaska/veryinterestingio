			<div class="markdown"><p>Not fully correct. IBM made fine computers and rented them, as a bundle, at a reasonable price.  This was considered a monopoly, and they were required to &quot;unbundle&quot;: to sell (instead of rent) and to permit other organizations to interconnect and service to IBM equipment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure why that contradicts anything I said.</p>
<p>They were required to allow other vendors to compete, yes. If IBM makes the best A widgets, using that monopoly position to force customers to also buy their B widgets is abuse of their monopoly position. Customers should be able to buy IBM's A widgets because they're the best, and a competitors B widgets because IBM sucks at those.</p></div>		</li>
