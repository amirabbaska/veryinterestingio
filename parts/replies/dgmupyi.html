			<div class="markdown"><p>I would just like to say that the information on ssri is not good. The theory on why they work was dropped by the scientists proposing it in the 70s and promptly picked up by marketers. The term SSRI is not a scientific one or classification. It came from the marketing department of SmithKkine Beecham to try and separate it's Paxil from Likys Prozac and pfizers Zoloft. They all adopted it to create the appearance of a new drug class to marginalized older, cheaper, and vastly more effective treatments. </p>
<p>And as a group, they just don't work. After removing the placebo effect they help about 1/10 people taking them. FDA analysis of 100,000 patients. Only 4% got tricyclics. Half of patients had depression. 50% responded to the active drug. 40% responded to placebo.
Cochrane review of depression in general practice: 58% responded to drug while 46% responded on a placebo. Although this itself is biased due to using only published trials, which are far more likely to be positive.

<p>The more conservative estimates from the present analysis found that differences between antidepressants and active placebos were small. This suggests that unblinding effects may inflate the efficacy of antidepressants in trials using inert placebos.

<p>Effects are largely exaggerated by unblinded assessors, which can be easily done on some drugs.

<p>And in this study, active drugs were quite a bit better. But the outcomes were the same if you waited a couple of weeks. So why are these drugs being portrayed as so effective.

<p>Another reason these drugs are seen as so effective when they aren't, is the bias in even publishing papers. About 1/2 of all trials are never published. What would you call it if 1/2 of the data for 1 trial wasn't published? Fraud! Here's just an example how biased or rained the literature is. </p>
<h2>Antidepressant papers  published over two decades of approved drugs were looked at. 12500 patients in 74 trials, with 38 trials showing positive resluts for new drugs.  37/38 + were published -
3/34 not positive were published.  </h2>
<h2>11 of the negative trials were in the literature, but were written as if the drug was a success!  </h2>
<p>So reality is 38+ and 37-, while the literature showed 48+ and 3- trials. Absurd!  </p>
<p>I wish they'd teach things like publication bias, ghostwriting, PR firm infiltration, and more statistical trickery used in med school. I know in the one class we took on how to analyze research completely missed the boat on that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey thanks for this info I wasn't aware! We're generally taught by clinicians at my med school so the info we're given is all based on what's used and how it works, with not a lot on the study evidence behind it</p>
<p>I totally agree on your last point, we have almost no teaching on how to analyse this research effectively so by the time we graduate we're relying on the people trying to sell the drug to give us the info on the research which is obviously not ideal</p>
<p>Unfortunately a lot of the antidepressants have this issue though, with depression still being so poorly understood and the NNT even for the better antidepressants being 7 for SSRIs and 9 for TCAs (supposedly - <a href="http://www.aafp.org/afp/2010/0701/p42.html" target="_blank">http://www.aafp.org/afp/2010/0701/p42.html</a>) not to mention the number needed to harm in these groups being so low, it's a big issue in terms of management - what drug do I use when none of them are great?</p>
<p>I guess this really does show the power of marketing though, I think the most important thing is involving people who know what they're doing early - psychs are great at what they do - and making sure patients are followed up and put on a treatment that works for them, not 'what works for most patients'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So knowing what you know, can you explain the long term concept behind how SSRI are supposed to work?</p>
<p>After the lag period, you start gradually increasing the amount of serotonin in the brain and the patient starts feeling better. Months pass, they've hopefully improved, get off the treatment. </p>
<p>What happens at that point?</p>
<p>The reason I ask is I've read a lot of horror stories online about people who became long term users of various depression treatments and eventually found themselves feeling just as depressed as before starting treatment, except now ending the treatment will put them in a massive depressive episode far worse than anything they'd experience had they not had the treatment in the first place. Can you comment on this? I'm sure there's some misconceptions here but at the same time I just don't hear a lot of success stories with today's depression treatments either. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there's often a bit of a misunderstanding about anti-depressants among doctors and patients alike that they are there to fix the problem entirely. The way we're currently being taught is that anti-depressants are really there to buy time for effective therapy to actually make the real difference. </p>
<p>As you say, eventually the body can become accustomed to the SSRIs and if the issue hasn't been addressed then the depressive symptoms can certainly come back and the SSRIs can lose their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs don't always work for every patient so doctors should be considering whether to switch some of these patients over to second or third line drugs if the SSRIs aren't working because if they're still really depressed then what's the point of having them take the medication at all </p>
<p>Unfortunately a lot of the theories about how depression work are just guesses. A lot of our current understanding of the physiology comes from what we know about what the drugs do. The serotonin theory of depression comes from the fact that SSRIs and TCAs work to treat depression, so the researchers draw the conclusion that it must be a problem with serotonin. </p>
<p>Coming off the medication is another issue in itself but ideally the underlying issues will have been addressed by the point that the medication is stopped. Unfortunately not a huge amount is known about what changes actually occur in developing depression or with coming off the medication. It's obviously going to have some effect but I don't really know what that would be so sorry I can't help you out any more than that </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having dealing with depression myself for the better part of 7 years, and having a M.S. with a strong research background maybe I can confirm/shed a little light on what you are explaining and questioning. </p>
<p>SSRI's to my knowledge do, scientifically, exactly what most people think they do. They inhibit serotonin reuptake. It's that simple. They don't treat depression, they don't cure depression, they don't do anything other than inhibit serotonin reuptake. I am not arguing the legitimacy of what applebottomguy has posted above as I understand the publication bias regarding their ability to treat depression. I am just unclear on his conclusion and the part of SSRI having no scientific value as a label. As far as the two week lag period of suicidal ideation, that is due to the deregulation/autoregulation of the system in general. Introducing it at first can cause some significant changes in mood off the bat- good or bad. </p>
<p>Now for the juicy part- Everyone's &quot;depression&quot; is different. Why someone is depressed is the most important part. I will go as far as saying the concept of depression as we understand it (a medical condition requiring pharmaceutical treatment) is one of the most misunderstood and dangerous concepts in modern medicine. There is no disease of depression. It is not cancer. It is not diabetes. It is not a physical deformity, so far from baseline that someone life is threatened physically. It is a conceptual illness, diagnosed in a medical sense by a test of asking some of the most generic bull-shit questions I have ever heard come out of a medical professionals mouth.</p>
<p>I will say SYMPTOMS of depression (the real problem to a human being, and in-fact the disease itself) are a result of forcing a real-life human being into situations at-home or in society that make it nearly impossible for that human to function happily. If you think about it- something as simple as belief or disbelief in an afterlife would be enough for someone to have very, very different levels of happiness (whether thats in your head or chemically induced) throughout their life. Introducing people to horrific situations (again this is all perception), can have a HUGE impact on the brain functioning of an individual for the rest of their life. For some people horrific situation are the death of others on the battle-field, and for some it's simply seeing or hearing about the the amount of horrible people that exist on the streets of our own society. It's all perspective, which is why situations of depression are all different. Have I ever fought in war and watched my friends die? No. But I have from my own perspective experienced horrific events in American society that have taught me and left my psychological state in a condition that makes it very hard to go-to bed early, wake-up early, work for a paycheck, go home to my family, and spend that paycheck. To me it's just not a sufficient way to live my only life in a universe full of things much more important and interesting. That is where my depression lies. Does serotonin play a part? Sure. Is taking a drug that forces me to be okay with wasting my life a medical treatment? No. </p>
<p>To me the way medical professionals are treating depression with pills are similar to this situation: Someone is naturally shy. They may be shy to the point where they are unsuccessful in certain social situation in America. Finding a significant other may be tough. It is just the way they are. If they drink alcohol, they are no longer shy to an awkward point, and can succeed in social situations. Should this person be treated with alcohol for their shyness? No. Is shyness a disease? No. The way depression is being treated right now is essentially forcing a biologically advanced human-being to adapt to the standards of society that they live in. If that shy human being was in a forced marriage culture. One of their &quot;symptoms&quot; and &quot;problems&quot; would be alleviated due to their culture, not some pill. </p>
<p>My explanation for depression is very conceptual, because that is in fact what depression is- a concept. It explains the horrible psychological and eventually physical effects of someone just not being happy with their life or thought of where their life is going. I am not disputing the general effectiveness of SSRI's or other anti-depressants, at treating some people's depression as I know many people on here have wildly-successful stories of their lives changing because of these medicines for the better. But IMO that is because the manipulation of serotonin in your body by the medicine allowed you to succeed in the situation your life puts you in. That is not the treatment of a disease. That is the manipulation of a human-being's chemistry to fit a mold they were not happy with. I do not mean that maliciously AT ALL. But I feel as though the stigma of depression as a disease (akin to cancer, diabetes, where an observable physical malfunction is observed) treatable by medicine is a slippery slope. If you can gain a better understanding of why you are upset about life you have a much healthier foundation for treating your &quot;depression&quot; and living a happier life. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess you're kind of reaffirming what I was worried about; that SSRI are prescribed because through a process of more or less trial and error, they were found to be effective in some percentage of cases. I'm concerned that you as a med student going through modern education, are unable to explain how the treatment is actually supposed to work (i.e. what systemic approach exists to overcoming depression once a patient is on SSRI), or the implications of coming off the medication. If you don't know this while undergoing education right now, I think it's reasonable to say that the vast majority of professionals involved in the treatment of depressive patients don't know either. </p>
<p>The actual efficacy figures of SSRI are so obscured that a layperson or even a GP has absolutely no chance of actually grasping how that efficacy was tested, what the success rates are, or what 'success' even means for the studies that led to the introduction of SSRI as a mainstream treatment. It really doesn't help that pharma manufacturers invest insane money to make sure these drugs hit the market and a lot less money into actually addressing the needs of the patients in this field. </p>
<p>Not having a go at you or the medical field at large, just looks to me like medicine is in its infancy when it comes to depression, and vested financial interests are hindering progress. I really can't blame people who say to stay off depression drugs at all costs. They sound almost like anti-vaxxers, but in their case the argument is actually quite justified. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like SSRIs being a painkiller for your mood. If you have a cold you can take paracetamol for a while to take the edge off until your immune system deals with it, if you're depressed you can take an SSRI for a while to take the edge off but you have to work at fixing the underlying problem yourself, whether that be by lifestyle change and DIY therapy or more direct intervention with therapy, CBT, etc. I don't know whether this is true for all other antidepressants as I have no experience with them.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is quite apt. Antidepressants are really there to buy time for therapy to work. They prevent depression getting worse and can help with sleep, motivation, appetite, and hope. All of those things will make therapy much more likely to work and make the patient more willing to try. However, taking antidepressants without addressing the issue is just going to lead to further depression down the track. It's a temporary fix and when it doesn't work long term patients lose hope and then therapy is going to be much less effective.</p>
<p>If depressive symptoms are picked up early some patients can even be treated effectively with therapy alone and avoid the need to go on to anti-depressants at all</p>
<p>Unfortunately a lot of patients and doctors see anti-depressants as a cure and don't take any other measures to address it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an Australian student so I don't know that big pharma has the same sort of influence as in the US but I think it would certainly play some role. </p>
<p>When we covered this stuff SSRIs were certainly the main focus and the second and third line drugs were really considered as a secondary learning objective. We did cover them for sure though and you'd definitely be doing yourself and your patient a disservice if you didn't consider all of the options though. It would be poor practice to put every patient on an SSRI and assume you'd fixed them, and regular follow up is so important to decide if and when medication needs to be changed </p>
<p>TCAs are as effective or more effective than SSRIs but have more side effects because they effect a much greater number of receptor systems so we tend to shy away a little from those as first line</p>
<p>MAOIs are more poorly understood than the other antidepressants so a lot of doctors are hesitant to use them. They're also a little harder to control than SSRIs because other medications and diet can affect their potency </p>
<p>There are a few others that are considered third line drugs that are less commonly used and I definitely wouldn't be using them I'd be relying on a specialist but I think overall SSRIs while they may not be the most effective they're generally considered the safest for most patients, but again you obviously need to consider every patient as an individual and nothing is a guaranteed fix </p></div>		</li>

<p>I think there's less of a role in Australia for big pharma. The way we are taught is first, second, and third+ line drugs for conditions and we're generally expected to know indications, contraindications, mechanism of action, and side effects for all of these (or at least be able to look them up because I'm awful at pharmacology).</p>
<p>The effect of this is that generally there's never one specific drug always for one specific condition. </p>
<p>In addition to this the expectation at all hospitals (at least in my local health district) is that you prescribe by generic drug name, never by brand name. The pharmacists will hound you to only ever use generic drug names which I really like as a concept</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm on SSRIs and swear that things in my diet can affect them. </p>
<p>The big one is alcohol - drinking any non-negligible amount regularly seem to badly disrupt the medication (although conversely, I've noticed benefits to having a small amount say once a week).</p>
<p>This last week I've struggled to function and have only really recovered today. I have a strong suspicion that the aspartame I ingested in Diet Coke and concentrated fruit squash had an effect on the drugs. Normally I wouldn't have these kinds of drinks more than once a week, but I went through a stretch where I had them most days.</p>

<p>I just assumed after the tricyclics which are considered &quot;dirty drugs&quot; because they hit many receptors - they thought Serotonin what was responsible for depression anxiety etc. So they developed the SSRI's which target only serotonin and released them in the 80's.</p>
<p>After the 90's they realised - shit, these drugs aren't all that effective maybe there <em>was</em> something that the tricyclics did that we overlooked as a previous side effect.</p>
