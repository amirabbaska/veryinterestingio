			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's the source:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>>Is there a more elegant way of finding the bedrock number that underlies a given exponent?</p>
<p>Yes, for x\^n the number you're looking for will be n!, which is shorthand for n \* (n-1) \* (n-2) \*....\*3\*2\*1.</p>
<p>For example, x\^7 would end up with the number 7! = 7\*6\*5\*4\*3\*2\*1 = 5040</p>
<p>To see why:<br />
-------<br />
Focus on x\^2 to start. </p>
<p>To generalize the difference between consecutive items in the sequence, we have:</p>
<p>(x+1)\^2 - x\^2</p>
<p>Do some algebra and get:<br />
**2**x\^**1** + 1</p>
<p>Repeat the process:</p>
<p>[2(x+1) + 1] - [2x+1]<br />
= 2</p>
<p>So there's your 2.</p>
<p>--------<br />
Now we do this with x\^3:</p>
<p>(x+1)\^3 - x\^3<br />
= **3**x\^**2** + 3x + 1</p>
<p>Repeat the process:<br />
[3(x+1)\^2 +3(x+1) + 1] - [3x\^2 + 3x + 1]<br />
= **6**x\^**1** + 6 </p>
<p>Repeat the process:<br />
6(x+1) + 6 - [6x+6]<br />
= 6 [aka **6**x\^**0**]</p>
<p>Making sense of it:<br />
-------</p>
<p>Notice that I've bolded a few coefficients and exponents in the above section. As you go through the repetitive process, you see that your highest power term always gets canceled out in the algebra. In the x\^3 example, you start with 1x\^3 being your highest power term. Then you do the difference process and you end up with 3x\^2 being your highest power. Then you do the difference process again and you end up with 6x\^1 being your highest power. Then you do it once more and 6x\^0 is your highest power. </p>
<p>**In the x\^3 example, do you see how the highest power term goes like this as we go through all the steps:**</p>
<p>x\^3<br />
3x\^2<br />
6x\^1<br />
6x\^0</p>
<p>**So the general pattern is:**<br />
x\^n<br />
nx\^(n-1)<br />
n(n-1)x\^(n-2)<br />
n(n-1)(n-2)x\^(n-3)<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
n(n-1)(n-2)...3\*2\*1</p>
<p>which is the formula we talked about up top.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, at the end there, I realized, that the end number is just a derivate of the initial one. And you do the derivative n times, where n is the exponent in x^n. (Don't think it works for negative exponents)</p>
<p>It's probably very obvious... It makes sense, the deivative is the growth of the thing you take derivative of, and so on. And in the end, for x^2, for example, the growth was 2, after two derivations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's repeated derivatives until you reach a constant (the OP's &quot;bedrock number&quot;), beyond which taking another derivative would leave you at zero. The factorial nature of this bedrock number is a consequence of the chain rule.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you start with a negative of fractional exponent you'll never find a 'base number', because repeated differentiation will never give you a constant. It's a special feature of polynomials that repeated differentiation will always give you a constant in a finite number of steps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. The simplest comparison, is when you have a function for position, the derivative of that is the speed/velocity, and the derivative of that(the speed), is your acceleration. </p>
<p>As n goes above 2 though, we're talking the growth of the growth of the growth... and so on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is amazing because i didn't do/study any math other than basic stuff for almost 5 years (law school) and now i was reading OP and i was like, oh shit i remember this from high school it is factorials of the number and scrolled down to see nicely explained comment of yours. (don't know ''taking factorial of a number'' mean anything in English, but it is used like that in my language)</p>
<p>So point of this comment is that it is amazing that you can remember something you completely forgot years ago just like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think schooling is valuable in almost the same way being guided round a city then being given a map of it:</p>
<p>Not only will you be able to go back to the places that were interesting at the time, you'll also know about all the other areas that might have been boring at the time but that you would have never known about otherwise.</p>
<p>Edit: I think this is the difference between &quot;an education&quot; and simply &quot;training&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
