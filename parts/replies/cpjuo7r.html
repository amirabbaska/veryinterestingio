<p>Maybe that's why we model that there's so much of it, but are unable to detect any.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting thought! If dark matter interacted with gravity like &quot;normal&quot; matter interacted with the electromagnetic force, you'd need 10^-38 times as much of it to explain current observations. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction" target="_blank">Source</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>you can overcome ALL of the gravity of ALL of the matter in the ENTIRE Earth with a magnet the size of a Tic-Tac.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, but that's only true because of the distances involved right?  If you compressed all the matter in the earth to the size of a tic tac (black hole?) and then put it next to your tiny magnet, which would more strongly attract an equidistant piece of magnetic matter? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Try to think in terms of mass. The Earth is much more massive than a magnet. If you had as many atoms of Earth as you did atoms of a Tic-Tac sized magnet (so, a small rock for example) the gravity of that rock couldn't even be measured it's so small.</p>
<p>If that doesn't make it click for you, try thinking of a magnet the size of Earth, then. Start thinking of a small magnet, then a bigger one, then a bigger one... ever had two big magnets you couldn't pull apart? What if they were twice as big? Or a hundred times as big. Finally, imagine a magnet the size of earth. If you had a magnet the size of earth and you put a steel I-beam on it, it would deform almost like a liquid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but I specifically said you're compressing the matter of the earth, meaning the mass stays the same, but the distance to the center of mass decreases drastically.  Shouldn't this increase the force due to gravity immensely?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is that a body of mass pulls other mass towards the center of the body of mass regardless of its size (its the mass that matters). </p>
<p>If you were to create a singularity with the mass the size of our planet, a magnet the size of a tic tac would have a stronger pull (on ferrous metals).</p>
<p>Now, if it were literally a black hole, it would gobble up matter that came into contact with it - but not much would come into contact with it if you just did a replacement for earth to black hole earth - for the most part, the solar system would keep going on just like it does now (objects that may have collided with the earth may not collide with the black hole).</p>
