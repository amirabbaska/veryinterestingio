			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm inclined to think that there will still be internal movement.</p>
<p>If we jump in on the picture at a moment when the bottle and the water are moving at the same speed in the same direction, there will come a moment soon when the bottle stops and reverses direction. The glass and the water have very different viscosities (solid and liquid, about as different as you can get), so the glass changes direction as a unit and more or less instantly, while the moving water is completely non-rigid and will surely collide with the oncoming glass.</p>
<p>If we posit a bottle with a non-uniform internal shape (like a Coke bottle), I would think that would cause even more turbulence in the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's compression.  You can compress liquids but only very inefficiently, a lot of pressure is needed for little compression.  I don't think it would be easily achieved or noticeable to the naked eye.</p>
<p>There's also an experiment where you can break a bottle by creating a cavitation bubble, a vacuum, in the bottom of the bottle.  But this usually only works because there is space for the water to move upward.  Don't think it can be achieved easily in a closed container because it would rely on compression of the liquid to gain momentum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless the water or glass is compressible, there is no where for the water to move. There are no density differences in pure water either. The top post in this thread explains it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So if I go to the grocery store and get a jug of distilled water, is that still 99.98? Or something close?</p></div>		</li>
