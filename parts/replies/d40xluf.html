			<div class="markdown"><p>This was my initial thought--the planet needs to support an atmosphere large enough to have vapor pressure such that the surface temperature doesn't cause the water to boil off. Without liquid water at the surface of the planet, this question doesn't make sense. </p>
<p>Thus, the answer to the OP's question is likely an equation that gives a radius based on the temperature.</p></div>		</li>
