<p>At some point, the number of your descendents will be either equal zero to or will be the population of the Earth.</p>

<p>There's no theoretical reason that you couldn't have, say, exactly one descendent every generation, though, is there? You have one kid. That kid has one kid. Etc. In a billion, billion years you still have one descendent (or, probably a couple as a few generations are alive at once). </p>
<p>Am I missing something? This is improbable, but not impossible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure.  This is strictly a mathematical model used to approximate real world behavior.  For the Markov chain inputs to match your scenario, you would say that there is a 100% chance that you and all your descendants will have exactly one kid.  Then the model propagates out for a billion, billion years and we get exactly the scenario you describe.</p>
<p>But if it's anything other than 100% probability of one kid, it falls apart.  Say 99.9998% chance for one kid, 0.0001% of no kids, 0.0001% of more than one kid.  Maybe 100 generations isn't enough, but eventually you run to one extreme or the other (all or nothing). </p></div>		</li>

<p>No, you don't.  You <em>probably</em> do, but it's not certain.</p>
<p>You can have a 99.99999% chance of something happening, and <em>still</em> do a billion tests which all result in that thing not happening.  It's just phenomenally unlikely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not really wrong, but the key here is the infinite bit. It's probably unreasonable to assume that you and your children, and your children's children and <em>their</em> children's children are all only going to have one kid. That happening for several hundred generations is even more unlikely. For several thousand generations I'd imagine that chance is a tiny infinitesimal portion of 1%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I didn't say it was likely.  But the proposition in the comic and various comments is that a given outcome is <em>certain</em> to happen, which is not right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guess you aren't a computerphile. 2^10 is 1024--the number of bytes in a kilobyte. (Well &quot;kibibyte,&quot; but no one says that.) Or kilobytes in a megabyte or megabytes in a gigabyte, etc.</p>
<p>For smaller values of n, you can approximate 2^10n as 1000^n. It works with one significant figure up to n=17. And it stays within an order of magnitude up to n=97.</p></div>		</li>
