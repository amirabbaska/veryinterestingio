			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I tend to just use the unit of measurement that is closest to what I'm trying to describe. Saying 1/3 meter just doesn't quite have the same ring to it. </p>
<p>It comes from having grown up in a country that uses metric but being from America. I've had to use both so much that I don't even pay attention anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, except skateboards move when you push them, so the movement is stable and there's a well designed rough surface to stand on. Since the movement is controlled by the bug it'd be harder to properly account for shifts and turns. Plus I doubt the back would be well suited for standing on.</p></div>		</li>
