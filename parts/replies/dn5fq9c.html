			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that's fascinating! Thanks for sharing this with us. A lot of people went off on things about telomeres and telomerase and the decaying of the cells, but they never really got to the heart of my question, which was relating to why the decay doesn't seem to affect reproduction in particular. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what happens during fertilization and early embryo development? You guessed it -- all the epigenetic marks are wiped clean and totally reset. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This in particular really answered the core of my question. I had a feeling that it would &quot;reset&quot; somehow when a new baby is created, but it's interesting how that works out in those cases when it doesn't reset when new cells are created in the body. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Resetting presumably carries a nonzero probability of resetting to the incorrect epigenetic marks. If all your cells reset every cellular generation your liver may well be overwhelmed by half its cells turning to pancreas or intestine (since being next to pancreas would probably make it more likely to form pancreas on a &quot;reset&quot;). It's entirely possible that resetting constantly would cause more deaths during reproductive years while our current method keeps us pretty healthy from an aging perspective during our prime time to reproduce. Anything after roughly 40-50 is mostly irrelevant from an evolutionary selection perspective.</p>
<p>I don't think there have been any experiments to try to induce this for observation but it's a plausible explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about this, life has existed for 3.5 Billion years and every cell comes from a cell before it. So I think that life has no problem with reproducing indefinitely. Quite on the contrary, the complexity of multicellular organisms must have to do with the fact that we are programmed to die. the aging you speak if is controlled, only within the egg cells and stem cells is this infinite regenerative potential unleashed. That's why Cancer is such a blight on mankind and happens so spontaneously, cells perhaps have an innate 'desire' to reproduce that the body as a whole has evolved to suppress in order to create complex functions and tissue systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, our somatic cells are programmed to propagate our germline. You could think of cancer as when our somatic cells forget this and then try to become immortal themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also consider that the body is made of billions (trillions?) of cells. If one of those goes rogue (eg- becomes cancerous) it is just one of many and the organism as a whole is okay, at least for a while. Any errors in the egg/sperm or zygote that prevents the <em>perfect</em> execution of forming a baby results in that embryo dying. Generally you don't notice the lost pregnancy since it barely had time to form. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh cool man. Seriously thanks. Before I saw your post, I've written the following, which might be wrong since I'm not a scientist in the field, just a curious person.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The aging is called senescence. It has much to do with the telomeres activity, it's true, as other have mentioned, but it's only the tip of the iceberg. There is much more going on, and only a small fraction is barely understood.</p>
<p>Different families of cells have different maximum number of divisions. The deletion of small part of the telomeres acts as a biological countdown until that threshold is achieved. Telomerase protein acts as a reset button. Reseting the time debt of a cell. Some cells will produce a lot of telomerase for a longtime, others less for a shorter time.</p>
<p>&quot;Why&quot; would there be a mechanism that depletes our cells life, or ability to live? It's not quite like that. First, there is no &quot;purpose&quot;, or &quot;function&quot; per say. A function is a very human way of seeing what happens in biology.
Secondly, things in biology are never easy, simple, and straightforward. Unfathomable interactions, mechanisms, exists. Well-known proteins can have unforseen &quot;functions&quot;.</p>
<p>Mechanisms in aging are closely linked a lot of  intertwined processes, proteins, enzymes, involved in cell suicide, mithocondries activity, cells differenciation, gene library preservation, metabolism processes, even embryo development.</p>
<p>We barely understand 1% of all of this.</p>
<p>Some cells, such as the germinal cell (two germinal cells from two opposite sex individuals will fuse to form a new individual) have special preservation tweaks, defense mechanisms, proteins, that will help preserve their pristine state until they are used.</p>
<p>Some proteins in germinal cells within an individual are crucial for preservation of the library as well as embryo development, but also will trigger aging response of the individual. And cells of the reproductive organs of the aforementioned individual will produce other proteins to counter this signal.</p>
<p>Honestly, it is just mind blowing how things are incredibly complicated.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your description of telomeres is pretty accurate. And 10-20 years ago, many did think that telomeres played an outsized role in aging. That's why we do experiments -- to falsify our hypotheses. </p>
<p>You mentioned senescence at the beginning of your description. While replicative senescence (the Hayflick limit) is indeed induced by short telomeres, there are other types of senescence too that don't have to do with telomeres. And senescent cells do increase during aging. There's an active body of research suggesting that if you clear senescent cells, with genetic tricks or drugs that target them, you can make old mice healthier. There's is so much going on during aging that we have yet to learn.</p></div>		</li>
