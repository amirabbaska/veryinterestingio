<p>Edit: Because the post has been locked, several of you are talking about Trump banning the National Parks from communicating. There's little evidence that is actually occurring. Don't believe everything you read.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm no expert.. But i think that is correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So kind of how trump is initiating a gag order on national parks, banning them from communicating to the outside world? That was Obama that opened up the parks ability to use Twitter, via executive order?</p>
<p>Or also maybe how trump is telling all states and other Medicaid funded sources to cease providing services that were funded by the ACA or &quot;obummercare&quot; as people call it? Oh wait, that was one of the only things the Republican Congress allowed Obama to actually pass into law, and wasn't one of Obama's executive orders.</p>
<p>So what do you mean when you say &quot;most of&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most executive orders to actually be done, need congressional approval for the budget. For example, Donald Trump can sign an executive order to rebuild all of the roads in America, but if congress doesn't like the way the funding would work they can shoot it down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not entirely true. Congress controls budgets. Executive has vast control over money - especially finances, banking, Fed, Treasury and a plethora of other areas.</p>
<p>Congress tried to exert control over executive control of money (finance) by refusing to limit the debt ceiling which demonstrates just how incredibly futile they are.</p>
<p>Now consider that much of the executive controls the military and federal agencies and their finances and you realise - just how completely and utterly congress has almost nothing to do with &quot;money&quot;.</p>
<p>Token gestures like &quot;aid to Israel&quot; are pretty much all they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that affect the wall. He plans to make steps towards that this week, so how could he sign an executive order on a $6 billion project without Mexico playing ball, or congressional approval?</p>
<p>Would this mean he can't, and <em>has</em> to go through congress?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. By the President who signed it via another EO cancelling the first one. </p>
<p>As well, the courts have the power to stop them. For instance if Trump issued an EO for all Muslims to be deported, the courts could say &quot;No, unconstitutional&quot; and invalidate the order. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Executive orders are implemented by government employees, who have salaries. If the executive order would be carried out by ABC agency, the next time Congress passes a bill appropriating money to fund the operations of ABC agency, it can specify that no funds appropriated by that bill can be used to do whatever the executive order says to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you recommend a good way to learn about the US political system?  Maybe a book or YouTube series?  Not actual political news but the actual process, who does what, what powers they have, how various people are elected, etc.  I'm sick and tired of sensational news (left and right).  I've decided I need to learn more about the process and find alternative and more neutral (or raw) sources of US news. </p></div>		</li>
