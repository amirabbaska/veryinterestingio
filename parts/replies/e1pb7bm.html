			<div class="markdown"><p>I talk about bacteria with my pre-k and kindergarteners when we talk about why we wash our hands after the bathroom, covering our mouths when we sneeze with our sleeve, etc. The day I heard one of the 5-year-olds reminding another child that everyone has bacteria and some bacteria is good bacteria- I was so proud. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite way to teach kids about bacteria is with glitter. I'd roll a ball in glitter and we'd pass it around while singing a song about germs and later, we'd look at our hands and see how many &quot;germs&quot; we have. It worked great although I had a couple children consistently refer to germs as &quot;sparkles&quot; when reminding others to cover their sneezes or whatever. It was rather hilarious</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I keep seeing this but why does no one mention that parents also have a role in raising people nowadays? Reddit sure loves to bitch about how school doesn't t teach them anything useful like.</p>
<p>How to change a tire (3rd grade reading of the owners manual) or follow the pictures on the jack</p>
<p>Doing taxes ( reading level 4th grade, Item A goes in Box A from kindergarten and counting up to however many people live in your house 1st grade math.)</p>
<p>Fixing a toilet (6th grade essay writing with sources to get to Google and follow instructions).</p>
<p>Budgeting. (Third grade where they ask how many apples can you give Suzy and still have 1 for lunch.).</p>
<p>For some reason people don't seem to understand that 1+1=2 can also apply to $1+$1=$2 because that wasn't how it was taught to them.</p>
<p>The next generations need to be a lot smarter than they are today.</p>
<p>Regarding this a big problem is laziness. Schools taught you lots of skills like how to research so use it. People go on the INTERNET and bitch &quot;I dont know how to file taxes&quot; Google (39,700,000 results), or &quot;Oh man school never taught me to budget&quot; Google (570,000,000 results).I think maybe if they applied their 6th grade research abilities they could figure it out? I know because i had to, i wasnt even a smart kid i was a C student at best but nothing happens if you just sit and bitch.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One thing that's kind of funny is that like half of those neurons (or more) are cerebellar granule cells, an nonoutput local processing interneuron found in the cerebellum. The part of the brain responsible for making our movement less janky.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And those modern humans doing that 50,000 years ago had exactly the same brainpower as we do today, if not more. The reason today we have achieved things like this portable supercomputer / instantaneous communication / pornography device I’m using now is because we started writing down those ideas and having each generation build on the last. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find the monotreme lecture hits this note perfectly.</p>
<p>Start with the platypus to draw them in and lull them in to a false sense of security:</p>
<p>&quot;So you know the platypus? Weird duck/beaver looking thing. Well there's other things that make it pretty unique too.</p>
<p>For a start, the male platypus has a claw on its back leg that's attached to a venom gland. Weird yeah? And it's pretty potent too. It can incapacitate an adult human or be lethal to a medium sized dog.So it's more of a beaver/duck/snake now.</p>
<p>It's also interesting because even though it's a mammal, it doesn't give birth to live young, it lays eggs. It does feed it's young with milk though, but it doesn't have nipples so it just secretes the milk from folds in its skin.</p>
<p>Thing is, the platypus isn't alone in being the only mammal that lays eggs, there's another one ; The Echidna.</p>
<p>&quot;What's an echidna?&quot; I hear you say. Well it looks like a hedgehog but with a long snout. (Bonus trivia, Knuckles from the Sonic the Hedgehog series is an echidna. Just keep that in mind for this next part too.)</p>
<p>Now aside from being an egg laying mammal like, it also has another special feature, just like it's buddy the platypus. Now if you're familiar with the Sonic universe, you might be thinking it has wingsuit like flaps similar to a flying squirrel or wolverine-esque spikes coming from its knuckles that it can scale walls with; but you'd be wrong.</p>
<p>4 dicks.</p>
<p>Yup, that's right, that cute little long nosed hedgehog thing has 4 dicks. If your struggling to picture this, when exposed it looks like a little hand reaching from its groin.</p>
<p>I can see that you're starting to ponder the logistics of sex for these little guys. Don't worry, they don't use them all at once in a 1 man gang bang.</p>
<p>They use them in pairs. In fact, they alternate which pair they use too. So it's more like a 1 man 3some tag team.</p>
<p>Keep that in mind the next time you go for the edgy red guy in a sonic game.&quot;</p>
<p>If they still haven't left by the end of all that then they're probably weird enough to be OK with sitting in silence with you as you get tanked.</p></div>		</li>
