			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but as others have pointed out, these bands would still consist of discrete, but very closely spaced, energy levels since vibrational and rotational excitations are still quantized. It's lifetime broadening that gives rise to continuous spectra for discrete transitions (i.e. below ionization potential)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Thanks for the message. I looked that up and it's essentially energy uncertainty. Seems to be a small broadening but I could see that blending everything together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The spectrum you measure is, under nearly all circumstances, also the result of an ensemble of molecules with different speeds, different effective temperatures, different bonding or interactions with neighboring molecules (in the case of liquids, at least).  This greatly adds to the perceived broadening, even if each individual molecule's absorption bands are well-defined.</p></div>		</li>
