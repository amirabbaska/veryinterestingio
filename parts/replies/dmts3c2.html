			<div class="markdown"><p>Flipping the question, I'd bet that more equatorial countries avoid wood because of a higher relative cost of wood, and a higher relative rate of deterioration of wood. </p>
<p>In coldish/dryish places, wood lasts a long time and in Canada/US/etc there are a relatively low cost and sustainable forestry industry. </p>
<p>In humid places, wood doesn't last as long - really nothing lasts as long. Also: Mexico probably has fewer giant softwood forests than Canada or the US have. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, they do have that whole Amazon jungle to provide wood. I guess what I don't get is that cost is so often cited as the reason for not using poured or pre-cast concrete. But if it were really more expensive for them, you can bet that they would use wood, even if it did not last as well. But you do have a point about moisture and I would throw in industrial scale termites. It also does not explain the Italian tile floors and roofs. We pay a premium price for that stuff here, and even the poorest people use that stuff down there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Affluence isn't the point. It's what you can get for the money you spend. Most of the U.S. has a climate that allows wooden structures to last a very long time. Some parts don't, and that's where you see concrete and block construction. </p>
<p>Florida (and the areas around it) has a climate that's hot, wet, prone to hurricanes, and full of wood eating insects-- so they build almost everything out of concrete block with lots of steel reinforcement, use ceramic tiles on their roofs, stucco as their siding, metal studs for interior walls, and impact resistant windows.</p>
<p>The desert Southwest (Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, ect.) is hot and dry, but not prone to hurricanes or frequent earthquakes-- so they build using similar materials, but with less expensive reinforcement. </p>
<p>The places that use concrete block for their houses have block plants in their areas, otherwise the transportation costs would be really high. They also have large labor pools that are experienced in block and concrete construction which would be considered a specialty in other areas.</p>
<p>The rest of the country (and Canada as well) uses mostly wood. We have large forests that support a huge, sustainable timber industry-- so wood is inexpensive. Wood is relatively easy to work with, has an excellent weight-to-strength ratio, does well in extreme temperature changes, and leaves large cavities between the studs that can hide wires, pipes, and duct-work, and the rest can be filled with insulation. Adding-on to, restructuring, and repairing wooden houses is also easy. Since wooden buildings are cheaper it's also more realistic to simply replace them when they've outlived their usefulness. Say you have a property that significantly increases in value, but it's got an old, undesirable house on it. The reduced weight of wood construction means that you can choose to demolish the old house and replace it with something better for a much lower cost than brick or block.</p>
<p>Wooden buildings are excellent in earthquakes, and do as well as most other materials in everything else-- except for hurricanes (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derecho" target="_blank">derechos</a>), but they can be engineered to withstand those too-- there's just no point because it becomes more expensive than using concrete and block. No material survives house fires, wildfires, mudslides, tornadoes, or floods without needing major repairs, or being rebuilt. Tornado prone areas usually have shelters built into the ground, or small reinforced rooms built into the house that can protect the inhabitants for the few minutes of the storm. Building an entire house that can withstand a tornado would be astronomically expensive, and silly. That's what insurance is for.</p>
<p>Using less expensive materials that work just as well (and in some cases better) to get basically the same result is just called being smart. We could build houses like they do in Europe, and then we too could enjoy having inadequate electrical, ancient plumbing, poor insulation, and weird room sizes because it would cost a fortune to fix any of it-- and crazy-high repair costs when something finally does completely break. But hey, look how awesome my 300 year old house is...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the materials that are the concern, it's the labor. Stick framing goes up really quickly and doesn't take a lot of skill. Built to code, it'll withstand most natural disasters. </p>
<p>Rebar and concrete are cheap, but setting it up on site takes skilled labor and a lot of hours. Between the higher pay of the concrete workers and the longer hours, you're looking at 3-4x the labor cost. </p>
<p>If you're in Latin America paying $.50 an hour for base labor, then most of your cost is materials and the pay difference isn't that much.</p>
<p>If you're in America and you're paying $10/hr for the general labor, labor is 90% of your expenses and increasing it is painful.</p>
<p>Especially since flooding still means you're straight fucked because the house isn't watertight and all of your stuff gets wet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Poured concrete is not the only other option. In Germany we generally prefer to stack large blocks of autoclaved aerated concrete, which is fairly easy (pretty much bricklaying with huge bricks) and offers good thermal insulation.</p>
<p>Of course that's still way more expensive than just putting up a wooden frame and calling it a day. American houses are dirt cheap by German standards. (Also sometimes horrifying but to each their own.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The labour reasoning doesn't make sense when you go to a country like Australia... </p>
<p>They have a significantly high minimum wage - the base labour for any employee over 18 is $18.29 per hour, that includes roofers, bricklayers, plumbers - pretty much everyone who works in any industry gets paid that as a starting wage... some of them are a lot higher.</p>
<p>Every house in my home state (Western Australia) is brick and concrete construction. Its the same for most of the country, except in some Northern parts like QLD where I beleive they use timber as its more plentiful - and newer more eco-friendly ways of building are coming into vogue (recycled materials etc)</p>
<p>If it was the costs of the labour being a huge issue then Australians would all live in wooden stick framed houses.. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Concrete is cheaper than wood in many places that don't have wood. USA homes have building standards/codes that make the structures much safer than the concrete homes in mexico and south america. Also in the USA most people live in homes or apartment complexes and we don't have many &quot;tent cities&quot; or &quot;shanty towns&quot; like many of the mexican and south american citizens live in.  </p></div>		</li>
