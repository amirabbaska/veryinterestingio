			<div class="markdown"><p>Anti-venom would be more like a type of venom that counteracts the first venom. Anti-venin is what the antibodies are called. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're applying way more logic to that than it deserves. &quot;Antivenin&quot; is just a linguistic artifact.</p>
<p>The earliest research on the subject was by French researchers, and the French word for &quot;antivenom&quot; is &quot;antivenin&quot;. Authors in other languages copied &quot;antivenin&quot; to keep the nomenclature consistent.</p>
<p>There's really nothing more to it than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>anti: opposed to or against</p>
<p>venom: referring to the venom ur trying to oppose</p>
<p>i dont see how anti-venom is incorrect. i mean sure, the antibodies are called antivenin but that seems really pedantic to then conclude that anti-venom is incorrect</p></div>		</li>
