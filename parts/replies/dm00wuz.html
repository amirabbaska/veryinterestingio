			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting the &quot;reach REM sleep quickly&quot; section isn't totally correct. It's mostly right. There are two critical phases of sleep - phase 3+4 (grouped as just type 3 in america), and REM sleep (called phase 4 in america). Phase 3-4 sleep can be thought of primarily as physical recovery - fixing breaks and cuts and muscle regrowth etc, whilst REM sleep is more complicated (and less well understood), but could generally be thought of as mental recovery - tabulating memory, removing cellular toxin buildup in the brain etc. </p>
<p>Uberman + similar hardcore polyphasic schedules work by near total removal of the less relevant phases of sleep (1+2), and a slight suppression of phase 3+4 sleep in favour of REM sleep (called REM rebound). In seriously constricted sleep schedules like uberman you don't have time to repeat multiple cycles of sleep stages like you normally would, so instead you have a restricted 3+4 stage, and then stay in REM sleep until you wake up. You alternate preference for stage 3+4 and REM sleep based on requirements. </p>
<p>This is important because without phase 3+4 sleep, you die. The same isn't true of REM sleep. It fucks you up good if you go completely without it for sure, but the effects of 3+4 sleep deprivation are worse. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Just...no.</p>
<p>You NEED NREM 1 and 2 in order to have healthy sleep. Features like sleep spindles and k-complexes are a vital component of sleep. If you are dropping straight into REM sleep, it means you are so sleep deprived that your sleep architecture is compromised.</p>
<p>You also NEED REM sleep.</p>
<p>You could at least post research articles that pertain to human sleep.</p></div>		</li>
