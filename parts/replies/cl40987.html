			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation, I had a feeling a lot went to textures and the art aspect of development. A ROM download may only be a small file, but if you add in a custom texture pack, it's in the GB range. Makes sense. I guess it just seems crazy how all the items, side quests and the &quot;scope&quot; of the game operates within the small storage space confinement. Really makes me appreciate these old games more! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should add on the sounds - for a long time, sounds were mostly .midi files. Midi files are freaking TINY. They're also not technically &quot;high quality&quot; but with enough effort you could actually make a very worthwhile soundtrack/effect set for a game although it wouldn't rival say the opening credits of something like Halo.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kunstderfuge.com/beethoven/variae.htm" target="_blank">Example</a> The first file is only 171KB but it's 9 min long. Midi files synth a sound profile to a note frequency. It may not have superb amounts of clarity, but for video games it's more than enough. This also means simple sound effects are tiny ^tiny ^^tiny files. Also, figure this, with the added storage capacity of a game disc, <em>why skimp on quality</em>. So even if you could have an opening cut be 10MB, but you have the overhead to go for the full 7.1 UHD @ 200MB, why compress it? Sure maybe only .01% of your gamerbase is going to have the audio setup to actually hear the full glory, but then that's .01% you won't disappoint on something that was doable.</p>
<p>Textures (and shading) are notably the largest. Think like Super Mario 64. There really wasn't much &quot;lighting effect&quot; and all the grass looked more or less the same.</p>
<p>They created the landscape with simple vector shapes. Vectors being cool because instead of the full resolution you'd need for say 10M pixels in Bitmap, you simply have points connected by lines that can be resized instantly. These 'voids' or areas are then filled with a simple texture that is repeated, much like in the old windows background menu where you could tile a thumbnail. If you have Photoshop or PSP, try creating vector files compared to other files. Vectors can usually be scaled indefinitely without &quot;loss of quality&quot; (because it's nominal usually to begin with) where as if I blow up a 420p to 1080p it just turns into Blockman 4.0</p>
<p>This is also why early 3D video games had blocky shapes with sharp edges and in general not a ton of <em>dynamic</em> lighting effects.</p>
<p>Going back to the Vector thing. Think of in the menu on SM64 where you could fuck with Mario's face. Say the area on the underside of his nose is almost always going to be darker than say the top. Then they could duplicate NoseColor1 at 80% brightness further reducing the amount of information needing to be stored.</p>
<p>I would say the second largest use of written memory (stored on disc, not memory used to process input) would be engines. Particularly physics / mechanics engines. The engines themselves aren't necessarily massive, but all the auxiliary coding that must be created for every object it is going to affect in the game usually accounts for a large portion of the increase in video game sizes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A long time ago I dabbled in mixing stuff in midi (shit ton of work) you can actually get different &quot;profiles&quot; for lack of a better word. So a C7 will have different qualities across different profiles.</p>
<p>Still a very compact (and not half bad) method of creating soundtracks. Especially if you can bang it out on say a keyboard then just transpose it into a midi and attach a profile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of that, in the olden days developers actually tried their best to get as much data into those tiny 32MB cartridges as possible. These days they just say &quot;fuck it, we got all the storage we need.&quot;</p>
<p>That's why for example the bushes in the first Super Mario Bros are just green-colored clouds. They reused the same sprite for 2 different things and just colored it differntly, saving storage space.

<p>For perspective, a floppy disk can contain 1.4MB, that's 1440KBytes. (I know that the trick is procedural generation, but they still look nice, sounds nice, and capable of telling a story nonetheless. Artful both in technique and content.) </p>
<p>There's lots more (like kkrieger, an interactive FPS in 96k, etc) at pouet.net. I'm on mobile right now, so, yeah.<br />
Those demoscene gods live in another realm beyond reach of us mere mortals. ;)</p>

<p>They released a final version a while ago, and it runs (and looks) much better. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIItHzm9hzc" target="_blank">youtube version</a>, enjoy!</p>

<p>That's only part of the story. Executable compression, shader minification also help cutting down the last few KBs. There's a lot of interesting techniques for reducing the final file size (linker tweaks, removing what may seem like optimizations for better compressability, etcâ€¦).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconding this. I did development on mobile before smart phones. We used all sorts of techniques to reduce the size, especially for the smallest handsets. Image reuse, no redundant resources, palette swapping, image compression and optimization, whatever we could do.</p>
<p>Enter the smartphone. There are two ways to download - over wifi, and over the data plan. The threshheld has moved up over the years, but it used to be 25MB, then later, 50MB - if your application was any higher than that (including the channel's wrapper code and apple's security components), you couldn't download over data plan, you had to be on wifi. So if we were anywhere close to that threshhold, we cleaned it up, we crammed, we compressed, we optimized, to get it below.</p>
<p>However, if we realized that there was just no way in Satan's coal-clustered hell that we were going to meet that size limitation, the attitude was absolutely the opposite - screw it, there's plenty of space. Duplicate images, sounds, hell, we once saved an old copy of the entire codebase in a subdirectory inside the main framework <em>just in case</em> one of the libraries in there was referenced by newer code, because &quot;what's a few more megabytes.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Ocarina of Time specifically they used a lot of efficient workarounds too, for example a lot of building interiors (ie Link's House) around villages aren't geometry at ALL, they are simply fixed camera angles with a prerendered scene underneath the player model. Also a lot of things that would typically be modeled out completely nowadays are handled with planes instead of enclosed geometry (ie. the ladder on links house and fences aren't 6 faces per rung, instead they are 2 faces total, that use an identical texture on both sides) which reduces a bunch of rather unimportant texture space.</p></div>		</li>
