			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe to add a bit more to your thoughts, higher frequencies are more directional than lower frequencies. This is also accentuated in speaker dispersion causing higher frequencies to &quot;beam&quot; or are dispersed in a narrow pattern. When you're in the spot where a speaker is &quot;beaming&quot; it feels very sharp, intense, and unmusical. An oscillator producing a single high frequency is like being pricked by a pin where the feeling is focused and unpleasant.</p>
<p>Lower frequencies will disperse in all directions and can even &quot;bend&quot; around objects (perhaps the blanket analogy works here?). I'd also add that in general, the fundamental notes of many instruments are lower than higher. This leads me to believe lower frequencies would be perceived more musically. An oscillator producing a single low frequency feels more almost meditative and very consuming.</p></div>		</li>
