			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, no. The last paragraph shows that the two words were coined more or less simultaneously in the 19th century. So it's not that Americans thought &quot;to burgle&quot; sounded silly, it's that Americans decided they needed a word, and they settled on &quot;to burglarize.&quot; Brits did the same, but settled on &quot;to burgle.&quot;</p>
<p>When they learned what the other had done, both had a little bit of a chuckle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is <em>not</em> how language works. Only in a limited number of contexts is language developed in a prescriptive manner. People had been using 'burgled' and 'burglarized' before that use was ever documented. In US, presumably use of burglarized was more common, hence why it caught on. From there, we can guess at how and why burglarized was more predominant in the US than burgled, in which the person you replied to made a fairly sensible suggestion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in australia, the deadshit kids &quot;do some burgs&quot; as an even worse mangling of the word.</p>
<p>then they spend the money on weed, so they can &quot;smoke some buges&quot; (from bugle, the instrument, which the gatorade bottle and garden-hose bong they're smoking out of apparently resembles)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not really, it was an anecdote. the australian lexicon has little bearing on the queens english (thank fuck) but for what little its worth, most skips would tell you the burglers burgle.</p></div>		</li>
