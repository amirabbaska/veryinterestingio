<p>And at the same time your skin has a lot of pores that allows for bacteria, fungus, and so on to hide. Unless you literally remove most of your skin some bacteria will survive just hidden, then it will come out and start breading quickly.</p>
<p>What's more once your hands are really sterile there is a possibility for it to get infected with much more dangerous bacteria that were so far kept from reproducing by the ones normally present. (Think about the burn victims - they have sterile skin which is full of dead matter ready to be infected by something.)</p>

<p>As far as I know (but I'm no expert) it's not an issue with surgical equipment at all - the amount of bacteria that could be there before sterilization is so tinny that there is no need for it. Depyrogenation is important with drugs you inject someone with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is impossible to sterilize your hands. Your hands are made of cells, anything that would completely kill all bacteria on your hands would also kill you. Fortunately, you have a strong immune system that can fight off almost anything, it just needs a bit of help. Washing your hands reduces the number of bacteria to a manageable level. A little bit of &quot;sanitizer&quot; in the soap adds nothing to this process other than strengthening the bacteria that survive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you mean antibacterial? Sanitizer is usually alcohol which (IIRC) isn't dangerous like antibacterial soap is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a buddy who runs a very successful business cleaning surgical equipment for all the reasons you just posted. It's actually...kind of scary...how many hospitals and surgical centers do not see the need to do anything other than autoclave their stuff. Sure, you have sterilized everything, but the protein left over that can trigger an immune response is complicated. </p>
<p>Plus, and beer brewers will tell you this - sterilizing and sanitizing your equipment is useless if bacteria are hiding under a gunk of shit (bacteria corpses, tissue, etc) that manages to insulate it JUST enough from the extreme heat.</p>
<p>He has a high school diploma and that's it. He makes bank. And the market is still young (i.e. as I stated, many hospitals will refuse to bother with the services). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every surgical place has a sterile processing unit. They're in charge of cleaning the instruments and sterilizing them. The saying in those departments goes &quot;it can't be sterile unless it's clean.&quot; </p>
<p>The process of cleaning starts in the OR when they spray used instruments with enzymatics. Then the instruments are taken to decontam which is part of the sterile processing unit. From there the instruments are cleaned of visible bioburden before it's put into a instrument washer which thermally disinfects the instruments. After that they are visually checked again before they are packaged and sterilized. </p></div>		</li>

<p>ok, so after that entire drawn-out process, what exactly are they looking for in their visual checks?  (actually I guess the real question is: what types of things do they find in their visual checks?)</p>
<p>do they use a microscope?  or just eyeball it?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can killed bacteria still be harmful (besides hindering surgery)? Like when I boil water, I drink the water with dead bacteria. How is this different then drinking the water with bacteria alive?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, standard disclaimer of Im not an expert on potable water first.</p>
<p>The short answer is not really likely.  Its probably part of the reason they tell you to boil water for a certain amount of time before drinking it.  Essentially, your digestive tract is already literally full of all sorts of crap, so your immune system wont have a pyrogenic response.</p>
<p>The main concern with pyrogens is injecting them into other parts of the body.  For example, water used in a vaccine or a saline drip going into the blood stream.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's not true, actually. botulinum toxin is very susceptible to heat, and denatures at about 80Â° C if I recall correctly. So boiling will certainly do it. Maybe you're thinking of the spores? They are quite heat resistant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, just because you cook old leftovers and kill the bacteria doesn't mean you cannot get food poisoning. Bacteria can still leave nasty byproducts behind. Those byproducts are usually produced when the bacteria eat so water is likery not as problematic as food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact : the Rhodesian Sealous Scouts (similar to SAS) had the infamous baboon test as part of their training. At the beginning of training camp a baboon would be killed and then left in the sun to rot for days. As part of the course they were trained how to prepare spoiled meat. The final test at the end of the week was to prepare, cook and eat the rotten baboon - and not get sick or die. Supposedly their was a very limited time after cooking where you could consume it before the toxins reached dangerous / fatal levels. </p></div>		</li>
