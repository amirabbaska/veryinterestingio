			<div class="markdown"><p>You know mri machines. The ones that if you have any metals in your body when you use it’ll rip it out. Those are really strong magnets right? Yeah those are about 3T max. </p>
<p>Earths magnetic field is measured in microTeslas(10^-6)  and ranges 25-65 of em but that’s nothing compared to a fridge magnet which is about 0.001T </p>
<p>One of the magnetic cranes you see lifting cars in junkyards only comes in at about 1T</p>
<p>So to put it simply 100T is ridiculous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the MRI reference...I believe its at stanford, there is a 7T system that is a &quot;test&quot; system, and when you enter the room you have to be careful about your movements as the field can disorient you. A few people have actually thrown up because of its strength and the disorientation. My pops worked on mri systems and I used to go with him every now and then and even the 1.5T systems were strong. I remember standing in the doorway of one holding a small piece of metal and the pull from it was insane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you had two 1 m^2 100T magnets and put them on top of one another, you'd have about the same force as the force exerted by water on the Hoover Dam walls, concentrated in 1 m^2. </p>
<p>For two magnets the size of your fingernail, the force would be ~7x a T-Rex bite.</p>
<p>F = B^2 A / 2 mu_0 is the approximation I'm using.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could we hypothetically learn anything from exotic objects such as Magnetars (10^8 - 10^10 T) that might open new avenues of research into more powerful man-made fields, or do you think we're at a hard limit as far as what's possible on Earth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I asked the question, I actually was considering if a study of the fields of a magnetar (remotely, obviously, perhaps by watching plasma flow around the object?) could assist in designing a superconducting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosively_pumped_flux_compression_generator" target="_blank">EPFCG</a> to attain higher field strengths here, like you said.</p>
