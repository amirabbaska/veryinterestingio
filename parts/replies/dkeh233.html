			<div class="markdown"><p>This is literally the same story applied to Tasmanians - they use the same method of dragging fire around - and it was proven they did have fire making capability. The source in the Wikipedia article is an observation from a Brit in 1880. Read the article - it lists all the known contacts with the Sentinelese.  Lack of eye witness testimony is not the absence of a crime, and the lack of any successful contacts is not proof that they don't know how to make fire. The assertion is just speculation. The case with Tasmanians prove, it was totally possible for a casual racist observer to conflate portable fire transportation technology with the &quot;primitive inability to make fire.&quot; The correct answer is no group of people have been found surviving in the world without fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In 1880 they should have known better because safety matches were a new invention. Bic lighters and Walmart magnesium were still some distance away.</p>
<p>If you try rubbing two sticks together or real flint and steel on natural tinder you will discover that it is a massive PITA and that you want to avoid this. On the same camping trip you may also figure out how to bank and rekindle a fire, which is just what every culture did whenever possible until very recently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to know more about the interpretation that they don't know how to create fire. I see it repeated all over the internet but not explained. Do you know what evidence is used to support that interpretation, and the degree of confidence associated with it?</p></div>		</li>
