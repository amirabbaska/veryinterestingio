			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting though that all current 4k hdr Blu-rays, and the Xbox one s/x all use the HDR 10 standard. Amazon video uses HDR10 and Netflix uses both HDR10 and Dolby vision. I've been told that DV is superior to HDR10, but ideally  you wanna get a TV that supports both standards. It's like the modern day hd-dvd vs blu ray format war. The way things are now, I can see HDR10 winning the war. There's so much more  HDR 10 content/devices that use HDR10. The main reason for that is HDR10 is open source, and unlike DV, companies don't have to pay a fee to utilize the technology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true. HDR10+ is also an upcoming standard to look out for. This is an upgrade from HDR10 incorporating dynamic metadata. But as you suggested a system that can run all standards would be the best bet</p></div>		</li>
