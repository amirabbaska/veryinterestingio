<blockquote>
<p>scientists explained how they stopped the light using a technique called electromagnetically induced transparency. </p>
<p>Halfmann and his colleagues fired a control laser beam at an opaque crystal, triggering a quantum reaction that turned the crystal transparent.
Then they directed a second light source at the now-transparent crystal. The control laser was then turned off, turning the crystal opaque. </p>
<p>The light from the secondary source remained trapped inside the crystal. </p>
<p>In addition, the opacity meant that the light inside could no longer bounce around â€” in other words, the light had been stopped. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if they turned the control laser back on, to make the crystal transparent, would the light from the second laser shoot out, even if the second laser was deactivated?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone curious:</p>
<p>The speed of light in water is approximately 225,000 km per second. While enormously fast, this is notably slower than the speed of light in a vacuum, which is 300,000 km per second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a faulty definition, though. The speed of light is constant; it does not change regardless of the medium. The speed at which light <em>travels through</em> a medium, however, can be decreased by forcing the light to take a longer path. </p>
<p>When light passes through, say, water, it must travel a longer path as a result of the water molecules that make the medium.</p></div>		</li>
