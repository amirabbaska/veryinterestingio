<p>at we just heard or thought, and so what we are about to say.</p>

<p>I believe you have some very good theories in there, and I've always thought that our layer of consciousness is used more often in times where the other parts of the brain are unsure of what to do, so it asks &quot;us&quot; to get the gist of it. </p>
<p>Kind of like how doing anything new is awkward at first, like riding a bike, the hind brain is like WTF is going on??  Consciousness is then asked to temporarily handle new tasks, albeit at a very basic level, until the other parts of the brain &quot;grasp&quot; the new task, and then put it on a sort of auto pilot for you, so that it feels like second nature, in order to have you available for the next &quot;bike&quot; it has to learn how to &quot;ride&quot;. The second part is especially important, because you are then more alert for possible dangers/opportunities, now that you don't have to manually think about riding the bike as much anymore. </p>
<p>That's definitely, imo, an error checking and correction loop, where it teaches itself what it needs to learn through having us do it awkwardly/manually, to the point where it gets it and is able to create a new &quot;auto pilot&quot; function.</p>
<p>I also think people who are life long learners stay more mentally agile for the same reason that people who exercise don't atrophy as fast into old age, if you don't use it, you lose it, and this includes your brain seeing your consciousness as an asset continually. If its not getting new information from you, and learning new things from you, its basically going to be auto piloting your life eventually, to the point some people seem like vegetables, while a professor or some other life long learning profession will still be mentally with it, long into old age. Of course their are exceptions to this, but those are my arm chair thoughts on it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Question, when you dream, your dreams have visuals right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not the OP, but I found your question interesting, since the one thing that blew my mind when I first heard of aphantasia was related to dreams.</p>
<p>I always heard people describing their dreams very vividly, with details, colors and all that, while for me, it always felt more like reading a description of the dream, like from a book, than properly experiencing it, if that makes sense. That still isn't exactly it, especially since your interpretation of books might differ a lot from mine! </p>
<p>Putting it another way, it's as if I experience the dream as directly as thoughts, or concepts. For example, taking my last dream, I can &quot;see&quot; it in the sense that I can recall what happened and describe it to you, but I'm not sure I can guarantee that I actually saw it, visually, to acquire my memories of it. </p>
<p>Man, this is hard to explain, sorry if it sounds like complete nonsense. </p>
<p>Even now, I'm still unsure if I really do carry this &quot;disability&quot; or if my mental images are the same as everyone else's and I just interpret them differently. It's weird, almost scary, to think that such a fundamental aspect of our consciousness can differ so greatly between persons.</p>
<p>Anyway, great question, I do enjoy trying to wrap my head around these concepts, hopefully the mess I've written also helps you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unsure if this is related, but when I tend to dream, if there's a person in my dream, the more I feel like I &quot;know&quot; a person, the less they are represented visually within the dream and the more they appear as just the concept of that person as I understand them. I tend to see things visually as just objects in the dream, but the more complex and alive they are in my mind, the more there just seems to be a presence there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but I know that I personally visually see the things in my dreams. Exactly like seeing everything else. Now, visualizing things in my head is completely different, I can see them, but not really (way too complicated to explain).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you do suffer from this affliction; contrast what you wrote with my experience reading a book on napoleonic war:</p>
<p><em>I can see the deep blue of their wool coats, which is vibrant against the cloudy grey sky. The sky is dark from gunsmoke, which I can smell and recognize right away. The distant sounds of cannon on men shouting can be heard, and I feel the cold of the frozen rain.</em></p>
<p>All of that I can experience as if I were really on that battlefield, seeing / smelling / hearing / feeling it, if I concentrate.</p>
<p>Have you ever been able to elicit any of these senses while reading? Seeing a flash of color, hearing a distant rumble, feeling a sudden chill?</p></div>		</li>
