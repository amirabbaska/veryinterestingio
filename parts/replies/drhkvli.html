			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, yes. But in filtration, usually there is an air gap, so when the force is removed the liquid doesn't flow back up through the filter paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In any kind of industrial setting its unusual to have an air gap after a filter. The mechanics of the filter are removing impurities (or whatever you're trying to remove) either through pore size or adhesion. An RO membrane uses a separation process where the impurities flow into a concentrated stream. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Osmosis is like gravity, it has direction. Reverse osmosis would be like going up in an elevator, you are going against the natural direction. You don't call jumping, &quot;forced falling&quot;. Jumping would be more akin to reverse falling.</p>
<p>I'd be surprised if this explanation makes sense to anyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Filtration is when the medium retains the impurities as the clean water passes through. Osmosis is different because the impurities are left on the other side of the membrane but not as much in the membrane itself. That means an osmosis membrane can be reused and can be used for longer than if it were actually filtering the impurities out of the water.</p>
<p>The word &quot;reverse&quot; is used because water is forced against, or in the reverse direction of the gradient, requiring external pressure to overcome the osmotic pressure that would ordinarily prevent water from going from high to low salinity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: in addition to producing purified water, reverse osmosis is used by maple syrup producers to remove water from maple tree sap. You get concentrated sap, which requires much less boiling to get to syrup stage, and water as a by-product.</p></div>		</li>
