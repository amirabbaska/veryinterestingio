At some point it had the same number leaving and returning.  That would be 100% relative humidity.  The amount of water air can hold is temperature and pressure dependent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, however the air doesn't actually &quot;hold&quot; the water saturation point has more to do with the thermal equalibrium of evaporation and condensation which is dependent on the temperature alone. The saturation vapor pressure is actually the same whether or not the air is there. In this way the name &quot;saturation&quot; is actually pretty misleading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So to be.... the most precise.... we should perhaps instead mention the low energy water molecules as being in water vapor that is coextensive with the air.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe say a cup, and mean the measurement (250ml) because a glass is usually 500+mls if you fill it, with fairly low surface area.    It'd take a couple weeks for your example, maybe like 5 days for like 100ml-200ml in a stocky, wide cup</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More on sweating.</p>
<p>People think that when you are covered in liquid sweat, your sweat glands are working correctly. Well, you are sweating, clearly, but liquid sweat on your body is a sign of your sweat glands being overloaded. When your sweat glands are working correctly, water is evaporating from your body. When they are over loaded, your body becomes covered in sweat. If your body was composed of alcohol, your sweat glands would be much much more effective, but alcohol is poisonous to living cells, so that's a problem. </p>
<p>If you want to do a little experiment, put a little water on your wrist and blow on it. Wipe it off, then put a little alcohol on your wrist and blow on it. The alcohol will feel much colder on your skin when you are blowing on it. This is due to the alcohol evaporating much much quicker from your body, and taking heat with it.</p>
<p>So alcohol has a very high evaporation rate. It is very effective at transporting heat away.</p>
<p>Water has a medium evaporation rate. It is somewhat effective at transporting heat away.</p>
<p>People think oil does not evaporate at all. This is not true. Oil evaporates very very slowly. You could set some oil out on a counter and it would eventually evaporate over the course of years and years. This makes oil very very bad at transporting heat away through evaporation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is convoluted reasoning.</p>
<p>Whether or not your sweat glands are working correctly has nothing to do with whether or not the sweat is evaporating.</p>
<p>In other words, your sweat glands can be working correctly, but still be ineffective at controlling your body temperature.</p>
<p>You wouldn't say that someone's sweat glands are &quot;working incorrectly&quot; if they spend 20 minutes in a sweat lodge and come out covered in liquid sweat.  Their glands are working perfectly fine.  They just aren't <em>effective</em> because the humidity of the air inside the lodge is too high.</p>
<p>Also, to say that one's sweat glands are &quot;overloaded&quot; implies that they can't deliver sweat fast enough.  But the failure of sweat to evaporate is not a problem of sweat glands failing to deliver sweat.  It's a problem of the air not allowing sufficient evaporation.  Sweat accumulates because your sweat glands are working marvelously, but the air is not capable of evaporating that sweat fast enough.</p>
<p>In fact, it is when your skin is <em>dry</em> and you are overheated that your sweat glands are &quot;overloaded&quot; - meaning, the failure of your sweat glands to deliver sweat is the step in the perspiration process that is preventing you from cooling down.  It is in this case that the capacity of your sweat glands to secrete sweat is the limiting factor in cooling you down, rather than the evaporation rate allowed by air conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evaporation rate is also impacted by overall humidity. I can tell when itâ€™s super humid by (among other things) when my sweat stays around vs evaporating immediately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humidity sucks so much ass. The knowledge that the beading of sweat indicates your natural cooling system isn't working effectively makes it seem even worse. </p>
<p>Honestly it's kind of surprising that on high temp, high humidity days people aren't dropping like flies, especially folks that tend to sweat a lot.</p></div>		</li>
