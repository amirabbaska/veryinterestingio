			<div class="markdown"><p>Drone does touch the car. It's hovering by churning a mass of air that is sloshing inside the car cabin. Since air has a lot of give, the drone will &quot;lag&quot; in acceleration or deceleration, but it still moves as a unit together with the car and the mass of air inside it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean even easier is you can just feel it. You're traveling the same speed down a straight road? You feel totally stationary. You brake, you're pushed forwards. You accelerate, you're pulled back into your seat. You make a turn, you feel pulled to side opposite of the turn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any acceleration would cause the drone to move the opposite direction of the acceleration vector. Cornering causes a centripetal acceleration toward the inside of the corner. So yes, the drone would move toward the outside of the car. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, making a turn at constant speed is actually decelerating to zero in one direction and accelerating to your previous speed in another. </p>
<p>To see a real world example of this, put a dog in the back of a station wagon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything makes a lot more sense when you think about velocity instead of speed. Speed only represents 1 thing, how fast something moves. Velocity represents 2 things, how fast something moves and the direction it goes in.</p>
<p>If you are driving north at 50km/hr and you turn east but stay at a constant 50km/hr then your speed hasn't changed but your velocity has. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is because helium is less dense than air, which makes it lighter. When you turn the car, the air in the car is moving opposite of the direction you turn the car, this builds pressure on the same side. Since helium is less dense, the denser air is pushing the helium filled balloon to the same side of the car the car is turning. <a href="https://youtu.be/y8mzDvpKzfY" target="_blank">SmarterEveryDay did a video about this behaviour.</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Air density. Air is a fluid and as you move forward that fluid pools in the back of the car. The balloon is less dense than the air at the back and thus moves forward.</p></div>		</li>
