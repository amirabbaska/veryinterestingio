			<div class="markdown"><p>This is possibly one of the clearest and strongest answers I've read on here.</p>
<p>Currently I am a medic though I spent a large portion of my youth living and breathing mma.  </p>
<p>Anecdotally, I was very comfortable and became very adept at angling off on punches and essentially attacking them... with my face.  Most people thought because I seemed unphased that I possessed some super human propensity to take blows to the head.  When really it's just about timing and spatial awareness. </p>
<p>Realistically it is just a calculation where you change the angle the attack is coming from by altering your own position. </p>
<p>So by tucking and slightly turning your head you are stabilising your skull for impact and ideally mitigating transfer of kinetic energy to the target (your face).  If performed properly you won't get that whiplash effect which is generally the most serious offender regarding generation of concussions.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that you don't still suffer trauma, it's just generally much less trauma. Lower levels of concussions on the scale and less of them overall over the course of a match or bout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a running joke in Bonfire of the Vanities that this super vain state prosecutor is really proud of how well developed his sternocleidomastoids are. He doesn't have time to exercise anything else, but he works out his sternocleidomastoids every day. And he thinks women must find it irresistible when he flexes them.</p>
<p>Then later on in the book this female witness is being cross examined and the Defence asks her &quot;so did you find this lawyer attractive?&quot; and she replies &quot;hell no he kept on doing this weird gross thing with his neck&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In football they do exercises where they wrap towels around their heads, suspending weights in front of their face, so that they can exercise neck extensors.  In wrestling they do bridges where they arch their back (or bend forward at the waist) and rest their weight on their head and feet, thereby exercising the neck extensors (or flexors)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brain injury happens when your head starts moving really fast and forces your brain to hit your skull. The best way to stop this is to use neck muscles to resist the hit and make your head move a little slower. Also, when your jaw is big, getting hit there moves your head fast, and you don't want that. So, having a small jaw and big neck muscles is best for boxing.</p></div>		</li>
