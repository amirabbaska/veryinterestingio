			<div class="markdown"><p>Browsing through some of the talk pages on Wikipedia, there seems to be a very inconsistent application of what is authoritative or credible. And it seems to vary depending on the bias of the collective group of moderators that essentially &quot;own&quot; the page.</p>
<p>Some moderators seem to develop a sense of ownership over their wiki page and aim to ensure it doesn't deviate. Now, individual academic sources all have a bias. One course I took was the Pacific theatre in world war two. Academic texts argued in favour and against the atomic bombings. They had their bias.</p>
<p>But Wikipedia is often referred to as this &quot;overview&quot;, but this overview often gives you only one side of the academic debate. Or over-emphasizes the debate to one side. So, for a lot of students who are approaching a topic at the very beginning of their understanding, it can immediately slant them to one side instead of them forming their own conclusion through their independent investigation of numerous sources.</p>
<p>I still check Wikipedia for quick facts. (To continue the history theme), stuff like names, dates, etc. But anything else, I don't even use it to acquire sources, because those sources aren't necessarily the best in the field, or even close to being representative of the academic debate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could not agree more. The Wiki's on the various flavor of socialism are extraordinarily biased and slanted towards using a rather academically inbred set of modern scholars while summarily excluding contemporary (1920-1950'-ish) sources and older academic work. Any attempt to bring these into the article (say for example Mise's criticisms and exploration of socialism) have been routinely met with hostility, and in some cases, bans. It is not exactly a balanced source. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, but sometimes, people - even (especially?) on Wikipedia - like to pretend all &quot;sides&quot; have equal merit and deserve equal time and coverage. 9/11 conspiracy theories are a great example. Is an article on 9/11 conspiracy theories in order? You bet it is. But should the primary 9/11 articles give &quot;equal time&quot; to crackpot theories that collapse in the face of almost any rational thought? Fuck no.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>They often defer to general wisdom on a topic, not the actual authorities. In the Chronicle of Higher Education there was an essay by a historian who complained that he had written several books on a particular topic and then tried to correct the Wikipedia entry and was continually uncorrected by the moderator who said that &quot;what you propose has not been made authoritative yet.&quot;</p>

<p>If he was citing his own books as sources, that's very discouraged on Wikipedia. It's quite common for authors to try to use Wikipedia as a way to promote their books. Even if he was being honest with his edits, there's still the issue that he is biased in favor of his own books and may give undue weight to their content. The Wikipedia stance is that if an author's book is worth sourcing, someone other than the author will include it as a source.</p>
<p>That being said, there is a known problem with moderators on Wikipedia. Officially, they have no more editing authority than regular editors and only have some extra rights. Unofficially, they have an immense amount of power and control over the edits made to an article. They will often prevent edits that they don't like, regardless of the credibility of the source. There's not much you can do unless you get another moderator involved, but they typically take a hand-off approach to these issues. If a moderator takes ownership of a page, the article is going to be heavily biased in favor of his or her views.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reddit has moderators. Wikipedia has admins: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators</a></p>
<p>Yes, you're right that admins often have more power, but it's that they are really into Wikipedia and so they devote more time to editing and have more knowledge about the rules than you, not power granted to them by their administrator privileges. With the exception of being able to lock pages. They can ban people though but only if your behaviour is against the rules. </p></div>		</li>
