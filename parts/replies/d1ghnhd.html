<p>This is a CNN link, but it mentions studies where the amount of sunlight might have an effect on factors that control the growth of the eye: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/06/01/myopia.causes/" target="_blank">http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/06/01/myopia.causes/</a> </p>
<p>They interview Kathryn Rose and when I look her up, I find this article: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15555525" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15555525</a></p>
<p>And from here: <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/health-sciences/staff/first_lastname.shtml" target="_blank">http://sydney.edu.au/health-sciences/staff/first_lastname.shtml</a></p>
<p>&quot;In 2005, she co-authored a refereed review of literature regarding development of myopia. As the first comprehensive meta-analysis undertaken of this topic in at least twenty years and the approaches to analysis in this paper were sufficiently innovative that it was the subject of an article in New Scientist and has been citied over 100 times since publication in the top ranking ophthalmic journal.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In animal models it works like this:</p>
<p>Myopia happens when the eye grows too &quot;long&quot; from front to back, causing the focal point of the lens to move away from the retina.  When light is focused properly on the retina, certain cells detect the increase in illumination and produce dopamine.  This slows the growth of the eye, preventing myopia.  But in dim lighting, the cells of the eye don't get enough bright light to produce enough dopamine to slow the growth of the eyeball, resulting in nearsightedness.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could it also be an effect of long periods of close-up work? Like an office job would require, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you go back and read some of Kathryn Rose's work, you'll find it's apparently related to lack of the constant changes in visual environments, so like a kid who plays outdoors a LOT, doesn't get myopia, but the kid who stays inside a lot, does.  I believe they also considered a genetic component to that as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a study of inuit children before and after they began receiving modern educations (involving reading and writing things up close). Before the inuit rarely had vision problems, afterwards myopia was as common as it is anywhere else in the western world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but that doesn't mean that the reading and writing up close resulted in the myopia.  It could be that once you start learning you spend more times indoors during the day (in class) and more time reading indoors at night.  So it could still be possible that it's caused by lack of sunlight because you spend more time indoors when you are in education.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your graph implies that from 1950 to 2000, the prevalence of near-sightedness in those four &quot;Asian Tiger&quot; countries went from around 30% to around 80%.  Did something happen between 1930 and 1980 that caused indoor lighting to become dimmer?  On the contrary, I would think the opposite, as those countries became richer, their indoor lighting should have become better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh... and that indoor lighting is dimmer than outdoor lighting (i.e. the Sun).  Got it.  That makes more sense.</p>
<p>I wonder if the graph looks similar for already developed countries, and for still undeveloped countries.  Probably yes to the former and no to the latter.</p></div>		</li>
