<p>a vacuum is a superconductor of light</p>

<p>You and /u/KToff are confusing your terminology here. Conduction is not a phenomenon that refers to electromagnetic waves. Conductivity is a measure of how easily electric current flows in a medium in response to an applied electric field. Electric current is the movement of charge carriers, usually free electrons. Metals have a lot of free electrons, making them good conductors. </p>
<p>In conductors, thermal motion of atoms causes collisions that slow down the drift velocity of electrons, which can be interpreted as a decrease in conductivity. Thus, lowering the temperature of the material will reduce this thermal motion and increase the conductivity. This is true of all conductors. Superconductors are special materials which, at very low temperatures, have extremely large conductivities, allowing current to flow very easily through the medium.</p>
<p>Conversely, a vacuum has no matter, so it obviously has no free electrons. Thus the conductivity of a vacuum is zero. We call this type of material an ideal dielectric, meaning that it's the best natural insulator that exists.</p>
<p>What you're thinking of is how easily <em>fields</em> propagate through a medium. A vacuum is the only truly lossless medium, so an electromagnetic wave can travel forever through a vacuum with no attenuation. </p>
<p>Compare that to a conductor. <a href="http://www.antenna-theory.com/tutorial/electromagnetics/electric-field-boundary-conditions.php" target="_blank">This</a> page explains it well. In a nutshell, the tangential component of an electric field gets canceled when charge carriers reorient themselves and the normal component just bounces off. Thus an electromagnetic wave can't propagate in a perfect conductor at all.</p>
<p>In reality perfect conductors don't exist, and some electromagnetic radiation can always penetrate a short distance into a material. This distance is called the skin depth, and is dependent on a few intrinsic properties of the medium (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permittivity" target="_blank">permittivity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism\)" target="_blank">permeability</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity" target="_blank">conductivity</a>) as well as the frequency of the wave.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> A vacuum and a perfect conductor are actually complete opposites of each other. In general, higher conductivity means it's harder for fields to propagate, but easier for currents. So a vacuum and a superconductor (closest thing we have to a perfect conductor) are actually opposite ends of the spectrum. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permittivity#Classification_of_materials" target="_blank">table</a> summarizes this, with a vacuum representing the top row and a perfect conductor representing the bottom row.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my defence I did say &quot;in a way&quot;. And a vacuum is a perfect conductor of light in the sense that it transmits light with no losses.</p>
<p>The word 'to conduct' isn't reserved solely for electric current. There is also 'thermal conductivity' for instance. And more generally 'to conduct' something simply means 'to serve as a medium'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was picking up on ops terminology even though it is technically wrong. A &quot;superconductor for light&quot; is meant as an analogy to an actual superconductor with the main characteristic that it conducts current in a lossless manner. In much the same way, vacuum allows lossless transmission of light so while vacuum doesn't technically conduct light, it has the properties that a layperson would attribute to a &quot;superconductor for light&quot;</p>
<p>An old professor of mine used to say, not everything that is correct is helpful, and not everything that is incorrect unhelpful. For example pi does not equal 3 is correct but completely useless information. On the other hand pi equals 3 is incorrect but very helpful for approximation of pi</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is already concentrated solar power and some use thermal energy storage to deliver power continuously. Another variant is concentrated solar with heat and power cogeneration where light is concentrated on solar cells and the heat is also captured and stored by heating up something like water or salt. Afterwards it can used both for electricity or one for electricity and the other for heat.</p>
<p>Regarding storing light itself, maybe BEC might work</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK6HxdUQm5s" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK6HxdUQm5s</a></p>
<p>There is also an approach using crystals, I don't know the efficiency</p>
<p><a href="https://physics.aps.org/featured-article-pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.033601" target="_blank">https://physics.aps.org/featured-article-pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.033601</a></p>
<p>Of note is that all this research is mostly for light based computers, stopping light after processing as a sort of memory. There is probably redundancy in play here, though they likely always aim for high energy efficiency. Personally I doubt it would be cost effective to store light as a form of energy storage, data has more value than kWh so the economics there work differently.</p>
<p>At any rate, if someone wants to make this feasible, economical, practical, scalable globally, I'm not going to stop them, just warning them it will be a long and difficult process. Higher efficiency solar cells and batteries are available right now and it will take less effort and research to scale them up compared to photonic energy storage and you still need solar cells to transform it into usable electricity at the end so basically it's competing with batteries. Most likely advantage is that it could be very long lasting, assuming it's done with crystals. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's actually not just light based computers, but optical quantum computers. That's one reason why we are interested in such memories, the other being quantum information networks and there most prominently quantum repeaters.</p></div>		</li>
