			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, that's a hard one. I get &quot;enough&quot; sleep for sure, and only usually get up once per night to go to the bathroom. My issue is that I have almost <em>never</em> woken up feeling good/refreshed. I average at around 8.5 hours, still snooze 30 minutes every day and am late to work. I've tried sleeping less...8 hours, 7.5, 7.</p>
<p>On the weekends, even though I get up at 8:10-30 every day, I literally sleep an unlimited amount. If I go to bed at midnight, I can sleep till noon, and snooze till 1, 2, or 3. There is <strong>no</strong> amount of sleep that is ever enough, hahah. And I'm also tired on the weekends without coffee, and tired in the afternoons after lunch.</p>
<p>It's pretty annoying but me and my mom are the same. We can <em>never</em> get enough sleep and just <em>love</em> laying in bed in the morning. It's honestly bliss for me, and it makes me mad when people wake up early on the weekends, haha. I heard that having had mono at some point can mess your sleep requirement up.</p>
<p>What about you!?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We may be twins haha. However, I'm the opposite when I sleep I struggle to fall asleep and stay awake into the night and maybe get 6 hours of sleep. But I'm the same when sleeping in the next day I can just lay down and stay chilling till 12pm. But this is only on my days off of work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your description was super on point with the shitty nap feeling. I used to take naps after work on days that I'm especially tired, but after a couple naps like that I stopped and just try to tough it out till my normal bed time.</p>
<p>For me anything between an hour to three hours and I'm going to wake up feeling super sick. It feels like I took some dissociative drug mixed with methadone and some blood pressure medication. The only thing that fixes it is getting a full nights rest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe try a shorter nap? I tried the 15 min nap yesterday and it actually made me feel better. No &quot;what the fuck&quot; -ness</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly like me too! I always feel weird, because everyone else I know loves naps. Meanwhile I wake up with post-nap depression, until I go to sleep for reals. </p></div>		</li>
