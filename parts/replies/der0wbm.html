<p>An important thing to understand is that the DM is running the game. He is not trying to defeat the players (that would be easy - rocks fall, everyone dies) but to create an interesting challenge. </p>

<p>The DM is really the glue that holds a campaing together. It's the most demanding role, generally requiring many hours of preparations between sessions. Being an experienced player helps a lot to be DM as knowing the rules, monsters, etc helps redirect the campaing more smoothly when your players pull some strategy you hadn't thought of out of their hat (which happens often). </p>
<p>Pre-made campaings can help a new DM with the creative story-telling aspect but they cannot compensate for the knowledge of the rules and elements of D&amp;D. </p>
<p>As others have suggested you guys should look into existing groups in your area and try to play with experienced players (and DM!) for your first few campaings. You'll learn a lot faster this way and it'll surely be more fun. </p></div>		</li>
