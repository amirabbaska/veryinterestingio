			<div class="markdown"><p>So, is it abnormal if your temperature is always under 98 degrees and you rarely get fevers even with an illness that a fever usually accompanies? My temperature is always 96.8-97.5 and throughout my life doctors and nurses have said &quot;well, you don't have a fever&quot; and kind of shrug off my symptoms despite my being very sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a doctor with two kids and I don’t own a thermometer at home. When the kids are sick, they act sick. I don’t need a temp to prove it. One of them had the flu last week. I know because he had the flu. </p>
<p>That said, it’s not that a temperature is useless. In a patient with ambiguous symptoms, it can be very helpful. Or let’s say a 55 year old cirrhotic who is encephalopathy comes in on a stretcher. It may make a big difference if he has a temp of 38.5. </p>
<p>But for home use— colds and whatnot— the symptoms are what matter, not the temp. The obvious exceptions are obvious... chemo patients, transplant patients, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi. I've got a lot of documented evidence about my body temp being consistently low, thanks to hospital stays where they take readings very regularly. When each new medic takes it three times because &quot;that can't be right&quot;, they start making notes in your file and after 25+ years it adds up. I've also got &quot;surprisingly&quot; low blood pressure and a bunch of neuro and autoimmune conditions so if there's a test result I can possibly get &quot;wrong&quot; I probably already have.   </p></div>		</li>
