			<div class="markdown"><p>That said, if you worked at a bank, you could get around this by &quot;kiting&quot; checks - writing checks between accounts while previous checks were still clearing. My friend's dad went to jail for this because he was a scumbag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of lower income people survived this way--run out of food a couple days before payday? The money will (probably) be there before they cash the check, so no harm in getting it now. I know a couple who got hit with bounced check fees because they tried to do that and Walmart had started cashing checks instantaneously. I imagine it's harder to do now, though some people still postdate checks (and some places won't take postdated checks).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, check were basically used as a a 3 day semi-legal credit card? </p>
<p>I find it funny because we do it legally now. You don't have money ? Use credit card and pay it before the countdown it 0(30 days in that case). Sure with a credit card you get fees if you're late but it's basically the same process.</p></div>		</li>
