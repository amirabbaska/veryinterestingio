<p>I guess the antigen presenting cells are my warriors running around decorated in the skulls and bones of the vanquished invaders. With the B-cells being powerful warlocks who curse the remnants with the promise of death to all those of the same bloodline who dare pass into my realm again.</p>
<p>TIL my body is savage as fuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's called Deadpool because of the &quot;Deadpool&quot;. Based off an earlier movie with the same name. Basically people bet on who's going to die first, that's the &quot;deadpool&quot;. At least in the movie that's why he's called Deadpool. I think Rob Liefeld said something about the betting deadpool movie being an inspiration for his name. </p></div>		</li>
