			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the help. So, if they weren't necessarily talking about spacial dimensions, what dimensions (theoretical existence dimension, etc.) were they talking about? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many people consider them to be spatial dimensions, exactly like length, width and height, just compactified - curled up inside of atoms (essentially). That isn't the only interpretation, although there are several people here who have claimed I am flat-out incorrect for even suggesting that. The dimensions are just parameters by which you can define an object and its placement in the universe. Those parameters might be physical, they might be temporal (when in time it exists), they might be probabilistic (defined by the probability of something fitting a specific criteria), they might be other types.</p>
<p>Ultimately, one of the big points I failed to make in my initial post is that String Theory is a <em>very</em> work-in-progress and incomplete theory. The extra dimensions were originally conceived wholly because the math said they needed to. As String Theory progresses and better versions - Supersymmetry/Superstring, M-Theory, etc. - it gets closer to possibly predicting everything and being 100% consistent with the universe as it exists, but none of them currently do either of those things. Again, while ten spatial dimensions is the number required by some versions of ST (and is, in fact, the most &quot;elegant&quot; - there's that word again - number in Supersymmetry and other versions), it isn't the only number of dimensions that is suggested in all versions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, but even though you didn't technically write anything that's wrong, your answer doesn't have much to do with the question...</p>
<ol>
<li>The 10 dimensions in (super)string theory are, in fact, dimensions of spacetime. So no, when talking about this topic, we should not redefine the term dimension.</li>
<li>The extra dimensions don't have anything to do with &quot;interactions of the quantum world with the macro world&quot;.</li>
<li>10 dimensions is exactly the number that is needed for superstring theories. Yes, there are other string theories with a different number of dimensions (e.g. bosonic string theory with 26 dimensions), but they are not intended to model our universe.</li>
<li>And also, while you are trying to explain what dimensions are, the question was why there should be 10.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5nlfcl/eli5_why_does_string_theory_require_10_dimensions/dcct7rx/" target="_blank">This</a> answer gives a more correct answer to the question what those extra dimensions <em>are</em>, while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5nlfcl/eli5_why_does_string_theory_require_10_dimensions/dcdabl1/" target="_blank">this</a> is probably the best explanation one can give as to why it's exactly 10.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for a great explanation. For years I have been mislead by thinking of dimensions as directions you can move in that have distances you can measure - like the three dimensions we interact with each day. To (hopefully) paraphrase you, the higher dimensions in String Theory don't really describe a measurable space, they describe attributes of subatomic interaction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they do mean dimensions and distances you can actually measure. I'm not sure what the OP is talking about. The dimensions in string theory are <em>small</em>, but are not that fundamentally different. String theory (or any other kind of extra-dimensions theory) also has nothing to do with quantum tunnelling. There are no extra dimensions (of even the 'generalized kind') involved in ordinary quantum phenomena. Existence is not a dimension.</p>
<p>Physicists <em>do</em> also use the word 'dimension' in this way--to refer to the number of independent ways you can vary the state of something, whether or not those ways correspond to distances. But in string theory they <em>are</em> honest to goodness spatial dimensions.</p>
<p>Kaluza-Klein theory initially used 5 dimensions because it was trying to incorporate electromagnetism into the same formalism as general relativity, and that only needs one extra dimension. The reason string theory requires ten dimensions specifically is quantum mechanical in nature: it's not easy to find sensible quantum versions of classical theories, and some symmetries that the theory needs to make sense are spoiled in the classical-&gt;quantum transition in anything other than 10D. This is conveniently also probably necessary to &quot;continue&quot; the Kaluza-Klein idea and incorporate <em>all three</em> other forces (electromagnetism, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear) as arising from extra geometry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Existence as a dimension&quot; was a metaphor I was using. I never said it was a dimension, and explicitly stated that it wasn't. The same with my Quantum Tunneling example, which I also stated was just for the purpose of explanation and not intended to describe actual reality.</p>
<p>Saying that these higher dimensions have actual size is not really accurate, since they're &quot;curled up&quot; and not measurable as describing any actual amount of space. They're primarily mathematical constructs used representatively, not physical spaces. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of the dimensions as fundamental parameters, conditions that describe the underlying basic qualities of the particles. They're not properties, like density, so that description doesn't really properly explain them either. </p>
<p>Michiu Kaku, who catches a lot of crap for not dismissing some ideas which are pretty clearly woo, is nonetheless a really great theoretical physicist. His book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperspace-Scientific-Parallel-Universes-Dimension/dp/0192861891" target="_blank">Hyperspace</a> gives some great explanation of higher dimensions than I can summarize here. There is an easily-Googleable PDF of the book available for free, but I recommend buying it and supporting the author and his work, and the willingness of publishers to commission scientific books for laymen like this one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, something like that. For example in physics people say stuff that an object has 8 degrees of freedom (or can move in 8 dimensions) if it can move forward/back, up/down, left/right and spin left/right.<br />
So the extra dimensions are not like a physical one in the terms of physics.<br />
But im far from an extert in this field, so this might be wrong.</p></div>		</li>
