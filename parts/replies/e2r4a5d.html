			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of a non-answer though, isn't it? 'yellow seems brighter compared with black than other colours do when compared with black'? So... Yellow seems brighter than other colours because it seems brighter than other colours? The question is <em>why</em> is this true? I also can't seem to find any sources online to support the idea that yellow+black is higher contrast than white+black.  </p></div>		</li>
