			<div class="markdown"><p>I got canker sores from the age of 7 to 22. Read online in a somewhat obscure study that sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is the main cluprit. Also acidic and spicy food exacerbate problem, but I am not giving those up.</p>
<p>Went to store and every single toothpaste had SLS, went to Walgreens and finally found Sensodyne Pronamel doesn't have it. This was before sensodyne was sold everywhere. I switched to Sensodyne and two weeks later was canker sore free, and have never gotten one again. That was 11 years ago. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sodium laurel sulfate definitely can irritate the gums, and it's only purpose in toothpaste is to foam up. That's all it does. Just foams the toothpaste, which does nothing at all to make your teeth cleaner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Woah wait really? For as long as I can remember I had canker sores. A few years ago I just stopped using toothpaste. Still brush every day but without the paste. Now that I think about it that's like the same timeframe when I stopped getting cold sores. Imma google that study. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Rinse in warm salt water twice a day to kill the infection. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My best friend used to get them constantly because of one of her canine teeth would chomp down on the side of her mouth. Like 5Ã— a week. At CVS they sell these things that look like half blue half white tablets that you put on it and it dissolves into a gel and stays attached, covering it until the sore heals. No idea what its called. But she swears by them.</p>
<p>Edit: just looked it up, literally just called &quot;canker cover&quot; canker sore patch. You can eat and drink with them, they won't move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Over a year ago I tried another &quot;ailment&quot; to tackle this problem but for once I actually got results. I take one 500mcg B12 every morning and two things happened. 1) I can now go months without a canker sore 2) On the odd chance I start to get one it heals up before it even enters the painful phase and just goes away. In the year and a half I've started this I've only gotten one painful canker sore. I used to get them just about monthly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was getting canker sores frequently for many, many years. I could never figure out why. Then one day I came across a post here on reddit where someone mentioned that there is a substance in most toothpastes that cause canker sores for some people.</p>
<p>I immediately looked it up, and found a toothpaste that didn't have that substance. I haven't had a single canker sore since then. It is seriously an immense life improvement.</p>
<p>Every time I hear a friend or family member mention that they get canker sores, I urge them to try switching toothpaste like I did. It has worked for every single person so far. It is extremely strange to me that this is such a common problem, and nobody seems to know that toothpaste is the cause for most people.</p>
<p>The substance is called &quot;<strong>Sodium Lauryl Sulfate</strong>&quot;. If you have problems with canker sores, please go check if your toothpaste contains that.</p>
<p>I think it could also be called &quot;Sodium laureth sulfate&quot;, &quot;Sodium dodecyl sulfate&quot;, &quot;Laurilsulfate&quot;, &quot;SDS&quot;, &quot;SLS&quot; or &quot;SLES&quot;.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TL;DR: If you get canker sores, check if your toothpaste contains &quot;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate&quot;</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. </p>
<p>I don't have nearly as many outbreaks of canker sores after switching toothpaste.</p>
<p>Didn't know the name of the ingredient causing this was SLS until now, I believe it is there to give you that insanely minty fresh feeling in most types of paste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandpa, father, and me (when I was younger) all suffered from them. The only thing I can tell you that prevents them is using Sodium-Laureth Sulphate (SLS) free toothpaste. I usually just order mine on Amazon but I've gotten it at Walgreens before too. Since I've switched toothpastes, I get canker sores probably once a year and they were much smaller, less painful, and didn't last as long. </p></div>		</li>
