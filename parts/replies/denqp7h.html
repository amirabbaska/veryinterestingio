			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you mean &quot;this is used in the USA, against citizens of the USA&quot; (which is not so relevant for most of the world, except the rage citizens of the USA could create against their government). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Americans&quot; is the term used to describe citizens of the United States of America. &quot;America&quot; is an acceptable term used to address the United States of America. While there are other countries in North &amp; South America, their citizens are not called Americans. They're called Canadians, Mexicans, Brazillians, etc. </p></div>		</li>
