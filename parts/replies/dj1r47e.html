<p>I remember cases where Hong Kong was trying to force Japan to apologize and compensate for their atrocities. </p>
<p>It is not difficult to find people who were still upset at Imperial Japan. Just look at maps of their occupied territories, and you'll find people who will be very upset at the Imperial Japanese flag. Coupled with a lack of apology, acknowledgement and education of the Japanese people to understand what was done in WW2, it's hardly a surprise that there are Asian countries that don't see eye to eye with Japan. </p>
<p>The comfort women article on Wikipedia is a chilling read even with its rather neutral language. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were actually a bunch of foreigners that were appalled by what they saw, but people didn't really pay attention to them.</p>
<p>One of these was John Rabe, who was a German Nazi. He was actually in Nanjing at the time and trying to save the Chinese in his compound...all the while the japanese troops were making excuses and saying they saw soldiers run into his compound to try and get in to kill more Chinese people. The dude actually wrote about it in his journals, and then also went back to Germany to try and get ppl to put pressure on Japan to stop that shit. He was pretty much told to shut up tho. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There are the human experiments they did on people in China, all kinds of rank shit, like live dissections, freezing peoples extremities off to see what happens.</p>
<p>But none of this really happened or was not talked about in the western countries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, the Nazis had their fair share of human experiments, with the likes of Josef Mengele.</p></div>		</li>
