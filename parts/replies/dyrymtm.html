<blockquote>
<p>At the moment all we can really say for certain is &quot;fusion will be expensive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't think so. I am pretty sure, that nobody can exactly say, how expensive fusion will be. The fuel is rather cheap because it is simply water that gets treated in a special way. So the price is largely depending on how much energy can be harnessed in one plant/how big can one plant be build and on how expensive that plant is. </p>
<p>I mean sure</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This naturally means that the cost of a working fusion plant will run into the tens of billions just to build the damn thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, it will also produce a hella lot of energy. And the price is basically building cost/kWh of produced energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your optimism. I like to be optimistic  and get people excited about science and futurism. But fusion as we know it is dependent on tritium (possibly helium-3 in the future). It's not rather cheap, because it is not &quot;simply water&quot;. Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare on Earth. The next best sources are heavey water nuclear reactors and lithum-6 fusion.</p>
<p>Regular hydrogen fusion is even farther off than tritium deuterium fusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that is what I meant with it gets treated in a special way. When deuterium gets bombarded by neutrons, you receive tritium. Thus, the idea is to build a blanket in the fusion reactor for tritium production.</p>
<p>(on a side note, of course it is rare. Tritium is radioactive and has a rather small half life of 12.3 years)</p></div>		</li>
