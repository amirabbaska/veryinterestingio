<p>Back to the CP problem and why it is a thought crime. If I view sexual imagery of children, the thought is I have the &quot;potential&quot; to harm children or promote the harming of children. So I must be jailed for the &quot;potential&quot; and not for the crime of raping children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CP depicts actual children being raped. A lot of CP is sold and made for profit. By acquiring and sharing those images you are promoting the actual rape of actual children. </p>
<p>CP being illegal is not &quot;thought crime&quot;. You can sit around and jack off to fantasies of raping children all day, that's not illegal. <em>Posession</em> of CP material is illegal, not the thoughts in your head. </p></div>		</li>

<p>While that is a sound argument (in the same logical way as how sharing or buying porn without knowing the actors are treated well, or buying chocolate from areas that routinely employ indentured servitude, or buy electronics from factories in areas with &quot;flexible&quot; labor laws can also be discouraged). That isn't the actual justification for the laws in the book.</p>
<p>In fact, if a justification like this existed in the proposed legislation for any law, the principle would likely be discarded the instant it would come to a vote. Simply because the instructional or educational aspect of the law would be very fuzzy, and the culpability would be very difficult to pinpoint; the &quot;value proposition&quot; of the law would be questionable, as it would encourage individual responsibility to a quite detailed and thorough degree. Rather than operate on the biblical suppression of inherited sin (or &quot;discouraging crazies&quot;, as one said), like we're supposed to have. </p>
<p>But the justification for the laws regarding porn, violence and graphic depictions is very overtly that it should not be promoted. With the unexplained raider that child pornography, like murder, has to be punishable by law to not occur constantly and without restraint.</p>
<p>This curious situation has some of us often wonder what exactly is wrong with many elected officials. Until they.. you know.. get caught having random, unfaithful gay sex in a public restroom, for payment in cash -- right before going with their wives and children to the Capitol to promote healthy families and sexual morals by banning gays and all the other things god hates.</p>
<p>Then we sort of don't wonder any more.</p>
<p>But the fact remains - we do not, in any law, deliberately make something illegal to posess on the grounds that buying it or owning it promotes the actual act. Which certainly would make sense, considering how far we do go when it comes to making thoughts, images and writing illegal. Heck, publishing private data can easily be a crime if it's marked &quot;classified&quot; rather than &quot;personal&quot; (in which case it's just a &quot;scandal&quot; - unless it's the personal remarks of a senior public official, of course, then it is a crime too, specially if the personal thoughts are very stupid - then we're talking treason). </p>
<p>In other words, merely posessing the material in this case is a crime, on the danger of it poisoning the public awareness of it. So it certainly would be logical if we outlawed, say, Chocolate production in general on the simple basis that some of it promotes child-labor and slavery. </p>
<p>/And/ then made the people who eat it in public punishable for that said offense, of at the very least deliberately promoting slavery. If not being slavers themselves.</p>
<p>In fact, if you were in posession of syntetic chocolate. Or - analogous to owning any of the family photos that commonly are indexed by internet vigilantes and flagged as porn - eating something that /reminds us/ of chocolate. Then you should be potentially punishable by law as well. Although apparently only if you - at the time - thought about chocolate as a concept.</p>
<p>And this obviously would make sense, because Chocolate slavery is of course a much bigger problem than Child Porn globally. Why, for all we know, Chocolate could /lead/ to child pornography through the promotion of slavery! Chocolate should obviously be vilified much more than Child Porn! Rabblerabble.</p>
<p>Etc., etc.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, the actual justification for a piece of legislation is not based on the long casual chain that eventually leads to a criminal act. </p>
<p>Conventional ethics systems of course don't assign guilt of a crime to anyone who discovers it, but the one who committed the act, yeah?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the educational effect of legislation is something that increasingly is becoming more important than the nearer casual chains of events. The same goes for the instructional and educational purpose of punishment: one believes, often, that increasing penalties (as opposed to, say, proving that the justice system is fair and not extremely corrupt and hypocritical) will deter crime.</p>
<p>So as so eloquently pointed out above here, the justification for how Child Porn laws are put together is often to discourage the existence of it as an idea, in your mind, as a law-abiding citizen. And not to actually remove the material or the production of it. </p>
<p>And it is curious that one does often hear arguments that amount to how not exposing children to sexual material, and certainly avoiding ever introducing them to sex until they are about 40 or so. And of course associating monstrous guilt on the one hand, and social pressure on the other to publically abstain from such until at least the age of 40 - is educational and instructional. As we all know, 40 year old virgins with strict mothers and a suppressed sexuality are always pillars of society. Why, priests in the Catholic church for example are notorious for this. And certainly sexually suppressed immature 40-year olds in posession of child-pornography is, oh, extremely rare! </p>
<p>My goodness, no, being sexually aroused by prepubescent children exploring themselves for the first time is clearly a medical condition. </p>
<p>And obviously child abuse, rape, murder, and god knows what else is clearly not covering the concept of child abuse, rape, murder and god knows what else thoroughly enough. And so on.</p>
<p>While it is, similarily, a sign of societal health and good crime prevention policy, when a random picture of a smiling prepubescent child... without a shirt... makes you physically uncomfortable and afraid of being arrested, labeled an outcast from society and perhaps jailed.</p>
<p>Not to say child porn in every form shouldn't be illegal. But the argument that justifies the legislation - what we wanted to virginally explore here in this text - will consistently have a dominant educational and instructional element to it, like many other laws. </p>
<p>And promoting this aspect increasingly goes at the cost of actual practical considerations when it comes to enforcing these laws - child pornography laws being just one out of many of these. </p>
<p>In the sense that we are more concerned about condemning something we dislike the idea of and spectacularly punishing it once in a while, than we are about simply creating sensible rules and laws that make it illegal and punishable to engage in.</p>
<p>Of course, firebranding more consequence-ethically sound and disciplined legislation, under the banner of legalising posession of Child Pornography - is likely something we will not see in any parliament, in any country.</p>
<p>Although when a country can actually elect someone like Trump as president, I guess anything can happen! Freedom and Liberty, Bitch!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gore videos also depict actual murder. Does that mean all people that view such material are promoting murder?  If so we should ban those too. We should also ban anything with the likeness such as lolicon and violent video games... and American football and rugby. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there was a industry devoted to murdering people in order to sell the gore videos, then a case could be made for banning gore videos, yes. That is not the case. The fact of the matter is that there is a clandestine industry devoted to the creation of CP for profit. </p>
<p>By watching gore videos, you are not promoting murder. By watching CP, you are promoting child rape. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep I would agree with you that some laws are based on human emotion. As an avid video gamer I feel it's fear of the unknown that makes people think that video games would potentially spread violence because it would be easy to link violence in games with real world violence. However there are many other media formats that do the exact same, TV shows, films, books and even the news all show plenty of violence. When someone sees violence in a movie, they usually have that part of themselves that reassures them they would never do such an act, but wouldn't mind learning from the experience of how violence affects others. The same goes for actually playing games. However to those who watch someone else play a violent video game, the same reassurance is no longer there, and instead, concern lingers. </p>
<p>What's worse is the media love to induce fear into people, making them concerned about violent video games being the cause or trigger of real world violence. Which makes it even hard to change their view even when they experience playing a violent video game. The truth is, it's always up to the person to make that final decision on whether to act out violence on others, and a lot of it probably had a lot to do with how they grew up as a child and how socially healthy they were. </p>
<p>Anyway, that's my take on it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Hear hear. Human character traits are made of a myriad of factors, most of which are outside our control. A personality is not something we have absolute control over, it takes years of dedicated influence, and the simple matter is that if a person is raised in an unhealthy environment, they are going to make poor decisions. You don't heal them by social condemnation, you do it by exposing them to a healthy environment. Exclusion and shaming tactics mostly just make them worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you point out examples of lawmakers using emotional judgements? I'm having trouble constructing counterpoints. I'm also having trouble figuring out the meaning of &quot;What we are doing is not attacking the root of the problem which is the heart and mind.&quot;</p>
<p>The idea of hate crimes being more heinous than regular crimes is not a matter of emotion; rather, it is a reaction to the effects that the motivation of &quot;hate&quot; (prejudice) can have on the victim and society as a whole. Crimes motivated by hate can cause additional trauma and stress to the victim and those who identify themselves as the same hated category as the victim. </p>
<p>Now, as for the CP. I agree with you that being jailed for the &quot;potential&quot; of raping children is unjust. However, I believe being jailed for possession of CP, real CP with real children, is not.</p>
<p>In the production of CP, everything is intentional. Someone must convince or coerce the child into sexual situations. Someone must condone and cause the CP, including the trauma and violation that it entails. Someone who comes to possess said CP and does not move to alert the authorities must acknowledge that the CP was intentionally created and intended for viewing. This inaction in the face of intentionally produced CP reinforces the idea that intentional production of CP is acceptable. That is what you are jailed for. You will face prejudice for the &quot;potential&quot; to commit CP, but you should not be jailed for it. </p>
<p>I'll leave it at that for now, but know that I am attempting to formulate a response for making any media of killing illegal. Honestly, I do see your point there, as I am having difficulty finding reasons that do not include the idea of what is socially abhorrent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for the late reply. I felt like my initial argument about drugs, hate crimes, thought crimes would cover the basis for the argument, but your questioning of the emotional judgement makes me rethink the premise of my initial argument. What I mean by that statement is those things I mentioned are of course difficult to combat as a legislator. If I were to say, &quot;you are either for child porn or not,&quot; would yield an answer from any politician, &quot;of course I hate it. Why wouldn't I?&quot; So if I were to say the same of hate crimes it would look like: &quot;Do you think crime on the bases of race abhorrent?&quot;  You would have to answer, yes. Because racist action is indeed abhorrent to the sensibilities of the masses. So by those answers it would yield that anything controversial would have a reaction. As a smart politician I would of course vote that hate crime is more heinous then regular crime on the basis of prejudice or I would be run out of town. What I posit is that crime against humanity by right of restriction against others freedom is the only rule by which we should judge. It is not perfect as I stated earlier such as the right of animals. It even goes as far as unborn children and abortion.  The only real argument is an argument of causality. Does viewing CP or videos of murder promote such action, and should it be punishable?  We could go on and on, but I'm done there in the public sense unless you would like to debate it privately. I feel as though you might have an objective nature about you and thusly make for a good convo. No one has proven that a correlation is a good basis for legislation, such as banning all things violent. It is an issue with individual moral code, and pressing that code on others, as well as legislation based on something that emotionally seems bad. &quot;Do you want to rape children?&quot; &quot;Well, no!&quot;  So should we make special cases that even looking at material should be illegal on the bases of perhaps creating the &quot;thought&quot; of wanting to rape kids?  I feel like like laws regarding such things never reaches the root cause, and for that the masses can crucify me. I really do not care. I'm too old to give a shit except to perhaps try and adjust the staunch views of others by at least posing a counter argument. </p>
<p>Root cause analysis and prevention/assistance is the real way to win in my book. (This book may be fucked up due to the inherent hate for government control or oppression) As for the hearts and minds comment, drug abusers and sexually deviant people as defined by societal standards need therapy and not litigation. We see this time and time again from drug users needing social contact and racists needing to understand stereotyping and reality are different.  </p>
<p>Yes the perpetration of child molestation or rape is bad, but is the idea of viewing an image of it the same? Is the idea of viewing a cartoon of it the same?  If you believe it to be so, or believe that the viewing of violence is as bad as the actual perpetration of the act, then we must say we should be in a position as a society to ban these things and label them crime. I for one think education and the ability to receive assistance for any societal deviance the key to winning the battle for a safer society and culture. </p>
<p>If I didn't answer you appropriately then contact me and we can discuss, or you can say I need to go back to r/iamverysmart which is the thing you say when you can't understand other people's position on difficult matters. </p></div>		</li>
