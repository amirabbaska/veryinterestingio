			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it was meant as a literal step in the gun cleaning process, but an example to teach the importance of gun cleanliness. In a battlefield situation, it's a life or death situation; and a dirty gun can get you killed.</p>
<p>I'd imagine it's like the lieutenant or w/e having all the guys clean their guns, then he chooses one guy who has finished first and asks if his gun is clean. He says &quot;yes&quot;, so the Lt takes the gun and feigns putting a bullet in, spins it, then hands it back to him telling him he can't look at it, only pull the trigger. There's no bullet in any chamber, but It's a lesson he's teaching to everyone around and no matter how well you cleaned your gun, you wouldn't take that risk. The guy then admits he doesn't think it's clean enough, so he takes it back, pretends to remove a bullet and tells him to get his ass back cleaning. But now he understands the reality of the dangers of an unclean gun.</p>
<p>But then I'm also reading the Gulag Archipelago and wouldn't be surprised if it was actually the final test they would do...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only with the cylinder out of battery.</p>
<p>Also, the Russian revolvers if that era weren't the kind that swing open to load, they loaded via a loading gate.</p>
<p>They still used an indexing system though, so if spun in place, which would take some effort, the friction of the index notches and ratchet will determine where it stops, not the weighting of the cylinder.</p></div>		</li>
