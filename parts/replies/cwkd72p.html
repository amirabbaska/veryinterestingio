I think you may want to get a duplicate of the piece and keep modifying it until the effect no longer works (the size of the hole, the size of the chambers, can it be leaky and still work, weight of the ball) and find ways to measure anything to find out when it fails what other forces must be overpowering. If you could also get something to blow air at a consistent rate you could play with the other variables one at a time too. </p>
<p>I think the guesses about Bernoulli's sound reasonable but I wonder where the effect fails. </p></div>		</li>
