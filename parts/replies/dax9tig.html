			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the input! I guess I should rephrase my question to say ...a multitude of TICKETS for less than $10 USD...&quot; which is still something you don't see in the USA. </p>
<p>For your second point, I have flown Ryanair a handful of times and never paid more than the cost of the ticket. I printed my boarding pass form home, only had a carry-on backpack, didn't purchase anything on the plane, etc. I flew from Brussels to Budapest for $12 total ($2 RT + $10 purchasing fees), and didn't pay a cent more. It was lovely! </p></div>		</li>
