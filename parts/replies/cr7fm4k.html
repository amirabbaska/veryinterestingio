			<div class="markdown"><p>Question here, from a quick glance it seems like most of the items on the list are blocked simply because they have the word &quot;ad&quot; in them. </p>
<p>Couldn't these guys make the title of their ads something that's close to an integral part of most webpages so that there's a chance of Adblock accidentally blocking the integral part of the website, and therefore causing someone to turn off Adblock?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would, but people would likely think the website is broken instead of thinking it's the ad blocker's fault, so it wouldn't be a good idea to do this on purpose.</p>
<p>Some websites do this accidentally, but fortunately, the filter syntax has a way of specifying exceptions, so the maintainers can fix things for a particular web site without having to ease some of their previous rules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand the other answer.</p>
<p>Maybe the problem is, that all ads from the same provider have to have <em>some</em> schema that is always the same. Only websites that have the same schema for their actual content would have it blocked as well.</p></div>		</li>
