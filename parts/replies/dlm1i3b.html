			<div class="markdown"><p>There are indeed overlapping dermatomes for different areas of the body, but the mouth and the hands are not in any way overlapping. The nerves of the hands and arms connect to the cervical vertebrae of the spine. The nerves of the face and mouth are cerebral nerves, which go directly to the brain through the skull and not the spine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cranial nerves.  They have their own nuclei in the pons and midbrain. The cervical nerves' sensory cell bodies re in the medulla. There is zero overlap between any post cranial dermatomes and those of the face and mouth.  </p>
<p>Edit: nuclei, not cell bodies. At least not first order ones.  </p></div>		</li>
