			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is less of a Hard science question and more of one on the impact of policy and the public. The thing about most policies, especially ones that are largely publicized is more often than not the effects of those laws are not what we see at face value. In America, we often pass federal laws that take 5-10 years to even begin to make an appreciable difference. I think there are good points to be made about how this policy may provide negligible impact according to the goals set forth but it's more about the intention and goals. By coming to a consensus, as a planet for the planet, the argument can be made that we are taking a stand and working in the right direction. We may find out down the road that we are not doing enough and then it becomes an incrementalist debate. You have to consider that this is not the plan that solves the climate and many countries can easily achieve these goals which is why the argument can be made that it is in fact not enough. The bigger picture here in terms of worldwide diplomacy is the concept of a unified approach to moving towards reducing anthropogenic climate change. People want policies that make them feel good and they can pat themselves on the back and say they have achieved something. Sometimes the unfortunate reality is in policy it's more about the here and now subjective feelings towards a goal rather than the objective scientific outcomes. While I don't agree with this approach my time working in US federal policy has proven this continually. The masses may likely remember climate change as a concern but years from now forget the Paris agreement, just like they forget the Kyoto protocol and so on. So even if the data says it may not save the world, I would have to disagree that it's not a remarkable feat to get this many countries on board. That in itself is a victory we must acknowledge and consider moving forward. We can always do more than the bare minimum, but having a standard is better than no standard at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said. The Kyoto protocol was not ratified by congress, and I remember when the Paris agreement was reached, one of the major criticisms was that there was no legal basis to the agreement.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these agreements are symbolic, and indicators of where public policies and laws may be heading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it interesting to look at the expert reactions to the US withdrawal:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-will-the-world-look-like-if-the-u-s-bails-on-the-paris-climate-deal/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-will-the-world-look-like-if-the-u-s-bails-on-the-paris-climate-deal/</a></p>
<p>It seems the main motivation for the Paris accord was to establish a global negotiation forum with agreement on climate change being a real challenge worth mitigating. It also adds frequent reevaluation of progress and methods.</p>
<p>This agreement then sends a signal to industry and investors about what the future is going to be like. And it puts peer pressure on countries to support that direction.</p>
<p>That future change is where the emission
reduction would eventually come from.</p>
<p>I think it is correct to say that the initial pledges by the participating countries are insufficient to put us in safe territory. As I understand things, they are supposed to get updated during later negotiations. And they are definitely better than no pledges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that this is precisely why they were a success. Rather than deciding on a bunch of limits and trying to impose them from above, they talked to every country to find out what was reasonable for them to achieve in the space of a few years. This means many of the targets are not what you might hope for, but are significantly better than no agreement or targets at all, or ones that no one thinks they can meet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understood, you are entirely correct. The agreement is a stepping stone and a first attempt, to be re evaluated every so many year - ultimately becoming more ambitious as technology advances. The reasons trump used to withdraw from the deal are simply ignorant, narrow minded and for short term gain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bjorn Lomborg is famous for these sorts of calculations. I find these in particular to be odd and tortuous. His headline conclusion in the lomborg.com article you linked is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The climate impact of <strong>all Paris INDC promises</strong> is minuscule: if we measure the impact of every nation fulfilling every promise by 2030, <strong>the total temperature reduction will be 0.048°C (0.086°F) by 2100.</strong> [emphasis his]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see in table 1 of your second article, this is based on his 'pessimistic' pathways like <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/1758-5899.12295/asset/image_n/gpol12295-fig-0007.png?v=1&amp;t=j3fxv84k&amp;s=286b1f55447669f8664a2e1e435cb88c5a4b87d8" target="_blank">this for the EU</a> and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/figures/doi/10.1111/1758-5899.12295#figure-viewer-gpol12295-fig-0003" target="_blank">this for the US</a>. In other words, he predicts that Paris will be followed perfectly to the letter up until the 2025 or 2030 targets, and then the climate agenda will be completely abandoned, CO2 emissions will suddenly massively rise again to 2100, temperatures will rise as a result, and on this basis Paris is pointless. </p>
<p>This represents a curious reading of international policy and diplomacy, that international climate agreement is strong enough to drive perfect adherence for Paris, but will suddenly collapse thereafter.</p>
<p>Firstly, Paris is just one step, to form consensus and to set medium term goals. The argument Lomborg is making is effectively that to set a target for 2025 is pointless because there is no target for 2040, but I would say it's fairly clear that one follows from the other. Secondly, Paris is about giving momentum to a long term industrial shift, to help to drive investment into alternative technologies, many of which will be cheaper than the current technologies. People aren't going to give up LED lighting which is much cheaper than incandescent lighting once electricity costs are accounted for, if the global climate targets lapse. If you can get solar + batteries over the line of being the cheapest option in sunny parts of the world, or electric vehicles cheaper than ICE vehicles, even if you did abandon climate action in 2025, those changes are likely to accelerate, not suddenly go into reverse.</p>
<p>And of course the argument he is making against Paris, will be misused to imply that global climate agreements and action to reduce emissions will not be effective, even though his scenarios precisely assume the long-term failure of climate policy, and an inability to get countries to reduce their emissions.</p>
<p>My honest albeit incomplete reading is that these calculations make tortuous and unreasonable assumptions, and frankly seem to be formulated with the purpose of casting the Paris agreement in a bad light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like his calculations must be intentionally misleading, he looks only at the pledges made up to 2030 and assumes countries return to pre agreement emissions, that's not just cynical that seems intentionally disingenuous</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The optimistic pathways are also strange as well, they say that the EU for instance will reduce to 2020 or to 2030, and then go up again. He is also using the fact that the EU is ahead of schedule on its reductions to 2020 to predict that they will plateau up to that point, and carry on a similar but slightly upwards trend afterwards. I'm not sure what the exact situation is in the EU, but I know in the UK we have linear reductions written into law all the way through to 2050, which you can see here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fifth-carbon-budget-1.jpg" target="_blank">https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fifth-carbon-budget-1.jpg</a></p>
<p>Those scenarios are in truth not optimistic, so they also find minimal reductions, of about 0.2C.</p>
<p>You notice also these graphs don't start from a zero basis, which makes it look like the 2020 or 2030 reductions are large. The 2020 reductions on these graphs from 2015 are about 5-10%, 2030 about 20% from current levels. It's not surprising making a relatively small cut and then holding at those emissions levels won't make much difference.</p></div>		</li>
