			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the up or down voting has no significance on the input. For example, I am commenting late in the lifespan of this discussion. As a result it will be viewed by far fewer readers than had it been early in the process. There are simply way too many responses to go through and likely will end up hidden in a pull down link of many other responses. Especially since the default filter is the top 200 comments. How likely is any comment considered a top comment? Is it determined by votes or by content? So few if any will read this comment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, most readers don't actually vote one way or the other. The total volume of votes does not come any where near the number of readers. This discussion has 14,431,110 readers of which 16,190 are supposedly online as I write. If you are someone who votes, you voted multiple times. Thus the total volume of votes is not indicative of the readership.</p>
<p>Compare it to web site statistics that use a general rule that 50% of the first time visits are people with very little interest. Also consider the 80-20 Pareto Rule which states that 80% of the volume of sales or interest comes from 20% of the audience. My web site analytics prove both of these stats to be true. Thus 20% of the audience do 80% of the voting.</p>
<p>Compare it to my Tweeter account, I currently have 29 Tweets about my new educational web site that have 2,168 Impressions that generated only 35 Engagements, and only 9 Web Site Clicks. But of those 9 click 55% were my target audience of educators. That represents at the early stage in the web site promotion 56% of all the First Time Visits of which 32% are Media Engagements which is a positive sign for future activity. Thus if the success of my old site before it crashed is an indicator, small numbers of the right audience generate big numbers like 475,000 total web site map views.</p>
<p>On the other hand people will down vote a comment no matter how intelligent the comment is if it differs from their polarized political opinion. They cannot see that there are multiple situations where there are two opposing rights (both theirs and someone else's) as well as two opposing wrongs (both theirs and someone else's). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's start at the top; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/64y44g/the_mostupvoted_comments_in_reddit_threads_arent/" target="_blank">It's not a good indicator</a>. A study was done, this year even, looking into what's most likely to receive upvotes. Short version: Post early, post often, and you'll get lots of karma. I won't disagree that social acceptance is what people seek, but it's not what drives upvotes. This explanation doesn't fit the data. </p>
<p>I'd put forward a different one instead, which is better supported by science. It's a little known <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~niederle/NV.AnnualReview.Print.pdf." target="_blank">study into gender differences in social competition</a> [PDF]. It's long and academic, and I couldn't quickly find a nice article to link instead. The result was, more or less, that when a reward (in the case of the experiment, a dollar) wasn't present for playing a game, women simply didn't compete -- they'd converse with one another and the game would just sit there. The men, however -- did. I'd suggest the driver for social media participation isn't acceptance per-se, but rather proving someone's worth by competing for votes, likes, views, etc. Bluntly, it's a popularity contest with all the trimmings. </p>
<p>Those don't necessarily make anyone feel good after. Negative emotion can drive behavior just as much as positive can. I'm not saying gender is the driver here (ie, that it's <em>just</em> men who are playing the 'reddit vote game'). But I am suggesting the reward comes from competition, not acceptance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's less about the up or down, and more about people seeing your comment. I've seen plenty of people who love the downvotes. But just the fact that they are receiving attention is reinforcing them to comment. I think attention being a reinforcer is largely understated on reddit. And that's despite the fact that people understand that there are people trying to get the most downvotes possible.</p>
<p>Not to say that competitive people don't just want to be on top regardless of the reward, but also that attention can be its own reward. </p>
<p>It's interesting to think that winning a competition can be reinforcing even if the 'reward' is meaningless. But I also think that some people can see it as a reward just for being acknowledged, even if it is completely negative in its reception.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found in people that actively seek downvotes, as opposed to speaking their mind and expecting it (I do this sometimes), is that they actually don't give a damn so much about how many people see it as much as that there's at least one person out there that goes &quot;Ewwwww...&quot; For them, it's personal. They'll respond endlessly, even to the point where I've written in a comment &quot;Last word.&quot; About 3 times, and they have a <em>compulsion</em> to keep responding. For positive reinforcement, group approval matters. For negative reinforcement, it seems an individuals <em>disapproval</em> is what's sought after. Weird, I know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! Upvotes are like virtual fist bumps, high fives, and pats on the back. I'm liberal with them because it feels good to support others, even if it's something as inconsequential as an upvote. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where as I issue them sparingly. The only time You get an upvote me is if your post/comment was really spectacular. That or you are backing me up in an internet fight. I don't even downvote that often, unless a post/comment is REALLY awful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm similar. Rarely vote up or down. I wonder what that says about us. On one hand, one could argue that I understand the validation I feel from being upvoted, and subconsciously don't want to devalue that by being too liberal with them. On the other hand you could argue about stimulus overload and desensitization, and a constantly raising bar for what constitutes &quot;good&quot; content worthy of upvotes and &quot;bad&quot; deserving of downvotes. There are a few plausible explanations, and I'd love to read some kind of research on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why? That one word really sums up every question I have for you. Do you think Reddit is made up of anything more than ordinary people? If I make you smirk, that's not good enough? Or do you just not go on Reddit that often? Or do you just think it's a waste of your time? </p>
<p>Jeez, I feel like I can go on and on. I'm not trying to attack you or anything, I just don't understand why. Karma is the central motivation for why this community exists, and it's unusual to see someone who barely uses the system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm more of a upvote everyone person. Why ? It marks a post/thread as kind of viewed, showing who I already read, and it makes everyone happy. So that's pretty good. </p></div>		</li>
