			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to the add-on, modern turbochargers are both oil lubricated, and water cooled.  The water is usually the one that keeps circulating after engine shut off, as it will move around by convection.  Low mounted turbos will have a small sump/reservoir in some cases ( oil). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The turbo only spins for seconds after shutdown, the coking occurs due to the turbine housing being extremely hot from exhaust gases. After shutdown, this heat conducts into the center section and with the oil no longer flowing through, it is stationary and subject to being overheated. Diesel engines typically run higher EGT's, making the problem more prevalent.</p>
<p>Edit: To be clear, the temperature of the exhaust housing is much higher after working a diesel engine hard. Idling reduces the temperature of the housing while keeping the flow of oil through the center section until it drops to a reasonable temperature, something like 400 F after a few minutes as opposed to 1000-1500 F that could occur by immediately shutting off after high stress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short version- the turbo is hotter than the recommended maximum temperature for your oil, so when the oil stops flowing it cooks in your turbo's bearings. Synthetic oil takes this abuse MUCH better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meh... But only very slowly. If it's spinning with any speed then it would build pressure. Since the engine is off there's no where for that pressure to go. It takes a lot of energy to build that pressure and the turbo itself doesn't have that much kinetic energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really why. Otherwise they'd just shut the engine off after a couple of minutes. The real reason why is that diesels can be run extremely lean. So lean, that many operators just leave them going - possibly to run air-con or other basic stuff or sometimes just because. </p>
<p>The reason they can run so lean is that the fuel is injected <em>after</em> the air is compressed. The risk of knock due to leaning out is almost non-existent (yes, they can knock), especially at idle and no boost pressure. So many people just leave them going because they use so little fuel at idle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that diesels were always &quot;knocking&quot;. In a gasoline engine,  knocking is sometimes referred to as &quot;dieseling&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, not quite. Knock in a petrol occurs because you are compressing a mixture of fuel and air. The wrong fuel or leaning out can cause the mixture to ignite before the spark initiates it at the right time. That's where you get the RON/MON ratings for different fuels - it's a measure of how well they resist knocking.</p>
<p>Diesels, on the other hand can't knock like a petrol does, as the air is compressed before you add the fuel. The fuel mixing with the extremely hot air immediately ignites. Well, almost immediately - there is a delay and this can affect the running characteristics. Like petrol has a RON, diesel has the cetane number:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetane_number" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetane_number</a></p>
<p>Also, you may be interested in this little bit from the wiki concerning engine knocking. It's quite interesting. It supports what you said (diesels always knock) but then goes on to say they don't:</p>
<p>Knocking is more or less unavoidable in diesel engines, where fuel is injected into highly compressed air towards the end of the compression stroke. There is a short lag between the fuel being injected and combustion starting. By this time there is already a quantity of fuel in the combustion chamber which will ignite first in areas of greater oxygen density prior to the combustion of the complete charge. This sudden increase in pressure and temperature causes the distinctive diesel 'knock' or 'clatter', some of which must be allowed for in the engine design.</p>
<p>Careful design of the injector pump, fuel injector, combustion chamber, piston crown and cylinder head can reduce knocking greatly, and modern engines using electronic common rail injection have very low levels of knock. Engines using indirect injection generally have lower levels of knock than direct injection engine, due to the greater dispersal of oxygen in the combustion chamber and lower injection pressures providing a more complete mixing of fuel and air. </p>
<p>Diesels actually do not suffer exactly the same &quot;knock&quot; as gasoline engines since the cause is known to be only the very fast rate of pressure rise, not unstable combustion. Diesel fuels are actually very prone to knock in gasoline engines but in the diesel engine there is no time for knock to occur because the fuel is only oxidized during the expansion cycle. In the gasoline engine the fuel is slowly oxidizing all the time while it is being compressed before the spark. This allows for changes to occur in the structure/makeup of the molecules before the very critical period of high temp/pressure.[3]</p>
<p>So, I guess I was wrong to call it knocking in the conventional sense. I basically meant poor running due to low cetane number or a combination of that and other things.</p></div>		</li>
