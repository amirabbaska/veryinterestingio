			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just (and I hate to use one of Reddits most overused words of last year) Confirmation Bias. At some point you thought to yourself &quot;Hmm I seem to see the pattern 911 a lot&quot; so now every time you see it you take more notice than you would any other number, thus reinforcing your existing bias.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might also be a case of the frequency illusion.    Where a number or word has some sort of importance (like 911 being an important emergency number) and the brain explicitly points it out thinking it's relevant and important information you need to know about.</p>
<p>It also happens when you learn a new word or important number.  It's just your brain going &quot;hey! This is important to you! You <em>need</em> to see this&quot; in situations where it's not needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar thing happens to me. My cousin once told me “look at the clock when it’s 11:11, you will start to see that number everywhere. That was a few years ago and I’m always seeing 11:11. Weather it’s the time or a score or whatever. Seems weird, but I think it’s cool. I also think it’s just pure coincidence </p></div>		</li>
