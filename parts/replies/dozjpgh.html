			<div class="markdown"><p>You could say that there is no &quot;Why&quot; in Biology, in a sense. Maybe the stimulation of the lacrimal nerve is just a useless side effect of the parasympathetic stimulation that is being activated for other processes involved in the stress response, but, since that doesn't affect reproduction, there was no evolutionary pressure for it to get removed. </p>
<p>If you move out of only biology for a bit, maybe it stayed because it eventually became part of the social semiology - it makes it easier to tell what other people are feeling. Summarizing, people who express their emotions phisically and recognize them readily were more able to form stronger social bonds and eventually reproduce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The theory is that obscuring our eyes makes us seem helpless, which provokes a sympathy response from nearby humans. Evolutionary psych isn't something you should take too seriously though. As has been said, evolution haphazardly stumbles from one solution to the next.</p></div>		</li>
