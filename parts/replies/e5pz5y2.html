			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, mixing cocktails of drugs are extremely dangerous because while either on their own might be an overdose (or enough to prompt medical intervention), when mixed together they counteract the effect of the other. When one wears off, however, the side effects of the other kick in and can cause serious problems.</p>
<p>The oft used example is a speedball or cocaine mixed with heroin or morphine. Cocaine counteracts the depressing effect of the heroin, but once the cocaine wears off, the heroin may be a high enough dosage still to be lethal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny enough, yes more cocaine would keep you alive. Obviously that's not the preferred path in medicine, something like naloxone is preferred because it directly counteracts the binding of the opiate in the first place with little side effect.</p></div>		</li>
