			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I know, AWD only engages when the cars computer sees it fit, such as with an icy road or mud, etc. So an AWD car is only 2 wheel drive most the time. 4WD gives you the ability to lock differentials, etc, and make it so you can choose when to have 4wd, and when to have 2wd.
I may be wrong though. Pretty sure I'm not though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the system. The same car can have different AWD systems available, and that manufacturer could have a bunch for each car, plus it all changes every few years with different generations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain cars are absolutely all-wheels driven at all times, such as my old '08 Subaru Impreza w/ manual trans. It was always 50/50 front/back. But that isn't the norm nowadays.</p>
<p>Comparatively, my '12 VW Golf R has a Haldex controlled AWD system that only engages when front wheel slip is detected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the manufacturers AWD system.  Subaru (for example) is full-time symmetrical, others are full time but not symmetrical others are symmetrical but part time and so on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The line is getting blurred with modern stuff like torsens, electro/hydraulic diffs and other components that can vary the torque split on the fly.</p></div>		</li>
