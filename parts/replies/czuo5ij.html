			<div class="markdown"><p>Great questions! </p>
<p>There are two questions you seem to be asking. </p>
<p>Q1: The first is whether not we can tell the difference between a true memory and a false memory, and the answer is “probably not”. </p>
<p>When we show videos of false memories and true memories to participants in research studies, they generally cannot reliably tell the difference between them. This suggests that true and false memories  of emotional events look the same to others. </p>
<p>We also know that true and false memories can have multi-sensory components, which means that both can be incredibly detailed and have feelings, tastes, sounds, and sights all woven into them. This makes it likely that without independent corroborating evidence (such as photos or video footage) it is unlikely that we can reliably identify our own false memories.</p>
<p>Q2: Can we reverse a false memory? Essentially, yes. In the research I do participants seem to willingly revise their memories once I tell them what the research is actually about (in the debriefing). Essentially, this means that when confronted with compelling contradictory evidence, people are usually able to accept that they just dreamt up a scenario rather than actually experienced it. From that point the memory can either be forgotten OR they can become so-called “non-believed” memories, which are complex events that still feel like memories but we don’t actually believe happened. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you ever experience reaction formation in your subjects when confronted with the debrief? I.e., does anyone refuse to believe they were false memories?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the awnser.</p>
<p>Can you explain what evolutionary advantage we might have gotten from this.</p>
<p>How did the participants react when they realised their memories were untrue</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rather than evolving the ability to create false memories, I think we just use all available information to come to a conclusion about what happened. For example, if we hear 5 people independently reporting an event differently to how we remember it, we would think it more likely that we were mistaken than that they were all simultaneously wrong, so we would probably correct our memory to reflect this, and later not remember that we had originally thought something different. </p>
<p>I don't know about this particular situation, but I heard somebody talk about a very serious false memory from their childhood that they 'recovered' while undergoing hypnotic therapy from an untrained and irresponsible 'therapist'. It took a long time to realise the memory was false, in which time they had gone through some very intense emotions, and were fairly traumatised by the experience. There are calls for stricter regulation on who is allowed to treat people for serious problems like this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it also be possible to use the same process you used to create the false memory to overwrite that false memory again? Say you implant a totally normal memory (e.g. [during the time of the murder] you had a normal day went to school / work and did nothing special) which would override the existing memory and then after some time be forgotten?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also,  do the memories disappear when the subjects are told that they are false? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disappear is a strong word! Like any other memory, false memories have the ability to be forgotten, to fade, or to be replaced by other memories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I presume you are asking about the act of implanting false memories?</p>
<p>There are important conceptual differences between brainwashing someone and generating false memories in them.</p>
<p>To me, “brainwashing” means that we intentionally try to get someone to radically change their beliefs or ideologies. I guess you <em>could</em> use false memory techniques to try to do this, to make someone accept a grossly alternate version of reality or their identity.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, a single false memory, or even multiple false memories, will not necessarily do this. In the kind of research I do, I am not trying to change someone's ideology, and I am certainly not trying to change their political views, just their acceptance of a single event.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what you're thinking of is closer to what's called operant conditioning, that is, influencing someone's cognitive approach to their environment via manipulating certain aspects of it in order to instigate a behavior or stop a behavior. Implanting false memories would certainly be a potent manipulation! </p></div>		</li>
