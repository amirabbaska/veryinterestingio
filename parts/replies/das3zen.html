			<div class="markdown"><p>3-5 sets of 8-12 reps of 6-10 exercises. Different people do different splits on what they work on what day. Some do chest&amp;back, then arms&amp;shoulders, then legs. Some push, pull, legs. There are a lot of different ways to split up your exercises per day.</p>
<p>The key is to actually push yourself hard. You want to squeezing out those last few reps of each set. If you just go through the motions you won't get any of the results that you want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former bodybuilder here. My quick diet tip for gaining muscle is just to make sure you have protein as the basis of every meal. If you can supplement further with shakes or bars, great. But at a minimum, your three main meals should center around a protein group. What I mean by that is, every meal I have has at least 25 grams of protein. If I want a bowl of spaghetti, fine, but it needs meat sauce that's heavy on the meat or some grilled chicken with it. The upside is that it's a helpful habit for keeping in shape since you learn not to fill up on empty carbs and fats. The down side is that it's not cheap. Adding meat to everything doesn't have to be expensive, but it does prohibit you from living on the super cheap &quot;ramen diet&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eggs are an excellent source of protein for cheap! You have to eat a shitload of eggs to get to 25x3meals though. At least chicken is also cheap, especially thighs.</p>
<p>I would also suggest tuna, but a lot of people prefer to stay away because of mercury levels. But I guess once in a while doesn't hurt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that you want to put enough weight on to not be able to lift a 13th Rep. If you can lift 13, add weight. Small amounts should do it. You will probably climb in 5 or 10lb increments. Once you begin to top out, you'll only add a lb or 2 at a time to make that last Rep too heavy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look for a good strength building program. 1 thing a lot of newer lifters do is get stuck trying to create their own workout program, or they just goto the gym without a plan and wing it. That is really counter productive to what you want. </p>
<p>I highly recommend stronglifts 5x5 or starting strength 5x5 if you are still somewhat a beginner (this is based on your lift numbers). If you are an intermediate lifter, try wendlers 5/3/1 program. All of these programs are designed to build strength, and have been created by someone highly knowledgeable in the field.</p></div>		</li>

<p>tone training.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no such thing as &quot;muscle tone.&quot; Someone who wants to &quot;tone up&quot; wants to moderately increase muscle size and decrease body fat. This can be achieved with small amounts of lifting and a good diet.</p>
<p>The muscle density thing is mostly broscience as well. With very few exceptions, larger muscles move more weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. Getting &quot;toned&quot; just means you've lost weight and gained muscle mass. Also the muscle density thing is a myth. What is actually happening when you get stronger with the same amount of muscle is that your central nervous system gets more efficient at activating the muscles you have. That's why we get things like noon gains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. A good deal of getting stronger is using high weights at extremely low reps because it hits your central nervous system.</p>
<p>Your body already has a ton of muscle fibers in each muscle, but you don't use all of them because you don't typically need to. Lifting at or around your max trains your CNS to recruit more of the muscle fibers, which makes you able to lift more without actually putting on any more muscle. </p>
<p>Eventually you plateau because your body can only use so many fibers in each muscle before it becomes detrimental. When that happens you need to switch up your training to out more muscle on.</p>
<p>This is the entire basis for programs like starting strength and strong lifts.</p></div>		</li>
