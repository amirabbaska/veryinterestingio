			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to go to a speech and swallowing specialist when I was younger to help my stutter and my underbite and also help with my underbite and swallowing. I was doing something weird with my tongue every time I swallowed that put pressure on my lower jaw pushing my teeth outward. I hardly stutter any more and now can also swallow properly and breathe better!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few points to contend: 1) People don't usually flush their upper airway (laryngeal vestibule) with water. The epiglottis is supposed to protect that from happening. People (usually) cough when material is in the upper airway to clear it.</p>
<p>2) You state that one does not really feel stuff in the trachea. I did an MBS yesterday with a man who had a very strong reactive cough only when he aspirated water, but not when it penetrated. See the ENT's comment as well regarding tracheal sensation.</p>
<p>3) Our cells in the pharynx do, in part, get hydrated by water passing over them. There are two types of hydration: systemic and surface. Systemic hydration refers to hydration of the cells through the body, which is influenced by the fluids that you swallow. Surface hydration is moisture on the mucous membranes, which can be influenced by the moisture that passes through our throat in addition to humidity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks for clarification about the hydration!</p>
<p>i meant that when you sense something is in your throat, it's almost always way higher (even above the vestibule). for an average person with a normal swallow.</p>
<p>i'm still a little confused about whether a cough reflex is really the same as tactile sensation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Physician here. Amazing response. One thing I’ve been meaning to ask a speech therapist: is there a proper way to swallow liquids? I feel like sometimes I swallow liquid and choke on it. Even if it’s just water. Is there a more consistent rhythm or position I can employ to help this? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try to collect the liquid bolus in the center of your tongue, pretending your tongue is a bowl, and do not let any liquid escape from the sides, front or back of your &quot;bowl&quot;. Now try to smile with spread lips and propel the bolus back by increasing the intra bolus pressure via decreased volume. To do this, imagine lifting your tongue tip up, then the middle of your tongue, then finally the back in a wave like motion. With poor medial bolus collection, people are more likely to have premature spillage and have liquids trickle down the back of their tongue.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you inhale or exhale after swallowing? Most people swallow during the exhale of a respiration cycle. Some, however, swallow and then continue to inhale- leaving your airway more vulnerable (more likely liquid will go &quot;down the wrong tube&quot;). That's just my first thought! So many other reasons this could be happening. (Source : SLP student)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned this last night!</p>
<p>My gf is from Shanghai, and thus always orders the 'extra spicy dragon's breath' version of soup / hotpot. I was eating from chopsticks and couldn't get the first morsel into my mouth - the chilli hit the back of my throat and I started coughing and could barely speak.</p>
<p>I had some non-explosive noodles and tried again, realising that if I exhaled and then popped the chilli-infused meat into my mouth, I got the tang of the lemongrass, then the chilli, then the flavour... chew, swallow, then breath in, reach for beer.</p>
<p>Worked!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another speech therapist here! There has been research showing that the exhale-swallow-exhale is the best and safest pattern of swallowing. Also try swallowing one at a time versus chugging it down. This gives your larynx time to position itself before the swallow to prevent aspiration.</p></div>		</li>
