			<div class="markdown"><p>nitpick. DNA is not spliced. it is recombined.  B+T cells undergo V/D/J recombination of immunglobulin genes. their genes are not unique, they are just uniquely recombined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. Since intervening DNA is lost, I've always considered it splicing. Since sequences are lost and new joins created, isn't DNA unique (at least to each founder cell's lineage)? I know vocabulary is precise, so you well may be right. Not my area of expertise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say yes and no. Epigenetics has an influence on whats expressed but the expression of the genes themselves depend on things like transcription factors and other proteins. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but where do the transcription factors and other proteins come from?  Genes!  So if their genes are epigenetically silenced, they will not exert any influence.  They certainly play a role in dynamic transcription during a cell's lifetime, but I think epigenetics is more fundamental in providing binary on/off switches for determining <em>cellular identity</em> in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, as /u/neeblue said, it's kind of a chicken and egg statement, but if you look at signal transduction, often those activate transcription factors that bind DNA to activate protein transcription. Many times, those genes are constitutively activated and are not epigenetically controlled. Other times they are.</p>
<p>Epigenetics is highly important, but I wouldn't say the most fundamental. The epigenetic control is based off of proteins that were induced by signals that were created by genes that may have been epigenetically controlled or not. It's all kind of a circular argument.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But not all silenced genes are done so through epigenetics. I'm sure you're aware transcription factors can act as activators as well as repressors of the expression of gene x, and methylation does not necessarily play a role for the regulation of every gene in the genome. Also considering that methylation does not play a role in the regulation of c elegans, drosophila, yeast, and many many other organisms, I don't think methylation has such a fundamental role in cell development as your posts make it seem</p></div>		</li>
