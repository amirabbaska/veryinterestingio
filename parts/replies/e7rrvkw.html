			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, while boxers do this, it's a bad habit. People have much worse form when they're fighting vs when they practice. It's why sparring is key, getting used to keeping form while getting punched in the face.</p>
<p>The ideal form is 'sitting down' (bent knees and staying low), keeping your face and torso covered (including keeping your chin to your chest) , and maintaining proper footwork.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t you want some tension in the neck and shoulders to stop your head from whipping around so much if a punch lands? I know planted feet and straight knees are terrible posturally, but I’m surprised that a tensed neck is bad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People tend to chest breathe when stressed. To improve oxygen intake, the body ends up having to use the secondary breathing muscles that resemble shrugging. To help those muscles, the other major muscles in the region start to work. Eventually the entire upper back is tight which pulls down on the base of the skull. </p>
<p>A massage is a light pain response. Prolonging this pain signal (the massage) helps to override the initial signal to flex due to the stress response. This works because pain signals and muscle activation use the same neural pathways. Eventually the muscles will relax. This allows the body to better activate the diaphragm, which triggers the rest and digest response. </p></div>		</li>
