			<div class="markdown"><p>You hate this part probably because it's the very first response your body has when you try to vomit and you probably feel like real shit when you are just about to puke. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, as an experienced puker, the saliva is the big sign to get to a toliet or sink. But you also always feel alot better after puking anyways even though the lead up is so dreadful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shitty part is, I only really vomit when I've gone overboard with the neat rum. And it feels massively better when I'm done throwing up. So when I threw up cus of reasons other than alcohol, it actually felt nice. </p>
<p>What used to be the shittiest sensation in the world became much more pleasant because I drink too much sometimes. Eh, whatever. College life. I'll probably stop having hard liquor (except for nice whiskey) after my graduation so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it helpful. Especially if I am unsure if I am going to vomit or not. The saliva is like a final warning - yes, you are definitely about to vomit. Usually gives me just enough time to get to the bathroom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. If I vomit really violently or dry heave for like a minute or more, I get the blood dots on my eyelids. Almost looks like someone gave your eyelid a hickey. Looks kinda bad to other people but is harmless, and goes away within a couple days or so</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>one time I threw up from being shitfaced, I had eaten spaghetti-o's that night and threw up through my nose. when I woke up on the floor of the bathroom a few hours later i had a weird tickle in my nose and found a spaghetti-o suck under the little flap in my nostril. It was probably the least comfortable throw up I've ever done.</p></div>		</li>
