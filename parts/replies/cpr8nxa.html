<p>Also, if rainbow gravity is correct, then the Universe did not begin with the Big Bang, it is far older.</p>

<p>I want to clarify this. When people say this &quot;could disprove the Big Bang&quot;, that's misleading - <a href="http://ww.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/308uyk/tiny_black_hole_disproves_big_bang/" target="_blank">I explain it in more detail here</a>.</p>
<p>We still have all the essential pieces of the Big Bang. Our universe came from a hot dense soup, which expanded and cooled until stars and galaxies could form. It's not required to start from a singularity - at that point things are getting kinda speculative.</p>
<p>Rainbow Gravity is just saying that this hot dense soup goes back infinitely in time. This isn't a steady-state universe. It's still a universe that expanded from a small hot dense universe. This just modifies what happens <em>before</em> that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I truly can't wrap my head around. I can imagine an infinite cycle, or just the idea of there being a time before the Big Bang, but i can't imagine there being a warping reality based on human reaching the point of infinite knowledge. I'm sure i'm misinterpretting it. Where do I find further readings?</p></div>		</li>

Indefinite as in &quot;fuck me if I know how long&quot;. Could have been one minute, could have been one billion earth-years, could have been zero time (time might have not even existed before the big expansion of the universe). It's one of those things in which science's answer is &quot;we don't know yet&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, not a singularity. In Rainbow Gravity, the universe is small and dense, but not <em>infinitely</em> small. Depending on the parameters, it either just gets smaller and smaller as you go back in time, but never reaching a singularity, <em>or</em> it gets to a &quot;peak&quot; density and just plateaus there.</p>
<p>But yeah, it was a dense hot soup for infinity, and then suddenly gets interesting in the last 13ish billion years.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So why did it start expanding all of a sudden? If expansion had a finite probability, then it couldn't have gone an infinite amount of time before expanding...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd actually have to know the theory in detail to properly answer that, and that's beyond what I'm willing to do for a reddit post :P</p>
<p>But one of the scenarios is that the universe just gets denser and denser as you go back in time, without ever hitting infinite density. In that scenario, the universe has <em>always</em> been expanding, it's just that the expansion rate has been continually increasing, and it's only in the last 13ish billion years things have got thin and cool enough for interesting things to happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really. </p>
<p>It just suggests the that the universe is older (perhaps infinitely) than the moment/s of expansion we call &quot;The Big Bang&quot; and existed as a very dense universe before then. </p>
<p>From here on its just me thinking 'out loud'.</p>
<p>Which really if you think about it time didn't exist before the universe because there was nothing to dictate time. </p>
<p>To me saying the universe is infinitely old seems like an obvious conclusion because there was no time before and all the time that has elapsed since is an ever expanding amount. Regardless of when, its age has always been infinite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something had to come before the big bang.  What that is, I can't answer but the universe just didn't pop out of nothing-ness.   Time as we know it may have started at the big bang, but it may have also started long before the big bang.  </p>
<p>We could have had a 'big bang to big crunch' cycle before the start of this universe.</p>
<p>We could have had the Universe go through a life cycle once before (big bang to the big freeze) and a Quantum Event caused a new big bang and the cycle to start up again.</p>
<p>Who knows for sure?  Regardless, something happened...something was there...before the big bang.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Myself personally, I believe that the universe is infinite in age, but this rainbow gravity theory still sounds pretty bogus since visible light will predictably bend around massive objects as a function of gravity &amp; the speed of light. This rainbow gravity theory seems to be confusing time and energy.</p></div>		</li>
