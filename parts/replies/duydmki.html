			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the mechanics of how it goes Low-Medium-High is probably a variable resistor that the connection is moving across. It's probably a circle that the two connections get further and further apart until they are back together again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's just connected to two different filaments.  It isn't dimming the bulb,  it's turning on one or both filaments.  First click is the 30 watt filament, second click is the 60 watt filament,  third click is both filaments for a combined 90 watts.  Or 50-100-150.  A regular bulb would only touch the 60 watt filament power source,  so it only lights up when the bigger filament would in a 3- way. </p></div>		</li>
