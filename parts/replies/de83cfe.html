			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed - I have no idea what exactly is taught in American schools.  (Assuming the OP is British, I should probably have said 'A-level maths', although admittedly that's also beyond what most British people cover at school.)  I'm not saying a high school student could necessarily derive the series expansion for sin(x).  If you don't know anything about limits though, it's hard to properly grasp what pi is, much less why it's irrational.  (What does the circumference of a circle even mean?  How do you measure it?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment about approximating a number with rationals meaning it is irrational or will hit the rational exactly is not true.</p>
<p>Take the sequence (n-1)/n.  This sequence approximates 1 to any degree for large enough n, and is a rational solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, this is an example of what I'm talking about.  (Maybe I didn't phrase it clearly enough.)  The sequence s_n = (n-1)/n does a bad job of approximating the number 1, because |1-s_n| only shrinks as fast as 1/q_n, where q_n is the denominator of s_n (in this case q_n = n).   If you have a convergent sequence of rational numbers with 'small' denominators compared to how fast they converge, either the sequence is constant eventually (i.e. you hit the exact value), or the limit is irrational.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he's talking about the limit of summation of a series (provided that it converges), not the limit like you showed.</p></div>		</li>
