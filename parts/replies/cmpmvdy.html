			<div class="markdown"><p>But bear in mind it's mission profile called for it to visit Jupiter and Saturn before cruising out of the solar system. The remaining fuel will be carefully rationed on maintaining it's attitude and pointing capability so that it can maintain comms with Earth until it's electrical power runs out - not frittered away on thrust such that the craft has electrical power but has no fuel to orient itself for transmission.</p>
<p>If your goal was inter-stellar travel, then consider that reaching 1% of c requires 85 hours at 1g. That would have you at 3000km/s ^1 - far faster than Voyager's 17km/s.</p>
<p>Heck, 1 day at 0.5g would get you to 423km/s, which makes Voyager's 17km/s look decidedly sedate.</p>
<p><strong>Voyager 1 is not going quickly because it's a scientific mission who's job is to coast and see what it sees.</strong></p>
<p>If you <em>actually want to get somewhere</em>, you could do it much, much faster.</p>
<p>^1 Not accounting for Special Relativity. Point is that 17km/s seems fast to us on Earth but it's pretty slow in space and we could easily exceed go quicker and get out the solar system if we were happy to hump the necessary fuel up there. We don't because the mission profile doesn't usually care how long we take to get to the destination - we look for the cheapest route (by energy cost) and time our missions accordingly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make it sound like maintaining 1g for 85 hours would be easy. Even 1 day at 0.5g, which you imply is trivial, would be unfeasible with our current technology. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Voyager 1 is the fastest outwardly traveling object in space man has ever created. The only things that we've made that has gone faster were the Helios spacecraft, and they reached their speeds by being pulled towards the sun.</p>
<p>It may be slow on a galactic scale, but we have yet to create a spacecraft that moves faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man I just finished my Astronomy class yesterday (passed with an A :)) and learning about how a parsec is 3.3 light years to me is mind boggling. The fact that it would take 225 million years for our solar system to complete one galactic year around the Milky Way is...beautiful. I hope one day a life similar to Star Trek becomes a reality. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure where you got the distance to Voyager 1 from, but NASA has a &quot;live&quot; page here: <a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/" target="_blank">http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/</a></p>
<p>Which shows it as: 130.65785138 AU</p>
<p>Not that you're off by much, or anything, and it doesn't really change your answer to the degree of accuracy of light minutes anyway! Thought it was worth pointing out simply because that page could do with linking in this thread somewhere, though :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it wouldn't work like that. Let's give a crude example.</p>
<p>Say you have placed a camera at a distance of 12 lighthours, which can be operated on earth. You naively want to use this to solve crimes up to 12 hours in the past.</p>
<p>You know a crime has been comitted just 2 hours ago, you rush to the controls of the camera, you give in the coordinates for the crimescene, and you press the button to activate the camera.</p>
<p>Now what happens is that you are sending a signal to the camera. This signal takes 12 hours to reach the camera, after which it switches on, and it sees... nothing particular on the crimescene.
The camera would however be able to see you sitting there at the controls of the camera, just having pressed the button to activate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, theoretically if good enough equipment were on Voyager you could stream video of 18 hours ago, but the stream would take 18 hours to get back to earth so you're really watching the most expensive 36 hour tape delay in history.</p>
<p>(Why not just put cameras on earth and use a VCR?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's actually one good reason: scheduled secret revelation. If I want to release a secret in 36 hours, I can encrypt it and send the decryption key to Voyager. I delete the key. As soon as Voyager receives it, it transmits it back.</p>
<p>Unless there's someone sitting inbetween me and Voyager waiting for me to send the signal, relativity <em>guarantees</em> that nobody on Earth can decrypt my stuff for 36 hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or at the very least a satellite in low orbit. :)</p>
<p>You need a satellite 24 light-hours away if you want to watch a crime happen 24 hours ago <em>live</em>. But why not just record and rewind to the spot you want?</p></div>		</li>
