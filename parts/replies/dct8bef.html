			<div class="markdown"><p>You generally have to use apple flavoring to get a strong enough apple taste for ice cream.  Things like malic acid and hexyl acetate.  You can extract these flavorings from natural sources and get &quot;natural flavorings&quot; but it is insufficient to take something like apple cider and reduce it to a syrup because it still won't impart enough of the flavor we associate with apple to the ice cream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We call that sherbet. It's like a fruit sorbet but has some milk or milk fat added so that it's less of a frozen juice and sugar mixture but more like ice cream, just not as creamy as ice cream would be. We have sherbet in orange, lemon, pineapple, etc. I bet the apple one is delicious!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're talking about sorbet vs ice cream maybe? Apple ice cream is a lot more common in sorbet, but I've had creamy versions too. It's not super common in either version though, I'd have to go to a place with lots of flavors to find it.</p></div>		</li>
