<p>Caffine doesn't create this energy, the body is just using what it has stored more quickly.</p>

<p>That's why a lot of diet pills contain caffeine. Though caffeine overuse comes with its own problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently woke up feeling like I was majorly hung over despite not having a drink in months and being otherwise relatively healthy and hydrated. I took some ibuprofen and tried to sleep it off but it wouldn't go away or even just lessen for hours. It was severe enough that I called my ma and described it to her, she told me it sounded like a caffeine headache and I should drink a little coffee. I was skeptical and hesitant because the thought of drinking coffee at that moment was unpleasant, but I did have some. To my surprise the headache was completely gone within seconds, I doubt even a full minute had passed.</p>
<p>I drink 1 sometimes 2 cups of coffee a day, and apparently that was enough to make my body depend on it, and missing 1 day of drinking coffee ended painfully. I don't fully understand why it happens but needless to say I'm tapering off now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I worked at Dunkin donuts, I developed my caffeine addiction from the free coffees I would get on shift. (I worked 4-midnight, 5 days a week).</p>
<p>When I eventually quit that job... I had the worst detox of my life. I couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't eat. I was just pain and ache and felt like death was going to take me.</p>
<p>Now I drink tea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone wandering through- Caffeine addiction, anxiety, insomnia, high blood pressure, rapid heart rate, fatigue, headaches, and potential reduction of fertility in women are some risks.</p>
<p>Of course, it will be different for each person, but caffeine is a drug and can have some serious side effects if we overdo it. It would be ideal to eliminate caffeine but as a daily lover of Red Bull and a big fan of espresso over ice with coconut milk, I know that's a lot to ask. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who's received ~60k of his karma from ELI5 answers, the reason is because if you answer in an accurate but still truly simple to understand way, which by definition is going to require some amount of oversimplification, you get a chorus of people chiming in &quot;aaaaaactually, it's more complicated than that...&quot; and dumping their entire grad/PhD level knowledge on the topic on you.</p></div>		</li>
