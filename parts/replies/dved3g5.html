			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a follow-up question. Is this lab-grown meat vegan/ vegetarian? I feel like they can't possibly make it that cheaply without using FCS. So will this be a non-vegan/ non-vegetarian meat replacement product?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of it is vegetarian. It's right there in the name, vegetarians don't eat meat. This is meat.</p>
<p>I just wanted to clarify that. People can have any number of reasons not to eat meat, not only because of the animals. But as you point out, there is a discussion to be had about if it's vegan. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's not vegetarian, it wouldn't be vegan then. No?</p>
<p>So it'll be a non-vegan, non-vegetarian meat replacement product, then. Is there really a need for this? Seems cheaper and easier to recreate the taste and texture of meat with components (eg. impossible burger), compared to recreating meat itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure on the definitions when it comes to the borderline. But it does harvest a small sample from an animal, mostly stem cells. I'm not quite sure of how it's done but could be via an injection. No animals are killed or really even harmed during production. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was referring to the culturing method. The cheapest way to culture mammalian cells involved use of fetal calf serum (FCS), which would presumably render the practice not vegan/ vegetarian. FCS is added because it includes various growth factors that aid in cell growth. Some of these factors are defined, and can be produced as recombinant proteins in organisms such as E. coli etc.</p>
<p>It is possible to replace FCS with purified growth factors made by non-animal organisms (eg. E. coli), but this comes with a significant increase in cost. Thus I assumed that to make the lab-grown meat cheaply, FCS must be used, thereby rendering the meat arguably non-vegan. The produce could be acceptable to some vegetarians though. I see FCS being in a similar category as say, rennet used for making cheese, and gelatin used for making jello - all byproducts of the meat industry. Some vegetarians eat jello, some don't.</p>
<p>I suppose the definition could also change depending on how the FCS is harvested. FCS is currently produced as a side product of the meat industry. In other words, the blood/ serum of slaughtered cows is collected to make FCS for lab use; cattle ranching is driven by the demand for meat, not the blood. However, if the demand for meat is reduced to the point that the demand for FCS is greater than demand for beef, one can imagine bleeding cows for their serum, and keeping the cows alive. In this case, since no animal dies from the process of harvesting FCS, some people may be compelled to define the lab-grown meat as vegetarian?</p></div>		</li>
