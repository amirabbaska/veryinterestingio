			<div class="markdown"><p>I pretty much agree with all this. I just wanted to add on don't let this discourage you! Our current understanding says <em>no,</em> but this doesn't mean out future understanding will! Furthermore, asking questions that make us think, &quot;Well, let's think about that&quot; can only lead to better understanding. Which is, of course, the goal in the first place.</p>
<p>Good question!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've mostly heard electron cyclotron and nuetral beam injection described as heating techniques. Are those techniques capable of inducing a directional current and not just isotropic heating?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A plasma will also naturally drive a current as you heat it up</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could you expand on that? I have done a little bit of mhd in coursework, but I haven't encountered that yet.</p>
<p>Thank you for your response. It was very helpful. I had never really thought about the implications of stress in cycling both the magnetic fields and heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert on the different current drive techniques, so I can't say too much about them. But both electron cyclotron current drive and lower hybrid current drive can be used to drive current. You can even use neutral beams to drive current. If you want more information I look at ITER physics basis (google it). The ITER physics basis is a great review of the science of magnetic confinement. Chapter 6 is a chapter that talks about the different forms of external heating and non-inductive current drive. </p>
<p>The bootstrap current that arises naturally as you heat a toroidally confined plasma is a neoclassical (kinetic) effect. You would not see it in a pure MHD course. Are you familiar with the difference between trapped and passing particles? It turns out that the motion of the trapped ions in a torus is not symmetric as the ions bounce back and forth in their well. This asymmetry gives rise to banana orbits and can also give rise to a net current if there is a pressure gradient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plasmas are composed of both positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons. To a very good approximation plasmas have a net neutral charge. The net number of positive charges are balanced by an equal number of negative charges. </p>
<p>The current in a plasma is due to the difference between the positively charged ion flow and the negatively charged electron flow.  You can have ion flow without current if the electrons flow with the ions. </p>
<p>In order to drive currents in a tokamak you have to create an imbalance between the electron and ion flows. </p>
<p>Also not all the atoms in a plasma are completely ionized. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A pinhead the temperature of the core of the Sun would kill everything in a 1000 mile radius only if it was maintained at that temperature by continuously adding more energy to it to offset the energy lost through radiation.  Without this continuous addition of energy, the pinhead would only have the thermal energy equivalent to about 5g of TNT, so you'd get a little flash of light like a firecracker as it cooled off nearly instantly and then that would be it.</p></div>		</li>
