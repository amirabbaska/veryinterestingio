<p>Well, that just means you don't take cheeseburgers passionately.</p>
<p>What if cheeseburger's <em>are</em> one's life passion.  If that person held a mate/spouse in a similar light, it would be a good thing, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LMAO, talk about confusing things. This pupil dilation thing is triggered by ATTRACTION, not the love your ex was talking about.</p>
<p>Your pupils will dilate just as much when looking at an aesthetically pleasing hooker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your irises do not under any condition actually &quot;change&quot; color. They may appear slightly different depending on how dilated they are and the way the light is hitting them. </p>
<p>For example, in very direct sunlight when my pupils are very constricted, my hazel eyes look extremely green. In more ambient light conditions, they take on a light brown look. The properties of the iris haven't changed, only the light reflecting on them.</p>
<p>But color is not strictly objective; it is a relationship between the chemical/structural properties of an object the quality of the light reflecting off it.</p>
<p>EDIT: arguably more important are the physical qualities of the observers eyes and brain but that's a whole different (fasinating) topic. </p>
<p>EDIT 2: also very interesting is how subjective perception of color may be influenced by cultural conceptions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing that the inner area of your iris is darker brown, and the outer area is a little lighter/golder. This happens a lot with hazel-eyed people as well, where the pupils dilate or constrict and the eyes seem to be a different color because of it. </p>
<p>Dilation and other physiological changes also can cause a slight change to how light bounces off your iris (because the shape is a little different now). It's most obvious in light-eyed people (whose eyes can be bluer/grayer/greener depending on lighting, clothes, weather, and this) but it's not impossible in darker eyed people as well. </p></div>		</li>
