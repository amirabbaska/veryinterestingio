			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh.</p>
<p>I've always been able to do it with my eyes open, but only for a few seconds at a time before whatever muscle/s I'm clenching give out.</p>
<p>I tried it just now with my eyes closed, and I can make it last MUCH longer.</p>
<p>Interesting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oddly enough I can do it with my eyes open and for pretty much as long as I want. There's definitely a lot of variance in people's control over the mechanism </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can &quot;flex&quot; this muscle too, and now Im curious. Can all of you also &quot;wiggle&quot; your heads/ears? (I specify head cause I can actually wiggle my entire scalp forward and back, or just my ears)</p>
<p>Im just wondering if some people have more control over their... ear muscles or w/e</p></div>		</li>
