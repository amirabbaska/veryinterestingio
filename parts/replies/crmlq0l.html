Not much but if you live close to work, might be enough to get you home to plug in again overnight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i rode my bicycle 500 miles across the desert on the loneliest highway in the middle of june, desert is all bark no bite imo... riding in the darkness past weird air force bases while partially hallucinating was the hard part.. after that i switched to day time riding...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has driven through the desert multiple times, <em>stranded</em> implies being sufficiently far enough away that you would die long before that is worthwhile. The best thing to do would be use that awesome electric power for AC and cell phone charge. If you're cruising through Death Valley at 1kph with nothing but the windows down and you're not going to last long.</p></div>		</li>

<p>200 watts of solar panels, equates to about 1 km of electric range for each hour of full direct sun (about 200 W-Hrs) after being stored in the battery and used</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was in Arizona, for which he calculates 1.7kwh for an 8 hour day of direct sunlight.</p>
<p>In Maryland where he lives he says he can get about .8kwh.</p>
<p>He also spent $2500 on &quot;aerodynamic solar panels&quot; which he covered the roof and hood with. The pv efficiency is based on ideal conditions and would probably require you to wash your car quite often to maintain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former owner of the karma, shit didn't work. I'd rather park inside and charge the 50mile range battery for a couple of hours than do anything with the panel. The car had too much stuff and all of it was inefficient. You can get more charge going downhill for 1 mile on a lower gear than an entire day in clear July skies.</p>
<p>Such a stupid expensive car. Fuck that piece of shit.
(It does look pretty cool in the console: seeing all the &quot;energy&quot; from the wheels, panels and engine going into the battery)</p></div>		</li>

I was told by the former Fisker techs at our shop that it was just a static JPEG (We made the terrible mistake of being a Fisker dealership) that was there as a placeholder until the software was finished.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As it says later</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The solar roof is capable of generating a half kilowatt-hour a day[27] and was estimated to provide up to 4 to 5 miles (6.4–8.0 km) of additional range a week assuming continuously sunny days;[28] however, the solar panels as delivered only recharge the 12-volt lead-acid accessory battery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so it didn't add any power, it simply reduced load from the primary battery onto the 12v system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But cars sit outside all day. I live in California - I commute about 15 miles total, and my car sits outside in the sun all day. By that math, I'm making back roughly 2 miles a day, or about 13% of my daily use. That's not insignificant - in a hybrid that's using 13% less gas.</p>
<p>I suppose it doesn't make sense on electric cars since they're so cheap, and since it wouldn't really increase the range or capacity all that much, but on a hybrid that seems pretty significant.</p></div>		</li>
