			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how you would measure neurotransmitter levels, maybe from a brain scan but I have no idea so take that with a grain of salt. With depression or other mental illnesses though they don't really need to measure the levels, they can tell if you do or don't have enough based on whether you have symptoms or not.</p></div>		</li>
