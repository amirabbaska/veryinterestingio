			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't <em>snow</em> CO^2 but it would most likely leave a thin film of CO^2 <em>frost</em> on random surfaces, just like how water vapors condenses and freezes from the air when temperatures drop below freezing.</p>
<p>And even if a m^3 of air contains very little CO^2; air <em>does</em> of course move... and all air that blows over a such cold area (and itself gets chilled to those extreme temperatures) would drop its contents of CO^2 , so even if it wouldn't be amounts large enough to make up visible snow, the thin film would theoretically grow thicker as long as the temperature doesn't rise.</p>
<p>In reality, temperatures <em>that</em> low are usually quite temporary (on Earth), and the thin CO^2 blanket would sooner or later evaporate again rather quickly.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: Like many have said in this thread, the CO^2 levels in the air <em>in general</em> is too low to condense &quot;in the wild&quot;, but then again... The CO^2 levels <em>might</em> be higher locally, as in very locally around for example a scientific research station; with both breathing scientists and some kind of fuel powered electric generators. </p>
<p>These would however also produce heat,  but if I'm not mistaken there still have been observations of thin frost that has been <em>believed</em> to be trace amounts of frozen CO^2 , i.e dry ice, around research stations at a few occasions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every substance has a crystal lattice regardless of its state at room temperature. Their structure is just decided by different interactions, like van der waals forces/sterics, pi-pi stacking, etc.</p>
<p>Edit: I was a bit high when I wrote this but what I meant is that each substance can form an ordered lattice in the solid state. It is not always in that lattice when solid, nor does it have to be solid to have a lattice, such as with liquid crystals (which then also have various degrees of order). In a gaseous phase there is obviously no lattice formed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the temperature drops below freezing, there is still a certain amount of moisture in the air (not all the moisture comes out as frost or snow). It's reaching an equilibrium. Even at 30 below, there is still moisture in the air. </p>
<p>Is the CO2 concentration so low that it's possible none would come out. I believe it has to do with the dew point as to when water comes out of the air and how much of it condenses. How would the same mechanism factor in for CO2? Is it possible that despite dropping below the freezing point of CO2, the amount is still so low that none would condense out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, yes. You can think of it just like the dew point in air. If water vapor is almost completely saturating air at 75C, then the dew point will be like 74C and water will condense on surfaces that are colder than that. As you reduce the water concentration in the air, the dew point will fall until it's below the freezing point of water.  The same is true for CO2.  A -80C surface won't condense it out of the air, because the relative concentration is too low, and I suspect the condensation is too unfavorable with regard to entropy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on mobile right now so I cant investigate deeply, but we would need to find the equivalent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius–Clapeyron_relation" target="_blank">Clausius-Clapeyron_relation</a> for CO2, to see if at those low temperatures the CO2 concentration in the air can be saturated or not.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that no, there is not enough CO2 in the air to cause CO2 frost even at those low temperatures. But give it another few decades of the status quo and who knows? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would not be perceptible most likely, the vapor pressure of CO2 at -92C is around 300mmHg or around 0.4 atm. The atmosphere has about 1/1000th this concentration so the equilibrium will skew primarily towards vapor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because some introductory physics courses don't allow calculators on tests and don't really see the point of making students multiply by an annoying number like 9.81. They place higher value on deriving correct equations and remembering various formulas, so they simplify arithmetic where possible.</p>
<p>And they don't allow calculators because of the prevalence of programmable calculators, which makes it easy to cheat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>0.04 is a little ambiguous in that sense. To convey that there has been no rounding in the 3rd decimal place, one would write 0.040.</p>
<p>Either way, both values (current and earliest measured atmospheric CO2) are extremely low when compared to the history of the planet.</p></div>		</li>
