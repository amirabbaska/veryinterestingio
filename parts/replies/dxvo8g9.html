			<div class="markdown"><p>edit:  whoops, looks like i am wrong. hadnt looked at papers in a while.  looks like there are a couple papers showing there is a max.  looks like best rate may be 125 bpm.</p>
<p>Idris, Ahamed H., et al. &quot;The relationship between chest compression rates and outcomes from cardiac arrest.&quot; Circulation(2012): CIRCULATIONAHA-111.</p>
<p>leaving wrong post below so comments make sense:
if normal bpm gets too high you get improper filling, but again, chest compressions arent as effective so normal rules dont apply.</p>
<p>last time i looked, increasing compression rate over 120 still had survival benefits.  the faster you can press the better, and no upper limit has been established.  120 was chosen as a minimum because its kind of good enough and it is hard for people to do 2 minutes at a higher rate sustained.</p>
<p>basically if you have a deep rotation of people, you should just go as fast as you can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the negative pressure created by compressions is lost during the delivery of “breaths.”  There is a cpr machine which which pushes and pulls at 100bpm which mitigates this effect to certain degree. CPR is significantly more effective when the is a plunger-like pull following each push. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes. More people would probably be prepared with plungers if they didn't find them to be so cumbersome to carry. Pro tip: Wearing your plunger on your head will make carrying one a breeze, and  allows others to immediately recognize you as the authority on life-saving skills when the shit hits the fan.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There was a while where they said don't do the breathing, because maintaining the compressions was more important.  I guess they changed back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just did CPR training. After 30 compressions, attempt to do 2 breaths in less than 10 seconds. If you cannot get both breaths done in that time, go back to doing compressions. Do this every 30 compressions. Hopefully an AED is nearby, and somebody knows where it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do hands-only CPR at work for this reason. By pumping non-stop you keep up blood pressure moving it round the body. As soon as you stop you have to build up that pressure again. </p>
<p>Conversely, pushing down on the chest expels the gases in the lungs by compressing them, then when you release, air is drawn back in again. Whilst this is not enough to live by, it is enough for the current goal, which is keeping the brain oxygenated. Everything else is expendable. </p></div>		</li>
