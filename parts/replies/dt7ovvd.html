			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this answer and give some quantitative context, the apparent magnitude of the closest other galaxy, Andromeda, is 3.44. This is equivalent to the light from a 100 Watt incandescent light bulb at a distance of about 150 km. And that is the <em>closest</em> galaxy. If you were floating in the void between galaxies, you would barely be able to see the closest ones, and you absolutely would not be able to see your own hand in front of your face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If follow-up questions are ok:
(Note: Trying to write the question was difficult, so apologies if it just doesn't make sense).<br />
Take our solar system - is there a place in the galaxy where our solar system could be placed such that the immediate surroundings of the system were similar to what we have now, but the 'night sky' was just as bright as what we experience during the day? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brightest stars have an absolute magnitude of around -12, so they'd be roughly as bright as the full Moon from 10 parsecs (~32.6 light years) away. For one to be as bright as the Sun it would need to be a thousand times closer - around 2,000 AU. </p>
<p>An actively feeding neutron star or black hole can be significantly brighter, and the light from them is brighter still when inside a jet. No such object is currently feeding enough to be so visible within our galaxy, though it has obviously happened before and will happen again.</p></div>		</li>
