			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, classifying drugs as simply stimulants and depressants oversimplifies the effects and is regularly interpreted as their overall effect on the mind/body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think my favorite (least favorite?) example of this was the DARE program where they told us that &quot;you might expect alcohol to make you happy, but it's actually a depressant so it will make you depressed&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't most drugs some combo of depressant and stimulant? Not my field but I've noticed almost every substance stimulates one area (or more) and seems to depress another aside from maybe amphetamine which seems to only stimulate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every drug affects everyone differently. A lot of drug users tend to self medicate. For example people with ADD/ADHD who use &quot;stimulants&quot; tend to calm down rather than amp up. On the flip side,  just like kids in my high school who would abuse adderal, if you don't have ADD those meds are a definite Upper! Also, nicotine is addictive. IMO Sometimes just the fact that a craving is being fulfilled is calming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>mm, psychedelics are kinda stimulants i guess, but i wouldn't classify them as such<br />
especially when you get into dissociatives, i wouldn't label them even close to either</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: What other things can have these effects? I quit smoking 3 months ago, and as a web developer I find it much harder to concentrate on work now. I'm wondering if there is some healthy natural tea or something I can take to give me some of the relaxation and focus that I used to have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strong black tea. With or without milk, doesn't seem to matter. Tea and cigarettes have a very similar feeling in my body. </p>
<p>Tea has caffeine but also theobromine, which is calming and focusing simulateously. But, chocolate has more, and a piece of chocolate doesn't have the same effect.</p>
<p>I think though, there's a lot to be said for the ritualised behaviour of smoking or tea making. Ritual is good in times of stress, it calms us. Very few people are religious anymore but rituals still have power, they occupy our bodies while our minds wind down. Rituals are soothing, repetitive behaviour is comforting, and I think that's why so many people fidget or have oral fixations when they quit smoking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The theobromine levels are not significant to have such an effect. Black tea and especially green tea have a lot of Theanine, an NMDA antagonist that synergizes very well with caffeine, taking away the jitteryness and anxiety of caffeine.</p>
<p>Theanine is probably the most popular noot over at /r/nootropics as it's least expensive and most accessible for reducing anxiety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, except that doesn't make a <em>damn</em> bit of sense, since this is <em>not</em> what happens when someone who isn't an addicted smoker picks up and inhales. This is the worst kind of layman's anecdote.</p>
<p>A non-addicted individual who smokes a cigarette is NOT fucking focused and calm.</p></div>		</li>
