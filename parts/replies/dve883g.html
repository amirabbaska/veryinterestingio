			<div class="markdown"><p>So which strain do I want if I just want to mellow out and feel chill? A lot of the weed  I smoked as a teen made me feel paranoid and a bit like I was on a bad trip. I decided to quit since it was a constant unknown due to the lack of supply consistency. But now I’m about to move to a state where it’s legal! Fuck yeah!!! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most correct answer if you want to minimize anxiety.  As a personal anecdote, I have taken CBD and then smoked with noticeably minimal (almost non-existant) anxiety many times.  H
Haven't tried a high CBD to THC ratio yet but imagine would be the same</p></div>		</li>

<p>I heard there is one who acts like that and a lot of people are smoking it in the morning before work/school.</p>
<p>I think this could help with depression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer here. Also, Indica strains or Indica Hybrids are less likely to bring on anxiety inducing effects because of a few factors, one being tendancy to have higher CBD:THC ratios. So if you cant find something with with specifically CBD, pick Indica.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Go for a predominately indica dominant strain. Indica strains give a more body high that makes you want to chill out on the couch. Sativa dominant strains are more heady and energizing, which can give people a little bit of paranoia sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently had an edible that made me so paranoid that I had a hard time talking to my SO of 14 years. Somehow a tiny gummy bear of THC made me want to hide from the same person that used to comfort me on coke binges and serotonin depleted mornings after 3 day ecstasy benders. I can't do weed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me personally it’s the other way around. I get really anxious and paranoid from strong indica strains with an intense body high. When I smoke sativa dominant strains like lemon haze I feel great. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, cannabis contains compounds called terpenes which in conjunction with the cannabinoid profile drive the efficacy. Terpenes are also the flavor and aroma drivers in cannabis. For example, strains smelling like pine are high in alpha and/or beta pinene, strains that smell like diesel fuel are usually high in ocimene and so on. </p>
<p>If a high was like a bike, the cannabinoids, like THC, CBD, etc. are the pedals. The higher the concentration of these cannabinoids the faster the bike goes, or in this case higher you’ll be. Terpenes function like the bike handles, steering the effect.  To your head (sativa type strains), to your body (indica type strains), or anywhere in between (hybrid type strains)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a long time, but back in the late 70's and into 80's I didn't smoke too much because about half the time I would have to throw up. Is there a cannabinoid mix I should be avoiding? I remember reading where cancer patients smoked pot to keep them from throwing up. It seemed backwards to me. Any tips? I plan on travelling to a few states with legalized pot, so I want to experiment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a not well known disorder thats linked to cannabis smoking and violent sickness. My father in law has this issue and would get violently ill randomly from smoking. There was a few times he tried it and was fine but 9 times out of 10 hed get sick. Its not well understood and theres zero research on it so its up to experimentation to find If something works for you. If youre in a medical state try to get some pure cbd and see how that effects your body and if it seems to work then stick to high cbd strains. </p>
<p>Edit: its called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be mental. I'm a heavy pot smoker and psychedelics user and I usually always throw up on psychedelics even when that's not a common side effect. It doesn't matter what type it is, 30 minutes after ingestion I always throw up and then I'm fine and will have a great trip. It's completely in my head. For awhile it bled into other things too. Smoking weed? I started throwing up. Nervous about a date? I'd throw up. I know it is probably different for you but I'd still wager it's just something in your head. Like you throw up because you expect you will or something. </p>
<p>In my case meditation helped so I don't throw up on anything but psychedelics and I'm pretty sure I've broken that curse from it too.</p>
<p>Other then that make sure that you are breathing in the smoke and not accidentally swallowing the smoke. That makes my stomach flip the fuck out and almost always causes nausea. </p></div>		</li>
