			<div class="markdown"><p>Another small thing is that soap operas are actually designed to be listened to. Its not necessary to be watching the screen all the time and this is reflected in the way the shows unfold. The idea is that you can do something else with the TV on and still follow the plot. Its actually a hangover from radio plays but every action is either announced or given a distinct sound. E.g. People enter a room and everyone announces &quot;hello Name!&quot; They then proceed to explain that they are upset, rather than use a facial expression. Very important events or things that are visual-only will have dramatic music cues (to make you look up) or will be immediately commented on by other people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Come on now, sometimes it's a little varied. Instead of saying, &quot;Hello, Victor,&quot; you'll get, &quot;<em>GASP</em> Victor Kiriakis! How can this be, I saw you die!&quot;</p>
<p>I looked up how to spell that name. I heard that damn soap in the background of my life so much when I was a kid that the name sprang immediately to mind when people started discussing soaps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even better. Her ex-husband dies in a car accident, and I'd be the recipient for his eyes in a miraculous new ocular organ transplant procedure that JUST got greenlit by the FDA. After the surgery bandages come off, I realize that I've been given the ability to literally see Erica Kane's lies in some sick twist of poetic justice. I then do what I can to undermine all of her schemes... before... falling in love with her... again...</p></div>		</li>
