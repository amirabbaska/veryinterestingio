			<div class="markdown"><p>There are quite a few such machines that have formed patent applications, they consist of capillaries filling a container and then using the added gravitational potential to extract energy (eg letting the fluid fall through a turbine). I'd imagine Google's patent search would turn some up.</p>
<p>TBH I've always thought this was a good possibility - it's not a perpetual motion machine, it extracts energy from the environment. I imagine the gains though are worse than just having a bucket of rocks attached to a winch working as a generator and using your body to lift the bucket every now and again. </p>
<p>Not sure how capillary systems scale.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a room light that works like that. I'm on my phone and can't get a link at the moment.</p></div>		</li>
