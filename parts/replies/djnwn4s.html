			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: Not sure it has to be below 1, if you get far enough away. But it certainly has to be below the resistance of the shortest path by itself, since parallel paths exist to lower the resistance.</p>
<p>Yes, current flow is concentrated around the shortest paths - that's something we specifically try and mitigate in the semiconductor industry, to avoid excessive local heating in high-power transistors and such.</p>
<p>An analogue might be the visible patterns that lightning leaves when it goes through something, but that's a little different due to the different conduction mechanism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting, so this problem isn't entirely theoretical brain teaser then! </p>
<p>But in order to get to a node a knight's move away, surely you have to go through at least 3x1 ohm in series, even if all the other paths are in parallel with that one? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you can't ignore the parallel paths. All the resistors have an effect, but the effect gets smaller with distance. </p></div>		</li>
