			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense,  but why do I see it as blue and golden brown?  My brain can compensate for the shadows for one color,  but not the other? It's disconcerting that brown isn't even an option. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although swatching the color of one of the dark lace segments may give you that, the picture also isn't exactly one of very good quality - it's pretty overexposed, and I would suspect that that's what makes what might in real life be black appear as brown in the picture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does anyone NOT see it as blue and brown?  We're all used to colour-casts in photos, so it could just possibly be white although the shadows would be different.  But plenty of girls' stuff has 'nude' net (misnomer) around the yoke, so frills matching that would surely be the natural presumption.  Where is the evidence for any version of 'gold'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering how anyone saw it as black an blue when viewing on my iPad were it is a black border.  When viewing on my laptop where the picture border is white it shows as blue black.  So I think you will find that it is the reference colors you are seeing next to the picture that change it.  Take a black sheet of paper, cut out a square and hold that square over the picture, it should turn to gold and white, hold a white sheet over it and will be blue and black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a perfectly acceptable option, depending on what kind of lighting your brain interprets as being present, it's just that most people seem to side with blue/black or white/gold. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the people that only see a white dress.  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/fCrrgpo.png" target="_blank">This is close to what other people are seeing as a blue/black dress.</a>  I got this image by just editing the brightness and contrast of the image.  Maybe getting this view of the image will help you flip the colors.  I see a white dress most of the time.  After I stare at the altered image for a while, if I go back to the original, it looks black and blue.   I guess seeing the dress one way helps your brain correct the image in that direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of the dress and everything in the foreground as under a tent (and you, the viewer of the scene, are under the tent as well). While everything else (the background--aka what's lighter/brighter--aka what's out of focus) is outside of the tent. Think about the sun at high noon, directly over the tent and bright as can be at midday (so bright that when you exit the tent, you're blinded). Now, the dress's &quot;darkness&quot; is really just the shadow of the tent, because shadows have a slightly bluish hue compared to direct sunlight. If you can see the dress in the bluish-hued shade of a tent, then you can see the dress as being gold and white (where the gold is what you previously saw as black, and the white is what you thought was blue).</p>
<p>Alternatively, bring the picture up on a screen with actual gray or black pixels around the edges. Compare the top color on the dress to the dark gray frame, and it should look gold in comparison. Then try to see the color below that (what you think is blue) as white. If you can do that, you may also see it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that surprising given the ambiguity of the lighting in the photograph. The photograph is back lit and people seeing gold and white are interpreting a shadow across the front of the dress due to that. However, you can also see other shadows playing off the front of the dress, which indicates it is also being lit from the front.</p>
<p>I think this very much gets into a question of whether it's two faces or a vase, but in this case it's harder to switch your perception once you've seen it one way because it's a complex image.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can the lighting be made less ambiguous?  Can the picture be fixed?  I've seen many folks post versions where they crank up the blue, but that's not really fixing it.  Can the context be made clear to everyone?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Your description caused me to go back and focus on the shadows on the front of the dress. The colors slowly faded to black and blue. Now the picture is &quot;fixed&quot; in my brain, and I can't see it the other way. I try to focus on the backlighting, but it does not have an opposite effect</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe depends on the illuminant of the place where they are</p>
<p>edit: other people have made the great point that it looks the same to many people in the same room who see it for the first time, so I'm likely incorrect on this one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to agree with this, but there are lots of reports of couples disagreeing with each other on the same screen. Your guess is as good as mine as to why there would be a divide in priors aside from the obvious fact that it's just the right level of ambiguity to encourage both sides.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could be entirely due to lighting conditions in the room people are viewing the photo.</p>
<p>Try this experiment:</p>
<p>Stare at a blue square for 30 seconds then look at the picture.</p>
<p>Then, stare at a yellow square for 30 seconds and look at the picture again. Chance are your color perception will be altered from one to the other.</p></div>		</li>
