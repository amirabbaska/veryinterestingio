			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say it's more to do with relative motion to stationary objects.  Altitude plays very little.  Helicopters have a particularly difficult time over water, especially while hovering because there is no stationary object to gauge their motion.  That's why they sometimes use flares/smoke over water.  It provides a &quot;stable&quot; point of reference for their own motion in a hover. </p></div>		</li>
