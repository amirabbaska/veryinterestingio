			<div class="markdown"><p>Salt is also unique as a seasoning in that it's inorganic.  It's not grown.  It's mined, extracted, or refined.  It's a rock that you can eat because it's soluble in water.  Other inorganic nutrients like calcium, phosphorus, potassium, iodine, and iron are in or added to (fortify) foods, but they aren't part of the flavor characteristics (except when consumed as salts, such as potassium chloride, for example).</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a reason nearly any bottled water you can buy will either say: &quot;minerals added for taste&quot;, or the fancy water will give you a breakdown of the various minerals in it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>like running out of sea water? through an elaborate educated guess, id at the least say: no you retard.</p>
<p>you expel salt when you urinate and or sweat. your urine will eventually end up soaked in the soil.</p>
<p>rain water or other types of water, basically still water, will finally accumulate salt in some place where it will become a salt mine in the far future.</p>
<p>or it will end up in rivers and then in the sea. and so the cycle was completed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I used to work at a drive thru, we had to make fruit snacks and drinks. One of those items was lemonade and because we live in a predominantly Hispanic population, we would add &quot;Trechas&quot; fruit seasoning to our homemade lemonades, it's spicy, sour lemonade and gives a great flavor. I really recommend anyone to try it out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly. </p>
<p>Basically all flavored Starbucks drinks include salt. Same with virtually all commercial spice mixes, unless they are advertized as &quot;no salt&quot;. </p>
<p>Salt has a significant effect on flavor. Way before there is enough of it for a food to taste &quot;salty&quot;, it brings out deeper, richer, mellower flavors. </p></div>		</li>
