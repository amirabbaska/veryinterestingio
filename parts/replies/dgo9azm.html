			<div class="markdown"><p>So I get that the kinetic energy is more than the chemical binding energy, but shouldn't the energy released from the impactor conserve the momentum of the impactor, and therefore move in relative to the surface of the moon?</p>
<p>How does the explosion &quot;reset&quot; the momentum of the impactor? Isn't that impossible?</p>
<p>Surely the explosion should be a sphere in the frame of reference of the impactor.. So we should see the explosion, as it expands, moving across the surface of the moon, creating an oblong crater? What am I missing?</p>
<p>Like, if you explode a missile in the air, the explosion/fireball continues to travel through the air along the trajectory of the missile, it doesn't just stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a slow moving stream that you're paddling a canoe on.  Which direction you're going will make a big difference to your land speed because the water speed is a similar size to the speed you can paddle.</p>
<p>Now imagine a ultra-performance speedboat on the same stream.  Which direction it's going won't make much difference to its land speed, because the water flow is a tiny fraction of the boat speed.</p>
<p>Now imagine a meteorite hitting at a small angle to the moon.  It's moving sideways very slowly compared to the speeds all its vaporising gases will reach after impact.  You're right that the sideways momentum doesn't go away, but its spread across all the gas equally and is small in comparison, like the water compared to the speedboat. </p>
<p>So in short, no 'reset', more like giving a parking ticket to a billionaire, where the effect isn't really visible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what exactly is the &quot;explosion&quot; caused by? The expansion from solid to gas of the vaporized material? Any idea what the detonation velocity is? I just find it strange because meteors can impact at over 70km/s, so if the thing hit at a 45 degree angle, that's a 49km/s horizontal velocity. I don't know of any explosives that even come close to that, except maybe nuclear ones.</p>
<p>Seems like the explosive gases should be traveling horizontally at a significant portion of their own detonation velocities, if not many times higher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the size of the projectile. Larger bolides will have launch a lot more debris upward (termed ejecta) and they launch upward in a conical pattern and are then deposited in characteristic rays.</p>
<p>H2O content is also extremely important. If a comet with a high concentration of ice strikes the surface, the heat from the impact will melt the ice and cause the liquid water to mix with the ejecta and then run down the rim of the transient crater.</p></div>		</li>
