			<div class="markdown"><p>Can anyone explain to me why sometimes the settings on a tv make everything look too “real”, if that makes sense?</p>
<p>The only think I can think to compare it to is a soap opera. From my experience this was always on nice TVs. this never happened to my own devices so I can’t be sure but I always assumed it was something that could have been changed in the settings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That explains sooooo much, thank you!  I went to a friend's house to watch the Superbowl on his fancy schmancy tv, and while the game looked great, the commercials had that &quot;too realistic&quot; look.  The one that stood out the most was a movie trailer... I want to say it was for black panther, but not sure.  Anyhow, I just remember thinking, &quot;did they film that with a camcorder?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Movies are still filmed in 24 frames per second, which comes from technology limitations of the past. On the TV, it adds one or more frames between each of them, to smooth them out, which can lead to this &quot;fake&quot; effect (as in the frames in between were never in the movies data, just postprocessed by the TV).</p>
<p>On the other hand &quot;real&quot; high framerate videos look much different. Take<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAF4rfu-ETA" target="_blank"> this video</a> for example - or just search for 60fps videos on youtube, to see some native high framerate videos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will forgive a lot of technical errors if there is a good story, great acting, superb dialogue, and some substance and originality to the theme.  A small film like &quot;Blue Jay Cafe&quot; was way more interesting to me than a whole block of big budget correctly-lighted Hollywood productions.  </p></div>		</li>
