			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on your frame of reference! If you were to fly into a black hole and look at your watch at the moment you were passing the event horizon, nothing would seem unusual to you. That said, if someone watched you fall in, you would appear to move more and more slowly until you reached a distance infinitely close to the black hole. There would be a moment of you not moving, and then poof, you would disappear and the black hole radius would increase slightly.</p></div>		</li>
