			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only was wheat the perfect plant to harvest, the cow was the the perfect form of cattle to compliment. It provides meat and milk by eating the plants and part of the grain unfit for human consumption. They were also bred to do hard work, such as plowing the field, carrying a yolk, and transporting the food.</p>
<p>They were so important that most early religions represented their top gods with the bull (Baal of Babylon, Zeus of Greece, arguably Jehovah of the Hebrews) or revered cows as the most sacred animals (early Egypt, Hinduism, East Asia). They were usually associated with the harvest.</p>
<p>DNA testing of modern wheat and cows found that both originated in South East Turkey. It was the perfect storm of factors creating the agricultural revolution there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a correction, the word is 'yoke' not 'yolk'. Although that might well have been auto-correct, I doubt many people use the word yoke enough to get it into their phone's dictionary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also entirely possible that Neolithic communities did not necessarily see technological advance as a good thing. Many modern-day hunter-gatherer communities are contemptuous of settled, agrarian societies and fight to maintain their traditional lifestyles against modernity. This does promote the survival of 'the group' entity by slowing assimilation. Even in the West, technological innovation has only recently been seen as 'progress'. Classical and Medi√¶val European societies thought that humanity was degenerating from a golden age or prelapsarian state respectively. Our increasing reliance on technology was considered to be a symptom of moral, mental or even physical decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once you have time to settle you have time for people to use their brains for things like math, writing and government. The transition from hunter gatherer to modern day started when man began to farm. That was the turning point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it's not an issue of &quot;time&quot;--studies done with modern day hunters and gatherers have found that they have much, much more free time than us poor bastards who have to work all day, as farmers did and still do. It's more that once you have a large population and you're engaged in a collective pursuit like agriculture, you're accumulating stores of grain. You have to calculate how much you need to save as seed stock, you have to calculate how much each family needs, how much fertile land in an area needs to be allotted to a group. In order to remember this and organize it, you need writing and government. It's not that humans had &quot;government&quot; and
math&quot; floating around inside of them--they're adaptations to changing environments. </p>
