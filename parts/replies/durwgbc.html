			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep patterns are important. Your body is used to waking up and going to sleep at certain times. When you alter that, it screws things up.</p>
<p>Also: where you wake up during your REM cycle is important as well. In terms of alertness or awake-ness when first waking, you might be waking up at the literal worst time to do so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it is about sleep cycle. when you wake up after 6 hours your at the end of your sleep cycle most likely (if you re used to 6 hrs) while after 10 you might be in deep sleep cycle or whatever its called and it takes a good hour to wake up correctly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You produce chemicals while asleep that make your body numb and your brain tired. Sleep cycles seem to come from the fact that in the wild you may need to wake up from a danger, so your body does not put you in REM sleep right from the start and instead goes through stages of lesser to then deeper stages of sleep. So if you wake up groggy in say stage 3 sleep and are only awake for a couple minutes then your body has no time to get rid of the chemicals and realize you are well rested. (If there is an actual danger though then Adrenalin will pump itself to the for front and cancel out your sleepy chemicals). Instead you wake up and in those couple of minutes still feel like you are tired due to the chemicals your body has produced, so you go back to sleep. It's not just the brain saying &quot;hey I'm tired lets sleep&quot; but also the chemicals your brain has already triggered to help you sleep. Kind of like trying to open a pickle jar right when you wake up. Sure your awake and it would make sense for you muscles to work right away, but if you are coming from a REM sleep then the chemicals are still there and your muscles won't work right for a few minutes meaning you probably cannot open that jar. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking on the other guy’s comment so you can see this. Sleepyti.me is a great tool to gauge your sleep. It actually works really well. Sleeping an extra 30min to an hour can put you in a deep sleep, and when your alarm wakes you from that deep sleep you’re gonna feel like trash compared to if you happened to wake up in a lighter sleep state.</p>
<p>This is why sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night feeling like a fucking GOD, and other times you wake up after your 8hrs are up and are tired and groggy.</p></div>		</li>
