			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US, I think hatchbacks are also perceived by many as being less sporty and stylish than sedans. This is not universally true, of course, and there is a kind of hatchback subculture in the US, but mainstream America thinks hatchbacks are for nerds. There is an old association between hatchbacks and family-oriented station wagons (complete with fake wood paneling) in the US--not exactly sexy stuff.</p>
<p>Personally, I love hatches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>US also has lots of interstate driving. The mileage gap between a mid-size sedan and a compact hatchback has been dwindling, and is least pronounced on the highway.</p>
<p>Random example:</p>
<p>Chevy Malibu with turbo 1.5 - 27/36...Chevy Cruze hatch 28/37</p>
<p>Some cars with larger engines (i.e. naturally aspirated V6's) sacrifice a few more MPG in the city, but still get well over 30MPG on the interstate. Basically, no sane person with the money to spend is going to take the hatchback for fuel economy reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, larger sedans are way more comfortable and have larger interiors, which people prefer given that many people in the US have long commutes or have to sit in their car for extended periods of time to get around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Australia we tend to have large distances to travel but still love hatchbacks and sedans equally (probably leaning more towards hatchbacks now), albeit with larger engines than what are found in Europe. I'd say we care less for comfort over handling though, and don't enjoy the wallowing susoension tune that many US cars get (which also makes hatchbacks more palatable since they tend to have simpler, less sophisticated suspension setups). </p>
<p>That being said, security of what's in the trunk tends to be a low priority here, since we also love utes, which are not only not secure but also openly advertise whatever you've got back there (although hard tonneau covers are popular too). </p>
<p>There's also the perception of quality - we associate Japan with quality, and companies like Toyota who make extremely popular hatches have a reputation for lasting forever in Australia.</p></div>		</li>
