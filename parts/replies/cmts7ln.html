</blockquote>
<p>p = mv is a classical, Newtonian equation. In Einsteinian relativity, E^2 = m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2 - this looks familiar for an at rest particle, it reduces to E = m c^2</p>
<p>Anyway, if you plug in m=0 for a massless particle, you'll get E = p c, which is what I used. </p>
<p>Here's a simpler argument though. Imagine two particles, at rest. One emits some light (a high energy photon perhaps) that is later absorbed by the other one. The body that absorbs the light now has to gain a kinetic energy equal to the energy of that photon, meaning that it is now no longer at rest, but moving. Since it is moving, it must have some forward momentum. This means that the photon carried that momentum from the first particle to the second. The first particle, by conservation of momentum, now <em>must</em> have some backwards momentum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this derivation correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>p=mv</p>
<p>p=(E/c^(2))*v, from E=mc^2</p>
<p>p=(E/c^(2))*c, since v=c</p>
<p>p=E/c</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the response. TIL E=mc^(2) is the at-rest energy of an object with mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of my favorite theorems in physics. Every conservation law is directly related to a symmetry. Momentum is the quantity that must be conserved in order for translations in space to not change the physical system. In other words, because the laws of physics are the same no matter where in the universe you are, there must be a quantity that is conserved, which we call momentum. This is called Noether's theorem and it sort of answers the question of &quot;if momentum isn't mv, then what is it? &quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, energy is due to the fact that it doesn't matter <em>when</em> you perform your experiment -- time translational invariance.  And angular momentum is due to the fact that it doesn't matter with which rotation you perform your experiment.</p>
<p>(And then you have things like gauge symmetries which aren't as easy to understand.)</p></div>		</li>

As I understand it Congham Snail Racing is regarded as the world standard of snail racing, there not being any other snail racing. I also went to school with the owner of the champion snail for several years running, he's in the guinness book of world records somewhere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my first responders training, a 9mm bullet is only deadly when it comes out of the barrell of a gun, if a bullet is discharged while in a magazine, ammo box, or just loose it will make a loud sound but the actual bullet, even if aimed precisely, will be incapable of penetrating a sheet of cardboard as much of the energy goes out the sides and back of the casing instead of focusing on the bullet. So the energy of the gunpowder needs to be focused and directed as well. If you just had 16 9mm shells worth of gunpowder laying in a tupperware with a bullet on top when it lit the bullet might get launched up a few feet instead of becoming a super 9mm bullet(watch out for flying shards of molten plastic or glass if you're going to be demonstrating this to your high school physics class!).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you mean. It's certainly very counterintuitive when you think of a bunch of 9mm bullets being fired off, the kick against your hand and the bullets poking holes in things, but the actual combined energy isn't that much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Non-physics guy answer here:  the bullet wouldn't be lifted up at all. The powder simply burns in, around and out from underneath the bullet.  The bullet might move around a little, but it will basically drop to the ground as the powder supporting it burns away. </p></div>		</li>
