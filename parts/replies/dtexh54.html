			<div class="markdown"><p>It's much more than that. A lot of math is developed that has no apparent connection to reality at all. Actually, most math is like that nowadays.</p>
<p>The really amazing thing is when we <em>later</em> find that there's actually a piece of reality which some &quot;useles&quot; math turns out to describe very well.</p></div>		</li>

Turned out to be pretty critical for Quantum Mechanics (among other things). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's a coincidence. Not because math has some secret connection to the universe, but because math is just a language that we use to model what we understand. It reflects how we think about things. So as we keep hacking away at the edges of our understanding, it's not surprising it is organized like our previous understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So by deducing math from reality, and further extrapolating math through rigorous logic, we can glean clues as to how unexplained aspects of the universe may function?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d also say that maths is pretty much about studying abstract things that “make sense”, in order to come to logical conclusions about them. As the universe makes sense (things flow logically from rules) maths ends up being able to describe the universe. But that’s just my two cents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how it was earlier in history.  These days math is much more likely to lead to a new revelation in physics than it is the other way around.</p></div>		</li>
