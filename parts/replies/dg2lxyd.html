			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, two reasons.</p>
<p>1) The regular workers, while they do have ovaries, they're much, much smaller so if another one started laying (which does happen occasionally), they don't have nearly the same production capacity as a female that was raised to be a queen. (My understanding is that it has to do with the amount and types of food given to the ant while it's still a larva that determines what morph it becomes as an adult). </p>
<p>2) The workers were never part of a nuptial flight (due to having no wings) and never mated. Thus, any eggs they do lay would be males, not workers.</p></div>		</li>
