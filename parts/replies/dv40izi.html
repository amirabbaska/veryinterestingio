			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It's &quot;temporary&quot; as others have said, but takes millennia to dissipate (on Mars, that is) so it's actually not beyond the realm of possibility. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I think the biggest issue with creating a breathable atmosphere on Mars is it's lack of a magnetic field. Any attempt to thicken the atmosphere, a process that itself would be a colossal task, would only be temporary as the solar winds would just dissipate the atmosphere out into space again. </p>
<p>As of right now, the only way we know of  generating a magnetic field of that size is through planetary-scale interactions within the core of Mars itself. Not exactly something we have the technology for at the moment. </p>
<p>I'm curious, what would be needed to generate an artificial magnetic field powerful enough to protect a planet artificially. Given unlimited resources, is such a thing even possible with our current tech?</p>
<p>Assuming a magnetic field can be established, than there are plenty of known chemical reactions that can create the gases needed to thicken the atmosphere. Earth environmentalists shun Hummer drivers and worship the Prius. Martian environmentalists would welcome the Hummers fantastic ability to turn hydrocarbons into plenty of much needed CO2 gas!</p>
<p>Edit: Hmm... combustion needs O2, doesn't it? Cancel the order of Martian Hummers...</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not, the biggest problem is producing the atmosphere itself, you will need at least a <em>few thousand trillion tons</em> of it (Earth's atmosphere weights in at about 5000 trillion tons), and probably at least a few dozen times more in mass as water in order to make the living condition somewhat friendly to humans.</p>
<p>Stopping solar wind is actually a relatively simple engineering matter in comparison. You can for example put arrays of satellites (edit: or even a ring) around the equator of the planet to generate artificial magnetic field, you will need an awful many of them, but their total mass will be less than tiny compares to making atmosphere itself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is simply not true. For instance, there is a lot of interest in the idea of placing a strong magnet at one of Mars' Lagrange points to shield it from the solar winds. The idea even seems promising:<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, by producing more gasses on the planet and releasing them into the atmosphere. The mass of the planet and strength of solar winds determine how long that atmosphere sticks around, but a livable atmosphere on Mars would last millions of years if I remember right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Relatively thin atmosphere. Mars is .00628 atm (according to Wikipedia), Earth is about 1, Venus is about 90 atmospheres. Unbelieveable that Venus has so much, considering the temperature, especially under the subsolar point.</p></div>		</li>
