			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer IMO. No other game in a casino has this running history like single, double, six deck shoes in blackjack that alters the edge throughout the end of the shoe. Which is also why casinos love the continuous shuffle blackjack variety because the history is non-existent and the edge is always in the casinos favor (I think).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I was just recently in Vegas, my sister who has never played black jack before was asked to cut the deck.  When she did so she jokingly put it after the very first card and then moved it to the middle.  It was made clear by the dealers reaction that it was either not allowed or was really looked down upon.  </p>
<p>What would they do if you cut the deck after the first card, or after ten cards for that matter in order to increase your ability to read the deck.</p>
<p>Btw, at this particular casino they reshuffle the deck when you reach the break point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) It's frowned upon because it slows down the game and creates more work for the dealer.</p>
<p>2) They will make you cut to something more reasonable.</p>
<p>3) how would a shallow cut make it easier to read the deck? If anything the increased shuffling makes it more random and reduces your ability to count. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>State laws vary.  In WA state, you must cut at least 1 deck from either end of a shoe.  It's all about laws, we dealers know it makes no shittin difference where you put a cut card.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Baccarat is another game that is played with a shoe, usually 8 decks. It is 50/50 for the base bet but a house edge for the bonus bets. Also most casinos will charge a commission for the banker bet. I've hear there is a way to count but the edge is very small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Casino dealer here. This is true of many carnival games (ultimate Texas, three card poker, high card flush, pai gow, etc.) The actual odds of winning and losing the main bets are completely 50/50 and thus rely on bonus bets and commissions to swing the odds in favor of the house. Other games like blackjack, roulette, and craps are based more on win/lose odds but still implement bonus bets to get a little more. For example at the casino I work at on craps a $1 bet on the 12 rolling has a 1/36 chance of winning but only gets paid $30 to $1. That's how roulette makes money. While occasionally you can get the odds in your favor on blackjack it's not possible on any other game. The only bet I can think of that doesn't have an edge for the house is the odds bet on craps. If the point is six the win lose ratio is 5/6 and every $5 wins $6 but you are required to bet a pass line bet order to bet odds again turning it in favor of the house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny (to me) you mention Baccarat because it's been a game I've heard talked about so much especially from the old guys at the BJ tables. They would make it sound so fun but I just have always loved playing Blackjack that I never really got into it and I am not looking to pay the casino to learn if you catch my drift. lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's also why baccarat tables tend to be high minimums. We were just in Vegas for EDC over the summer and couldn't find an affordable table to save our lives. Old Vegas and the strip both all had high limit tables from what we saw</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most casinos I've been to use a six deck shoe and reshuffle at the yellow card, which usually lived at the 70% done part if the sack. Is counting cards still a viable strategy when so many cards are un-revealed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, because you still know what you started with, and what's still left in the deck. The only way to change that would be to start each hand with a new shuffle, putting all the cards from the previous hand back into the deck. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are no games outside of blackjack that continue to use a deck after the hand is over except Baccarat, but in baccarat the house follows a very specific set of rules and the player has no say in the outcome of the hand so counting techniques don't work.</p>
<p>Edit: forgot about baccarat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Counting doesn't work for bac because there is only am advantage from knowing what the first card out of the shoe will be, and only if that card is an 8 or 9.  Counting techniques would be able to tell you when there are more of those two cards n the deck but that doesn't help you bet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Roulette also can be exploited. There was a case where they analyzed results and found that every wheel produces uneven results, due to manufacturing. You only need a small error to exploit.</p>
<p>Same thing happened with electronic slots. They literally weren't randomly distributed. The first exploits were shockingly simple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can track a wheel.  You'll need about 1000 on the same wheel with the same ball, before the wheel gets rebalanced  which happens regularly.   Now assuming you won't get shafted by a rebalance, and there's a greater that 8% wheel bias ( edge on double 0 roulette is like 5.6% or something) you'll need to sit there for hours not attracting attention.  Given that dealer spins per hour are like 20-30 on a decently busy game, you'll need to match like a hawk, never miss a number or a ball switch for at least 300 hours to get a decent sampling.  That sounds fun...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The truth is almost every casino table game is exploitable, and legally (no hidden computers or whatever), it's just the methods change.</p>
<p>Three card poker?   Exploitable
Pai gow poker?  Exploitable
Mississippi Stud?  Exploitable
Every blackjack variant?   Exploitable
Let It Ride?   Exploitable
Ultimate Texas Hold'em?   Laughably exploitable</p>
<p>The player edge when fully exploited ranges from very small to well over 150%, depending on the game and the pay tables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Casino's are happy for customers to think they can beat them. Because almost all of them don't, and subsidize the few who do. They could care less as long as they can quietly and politely kick out the occasional person who's too good. The bottom line is if Casino's weren't raking it in, they wouldn't be building them non-stop and splurging on everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just imperfections in the wheel but also if there is a dealer (not the auto-spin ones), you can use that to your advantage. Dealers spin and throw a lot so they get into a rhythm. It's obviously not exact but if you watch a few rounds and determine where the ball tends to land based on the start position of the wheel, you can slightly increase your chances.</p></div>		</li>
