<p>Enormous, unshielded fusion generator. No safety equipment at all; Dangerous levels of radiation. Totally shit, unsafe design that never should have passed even a cursory safety evaluation.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hypothesis_Null" target="_blank">Hypothesis_Null</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  That'd be called co-generation.  A lot of college campuses have power plants on them with accompanying steam tunnels.  The remaining heat once the turbines extract some of the energy for electricity is used to make steam, which is then pipped around to heat up buildings.</p>
<p>The problem is still overall cost-effectiveness, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also another problem would be the type of water you’re using as steam. Distilled water used to make steam has many different chemicals in it to protect the boiler in which it is produced. Therefore it would not be suitable as drinking water. </p>
<p>So either drink chemical water or be replacing boiler tubes every other year. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's an active field of study for all fields of power generation. Nuclear powered aircraft carriers and subs actually use cogeneration to create potable water, unless I am mistaken. The idea has been tossed around the nuclear industry in particular since plants tend to be located near coastlines, so they could be naturally suited for cogeneration. (Of course, people would need to start building nuclear plants again for that idea to take off, and desalination with nuclear plants comes with its own can of worms. Salt water is a mess to work with, and the words &quot;mess&quot; and &quot;nuclear&quot; like being separated as much as possible.)</p></div>		</li>
