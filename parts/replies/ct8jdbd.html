			<div class="markdown"><p>True. Some do the opposite, though. Supposedly, Daniel Radcliffe made a point to wear (more or less) the same outfit for six months straight just to mess with his paparazzi, as it effectively rendered it pointless for them to take new pics of him if they'd just look like the older ones ;) Apparently, it worked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you often have to wonder whether most celebrities really hate papparazzi or not. for example, leonardo is almost never shown by papparazzi. that's because he avoids them and don't engage them. so it seems that it is pretty easy to avoid it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that the Kardashians call the paparazzi on themselves sometimes. At first it seems outrageous but if you were feeling particularly good on the way to the gym why the hell wouldn't you do it? It's their only way to manipulate the media, I guess. They probably deserve it since they're usually under fire lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick story: a few years ago in journalism school, we had a paparazzo come to my ethics class for a Q&amp;A that ended up lasting three hours (and only one hour was &quot;Have you met (celebrity)? Was s/he nice?&quot;</p>
<p>Apparently, a lot of celebrities call paparazzi; it's the ones you would expect, though, the ones who need to stay in the magazines and in the news to stay famous. When you see someone like a reality TV star photographed coming out of a club, it's almost always planned by that star or their handlers. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't this sort of like taking a serial killer's word when he says that he only killed <em>bad</em> people?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be higher. It's a have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too situation. The majority of photos you see in magazines like Us involve a publicist sending out an alert that's like &quot;hot actor that's going to be in the big film this month will be 'casually hanging out with their family' at the beach at x time.&quot;</p>
<p>There are so many celebrities that you want that buzz when it's your moment to shine. However that also creates a market for photos that spills over into your personal time as well. When celebrities are annoyed, it's usually for that night or short time they don't need more press. However, when they don't have any attention, they're just as troubled by it.</p></div>		</li>
