			<div class="markdown"><p>As an interesting addition to what you said, for all who are interested, it will be year 1 next year in Japan, because the current Emperor will abdicate and hence the imperial year counter will start again. It's 30 now btw. I was born in 61 of the old counter. It's kinda confusing sometimes. </p>
<p>Edit: oh and don't worry if you're like: Well I wouldn't know what year it is... Some Japanese people don't know what the current &quot;Western&quot; year is.  I say some because I've met some for whom that was the case. Purely anecdotal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh! I read that link, interesting indeed. I wonder how they figure that the only Japanese translation for type is shiki though. We regularly translate type as kata depending on what were talking about. Maybe it's a weapon specific thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the year 4716 in the Chinese calendar because the Chinese calendar doesn't continuously count years, rather it has named years that repeat in a 60 year cycle. Calling it the year 4716 is just the conversion of the number of years since the traditional epoch (start date) of the Chinese calendar into the Gregorian calendar. The current 60-year cycle started on 2 Feb 1984. The current year in the Chinese calendar is &quot;Wu-Xu&quot;, or &quot;Earth-Dog&quot; in English, the dog part being the part of the 12-year repeating Chinese zodiac that many people are familiar with.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh my goodness, it makes so much sense now. Since Jesus was considered “the king of kings”, the Western calendar is just a way of identifying The Ultimate Regnal Year.</p></div>		</li>
