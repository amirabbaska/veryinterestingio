			<div class="markdown"><p>The Sun is about 400x farther away than the Moon, so there's quite a lot of room for the Moon to orbit and comparatively much less for a sub-Moon. Gravitational perturbations scale very strongly with distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there's no chance of it happening?  I'm so interested in this, but have no idea about the specifics.  Would it possible with a very large planet?  Bigger than jupiter, with a very distant moon?  Thanks so much!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like parent said, there are artificial satellites to moon, and in principle there is nothing perventing from it happening naturally, except it becomes increasingly unlikely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain further? </p>
<p>As I understand it, as long as the Sub-moon is outside of the Roche-limit it will remain stable and not shred into rings or fall onto the moon.  </p>
<p>As long as the sub-moon is within the Hill-Sphere it should not get pulled back towards the parent planet. </p>
<p>I understand that this is a limiting set of conditions, but is there any reason that it couldn't happen? Assuming that the moon is substantially large and substantially far away from it's parent star, I see no reason why it couldn't be host to a sub-moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically both the Roche Limit and the Hill Sphere are proper boundary phenomenon, but cease to be distinct things once you're considering gravitational field dynamics instead of patched conics. Essentially, the smaller the distance between the two bodies, the less accurate our standard 2-Body approximations are, and orbits begin changing in very unpredictable ways. This is because the influence of Extra bodies on the gravity field around the bodies becomes more significant.</p></div>		</li>
