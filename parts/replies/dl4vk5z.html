			<div class="markdown"><p>I get that everything with a temperature (so..everything) gives off a broad spectrum of wavelengths. But, since the EM field is quantized wouldn't that mean that if you zoomed in far enough on the blackbody distribution there would be tiny little equally spaced  vertical lines due to Planck's constant? </p>
<p>Since the x-axis on the graph you provided is in units of (wave)length, the spaces would be of width âˆ†(lambda)=hc/E= Planck length, correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there is no such thing as a smallest photon, photons are gapless/massless, meaning you can have a photon of any energy.  Quantized does not mean there is an energy gap, whether or not the field has a mass term determines if there is a gap.</p>
<p>As for your mention of the Planck length, I don't see any relevance of it to this conversation.  It seems to be a common issue on this sub that people think the Planck length somehow relates to a &quot;smallest distance&quot;.  I was never quite sure where this notion keeps coming from but it happens enough that there's a section in the wiki specifically addressing it:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/physics/plank_scale" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/physics/plank_scale</a></p>
<p>Is that the issue? The Planck's length is an attempt to establish a length scale where both quantum effects and general relativistic effects are of comparable relevance.  Not sure how that applies here though. </p>
<p>I'd also point out that small energies correspond to LONG wavelengths, so if anything a discretization of photon energies implies a finite or periodic universe, which is to say the existance of a MAXIMUM length in the universe. i.e. something to do with the very large, not the very small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the question being asked (or to be asked) is what's happening on a quantum scale to produce an apparently continuous spectrum, since the emissions themselves are based on some quantized energy gaps, like for example how elements have well defined spectral lines for the various energy gaps available. Thermal emissions should just be forms of these decays from excited states, right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, everything with a temperature is emitting black-body radiation with a distinctive Planck distribution of wavelengths</p>

<p>Not every object is a perfect black body. The distribution can be different, and it typically is different. Stars are quite good approximations to black bodies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya, definitely correct, I just didn't feel like talking about emissivity and Kirchoff's law.   Everything emits, but the spectral shape has complexity regardless. I chose to keep the message simple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So low temperature has peak in infrared and higher and higher temperature eventually peaks at blue. Why? Why is the peak in that band. On intuition I would imagine that as temperature got higher and higher, the frequency would go higher and higher. I get that you can't have a wavelength of 0, but why is it in this small band?</p>
<p>And does not the Sun emit loads of other lower frequencies? How are those created? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the lowest of the lowest temperature is in the longer and longer radio.  The average temperature of the universe is -270 Celsius and emits in the radio, life on Earth is a smoldering/balmy 0-10 Celsius (on average) and emits in the infrared, our star is 6300 Celsius and emits in the visible, hotter stars emit in the ultraviolet and even hotter or more energetic phenomena in the x-ray or gamma ray:</p>

<p>Yes, absolutely it does, by no means is our star the hottest in the universe, it's a thoroughly mediocre star.  .</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It's not... where are you getting this from?</p>
<p>Light can have wavelengths ranging from the length of the universe, to arbitrarily small.  Human eye balls can only detect light that is about 700 nanometers to 400 nanometers, by standards of the universe that's an entirely arbitrary and meaningless range, but as it turns out, it's essentially the range in which the star our species evolved around provides light most prodigiously (this isn't actually the whole story, really you also have to look at how light from our sun survives a trip through our atmosphere to fully understand why we evolved for the range we did).  There is no &quot;chicken and the egg&quot; here.  The reason the &quot;visible&quot; spectrum is &quot;visible&quot; to Earth life is because we evolved around a star where those wavelengths are most useful.  Alien life around Zorlon 5, a red dwarf, would place no significance on 700 to 400 nanometer light and presumably have evolved to find an entirely different, arbitrary, range of light &quot;visible&quot;</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, there is no upper or lower bound to a Planck distribution.  Our sun, for example, emits still tiny amounts of radio (tiny relative to the amount it emits in the visible) but this &quot;shine&quot; is more than enough that we've based our entire weather and climate satellite technology around it, for example.</p></div>		</li>
