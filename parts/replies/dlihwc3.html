<p>Well... yes? Some of them have evolved to be able to pass through the stomach to colonize the gut, and a few species like H. pylori have even evolved to live right in the stomach.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As /u/CrateDane already pointed out they can; the &quot;bad&quot; bacteria usually die in the gut because of fierce competition for nutrients with the rest of the microbiome, and because they are attacked more fiercely by the immune system.</p></div>		</li>
