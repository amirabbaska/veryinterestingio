			<div class="markdown"><p>It causes Systemic inflammatory response syndrome.  </p>
<p>So cytokines are signaling proteins in your WBCs, and when they get released they activate other WBCs to release more, it's like a domino affect of your immune system.  Suddenly every immune cell in your body is going into overdrive to attack an invader.  </p>
<p>So, when you typically get sick, the feelings of exhaustion, bloating(depending), general malaise, fever, that's all your immune system, it's not the actual virus attacking your cells, it's your body's response.  So, imagine if that all just went into overdrive everywhere all over your body.  Fever is fucked up, it's our bodies way of trying to kill invading organisms.  Since 37C (body temp) is actually pretty high in terms of thermotolerance, bumping it up a bit can denature or destabilize certain proteins, causing some viruses and bacteria to grow much slower or not at all, allowing the immune system to take control of the infecting agent.  </p>
<p>edit:  immunology is all about cascades, so it's like a cascade of signaling molecules telling other cells to produce more etc.  It's kind of exponential in a sense, but not technically because I don't think it's quantitative enough to be considered truly exponential, but the basic rate of activation is kinda the same idea.  Like, molecule A1 will tell cell 5Z to release molecules G5-G8 and all those thing go and tell other things to do things.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Picture the Middle East.  The US sends in soldiers (white blood cells) to fight &quot;terrorists&quot; (disease).  One day the terrorists attack with new weapons  that the US cannot fight with soldiers and tanks.  So in desperation they fire a nuke into the areas of heaviest resistance.  This destroys the enemy, but also any friendlies and the surrounding infrastructure (organs).  Enough of these or one in the wrong place and you end up with nothing left standing (death).</p></div>		</li>
