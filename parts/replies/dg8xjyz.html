			<div class="markdown"><p>If some Bodiless Intelligence created us, that is one powerful and impressive entity to possess such intricate knowledge as to create all these processes. If it was evolution, I am baffled by the millions upon millions of errors and dead ends all organisms must have met before it all came together 'just so' and create viable and adaptable life. And obviously, humans may simply be one part of the long road that is evolution. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great response. It's also interesting to note that the baroreceptors that you mentioned monitor blood pressure literally every single beat. And even more so, it has the option of changing stroke volume or heart rate in order to increase cardiac output. Cardio physiology is pretty interesting stuff.</p></div>		</li>
