			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify a bit, muzzle velocity isn't just a function of round grain and powder grain, but also barrel length, as the longer a round is in a pressurized barrel the faster it will go. </p>
<p>Handguns in .45 are typically subsonic, excluding +P loads, but that may not apply to rifles using .45 rounds cartridges. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, my MP5SD has a little stub of a barrel. And it it is vented. IIRC, like 5”. </p>
<p>This allows me to shoot 115G 5G loaded ‘standard’ 9MM and it still be subsonic. In fact, I was warned to NOT shoot sub loads in it. </p>
<p>But I was trying to not get into the weeds... Just a basic concept. Technically, temperature, altitude, and humidity all also factors.  As someone else pointed out the composition of the charge plays in as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another notable factor is propellant composition. The amound of velocity gained or lost due to a change in barrel length depends on how quickly the propellant deflagrates. A &quot;fast burning&quot; propellant might produce similar velocities between a long and short barrel, whereas a &quot;slow burning&quot; propellant might gain or lose a significant amount of velocity depending on the barrel length.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, speed of sound is around 1125fps at sea level, and become slower with more altitude. So barrel length, twist rate, powder charge, bullet weight, shape of bullet, and size(width) all contribute to speed and effectiveness of suppression.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While this is generally true, it's not due to decreasing pressure like you might expect. It's due to decreasing temperature. While pressure can have some effect, it is tiny compared to temperature.</p>
<p>So whether you are in Denver or LA, if the temperature is the same, the speed of sound will be the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for adding the secondary part to this explanation. I worked in the hearing industry and we spoke about this a bit as it relates to loud noises that can cause damage to hearing. Wouldn’t slowing the bullet down defeat the purpose of firing that type of gun in the first place? Why don’t people just use less powerful guns if they want to make less noise?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, kinda. Again .45 is already subsonic so there is no &quot;penalty&quot; for using a suppressor. But yes, slowing down a bullet will normally reduce the effectiveness, but normally this is not important on short distances. I'd not want to get hit by either a 115gr/5gr powder bullet OR a 147gr/3.5gr bullet... They both will kill you. But yes, the slower bullet will become less lethal faster as distances increase.   </p>
<p>Some other people said another reason... It is not about making it silent, just making it harder to find out where the shot came from.  </p>
<p>Another reason is to reduce hearing pollution. I'd rather everyone use suppressors and in some Countries they are encouraged for hunting - They consider it polite.   </p>
<p>People don't use less powerful guns because a suppressed 9MM is still more powerful than a .22. But in some cases people do just use smaller guns.  </p>
<p>These are kinda neat <a href="https://www.sgammo.com/product/22-lr-ammo/500-round-brick-22-lr-aguila-super-colibri-powderless-cartridge-primer-fired-20-g" target="_blank">https://www.sgammo.com/product/22-lr-ammo/500-round-brick-22-lr-aguila-super-colibri-powderless-cartridge-primer-fired-20-g</a> </p>
<p>They have only the primer charge. They sound about as loud as an air rifle, but pack a bit more punch than a stock air rifle.   </p></div>		</li>
