			<div class="markdown"><p>Because more government means more police that aren't one hour away, enough fire trucks to arrive on time, a larger more diverse zoning board, and ethical environmental regulation. I understand your point and it's a good explanation, but it sounds like more government should be exactly what you wanted</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a respectful reaponse, but i think the point is that at a certain lack of population density, &quot;enough&quot; govt becomes unsustainable. If it, say, takes 10,000 people's taxes to sustain a firestation, when you get to a place with 100 people a square mile it becomes impossible to have a fire statio. Within response time of everyone. It is like public transit. Until you get a certain density of people, bus and train routes aren't only financially unviable, but they can actually be environmentally worse than cars. A postal worker dropping packages off where each stop is a 30 person apt complex costs just about the same as someone who is dropping packages at single person homes, while earning 1/30th the stamp cost.</p>
<p>I don't think the responders point was &quot;our local govt sucks so shut it down,&quot; so much as &quot; our local govt doesn't have the economic base to solve problems at a scale our tax base can support.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps that was a generous reading of it though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds correct. I think that is why many Scandinavian and european countries have such high quality of life. The countries total population may be relatively low but most of it is the in dense clusters of smaller towns and cities whereas here in rural america people spread out a lot and don't mind living 45 minutes from the nearest grocery store.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Property tax rates are higher in the city though. Plus higher priced housing and higher density. One would think a city would be more efficient and require less taxes per person. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if you quite grasp the expansiveness of a majority of the United States. Many rural areas could never feasibly have a dedicated police staff or fire station within an hour of themselves, people simply are too far spread out. Instead many rural communities have volunteer fire departments and a county sheriff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are definitely right. I lived in the rural US for 17 years and I have seen what you are describing so I don't want you to misunderstand my comment. Functional and fast-responding fire departments are not feasible across the entire country but they are still ideal. The original commenter essentially said &quot;we did't have enough fire trucks so I didn't like the government at the time.&quot; but the government is the entity in place capable of providing more trucks. </p>
<p>An analogy would be &quot;my boss doesn't pay me enough so I don't like him.&quot; It's a valid argument and opinion but no matter how you feel about your boss you still want more money. No matter how you feel about your local government you should still want a functional fire department. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My neighbor is a mile down the road. And I'm still 45 minutes to a large 30,000 city.</p>
<p>I also volunteer for the EMS and if we taxed the population to provide these resources, police, ems, fire, and public transport, there would be no one making money. People would stop working because if you don't make money what's the point in working.</p>
<p>Being in rural area I meet social justice warriors that come to tell us how to live and how to think. Sure I could be more excepting, but when I live in the highest meth use county in the state I'll pass on being welcoming to strangers. A bullet is a lot faster than police. I also work for volunteer ems and know these meth users will lie, cheat, and steal for a fix. </p></div>		</li>
