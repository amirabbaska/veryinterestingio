			<div class="markdown"><p>it depends on the speed i guess. This is all highly speculative as I am not quite familiar with the exact way that the plasma is forming in Earths atmosphere. If the spacecraft is not too close to the speed of light i could imagine some form of bowshock forming around the spacecraft. This is because in the frame of the spacecraft the nebula particles are being slowed down from supersonic to subsonic speeds, which can create some sort of a bowshock which will compress the medium and create a plasma due to the high temperatures.  However if the spacecraft is too faster, i.e. very close to the speed of light the particles would directly hit the spacecraft. Since the particles are now very highly energetic they will colide with the spacecraft and create particle showers similar to the ones in created in particle accelerators. This radiation can be very dangerous for a potential crew. I don't think a bowshock will form in this case because the particles are not slowed down before they hit the spacecraft. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's similar in that the cause is ultimately the same, but the energy scale is completely different. With aerobraking the relative velocity is enough to ionize the molecules, so that's equivalent to a thousand degrees or more (I'm talking very approximately, so it doesn't matter which degrees). When the velocity gets subluminal, the energies are enough to fuse the nuclei, so that's equivalent to millions of degrees, like in the core of the Sun. Of course the upper limits of our atmosphere are much denser than the nebulae, so if you want to estimate the damage you have to take this into account as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it contracts. While the density of the nebula is low, the size is enormous. They are often up to 100 light years in diameter and typically contain the mass of about 6 suns. There is a lower limit to the size of the nebula that is required to form stars, but I can't recall it right now.<br />
In order to trigger the star formation, the contraction of the gas cloud needs to be perturbed. This perturbation could be radiation pressure from a nearby star or gravitational disturbance from nearby stars.  </p>
<p>Once the star ignites the cloud will eventually be blown away by the radiation and solar wind. This is called the &quot;propeller regime&quot;. So after the star is burning it will have pushed/blown away the nebula that it formed from. </p></div>		</li>
