			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the &quot;brown fat&quot; that begins to spot grow do so to replace normal fat or appear in addition to it?  If I decide to start swimming in a cold pool to lose weight, for example, will swimming in cold water have any effect on me getting trim when compared to a similar workout in warm water?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried that last year. as a 63 year old swimmer with about 30% body fat and a a slow swim rate of one mile an hour, I did not lose a single pound even though I started swimming in an open lake as soon as the ice went out. My diet was the same as when I started. I swam  a mile every other day, shedding my wetsuit was the water finally warmed up. I had increased my shoulders, arms,and leg strength  a lot by the fall, but lost no weight at all!
Don't count on losing weight just by swimming in cold water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What happened to your body fat percentage? I mean, if you bulked up your shoulders and legs and such but didn't gain any weight, you should have reduced body fat percentage, which is similarly beneficial, if I was the same weight I am now, but 10% lower BFI, I'd be ripped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting; thanks for posting! What's the warm up procedure after a cold water swim? Sauna? I imagine jumping in a hot tub would just about kill you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly right, well done, I find myself explaining the dangers of hot showers and tubs every year. Every year some triathlete faints and needs medical attention.</p>
<p>Sauna is good if you have access, (which I don't on a rocky Irish coastline). Simplest and best is get dressed quickly (I have a 5 minute rule, I must be dressed before Aftershock hits, my core temp falls and I lose fine motor control), use multiple layers and go for a walk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really a &quot;depends&quot; question. There is cold water swim and then there is COLD water swim. When the water is less than 55 degrees F and I have been in more than 1/2 hour, I simply cannot grunt it out and wait for my body heat to recover. I shiver for a good hour or so and feel very uncomfortable for several more even if I cover up and walk around. Above 55 F, I am OK.
When I get out of COLD water, I get out of my wetsuit as soon as possible and dry off. The suit continues to suck out body heat and it is covered in very cold water. I drive home, get something to eat, and about 1/2 hour after getting out of the lake, I start a TEPID warm shower and gradually  warm it up. Even after the shower, I am still somewhat cold so I dress warm and cover up until I fully recover in an hour or so.
Last year when I was expecting to &quot;burn off fat&quot;, I grunted it out and no hot showers which made me hesitant to go swimming again in very cold water and I suffered. This year I know better. Exercise is better than than shivering! </p></div>		</li>
