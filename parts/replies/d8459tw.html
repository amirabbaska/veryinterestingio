			<div class="markdown"><p>That's all true, but there's a simpler answer: audience size. The Presidential contest is relevant to hundreds of millions of people nationally (and of interest to billions around the world), whereas each Congressional race is only relevant to a few hundred thousand in a small area, and thats assuming that everyone to whom the race is relevant was interested in paying attention to coverage. So the national media ignores local races because each is not relevant to the vast majority of their audience. Some outlets, like FiveThirtyEight and RealClearPolitics cover the Congressional races in the aggregate, but mostly coverage is limited to publications for political wonks and local coverage (if that), simply because of the percentage of a media outlet's audience to whom the races are relevant. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Treating it like it is, is one of the reasons you just had a 90 minute political debate with next to no debate about politics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding your third point about Trump: In all fairness, his attacks and/or disrespect towards women and Latinos does matter because that combination is a majority of voters. Millions of more women vote than men in the US and Latinos are 13% of the population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really frustrating to see these legitimate concerns about being represented by someone who thinks you're less-than portrayed as a creation of the media. These are the same people who got furious when Bernie Sanders slipped and said white people don't know what it's like to be poor</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that &quot;less than&quot; as in Trump thinks less of them or that he thinks there are fewer of them because they're underrepresented in media?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, it's late and I'm tired and I've not yet even watched the debate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She was an employee of Trumps hired on the basis of her looks, and she got fat. Should Trump have just fired her instead?</p>
<p>In case you're having trouble putting this together, because I realize this may still sound bad, try thinking of her as a fashion model and as Trump as the person paying her to take pictures.</p>
<p>She also threatened to kill a judge, and before you say that was never proven, she was just asked about it on CNN and told said something along the lines of &quot;we all do stupid things in our past&quot;. This doesn't change what Trump said but it does make her unsubstantiated claims of him calling her &quot;Housekeeper&quot; less credible in my opinion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we're doing direct elections, then there's no other real option than to gerrymander to ensure minorities don't get disenfranchised.  </p>
<p>Of course, not all gerrymanders are created alike, but sometimes you need to concentrate population to give them seats at the table.  Otherwise their 20% will always lose out to the majority and get 0 seats, rather than getting 20% of the seats like you'd want.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember an episode of Colbert where they interviewed one of the people who are in charge of redrawing county lines in heavily gerrymandered areas. He basically concidered himself a great artist and mapmaker, and completely ignored the fact that he was destroying democracy for thousands of people.  It's quite sad.  </p></div>		</li>
