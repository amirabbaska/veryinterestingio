			<div class="markdown"><p>Not ideal for the compost pile.  It needs to heat up and be fed on by the worms.  It heats up better if it's piled up (as opposed to scattered by the birds) and of course if they eat the worms, the worms aren't there to eat the grass clippings and kitchen scraps.  </p></div>		</li>
