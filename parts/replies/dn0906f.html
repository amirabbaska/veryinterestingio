<p>Anyway, when spiders die, they typically curl their legs under them. Spiders don't possess muscles like that of insects and other animals, but instead what some would describe as some weird ass hydraulic system; fluid is forced to extremities, sort of like having eight penises for legs and getting boners instantaneously to walk around. So when a spider dies, its limbs essentially lose pressure and all sort of wind back up. Spiders suffering from dehydration will have trouble moving for this reason and sit in a similar fashion.</p>
