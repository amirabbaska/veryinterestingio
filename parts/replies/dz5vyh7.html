			<div class="markdown"><p>Leading requires skill in placement, as in an absolute worst case scenario one point will have to absorb the weight of 2 falling climbers and gear, up to 250kg as a static load, and up to a tonne as a falling load. So not only do you have to choose the right pieces and place them correctly, but also assess the cliff's strength where you place them. This is a skill that requires many years of training and experience, with a working knowledge of physics. </p>
<p>Removal can be difficult, especially after a piece has been fallen on, but making a mistake will result in a broken piece of gear, not your own or partner's death. </p>
<p>Newbies generally belay for a couple of years, taking note of how the lead placed something, asking them questions and practicing on small ledges with minimal exposure (fall potential). </p>
<p>Physically as demanding as each other as you are both climbing the same route, although leads may fall more often if route finding on a new climb. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the piece gets weighted or fallen on it can be very difficult to remove, sometimes to the point of getting permanently stuck. Placing a piece is not physically difficult but does take know how. Removing a peice can be really easy or impossible depending on the circumstances. Ive left quite a few pieces on climbs because they were impossible to remove. I hope this helps :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Placing gear requires skill and efficiency especially as you go up the grades in climbing. Also the head game makes it way more intense to lead. </p>
<p>Following takes most of the head game out (sketchy traverses are a different story, but not every route will have traversing) and one can often sit on the rope if they need to fight with a piece of gear. Ultimately leading is more difficult. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically there will be an easier way down. Something like a hiking trail. I'm sure that's not universal though, I know there must be some routes that you just have to downclimb. </p>
<p>Most climbs aren't just a way to get to a place that is otherwise inaccessible. Climbers are just in it for the challenge of the climb. </p>
<p>Buuuuuut, I just do bouldering, so take all of that with a grain of salt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the route and what options are available. Sometimes there is a &quot;walk-off&quot; - a path that can be hiked down safely. Other times, the only option is to do a series of rappels (lowering yourself down the rope using a device which controls the speed of descent).</p></div>		</li>
