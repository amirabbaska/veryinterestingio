<p>So for 100 choose 10, 1/100 x 1/99 x ... x 1/91 = 90!/100! Or 1/(100x99x...X91)</p></div>		</li>

<p>90!/100!</p>

<p>The odds are actually a little better than that. There are 100! total ways to arrange the 100 song playlist. For the 10-song album to appear in correct order <strong>anywhere in the 100-song playlist</strong>, we have:</p>
<p>1 way to arrange the 10-song album, 90! ways to arrange the remaining 90 songs, and 91 choices of what position the album &quot;starts&quot; in. This last bit accounts for the fact the album could be the first ten songs (position 1, through 10), the last ten songs (position 91, through 100) or anywhere in between. </p>
<p>So that's 1x90!x91 = 91! ways to get the desired result. Since we have 100! possible outcomes, our odds are 91!/100!. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it would be 100x99x98x97x96x95x94x93x92x91 divided by 10!, so it would be 1/17,310,309,460,000</p>
<p>Edit: I believe this is the calculation for the first 10 songs being the album in order, not sure how you could calculate the likelihood of the album occurring in order at any part of the playlist</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The calculation for the first 10 songs being the album in order should be 90! / 100! â‰ˆ 1.62 <em> 10e-19. This is because there are 90! playlists that begin with the album in order, and 100! playlists total. Another way to think of it: there is a 1/100 chance the first album song plays first. Given that, there is a 1/99 chance the second second plays second, ..., given all that, there is a 1/91 chance the tenth song plays tenth. Multiply those together and you get 1 / (100 </em> 99 <em> ... </em> 91) which is the same as 90! / 100!.</p>
<p>To get the chances that the complete album plays in order somewhere in the playlist, multiply that by 91. That's because there are 91 ways to place the album in the list in relation to the 90 other songs. So the figure is 91! / 100! which is about 6.9e-17.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To find it at any part in the playlist, you look at how many different places it can start and multiply the chance of getting the whole album in order form the start times that. The album is ten songs long which means it can start at any of the first 90 songs so it would be 1/[12,310,309,460,000(90)]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not setting aside Apple logic/programming, it is 100% impossible, in fact, your shuffle is not random. Originally, it was, but since humans are adept at identifying paterns, we thought that there was an ordered patern in random shuffles, whether it be in artists, song genres, ect. So they use an algorithm to order it specifically to seem random.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It used to be like that. Too many people complained that it wasn't 'random enough' so they changed it. According to Steve Jobs, &quot;We're making it less random to make it feel more random.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>true random meant that there was a chance you would get the same song twice. you might listen to your favorite song, then a song you never listen to, then a song by artist as the first song, then a son you play often then another by first artist again then your favorite song again. people thought this was because it had weighting that they didn't approve of so apple made it less random by adding weighted preference to songs and artists that haven't been played recently so now it is much more likely to play more songs before hitting a repeat and that appears more random to the casual observer.</p>
<p>It's like a reverse of the gambler's fallacy.</p>
<p>a roulette table that hit black 7 times in a row is due to hit on red right?</p>
<p>wrong. the chance is always 50/50 (or slightly less due to 0, 00) but you get the point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this algorithm actually prevent an album from playing in order? I'd think it would be more geared to preventing songs from playing twice too close together, and preventing songs from the same album or artist playing close together when you haven't selected to play songs only from the album/artist.</p></div>		</li>
