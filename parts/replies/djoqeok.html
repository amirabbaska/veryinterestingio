			<div class="markdown"><p>I can add some confirmation backup for number 2. I was listening to a podcast about evolutionary psychology and they were talking about humour being a way to subtly test common understanding and intelligence among peers. </p>
<p>It's still used for that reason all the time like when your circle of friends have an in joke it separates who's in the circle(tribe) and who isn't by who gets it.  Who's socially intelligent enough to be &quot;one of us&quot; and who isn't. </p>
<p>They also touched on how people might fake laughing to try to appear to be part of a different tribe for the same reasons benefits. like laughing at your bosses joke whether you get it or not because you want to be part of that circle </p></div>		</li>
