<p>Traditional 3D rendering works backwards: you start at the virtual camera and, for each pixel you want to render, trace out a line until you hit an object - each line goes out at a slightly different angle for each pixel. </p>

<p>You're describing raycasting/raytracing.</p>
<p>OP mentioned a graphics card, so he is probably talking about rasterization which is more typical in games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing, and that's what is often done. But there are two problems: first of all, a fire moves a lot. As the fire moves, the light and shadows should change. So at the very least, the light has to change position. But also a large light source casts different shadows: when light is not coming from a single point, the shadow cast has a partially-shaded area called the <em>penumbra</em> which you are most likely to have heard of in the context of solar eclipses. This just means that it's possible to partially cover up the light source. You can even fake this to an extent. But the illusion is still not perfect, because shadows cast by firelight are are made more complex by the complex shape of the flames, which themselves are always changing. Each way of getting closer to a true simulation makes the picture closer and closer to reality, but at the cost of more computation.</p></div>		</li>
