			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were naked in space with Line of Sight to the sun the part of your body facing the sun would be absorbing a lot of radiation and heat while the other side wouldn't (assuming you're in Earth orbit and not too far away like in interstellar space). Sunlight is deadly hot and it's the atmosphere of Earth that filters out some of the more intense rays and makes it safe to be in the sun while also helping to maintain a warm enough atmosphere, but with enough exposure we still burn, aka sunburn. This is also why astronauts have special visors on their helmet to protect their face and eyes if they have to do a space walk while in LoS with the sun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sun isn’t “deadly hot.” Its rays are more deadly in space because lower wavelengths aren’t scattered like they are on earth (eg ozone). If we didn’t have an atmosphere or anything reflecting, Stefan’s law (if I recall the right number) dictates the Earth would be about 40F. Sunburn is not burn but rather an inflammatory response from UV damage to skin DNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The high frequency UV waves don't transmit heat very effectively. UV, X-ray, and gamma can cause a lot of damage to tissue and DNA (leading to cancer), but they don't make you warm up.</p>
<p>IR is the most effective at transmitting heat. Microwave works as well on certain materials, which includes the human body. But it would come down much more to how far you are from the Sun, because the density of the waves is going to be very important. Assuming we are taking you are floating out in space around Earth, it would be pretty low. Definitely low enough that in the seconds you would live you wouldn't feel it. Now if you could survive longer, I don't know. A lot of it would come down to how you would survive because the human body regulates heat mostly through the sweat response. So after your body lost all its water in the vacuum you would start to overheat because your body couldn't lose the heat and probably at a faster rate than the Sun's radiant heat would warm you. If we discounted that, then it becomes an issue of whether you would be absorbing radiation faster than outputting it and what the equilibrium point was, but then we would have to agree on a temperature for you to be at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, absence of heat. Everything around you on Earth conducts and amplifies temperature, like cold air or a hot summer sidewalk. In space, there's nothing. Compared to you at 98 degrees F, nothing feels cold. Touching a dead body feels cold, even though dead bodies are just room temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's like when you use a can of compressed air and it gets very cold, even though the conditions outside the can have not changed.</p></div>		</li>
