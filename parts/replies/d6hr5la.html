			<div class="markdown"><p>But how does one practice Existentialism in day to day living when one is constantly bound to normative behavior in day to day society? I can't really expound that much, (at work) so I hope you are getting the context of my question.</p>
<p>I am bound to act in a certain narrative or else I suffer. E.g. I need to care for my tribe (family and friends) so I can be cared for in turn. I need to get a well paying job to avoid suffering the indignities of being poor. </p>
<p>I'm actually constantly struggling between my want's of living an ethical life (that's what I think gives me my life's purpose) VS what's actually pragmatic. E.g. I know that it's more ethical (for me) to help a homeless mother VS satiating my wants by eating at fancier places but I eat at fancier places anyway because I know it's what that's benefiting me in the long run.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if this is getting nowhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You always have the choice to suffer, or to let your loved ones suffer. Their suffering would be the consequence of your choice and you could bear sole responsibility for it. You choose not to do so, and therefore you take the responsibility/credit for their thriving. </p>
<p>A Nazi guard ordered to kill Jews, on pain of execution, could still choose to sacrifice himself. The intellectual dishonesty of saying &quot;I had no choice&quot; would be bad faith - the closest thing to a sin to an existentialist. An existentially authentic Nazi guard would say &quot;I chose to value my own life over the lives of the people I was killing&quot;.</p>
<p>The only limit on this are the &quot;facticities&quot; of life - that is, it's common sense that a starving African child has fewer choices available to him than Donald Trump. But even the choice not to end your own life is a choice.</p>
<p>As long as you always acknowledge that every action you take is a choice (Sartre even says choosing not to choose is a choice) you are living an authentic life.</p>
<p>This is kind of a baseline for constructing a personal ethics that is consistent with your actions. If you accept that your family's wellbeing is more important to you than the wellbeing of others and make choices in accordance with that, then you are not living in bad faith. The realisation that you are making these choices daily and, in the example you present, choosing to let certain people suffer so others may prosper is what I understand Sartre to mean when he speaks of &quot;angst&quot; or &quot;anguish&quot;.</p>
<p>Our natural inclination is to run from this horrible freedom and find a doctrine or scripture that will make us feel like we had no choice, and therefore no responsibility for the outcome. This is &quot;bad faith&quot;. There's a great little parable in Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov on this called The Grand Inquisitor. Look it up if you get the chance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some thoughts (not the OP):</p>
<p>From reading your comment, there seem to be conflicting implications that an authentic life needs to both be free from the restrictions of society while at the same time honoring other moral and ethical codes that are social in nature. My question is: why?</p>
<p>Existentialism states that you exist before you have purpose, so you define your own purpose. Imagine you have an upcoming office party that you don't particularly want to go to, and since you feel compelled to go to further a &quot;certain narrative,&quot; such as cementing a reputation as a team player to further a career (also a social construct), this seems inauthentic and not how you would define your purpose in life.</p>
<p>My question is, why do you not want to go? This would certainly be a more individualistic choice, but what purpose exactly would not going serve?</p>
<p>Let's say your argument is that you want to spend more time with your family. You want to live an authentic life putting family first, because you love them, rather than spending time with coworkers, whom you're indifferent toward. However, now it gets more confusing, since going to the office party and being successful would also help your family in the long run.</p>
<p>The point I'm trying to get at is, we all need to realize that we are not blank slates at the time we start thinking philosophically. Our assumptions about what would be an &quot;authentic&quot; and &quot;purposeful&quot; life are already partially defined by institutions, societal norms, dominant religions (even if we're atheists), and countless other influences that have shaped the world we live in. These are the same institutions, organizations and societal norms that facilitate certain types of activities that in many cases will be consistent with the goals you want for your own &quot;authentic&quot; life, since they originated from the same source.</p>
<p>Is rejecting all of these societal norms and living on an island more &quot;authentic?&quot; I would argue that doesn't seem to serve much purpose either, unless you are a rare individual that sees society as counterproductive to the purpose you feel you have defined for yourself. In your case, you would probably say that living on an island does not fulfill your greater purpose, since you also want to help others. Chances are your self-defined purpose in life is still going to be relative to many social constructs that themselves are arguably meaningless, which is ok, but you can't build a purpose using them as a foundation and then not expect to interact with them in your authentic life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think Sartre would have you reject societal norms only in two ways:
1) They are not objective universal values;
2) They do not absolve you from the burden of choice.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean you can't take them into account in making the choice. My understanding is that as long as you acknowledge that you have infinite freedom and are always making a choice and continually defining your essence, you are being authentic.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The point is, you're not. You have just decided that suffering the indignities of poverty, are more bad than suffering the indignities of abiding by normative behavior. There are people who do suffer poverty willingly in exchange for breaking normative behavior. People who are homeless by choice for example, and instead travel the world in their RV and live off of the land. They don't think they're suffering, they think the guy sitting in an office is suffering. What suffering is, is subjective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it is inauthentic. All purposes are authentic, as long as you always acknowledge that you are making a free choice, and the responsibility for the choice is yours alone to bear.</p>
<p>Another way of ending up in bad faith is to state &quot;I am this type of person, therefore I must act this way&quot;. This is another way of stating I have no choice. Existentialism says you never &quot;are&quot; something, you are perpetually in a state of &quot;becoming&quot; something - our defining of our essence is continual with each choice. Each choice is &quot;spontaneous&quot; and individual.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In reality existentialism doesn't encourage you to drown in meaninglessness. It purports to describe the world as it really is and offers an answer - When you realise that you are abandoned and without purpose, you can create your own purpose. You can define yourself and live a truly authentic existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's what I always liked about existentialism. It feels uniquely empowering. One of the underlying premises here is that even your perception of the world is up to you. Optimism is a choice you make.</p></div>		</li>
