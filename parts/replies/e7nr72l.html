			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, the proximity fuse was invented in WWII, by the US.  </p>
<p><del>And I think the Germans invented an airburst round that was triggered by altitude, in WWII as well.</del></p>
<p>They used timed rounds to achieve an airburst effect.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Proximity fuze was invented by the British, and after the Tizard Mission in 1940(basically the Brits technologically uplifting the Americans), the Americans in 1942 developed a version small enough and durable enough to be used in high velocity shells.</p>

<p>And no, they weren't timed: They used a small Doppler radar set inside the shell itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source for that? I've done more reading on the subject than most people, I think, but I've never heard of using barometric pressure. Seems far too variable and complex to do the same job a time fuze would. Not doubting, more just curious. And, WW-II is fairly &quot;recent&quot;, all said and done, I think</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flak fuses were generally of two types, timing so after a set number of second the fuse would explode which would be based upon a calculation of the speed of the shell to work out the right altitude to explode or alternatively the shell would explode when the air pressure matched the setting again matching the required altitude of the target. Converting that to ELI5 &quot;the fuse reaches the set altitude it explodes&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I've ever read, air pressure was never used. Too variable, minute to minute. If you have to re-set your fuzes every time the weather changes, you may as well just set (far more reliable and cheap) time fuzes instead. Not arguing how they were employed, just the method of actuation. </p></div>		</li>
