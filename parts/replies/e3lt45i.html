			<div class="markdown"><p>The attraction the Moon has on a small Glass of water (100ml) is only around 3.066×10^-6 newtons. The difference between one side of the glass and the other end is a tiny fraction of that force (I would guess less than 1/40x10^<del>6</del>9 of that value). If you position the glass 10m from the center of mass of a 20ton yacht or truck the gravitational force is only 1.335×10^-9 newtons but the difference between one end and the other will be a much larger fraction (the difference is around 0.026×10^-9 newtons). So your location on earth (the gravitational field is not the same at every point of earth's surface), a passing truck, a yacht in your backyard or a skyscraper next door will all have a much larger impact on your glass of water.</p>
<p>The more relevant question is if there is a measurable difference between the two end of the glass. The answer is clearly no.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay so let's consider being at sea level at the equator with no large objects around. (Bolvian salt flats sort of environment) </p>
<p>Now that we have a control, what size would a glass of water be required to be in order to have a measurable or observable tide? Or would it have a tide no matter what the size? Does depth and surface area both have affect? Does one have a greater affect than the other?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, Earth's gravity pulls straight down. The surface of the water in your cup would be a perfect circle. If you tilt your cup, the surface of the water forms an oval shape. </p>
<p>If there is another source of gravity that is not also pointing straight down, the water in the cup will look as if you have tilted it ever so slightly. So the shape of the surface of the water would change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pattern is much more complicated. Compare two selected points on the West Coast: <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/noaatidepredictions.html?id=TWC0405" target="_blank">South</a> and <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stationhome.html?id=9443090" target="_blank">North</a>. Despite having a similar longitude, the tides are shifted by 3.5 hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:M2_tidal_constituent.jpg" target="_blank">Here is a map</a>, white lines are points of equal time for high/low tide. A single worldwide ocean would have all vertical lines. As you can see, that is not even a good approximation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry, I should have mentioned that I was talking about the magnitude of tide (that's the subject, isn't it :-) ).</p></div>		</li>
