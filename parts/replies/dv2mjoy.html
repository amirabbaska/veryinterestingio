			<div class="markdown"><p>The Reddit conundrum.  A wide-spread myth becomes universally accepted and when people tell them they are wrong, they downvote to oblivion.</p>
<p>Just yesterday I saw a comment about eggs being lain soft by hens and it was a high-upvoted comment.  Didn't even think to question it if I am being honest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s what happens when you let <em>anyone</em> participate in the discussion. People who don’t really know much about the subject chime in on something they partially understand. Or worse, they go read Wikipedia and give a paraphrased answer. ELI5 is rife with this. Subs like askscience and askhistorians have well-sourced answers by flaired users who are experts in their field. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Your Italian father spends years telling you Italian olive oil is a scam.  You don't believe him.  Some guy on reddit says that and you immediately believe it.</p></div>		</li>
