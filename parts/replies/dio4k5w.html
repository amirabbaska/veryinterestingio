			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because drugs are <strong>medicine</strong>.  You take them if you're <strong>sick</strong>.  If you're not sick, why would you need medicine?  </p>
<p>If you want to know why that law was passed, you need look no further than two men: Ken Kesey and Timothy Leary.  In a time when nobody knew anything about psychedelics, they introduced them by using them to scare the shit out of America.  Timothy Leary was going to give your kids LSD, warp their minds permanently, and then your kids would never want to speak to you again.  He was such a winner he wound up in prison.  Ken Kesey was just a degenerate, but he got a lot of publicity.</p>
<p>In a time when people's opinions about psychedelics were plastic, these two men did a tremendous amount of harm.  Deliberately, they knew exactly what they were doing.  But fuck society, right?  Burn it all to the ground.  <a href="https://status451.com/2017/01/20/days-of-rage/" target="_blank">But that's what a lot of people thought back then.</a></p>
<p>Ken Kesey and Timothy Leary set back beneficial psychedelics 50 years, with malice aforethought.  They have a lot to answer for.  The adoption of psychedelics by far-left wackos who, likewise, wanted to tear down our society certainly didn't help.  </p></div>		</li>
