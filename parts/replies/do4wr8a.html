<p><a href="https://sciencing.com/giraffes-communicate-4567917.html" target="_blank">Giraffes use infrasound</a> (sound to low in frequency for humans to hear). </p>
<p>Usually 150-200 Hz, but can go <a href="http://www.animalvoice.com/Giraffe.htm" target="_blank">as low as 11 Hz</a> .</p>
<p>So when a giraffe wants to talk without humans knowing it ... he takes it to 11!</p>
<p>EDIT:  Ack-- mixed up my frequencies.  Humans prefer 150-200 Hz,  Giraffe commonly use 20-40 Hz</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uhhh what? Humans can hear 150-200 Hz easily. The average human limits go down to about 20 Hz so when giraffes get below that, that's about when humans are unable to hear. But if the usual sounds are about 150-200, then ezpz for human hearing.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, not necessarily. Vocal chords of humans are vertical to the neck, not horizontal. Adults have lower voices because their vocal chords are thicker and more loose, not longer.</p>
<p>@Edit I may have mixed up vertically and horizontally. What I meant was, vocal chords in the neck are situated more like this: [ - ], than this: [ | ].</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is almost completely incorrect.  The vocal folds run from the front to the back of the larynx, not up and down the neck vertically.  Also, while adult male vocal folds <em>are</em> generally thicker than those of women and children, they are also longer.  The length difference is a major component in one's vocal range.</p>
<p>Edit: looking at the context, I think you just mixed up vertical and horizontal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation, but I'd suggest the following improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>don't describe the vocal cords (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_folds" target="_blank">vocal folds</a>) as &quot;strings.&quot; This is anatomically inaccurate (the vocal folds are mucous membranes stretched across the larynx with free edges), and potentially confusing to 5-year-olds who have not played string instruments.</p>
</li>
<li>&quot;The same thing happens if you take that sound and artificially make it move faster. You're shortening the length of the thing that is vibrating so it sounds higher pitched.&quot; The second sentence does not follow from the first. By moving something faster, you aren't &quot;shortening the length of the thing that is vibrating.&quot; I'd say that by moving a thing faster, you're imitating the type of sound that a shorter version of that thing <em>would</em> make.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why doesnt his secind sentence follow? Wouldnt shortening the the length of vibration through speeding the video be the same as imitating that sound sped up? Or are you saying the vibration itself is not sped up but the recording is?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you take a sound and artificially make it move faster (i.e., speed up a recording of an audio signal), this is the same as imitating the sound that the original vibrating source <em>would</em> make <em>if</em> it were shorter/smaller.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll concede the first point for accuracy, except to say that a vibrating string can be easily demonstrated or visualized, whereas a vibrating mucous membrane cannot, and since this sub isn't literally explaining to five year olds anyways I find it's easier to understand the string concept as adults. But point taken. </p>
<p>On the second point, you're wrong. When you speed up a recording you are literally making the recording go faster, shortening the length of the thing that's vibrating, which when you're dealing with recordings, is a waveform. The waveforms that replicate the sound that was recorded move back and forth faster, which makes the pitch higher. </p></div>		</li>

<p>When you speed up a recording, you're making a speaker reproduce the original vibrations at a faster rate. You're not magically changing <em>the length of the original thing that is vibrating</em>, which is what your original sentence claimed.</p>
<p>This seems to be a difference of definitions. You're referring to the waveform itself as &quot;the thing that's vibrating,&quot; when really <em>the thing that's vibrating</em> is the thing that's vibrating (pardon the tautology).</p></div>		</li>
