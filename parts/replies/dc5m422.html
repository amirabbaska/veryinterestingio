			<div class="markdown"><p>My Dad grew citrus for about 55 years, and I'm definitely not an expert but I did work for him for a while.  Wasn't really my thing so I bailed out.   </p>
<p>But citrus runs the gamut from very small, kumquats and calamondins, to huge like pomelos and grapefruit.   You'd have to ask a botanist where the official dividing lines are, but I think oranges and tangarines are both in the same family.   </p>
<p>Plus I think mandarin and tangerine are the same thing, just one is the Spanish name and one is the English name (from Tangier, Morroco where they were originally grown).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, Citrus is a genus, so they are all in the same family for sure... But as for different fruits, wikipedia tells that what is marketed as sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) and bitter orange (Citrus Ã— aurantium) are hybrids, between pomelo (Citrus maxima) and mandarin (Citrus reticulata), with specific species depending on how much of each parent it has... Reddish-orange mandarins can be also marketed as tangerines, although some argue that it is a separate species (Citrus tangerina) and on the US market, sometimes mandarin-grapefruit hybrids are also sold as tangerines...</p></div>		</li>
