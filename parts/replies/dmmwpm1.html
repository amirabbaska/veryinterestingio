			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, however meditation specifically changes the parts of the brain that deal with stress and anxiety and helps reduce brooding (ruminating).</p>
<p>Edit: brooding is fundamental problem for those suffering anxiety, depression and even PTSD. Meditation can be used to treat all three.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, I think the point is meditation changes the mind beneficially, whereas some of our daily life habits can change it detrimentally. Ex chronic stress amplifies the amygdala and 'Me' center responses, making us more likely to be anxious and / or narcissistic, whereas mediation can decrease that amplification and boost things like perspective, focus, compassion etc.
Cool fact: which parts of your brain you boost actually depends on what type of meditation you do, so in theory you can choose a practice based on what's lacking - which of course is ideally what we try to do as practitioners anyway.

			<div class="markdown"><p>More like on how to do it, yeah. Something that is helpful and easy to follow. Well, I guess explanation on how it works would also be awesome. </p>
<p>I just don't want to stumble across something &quot;popularized&quot; and not actually helpful by using search. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mindful meditation had a pretty big CJ on Reddit.  Sounds more healthy than coconut oil from the way people talk about it.  Probably lots of info on that.</p></div>		</li>
