			<div class="markdown"><p>So if the probabilities of where it is (aka the wave function) is split, and the wave function describes the photon, we can be a little bit accommodating and say that the photon is split. But this is quantum mechanics, so things aren't like we're used to and we can't observe both halves for example. Fair enough. </p></div>		</li>
