			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose if you are to analyze his statement logically it would be a simple implication:</p>
<p>Q -&gt; NOT S</p>
<p>Where Q is quantum and S is simple.  </p>
<p>He said nothing about what implication is true if not Q.  It could be that  NOT Q -&gt; NOT S as well.</p>
<p>In which case you can just generalize and say NOT S.  Which, to me, sounds pretty much true.  </p>
<p>It's never that simple.</p></div>		</li>
