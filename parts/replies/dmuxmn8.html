			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, basically the supply chain needed includes everything needed to produce corn and soybeans for feed, plus processing into feed and transporting feed and calves to feedlots. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, and this would have to be averaged against other feeding methods representatively as all beef cattle are not raised the same. You might want to weight a vegetable supply chain to cover what would be grown in an equivalent time for beef to mature for the table, which by guess would suggest a lot of bang for your vegetables vs. beef considering the 18 months until cattle maturity and grain feed supply chain costs. </p>
<p>I'm not arguing that beef isn't more costly, mind you. I just prefer to compare an apple with an apple. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do not know how about the corn or soybeans. Most ranchers I know do not feed their cows corn or soybean. The cows just eat grass from the pasture. These are beef cows, not dairy cows that I am referring to. During dry weather and winter, the rancher will substitute with hay. </p>
<p>I have several friends that own small herds of beef cows and their biggest expense is just transporting the cows. Whether its from purchasing the cow or to the slaughter house. And I have talked to owners of huge ranches in the Wyoming area. All grass fed. But their expenses are different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would need to compare it to certain plants and not just vegetables in general. Corn is a very nitrogen heavy plant and needs more fertilizer than other plants like legumes which put nitrogen back into the soil. But the main point is the shear volume of feed needed to convert into one pound of consumable beef. Even if you stuck with just corn and made it simple and presumed the corn grown for feed was the same as consumed by humans, you would have one pound of food grown compared to one pound of feed grown. I don't have the numbers any more about how many pounds of feed needed to produce a finished beef calf but it is a huge volume of food that could other wise be consumed directly by humans. </p></div>		</li>
