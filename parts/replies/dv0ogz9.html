			<div class="markdown"><p>The results would be different than with oil as water has different properties. It depends very much on what you are cooking and how soluble it is in water. But reactions that only need heat above 100Â°C to happen and aren't otherwise prohibited by their interaction with water would happen yes.</p></div>		</li>
