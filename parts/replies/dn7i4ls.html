<p>(Though as it happens the US Navy's railgun isn't quite powerful enough to fire shots that escape the moon's gravity.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a mixed blessing though.  The higher your gravitational potential energy, the easier it is to drop weapons on your enemies, but the harder it is to get planetary resources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not significantly.</p>
<p>The main benefit would be that you'd be above the thickest part of the atmosphere, so would need slightly less heat shield to avoid burning up - but at the speeds involved, even starting at the top of Everest wouldn't really help that much.</p>
<p>The bigger issue is that in order to get to (or rather, stay in) space, you have to go <em>sideways</em> as fast as possible - and being on top of a mountain doesn't help you much there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A railgun on a mountain could never (on its own) launch any payload into earth orbit, unless the payload has its own propulsion system. Any ballistic trajectory will either be hyperbolic, escaping earth's gravity well entirely, or be suborbital and re-enter (since you're starting in the atmosphere; any orbital trajectory will necessarily intersect the atmosphere without secondary propulsion).</p></div>		</li>
