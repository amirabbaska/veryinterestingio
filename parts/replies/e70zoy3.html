			<div class="markdown"><p>Lithium and valproic acid are the gold standards and lithium has the added benefit of protecting against suicidal ideation (valproic acid has better evidence for mixed states and rapid cycling). Lithium is recommended first-line by most published guidelines but being an old drug with a host of awful side effects, most clinicians opt for an antipsychotic with mood stabilizing properties, especially where mania +/- psychosis are the presenting symptoms. Abilify, zyprexa, risperdal, latuda, and seroquel are the ones with the most evidence but they work on more of a localized level (targeting dopamine and serotonin transmission for symptomatic treatment as opposed to working at the gene expression level). Gabapentin blocks a2d subunits on calcium channels which directly inhibits the release of glutamate into the synapse. It works well for some but hasn't been studied extensively.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you elaborate a little on this? I have been taking Lithium for 2 years now, and it has been a miracle drug for me (bipolar II). </p>
<p>A small dose (600mg Li2CO3 ER q.d.) is effective for me, luckily. My psychiatrists have told me it is fine as a long term option, but other doctors keep telling me stuff like, &quot;You know you can't be taking that forever.&quot; </p>
<p>I am happy with it today. No side-effects other than hand shakes/tremors, for which I take Propranolol ER 60mg q.d. </p>
<p>I wouldn't mind trying Depakote, but Lamictal gave me pretty severe short-term memory loss. Plus, like I said, Lithium has proven to be a miracle drug for my illness. </p>
<p>When I look up these &quot;side-effects&quot; you mention, I get huge lists and not much distinction is made between what is common long term, what is common short term, etc. And my docs never give a straight answer here.</p>
<p>This was a very long way to ask: What are the side-effects you like to look out for? Particularly in a young, fit male like me who can get by on a small dose. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Bipolar II here. Those two sentences are concerning but I'd like more detailâ€¦care to explain like I'm, say, 18? I'm actually forty-nine, so I'm trying to stay sensitive to changes in brain function. Alzheimer's got my grandfather, unfortunately, but my dad at 74 is showing no signs of it, and I'm pretty much his clone.</p>
<p>Also, I've never taken anything other than lamotrigine. Get good results. Mostly stable, no suicidal ideation, and don't have to take any other drugs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should have put an asterisk to denote that this is the case without treatment. Lamotrigine prevents excessive glutamate by blocking sodium channels (same mechanism in treating seizures) and reducing glutamate improves neuron health and allows the brain to form new connections. Sorry if I was misleading, I'll update my original post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a prescription product and is very low dose. I have no experience with this so I can't endorse it or speak to anecdotal use. We use lithium carbonate or lithium citrate in clinical practice, both of which require chronic monitoring by a doctor and are known to life-threatening when misused.</p></div>		</li>
