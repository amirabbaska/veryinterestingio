			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't the Internet itself that drove banks to up their game with Check scanning &amp;  whatnot. Know what was the biggest drive? 9/11. When all the planes got grounded so did all the checks that were being transported across the country to be processed at their issuing institutions causing a delay at every bank in the country for receiving funds for checks deposited. The Check 21 act was put into place as a result of that. </p>
<p>Before that check kiting was still pretty common. </p>
<p>Check Kiting, by the by, is where you deposit a check from your account at Bank 1 into your account at Bank 2 to cover a check you wrote from Bank 2. And yes, writing &amp; issuing a check when you don't have the money in your account is a Crime (think about that next time you tell someone not to cash the check you wrote until payday!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A check (or cheque in places not America) is a slip of paper that can represent any written amount of money, so long as the issuer has the funds. So if I write a check to you I say &quot;pay /u/Operader $100 for Bills&quot; then I sign it. There's fields like amount, recipient, and reason. The check also contains preprinted info that your bank uses to ask my bank for the money.</p>
<p>(I realize you may have been joking that checks are so old nobody should realistically know what they are, but left this here anyway)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. Caveat, it may be bank policy (and often is) not to accept it before the date listed, however if the teller or processing software doesn't catch it, then it will likely clear. Post dating a check could be considered check fraud, especially if you don't have the funds at the time you issue the check. Emphasis COULD... it's the kind of thing that won't get you arrested, but would be tacked on if you're already facing related charges. Probably...</p></div>		</li>
