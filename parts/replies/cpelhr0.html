<p>I'll just talk about John Machin (1686-1751) though. He was a professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London, and he is well known for developing a quickly converging series for Pi in 1706, with which he used to compute Pi for up to 100 decimal places. The formula is <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/1/5/f15dc3d39c473c4bd718e3a98145da0d.png" target="_blank">here</a> and it remained the main way to calculate values of Pi for centuries (including in the infamous attempt by William Shanks, who spent many years calculating π to 707 places, which he finally accomplished in 1873, though in 1944 it was shown he was only correct up to 527 places)</p>
<p>Edit: Also the famous Indian Mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) found several rapidly converging infinite series of π, which can compute 8 decimal places of π with each term in the series, in 1910. This has become the basis for the fastest algorithms currently used by Yasumasa Kanada (1,241,100,000,000 decimal places) and the Chudnovsky brothers (4,044,000,000 decimal places) to compute π. </p>
<p>It was the Chudnovsky algorithm, based on Ramanujan's formulas, that calculated 12.1 trillion digits in December 2013, though that record has now been beaten/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends what you mean by modern, there was either [Isaac Newton]( <a href="http://egyptonline.tripod.com/newton.htm" target="_blank">http://egyptonline.tripod.com/newton.htm</a>) who reached 15 digits of pi, his approximation is used in computers today. See the first computer being to calculate Pi was in 1949, when John von Neumann and chums used [ENIAC]( <a href="https://wordery.com/electronic-numerical-integrator-and-computer-eniac-eniac-operating-manual-arthur-w-burks-9781937684679?utm_source=linkshare&utm_campaign=Affiliate&utm_content=10&utm_affiliate=je6NUbpObpQ" target="_blank">https://wordery.com/electronic-numerical-integrator-and-computer-eniac-eniac-operating-manual-arthur-w-burks-9781937684679?utm_source=linkshare&utm_campaign=Affiliate&utm_content=10&utm_affiliate=je6NUbpObpQ</a>) to compute 2,037 digits of Pi.</p>
<p>Today the record stands at 13,300,000,000,000 decimal places.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks a lot for this very detailed overview of the Ancients' treatments of pi. I have prepared a short historical write-up. Rather than going through a chronology of the computation (check out /u/TheFacistEye's wiki link or these <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Pi_chronology.html" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Pi_through_the_ages.html" target="_blank">pages</a>), I will just loosely follow the thread of the history of pi to discuss some interesting mathematical innovations that were made in the quest to understand pi. (Merely keeping track of increasing numbers of digits is quite far from what mathematicians care about.)</p>
<p>The most obvious method (approximating by polygons) already appears in Archimedes' <em>Measurement of the circle</em>, where he gave the lower bound 3.1408 and the upper bound 22/7=3.1428. Thus, although pi did not have its name yet, it could be said that pi day was already 3/14 in the 2nd century BCE. In Measurement, Archimedes uses Eudoxus' method of exhaustion to prove the lovely observation that the area of a circle of radius r and perimeter p is the same as that of a right angled triangle with short sides r and p.</p>
<p>It would take centuries to move past polygonal approximations, when the Indian mathematician Madhava developed his <a href="http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005af4_54.pdf" target="_blank">series approximations</a> for trigonometric functions in the 14th century. This was 200 years ahead of the Western giants Newton, Leibniz, Taylor, and Euler.</p>
<p>Before Taylor series (and later faster-convergent series) took over as the preferred method of approximation, François Viete put a new twist on the polygonal approximation idea, by expressing it as the first infinite product in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi%C3%A8te%27s_formula" target="_blank">his famous formula</a>. Wallis would follow suit a few decades later with his own formula.</p>
<p>Pi day could be said to have gotten its name in 1706, when William Jones introduced the Greek letter to denote the constant. The notation became widespread after Euler in his &quot;best-seller&quot; analysis textbook Introductio in analysin infinitorum.</p>
<p>In 1761, Johann Lambert confirmed that all the calculators through the ages had in a sense been approximating in vain, when he showed that pi is irrational. A century later, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindemann%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem" target="_blank">Lindemann's 1882 result</a> that pi is transcendental answered once and for all the age-old question of the (im)possibility of squaring the circle. Lindemann's result is not a trivial one, even using modern machinery. We still understand transcendality <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schanuel%27s_conjecture" target="_blank">quite poorly</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very few. If any. How many people would even know much about Pi at the time to care?</p>
<p>The Gregorian Calendar was only introduced in 1582, and it took many years for it to properly catch on (only in 1752 in Britain and the British Empire)</p>
<p>I'm also not sure how they would write dates at the time, as this is going out of my range of knowledge. As remember, even today (including where I live, as I'm English) today is 14-3, not 3-14</p>
<p>(Also it didn't have the symbol Pi then)</p></div>		</li>
