I remember Reddit getting very excited around 3/4 years ago when some scientists in Antarctica found the 'true smoking gun', which concluded that CMB was definitely from the big bang.. only to retract their conclusions a month later.</p>
<p>Has there been some development I missed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The CMB originated after the BB, approximately 380,000 years later, before the formation of stars. The physical basis for this is well established and confirmed by observation and experiment. Its existence is a direct result of the BB and consistent with an expanding and cooling early universe.  It was hypothesized decades before its discovery. </p>
<p>The observations you are referring to have to do with the polarization of this radiation. It is believed that this polarization is sensitive to very early fluctuations possibly due to quantum effects and this is what was attempting to be quantified and measured. Unfortunately, it was discovered that much of the polarization is due to local effects within our own galaxy. The origin and existence of the CMB was not in question. I do not know what the current status of the science regarding this polarization is but it is very critical to understanding the early universe and may provide important clues. </p></div>		</li>
