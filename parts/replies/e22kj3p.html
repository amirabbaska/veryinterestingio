<p>Which defeats the purpose of insurance. The idea of insurance is that for the majority of patients, you pay more than what the insurance provides. This spreads the cost of major issues for individuals through the population. If the only people getting insurance are the ones who have major issues, it's not much better than just not having insurance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a big part of the argument for single payer healthcare. </p>
<p>Insurance is a for-profit business and profit has to come from someone, either healthy people who are <em>wasting money</em> or sick people who are being <em>overcharged</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insurance pools resources from large numbers of people to inexpensively subsidize the costs of an expensive few. Because medical treatment is a virtual certainty at some point in your life, it can also be seen as an offset payment or investment.</p>
<p>For-profit healthcare adds overhead (profit/administrative costs make it more expensive), and for-profit healthcare perverts the purpose of medicine by maximizing highly concentrated wealth rather than the health of the community.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that simple.  The costs aren't the same.  The profit-nature of a business brings down costs.  It works like this in any public/private comparison.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually not correct at all. Vision insurance companies still prefer you actually use their insurance because the insurance company is making your lenses and making even more money off you. The $500 retail glasses that you got for $200 because of insurance, the docs office probably only keeps $70 while the insurance company takes $130 because their lab is making the lenses which probably only cost $30 to make. They profit from your monthly payments and they profit when you buy glasses. It's probably only 1/30 that they actually take a hit on providing you glasses.</p>
<p>Contracts are a little different story but generally they're still paying out much less than what you (and your employer) are putting in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you posted is how it works today, that is not what the person you replied to was saying. Hes talking about the original purpose for the existence of insurance, which is essentially to mitigate worst case scenarios by paying a slightly higher than average premium. This means that over a person's life, something like 90&#37; of people will pay more insurance than they benefit, but 10&#37; of people pay insurance vastly less than what they benefited from. </p></div>		</li>
