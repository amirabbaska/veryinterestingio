<p>? Algorithms are way, way faster than human heuristics. The tradeoff is the second part, that they are specific in scope. They're &quot;dumb&quot;, in the sense they cannot handle tasks that depart in the most minute ways from assumed parameters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, coming up with an algorithm (a solution that works every time, and encompasses all reasonable use cases) is much harder than coming up with a heuristic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But an algorithm that works in <em>most</em> cases is much easier to come up with than an equally good heuristic. That's why computers use algorithms, it's easy to come up with algorithms that cover most usage cases, and then we try to restrict the task to what our algorithms can handle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're comparing human heuristics to computer algorithms. I'm referring to human heuristics compared to human following an algorithm. The heuristic is faster, and more generalized, but not always correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's not proper because humans don't &quot;natively run&quot; algorithms. Humans <em>emulate</em> algorithms on heuristic equipment.</p>
<p>So it can't be said that algorithms are slower <em>per se</em>, that's just a constraint of our equipment. Humans executing algorithms is similar to a computer constrained to perform long division, but instead of using its CPU, having to use a neural network.</p></div>		</li>
