			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify: a President cannot issue an executive order that violates enacted law? For example, since the ACA is in place, Trump cannot just reppeal it with an executive order. But since there is no law against building a Mexican border, Trump can issue an exec order to divert border patrol funding to construction of a wall? </p></div>		</li>
