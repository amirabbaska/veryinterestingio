			<div class="markdown"><p>The majority of cat allergies are to Fel d 1 or Fel d 1-like proteins. It looks like big cats also express a conserved protein, so the answer is probably yes. Yes you would be allergic to big cats too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to wikipedia,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term &quot;prawn&quot;[2] is used particularly in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Commonwealth nations, for large swimming crustaceans or shrimp, especially those with commercial significance in the fishing industry. Shrimp that fall in this category often belong to the suborder Dendrobranchiata. In North America, the term is used less frequently, typically for freshwater shrimp. The terms shrimp and prawn themselves lack scientific standing. Over the years, the way shrimp and prawn are used has changed, and nowadays the terms are almost interchangeable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So sounds like while they can be used to refer to different things, they can also be used to refer to the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also relevant is that with IgE blood testing, cross reactions in related things are common causes of false positives, so someone allergic to say peanuts, will often show a false allergy to soy or other legumes.  I believe that one is around half of all peanut allergy sufferers will show up as allergic to another legume in blood testing.  Despite that, something like 95% of them can tolerate eating soy and the other legumes.</p></div>		</li>
