			<div class="markdown"><p>This is more for a consumer than a producer. I don't know shit about wine but people use these with scotch. Leaving bottles half filled with air is bad because it oxidizes the whiskey. Imagine you have a very expensive rare bottle and drank half of it. You can't just fill it back up because it's an expensive rare bottle. Instead they fill it with these glass marbles so that the whiskey reached the top of the bottle and minimizes the air in the container. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figured they meant after you open the bottle and drink some of it. You can use these to push the water level of the wine back up to the top. So, when you re-cork it, there's less air. </p>
<p>As opposed to wine makers only filling the bottle partially to begin with. </p></div>		</li>
