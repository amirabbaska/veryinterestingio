			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something I hear about a lot when I help people move to a new house and there are stairs involved. The question is usually along the lines of &quot;How can you carry so much up the stairs, and I so little?&quot;. (I'll leave the implications if this line of questions aside here...)</p>
<p>Consider this: you weigh 70kg, I weigh 120 and we are supposed to lift 30kg up the stairs. You lift 50% extra weight up the stairs, I lift 25% extra. Yes, I carry 50kg more up the stairs than you do, I always do that, but that also mean that any added weight adds less for me compared to my normal.</p>
<p>So far about capacity in kg, but in the moving scenario there is also the question of staying power. I lift 50kg more than you each time I go up the stairs, so it better be worth it! I can't do as many round trips as you can, so if 1 lamp needs to be hoisted, you go. Simply put: I can't go as many times as you can, so I better make each trip count. I normally lift more than you, because taking 1 extra round trip costs more to me. So in my every day life I lift heavier than you do and thus get more training with heavier weights.  </p>
<p>Edit: Oh great, now my most upvoted comment is about me being fat...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>lol i didnt even disagree; i guess i should've framed it into a question. my point was to hear what he kumi had to say about my thoughts because i was interested, not solely to be contentious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe when you're doing body weight workouts, but 50 pounds is 50 pounds and the guy with more muscle will be able to lift it easier  </p>
<p>Edit: to explain it better you could even think of it in marginal effort %, for the bigger guy vs the smaller guy, lifting x pounds will always be marginally less additional weight/effort for the bigger guy </p></div>		</li>
