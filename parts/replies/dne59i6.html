			<div class="markdown"><p>Brian Greene wrote a wonderful book titled The Elegant Universe. He explains string theory and physics in incredibly beautiful detail, but in a way that most people would understand. That book motivated me to study physics because he was obviously so passionate about the subject. Highly suggest the read. </p></div>		</li>
