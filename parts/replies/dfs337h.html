			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are the only one who got it right! Its absurd to think Jamaicans are &quot;faster&quot; than a  Martiniquan. The difference between Martinique and Jamaica is size and competition! Jamaica puts more emphasis on track and field than Martinique so naturally more sprinters will come from Jamaica than Martinique! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense! I mean, isn't it like saying 'All the best gridiron football players come from America! How can that be explained?'</p>
<p>Well, it's super popular and people play it here more than other countries. I'm sure there's some 'genetically perfect' football players born all over the world, but they just never had the chance to play. Maybe they got good at some other sport instead. </p>
<p>Or look at Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson.  He was a basketball player before becoming a strongman, so people can adapt, and there's a really strong community for strength training in Iceland so a lot of encouragement</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well id relate that more to &quot;how come so many football players come from the southern states?&quot; Northern states play football too, but comparing say Connecticut high school football to Texas is a huge difference.</p>
<p>Other Caribbean nations produce runners, but its bigger in Jamaica. </p></div>		</li>
