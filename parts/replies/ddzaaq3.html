Before Windows 95, you would literally &quot;exit Windows&quot; and then just flip the switch off when it's at the DOS prompt.  Vista/Server 2008 will refuse to install if you don't have ACPI, so this should be the complete list from 95 through XP/Server 2003!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Back in the 90s you would often see a message like &quot;it is now safe to turn off your computer&quot; as the computer didn't actually have the ability to power off. It was usually a physical switch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's such a little improvement, but daaaaamn what a difference it makes not having to wait for the message to hit the switch...</p>
<p>I must be lazy, but when that roll around, I was happyyyyyyyyyyy!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I forgot about the message until this thread, but now I'm remembering the first time I used a computer that didn't show it. I was utterly confused about whether or not I could safely flip the switch.</p>
<p>Kinda funny to look back on now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We set the boot process on ours to run a simple batch file that printed, &quot;Do you know how to stop a batch file?&quot; over and over again in an infinite loop. </p>
<p>I figured the lab instructor would know more about computers than I did. So, I never expected this would leave the entire lab inoperable for so long that the school conducted a formal investigation into what had happened to the computers. </p>
<p>They hired a consultant. He removed the batch file from the computers. The school never found out it was me. </p>
<p>... honestly, if I had known the entire faculty was so uninformed I never would have done it. Totally expected this to be a seven second prank. </p></div>		</li>
