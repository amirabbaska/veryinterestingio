			<div class="markdown"><p>We know the density of various planets.  Mercury is the most dense, but it will never be economically viable to bring stuff back from another gravity well.  It may be possible to bring back material from asteroids.  16 Psyche is nearly solid metal with a likely high percentage of platinum and related metals.  we are sending a mission there in the future  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_Psyche" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_Psyche</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard somewhere that objects such as the moon have so little gravity that a space elevator could be constructed out of currently existing materials such as kevlar, couldn't that make it economically viable to bring stuff back from other gravity wells?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Space elevators require the body to have a fast rotation and the moon is tidally locked to the Earth.  The moon doesn't have an atmosphere so a railgun type launch system might work.  The moon is also pretty light (few metals) and low water.  There's not much of value there.</p></div>		</li>
