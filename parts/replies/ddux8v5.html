<p>Question. I live in Chile and here the mobile internet enterprises usually offer data plans with &quot;free social media traffic&quot; meaning that using facebook, whatsapp, twitter wont count towards your data usage  in regards to the maximum data your plan has. This model is also true in Colombia. Even if the companies aro not blacking your traffic, are thoy fullfilling the net neutrality?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The way they aren't breaking net neutrality is that (supposedly) any company that wants to be a part of the deal can be without paying anything to T-Mobile.  In that way, T-Mobile is able to say &quot;we're still neutral&quot; since they aren't receiving any benefit (other than good press and potentially more customers) direct from the companies in the promotion.  This is a grey and dangerous area though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a good example of how much they could do. If they can make social media sites not count towards your data, you can be damn sure they can also block it or make it restricted to &quot;this many data&quot; per month or whatever else shenanigans they think of to make more money or fuck the competition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A long time ago, back when the smartest phone was a BlackBerry, in the UK, BBM (BlackBerry Messenger) was usually free through most mobile networks, which at the time was a useful thing. But in more modern times, this idea just throttles competition. A lot of ISPs would rather take payments from big companies to get their sites in the &quot;fast lane&quot;, rather than be motivated by political reasons</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worse, Time Warner (or Comcast) could, for example, throttle bandwidth on the basis of political content. For instance, you could have a Democratic Party primary pitting a corporatist flunkie against a socialist reformer... and for some reason the Internet loads super slow any time you're trying to load the reformer's videos. Well, they can do that now, but under a Net Neutrality regime, it would be illegal.</p>
<p>Though I prefer a more radical solution to this problem: the separation of content and infrastructure. (The parallel to the phrase &quot;separation of church and state&quot; deliberate; the concepts are actually very similar.) Time Warner simply shouldn't be permitted to own both the content provider and the delivery platform. It creates a conflict of interest that is in opposition to the public good. Companies should have to choose whether they're in the production business or the delivery business.</p>
<p>I also think municipalities should be allowed to be in the &quot;last mile&quot; business. I don't think they should be legally allowed to exclude other companies by legal fiat (as the currently do in favor of the cable companies), but I do think they should be allowed to buy, sell, and lease infrastructure with the same rights as any corporation.</p></div>		</li>
