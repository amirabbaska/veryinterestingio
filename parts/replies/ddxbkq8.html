			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! When I flaired this up, I wasn't sure whether to put it down as biology or chemistry at first but it seems I made the right choice. My initial thoughts and assumptions were that it might be down to a more straightforward reaction between a compound in the fruits and the medication itself, but this makes a lot more sense. Do you know exactly which compounds are responsible for this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question sits in the in-between field of biochemistry! A biologist would probably have been more familiar with it though as I think it's taught in most college/university introductory biology classes anyhow.<br />
As posted below, furanocoumarins interact with the cytochrome p450 (CYP) family enzymes. I'm not terribly familiar with chemical interactions of drugs, but I'd imagine most of them don't react with each other directly, but their metabolism, or biological pathways interact with each other and produce deleterious effects. Often drugs share biological processes they either rely on (like metabolism by liver enzymes), or affect processes in the body (like blood clotting).  When two drugs have adverse reactions, usually it's an unintentional or unexpected intersection of these processes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know for sure chemistry would not go into this and I'm pretty sure biology wouldn't either. I was a chemistry major and the intro to bio classes I took only went into cellular structure and function. The combo field of biochemistry is the only one I believe would be familiar with CYP450 interactions.</p>
<p>You're correct though in that most drug interactions are due to inhibition or induction of CYP450s by one drug which affects the metabolism and thus the overall effect of the other. If not, the interaction typically involves similar or conflicting mechanisms of action</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct about drugs generally not interacting much with each other directly.</p>
<p>Only a modest number are strong inhibitors or inducers of the p450 enzymes.  A much larger number are substrates, meaning their elimination is dependent on those same enzymes.  You don't usually care about those though as long as you avoid the strong inducers / inhibitors.</p>
<p>So most docs will carry around in their head a list of some of the <a href="http://www.ebmconsult.com/articles/medications-inhibitors-cyp3a4-enzyme" target="_blank">worst offenders</a>.</p>
<p>This is the 3A4 inhibitor list.  3A4 is the most common p450 pathway for drugs, but its not the only one.  You will note grapefruit juice on this list!</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are apps to do this for you for the drugs.  Epocrates is the most popular, but there are websites without logins I believe</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually learned about this effect in a class that was in the field of chemical biology which is different from biochemistry. Chemical biology is the chemical study of biological compounds while biochemistry tends to work with proteins and how they they interact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mark it down as pharmacology. Most of the other answers pretty much nailed it so I'm not going into it. </p>
<p>Enzyme induction and inhibition actually comprise a large base of what we know as drug drug interactions. That's why medicine can tricky. I.e. Patient A comes in and has a history of disease X and is taking medication Y for it. Say they develop an infection and you want to give them a specific antibiotic that's metabolized by a cyp450 isoenzyme (there's seriously a shit ton, but the big one is CYP3A4) that medication Y either inhibitors (thus raising blood levels of the antibiotic) or inducers (causing the antibiotic to be in the subtherapeutic range). So you'll have to adjust the dosing accordingly.</p>
<p>This is just one scenario, but there's way more. </p>
<p>Medicine is crazy complex. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The furanocoumarins in grapefruit juice inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme, which breaks down things like warfarin <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9351897" target="_blank">(source)</a>.  However, you need a lot of constant grapefruit juice levels before this becomes significant ( in class--pharmacy student here--we were told a quart a day is needed to change enzyme activity significantly).   If the person has been taking grapefruit juice regularly, sometimes you can just tell them to keep their intake steady and just find the dose that works with that enzyme activity level.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct.</p>
<p>I’ve been taking Warfarin for more than 5 years. There are very little restrictions to your diet. You can eat grapefruit and oranges as well as grapefruit and orange juice, you can eat spinach and greens in a normal amount. What you have to watch is the regularity of these things. As you start on Warfarin and maintain your normal diet, the technician in your doctor’s office will test your blood thickness via an INR test. The technician or doctor will determine the proper dosage to get the INR reading in the “range” they are looking for, usually a reading of 2.2.</p>
<p>You get an INR test daily or weekly at first, and as you modulate your dosage and hit the range desired, the test becomes less frequent; one every two weeks or once a month. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Seriously?  You've been misinformed!</p>
<p>It does not take much grapefruit, in fact it consuming more than a serving has no additional effect because one serving will completely, irreversibly inactivate all CYP3A4 present.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzyme is irreversible and lasts a significant period of time. It takes around 24 hours to regain 50% of the enzyme activity and it can take 72 hours for the enzyme to completely return to activity. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So just calc'ing that out, if you did a grapefruit every morning dropping CYP3A4 activity to zero, ~25% restored @ 12 hrs and 50% at 24 hrs only to be dropped back to zero, total average activity over 24 hrs is reduced by 75%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need a lot of grapefruit juice for the effect on hepatic CYP3A4 to be significant, but much less for intestinal CYP3A4, which is the main interaction (increased bioavailability).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One small point of clarification. The enzyme that grapefruit juice acts on is located in the small intestine, not the liver. </p>
<p>Well, the enzyme is in both places, but the juice only effects the enzyme that is in the gut. </p>
<p>&quot;Concomitant intake of grapefruit juice increases the plasma concentrations of many drugs in vivo, which is largely attributed to its well-documented inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4.&quot;</p>
<p>Also worth knowing: statins are effected by grapefruit juice too.</p>
<p>&quot;This interaction can occur even if grapefruit is eaten many hours before taking the medication. For example, simvastatin, when taken with about a 7-ounce glass of grapefruit juice once a day for three days, produced a 330% greater concentration of the drug compared to taking it with water. This can cause life-threatening muscle damage called rhabdomyolysis.&quot; </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, grapefruit juice also contains components that inhibit p-glyco protein, an important efflux pump in the intestines. Intestines absorb bad things, bad things get pumped back out by p-gp. So if a drug that is normally effluxed by pgp isn't, you get much higher concentrations of the drug from this, as well as from CYP inhibition.</p></div>		</li>
