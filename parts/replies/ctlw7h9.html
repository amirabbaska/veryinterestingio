			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for actually mentioning gender. The other popular comment makes it seem like women just don't want to name daughters after themselves but the reasons are much more related to the social and public sphere than individual choice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I think it's also a function of how names have been used in the past. There's a whole world of formal styles of address that nobody under 50 really cares about anymore. And &quot;junior&quot; is a part of that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A professor at my school has like four kids all named after himself. Same first and last name. And they are all called by the same name, they don't go by their middle names. It's absurd.</p>
<p>Edit: he teaches engineering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mother often tells the story of a man she knew (or heard of) that found out only when he had to sign up for military service that the name he thought he was his actually wasn't. And that he shared his real name with all of his brothers.</p>
<p>Apparently, the parents would choose a first name, but then once the kid was born the dad would proceed to get thoroughly hammered, alongside the bloke in charge of registering the birth... Hence his naming all of his kids the same.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I guess it makes remembering your kids' names easier. Not like my family where my mom would get as far as the dog's name without saying mine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(That's sister's name, brother's name, dog's name, then whatever get over here)</p>
<p>She also mixes up my birthday with the day her credit card bill is due. I'm 3/26. Her bill is due 3/20. She even checked me into the hospital for surgery with the wrong birthdate and we had to go back and change everything. </p></div>		</li>
