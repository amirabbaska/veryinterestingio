			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic idea behind the sniffing the wipes and smelling salts seems to be that a very powerful caustic smell like rubbing alcohol or ammonia causes an immediate reaction. You smell something dangerous and your nervous system panics and makes sure your alert so you can get away from it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Were you nauseated? An old trick to treat nausea so I have heard but haven't seen work is to take a quick sniff of an isopropyl alcohol wipe. If someone is about to faint, i'd be more concerned with establishing IV access and figuring out why you're about to faint, instead of preventing the fainting itself. Also faint is a weird word when you say it over and over again. </p>

<p>some studies have been done on it as well, i recommended it to a patient one time and he tried it and was like nah, i don't think that helped. cue zofran. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact. Veterinary clinics often use this technique to stop a cat from purring during examination. Can't listen to a heart if there's a jackhammer drilling away next to ya.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sniffing an alcohol wipe is an effective nausea treatment, about as effective as the medication Zofran. Won't do anything for syncope though.</p></div>		</li>
