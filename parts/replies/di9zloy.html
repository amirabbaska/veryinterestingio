			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of... Capacitors can be charged and discharged quickly, but they also don't have a very high capacity. If someone told you 'batteries' when they were talking about capacitors then yes, that's true. Supercapacitors are a special type of capacitor that has a very high capacity, so they offer the best of both worlds, but the capacity is still not high enough to be used in something like a mobile phone, which would make your statement true. It's not a problem that they can discharge rapidly, as much as a problem that they don't have much total capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I can tell from my limited experience playing with some Super Caps, shorting them doesn't cause them to go into thermal runaway like lithium cells, they are designed to be discharged extremely quickly.<br />
However; the sheer amount of current means you end up heating the conductor up, resulting in a fire hazard. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regular capacitors don't get damaged from shorting them either (beyond the usual wear from use). That doesn't mean they're the right tool for the job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not unless you mean a 2/98 setup, with equal volume for each and an associated 49% drop in battery capacity. But yes, the 2% could charge nearly instantly.</p>
<p>Supercaps provide 5-10 Watt-hours per liter. Lithium ion batteries provide 250-500 Wh/l. They're less dense than batteries, so far a few percent better in Wh/kg, but not much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could be interesting, you'd probably need to manage the flow so the battery would effectively charge from the cap, but with better energy density.  That's still the limitation with the capacitors by the way, the energy density isn't high enough yet to be convenient.  </p>
<p>Certainly no insurmountable conceptual difficulties with your idea though :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No- batteries charge and discharge faster when they are warm, up to ~40 Celcius.  They <em>need</em> to be warm so the chemical reaction can proceed.</p>
<p>Cold batteries experience slower self-discharge as a result of slower reactions, and are more efficient.  However they can't be charged or discharged quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note, though, that they can't be allowed to get a lot hotter than 40C. A phone has a maximum charge rate which depends on at what power level the battery internals exceed the maximum temperature and on what temperature people tolerate in their palms and pockets.</p>
<p>Ideally, you would heat the batteries up to 40C when you start charging (or let them self-heat). But after that, you would need to actively cool the batteries. Some electric cars use active cooling for this: <a href="http://insideevs.com/tesla-or-gm-who-has-the-best-battery-thermal-management-bower/" target="_blank">http://insideevs.com/tesla-or-gm-who-has-the-best-battery-thermal-management-bower/</a>. It's one thing to talk about a 36 watt quick charger heating up your phone, and another for a 150 kW powering an EV!</p>
<p>Now that high-power USB C is a thing and crazy charge times are apparently important to people, I think we will see phone manufacturers building aluminum docks with fans and heat sinks that provide a good thermal interface with the phone to enable still faster charging. Or running heat pipes from the battery to the CPU fan in laptops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It won't charge faster just from being cooled, but if you do fast charge it a little bit of cooling (like a fan, not a freezer) may dissipate some of the heat that would shorten the battery's life span.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When wirelessly printing large files, sometimes they print quickly and sometimes they take forever. What's the deal? Is it down to the network or is there something with the printer going on?</p></div>		</li>
