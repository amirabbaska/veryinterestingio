			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, but the rate of change of the speed, ie acceleration, depends on the track's steepness and not on the height of different points on the track. When considering the total travel time, you need to consider the rate of change of speed as well as the speed itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So essentially the point of a Brachistochrone curve is to minimize the length of the trajectory that's horizontal?</p>
<p>But why does the Brachistochrone curve curve upwards at the end? Ignoring friction, I would think that that would cause parallel force to start working against the motion of the ball instead of towards it, and cause it decelerate near the end, whereas I can't envision that happening on a horizontal path (since there's no parallel force to work in either direction), so it would keep its velocity higher for longer. I assume something is wrong with my interpretation, but what is it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point of the Brachistochrone curve is to minimise travel time. To do so multiple factors like the length of the track, the steepness of the track, how much of it goes down/up, how gently/suddenly the steepness changes... have to be considered and balanced. It is not to simply minimise the length of the horizontal trajectory.</p>
<p>The same line of thought is what your interpretation missed. Indeed the upward curved part in the end causes deceleration, but since the track has been going downwards for so long and quite steeply already, it has gained a higher velocity than it would have on, say a straight track. This extra speed, and thus the extra bit of motion it allows, over-compensates for the deceleration in the end, resulting in a shorter time overall.</p>
<p>Again it's all in the balancing act.</p></div>		</li>
