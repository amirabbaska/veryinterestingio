			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to guess which star is largest based on brightness, we already know which one is most likely visibly largest. R Doradus, followed by Betelgeuse. There are pictures of these stars with a visible disk, but very low resolution.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="http://en.es-static.us/upl/2009/06/altair_flattened_surface_details_Monnier-300x234.png" target="_blank">There's a nice picture of Altair, check it out.</a></p>
<p>It's a rapidly rotating star so it looks squashed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would we be able to see anything useful with that resolution?</p>
<p>My gut feeling is that 36 pixels across isn't enough to see worthwhile detail, but maybe I'm wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>36 pixels is enough to see differences in brightness on the surface.</p>
<p>On a star, a difference in brightness often means a sunspot (starspot?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The event horizon telescope, while not relevant for observing stars, <a href="http://www.eventhorizontelescope.org/technology/building_a_larger_array.html" target="_blank">will have higher resolution</a>, though not by as large a factor as I thought. At 353 GHz it may reach a resolution of 15 µas, or 6 times better than the VLT's aaray interferometer. Its goal is to observe the Milky Way's central black hole's event horizon, which has a diameter of 20 µas.</p>
<p>I would have never thought that the VLT's resolution is so close to that needed to image a black hole. Shouldn't one be able to see the shape of the accretion disk at that resolution?</p></div>		</li>
