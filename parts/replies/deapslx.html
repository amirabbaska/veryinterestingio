<p>I been watching some videos on black holes, and like you said, the Black holes are a result of a Star with (iron?) super dense center, and when the star's balance is thrown off, ie the Iron center is too big or the radiation on the outside is not enough, than the Black Hole is formed.</p>
<p>When I heard this, I thought instantly, well doesn't that mean that the Black hole is just a giant super dense rock, that due to its density, and iron substance it creates a MASSIVE magnetic &amp; Gravitational Pull, which is so strong it even pulls in light particals.  Thanks to our vision being in the form of light, than thats what causes us to see funny things around the star, almost like see the past light years away, its not that the past is actually still happening its only the limitations of our vision at play.</p>
<p>So really all black holes really are, are just massive magnetic super dense high gravity lumps of rock?  well atleast in theory.</p>
<p>Also that being the case, if we had the energy, atleast enough for a short burst, couldn't you use Black stars gravitational pull to propell you forward.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The thing with iron is that a star starts as just a big clump of coalesced hydrogen that becomes spherical under it's own gravity, and eventually due to the immense gravity starts undergoing the fusion of hydrogen into heavier elements. Fusion of hydrogen creates a lot of energy which pushes back out against the immense gravity. This keeps the star in an equal state of inward (gravity) and outward (fusion energy) pressure and it just stays that way for a long time. Eventually the hydrogen will dwindle and heavier elements helium, lithium etc. will themselves fuse into even heavier elements. This still produces energy but it's less than the energy from hydrogen. As the elements get heavier, the lower the energy release is. Until you get to iron. Then it actually costs energy to fuse. This disrupts the balance and the star dies in collapse as the gravity wins out. The star gets very squashed very quickly which generally gives one type of supernova and leaves a big leftover piece of something behind, as you described. </p>
<p>But it's not really iron that's left behind. It's something stupidly dense and is generally referred to as degenerate matter. There's actually a few levels of what this might be and it depends on the mass of what is left over after the supernova. If the star is small the collapse will halt at what is called a white dwarf. The electrons, protons, and neutrons are all still there in the atoms but they've become really squashed together. This is like taking the sun and squashing it down into something the size of the Earth. If the star is a little bigger it won't stop at this stage and the gravity will cause the electrons to combine with the protons via electron capture and leave behind an extremely dense bunch of (mostly) just neutrons. This is vastly more dense than the white dwarf and called a neutron star. It's like taking the sun and squashing it down into something the size of a city. Nothing very massive could escape the neutron star's surface, but light/x-rays and other subatomic particles like neutrinos can.</p>
<p>There's another stage beyond the neutron star, one for which we don't really have a working model of. The neutron matter gets squashed further by gravity if the star was very large. How squashed is the question. We don't know that. There's a few parts of the current theory of gravity that just go to infinite past a certain point (which is the boundary of the black hole, the event horizon, delineated by the Shwarzchild radius). So it's a very dense &quot;lump&quot; of something, probably, but we don't have the framework to describe it and calculate it. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>If you are not at or inside the event horizon, the black hole is just basically like any other massive object. You can orbit around it provided you are outside the inner stable circular orbit. You could probably slingshot from it.</p>
<p>If you're at or inside the horizon, you cannot move anywhere but towards the thing in the center no matter how much energy you waste. The only available directions go towards it. That probably doesn't make sense but that's the real reason light (and therefore nothing else) can escape: &quot;out&quot; is no longer a thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm can there be a point when the atoms inside a black hole are squashed together so tightly it reaches a point of maximum density?
As in more matter sucked into it would result in the hole growing in size? Could it reach a size it becomes unstable?</p></div>		</li>
