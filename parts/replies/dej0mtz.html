<p>They have this idea that getting out means you can do whatever you want, whenever you want. Civilian jobs can't control your life.</p>
<p>Woops. They are the same thing. I've worked places where I've had more personal freedom in the army. </p>
<p>Think you're just gonna not show up on time? Goodbye. Not gonna wear some version of a uniform? Goodbye. Not gonna spend MORE time maintaining a groomed beard than simply shaving? Goodbye.</p>
<p>No cell phones out at work hahaha</p>
<p>Gonna just go on a trip and not tell anyone? Not so fast bro. Do you have the vacation time? Good now doodle on the calendar. Oh those dates are no good. You don't have the seniority to take off thanksgiving. Gonna just not show up? Goodbye.</p>
<p>I've seen many prior guys rebel against any semblance of structure because it's not the &quot;real&quot; structure. It's not AAAAAARMY structure.</p>
<p>I've never seen anyone end up homeless because of this... But I have seen a lot of vets fired for being jackasses.</p>
<p>We hire vets because they have discipline... But so often it turns out they are in a phase where they want to reject discipline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Marine arty vet here. My biggest adjustment to civilian life is that people often don't want to do something just because a superior tells them to. I just can't wrap my head around it sometime. And I can't just go off on civilians for slacking off like in the Marines or I'm out of a job!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I won't do something I don't agree with if a higher up tells me to. We are allowed to question our &quot;superiors&quot; decision in the civilian world and we don't have to do everything they say on blind faith in them.</p>
<p>This is the main reason I wouldn't go into the military. I wouldn't do well with another adult yelling at me to do something. I also like to ask questions which don't seem to go over to well in the military.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason is that if you are in combat, and you are told to do something, you need to do it becausr stopping to ask questions can get yourself and others killed. Im not talking about illegal orders, but stuff that is difficult that people just dont like doing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You don't have to obey unlawful orders of your superior in the military, correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, what you describe is exactly what I experienced. I threw myself into the military life/ethos pretty dramatically.  This resulted in a ridiculously difficult transition to civilian life when I got out. One second I was an American badass on a whole team of American badasses that I loved and respected, the next I was a random civilian with a DD214 that meant nothing to anyone.  I had no connections in the outside world, and a list of qualifications that were suddenly useless.  Everyone wanted employees with college educations and job experience.  I couldn't get a job for months after I got out. Cue the depression and anxiety, and it all gets compounded. I did have a ton of terminal leave and some savings. Without that, I very well could've been homeless in a matter of weeks. </p>
<p>Maybe I just wasn't paying attention while I was in, but I was woefully ignorant of the assistance that I was eligible for through the VA. I have since taken advantage of a ton of mental health services that, had I known, would've been indispensably helpful upon getting out. I suspect that this true for other vets as well. </p></div>		</li>
