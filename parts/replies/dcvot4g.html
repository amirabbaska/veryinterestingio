<p>You don't express uncertainty via significant figures, but via confidence intervals. So the correct answer would that the range is from 4.5<em>4.5 to 5.5</em>5.5. Therefore it is X +/- Y. X will be slightly above 25.</p>
<p>Well, in school you do express uncertainty via sf, but it's dumb, and you'll never do that doing anything important outside school. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Although I do agree c.i.'s are the proper way to do it and significant digits are a bit of shorthand, you still can't create greater accuracy from less accurate inputs.</p></div>		</li>
