<p>What happens when an object's velocity is already extremely close to the speed of light and is traveling towards a massive object</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It really is hard to answer, because it all depends on your point of view. If you are traveling half the speed of light and light is traveling along side you, it will still appear to be traveling the full speed of light. Lets say two things are accelerating towards eachother, from an external point of view each object is traveling 2/3 the speed of light right before impact. What doesn't make sense is that from the point of view of one object, the other object is traveling 5/3 the speed of light, which is impossible. In a sense, yes, in another sense, no. I'm sure someone can elaborate in greater depth or verify/disprove what i'm throwing at you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that you would not observe a speed of greater than c and that this is why time dilation occurs in the relative frsmes of reference. Is this wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also correct. That's where things start to become confusing because it would be known that relatively it is traveling faster than the speed of light but it could never be measured because like you said, we can't observe anything with a speed greater than c.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is given in Einstein's Special Relativity. The (inertial) mass of an object is dependent on its velocity relative to another object (which is why in physics we talk about the &quot;rest mass&quot; of a body).<br />
You may recall that F (force) = m (mass) X (a) acceleration. Therefore a = F / m. As the object's velocity increases so does its inertial mass, therefore applying the same force (F) provides less and less acceleration. Once the object reaches light speed, its inertial mass becomes infinite, and so no amount of force will provide acceleration.</p></div>		</li>
