			<p>&gt; (2) Dishonest people have been stealing other people's work and selling it as their own on Steam. Valve apparently did not anticipate or plan for this, or if they did, they didn't care enough to do anything about it.<br><br>That's wrong, here's a quote from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/aboutpaidcontent/" target="_blank">FAQ</a>:<br>&gt; Q. What if I see someone posting content I've created?<br><br>&gt; A. If someone has copied your work, please use the DMCA takedown notice.</p>		</li>

			<p>So, either the DMCA takedown will be infinitely more effective than the Steam Support, proving that valve gives zero fucks about the consumer, or it's going to be as ineffective as steam support and open them up to hundreds of lawsuits. </p>		</li>

			<p>That is not even remotely true.<br><br>Mods have to be vetted by the community before they can even be commercialized, and the publisher also has to vette/modify the price.<br><br>Payouts aren't done immediately, they never are on market platforms. Many of them won't even have cleared for weeks.<br><br>Additionally, the only story about it supposedly happening was wildly misunderstood by the community. A creator took down their own mod, which they uploaded, because of a library licensing issue, which is very common in software development.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; (5) The argument for monetizing mods is that it will produce better quality mods, as creators will be able to do it for a living. The argument against is it will produce worse quality mods and the market will be flooded with cheap cosmetic crap rather than labours of love.<br><br>Also, currently modding in Skyrim features a TON of mods that are all designed to work well together, or modders will focus on one singular area of expertise and let other modders work on other things. <br><br>Turning mods into DLC means that these mods will disappear completely. Nobody is going to work to make mods compatible with others, nobody is going to make compatibility patches that make certain popular mods work together, nobody is going to have 'recommended to use with...' lists either.<br><br>People who mod Skyrim just to add stupid new swords and fancy armor are idiots. That's not what you're supposed to be doing. Modding Bethesda games means you should be installing giant game-overhauling megamods, and the fifty to a hundred mods that complement it by each improving specific areas of the game.<br><br>You will NEVER see that kind of modding under the third-party DLC scheme.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; fifty to a hundred mods that complement it<br><br>This is a point that I feel a number of paid-mod advocates miss. I have a load order stretching into the hundreds, and I know others who have more. It's wonderful to have so many tweaks, but if I had to pay for every single one, well, I'd be paying extortionate amounts of money to enjoy Skyrim the way I want to, which feels wrong to me. <br><br>Not to mention the fact that I can't afford it at all at the moment, nor could anyone else who is, say, out of work or at a low-paid job. The introduction of paid mods is going to put people off modding if they have mouths to feed or rent to pay, which is a real shame because it is/was a really enjoyable thing to do and a great way of improving technical knowledge as well as having damn good fun with Skyrim.</p>		</li>

			<p>The issue is, though, that those people can still offer their mods for free, as they have always done. <br><br>What I think this is going to end up as: crappy mods, cashgrabs, free (good) mods and a paid version of said mod, instead of a donation button.</p>		</li>

			<p>tl;dr: Modders are people with such passion, enthusiasm, and love for a game that they spend their free time trying to make it better, and share the results with everyone for free with no expectation of compensation. Communities were built around sharing/improving each others' mods. Valve has killed that kind of modding. They've taken one of  the most beautiful things about PC gaming and turned it into yet another bland, micro-transactionary profit mechanism.</p>		</li>
