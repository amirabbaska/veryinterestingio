			<div class="markdown"><p>The currents run in opposite directions. </p>
<p>North &gt; South on the Pacific coast and South &gt; North on the Atlantic so the water on the pacific coast is much cooler as its coming from Arctic regions instead of equatorial.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Very strong vertical wind shear in the troposphere is considered a deterrent.[2] The Intertropical Convergence Zone drops one to two degrees south of the equator,[3] not far enough from the equator for the Coriolis force to aid development. Water temperatures in the tropics of the southern Atlantic are cooler than those in the tropical north Atlantic.[4]</p>

<p>Additionally, I would image that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream" target="_blank">Gulf Stream</a> has something to do with it. This would help explain the statement above about the southern Atlantic having cooler temperatures (warm temperatures are required for tropical storms).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That map is notorious for coloring in parts of the equatorial band when tropical cyclones actually cannot form on the equator.  Tropical cyclones require a non-negligible Coriolis force to form, which means they can't actually form within ~10 degrees of the equator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agni, Vamei, and most recently Pali in January of 2016? They can and do form very near the equator, saying they cannot is 100% false.  It's a rare occurrence, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the limit is actually more like 5 degrees from the equator, but as /u/Ayclimate mentioned the Coriolis force weakens as you got closer to the equator so it's not possible for them to form any closer. <a href="https://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/7000/7079/tropical_cyclone_map_lrg.gif" target="_blank">This is a good map to see the limit.</a> You can also see the intensity of storms is lower closer to the equator.</p></div>		</li>
