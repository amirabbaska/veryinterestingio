			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting that gravity changes the other half of the equation. This implies that the perceived energy , or the frequency, as a measurement; is part of a ratio related to gravity does it not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would mean 100 clocks and observation stations positioned all the way down the path to a black hole would all report: normal wave length. Ever station sees it as normal because it's in an area where time is slower, so a stretched wavelength seems normal. </p>
<p>Edit. Never mind. It actually never stretches. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the stations are staying still, (using rocket fuel to maintain their position against the black hole's pull of gravity), then a beam of light coming towards the black hole will look blue-shifted to the stations that are closer to the black hole.  If the stations are in free fall, falling towards the black hole, I'm not sure but the light might look normal.</p></div>		</li>
