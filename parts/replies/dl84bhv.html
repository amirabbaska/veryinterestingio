			<div class="markdown"><p>I went through a phase when I was younger  where I passed out a lot. I ended up breaking my ankle after one episode. (Snapped it on the way down) I saw a few doctors and they all said my tests were okay, and one of them suggested I add a tiny bit of salt to my diet because my blood pressure was apparently really low.
After seeing a psychiatrist for unrelated stuff, I was able to make some connections. All of my &quot;spells&quot; happened when I was either staying at my dad's house with his violent alcoholic wife or when I had been away for a few days and was about to go back. </p>
<p>The doctor helped me work on some tricks to &quot;fake out&quot; my brain when it started telling my body I was nervous and vice versa. (And also helped me get out of that environment) Though I've had one or two close calls, I haven't passed out since. The human brain is amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting information. One note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many evolutionary psychologists believed that as human civilizations evolved, our bodies made our social and pain/reward systems in the brain connected, as a way to force us to socialize.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evolution isn't planful. It works through happy accidents. Bodies with linked social and pain reward systems were a better fit for where and when they lived, so their kids are everywhere now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I've always thought that everyone experiences the same degree of burn/pain/sinking feeling, then I'm diagnosed with depression. I I get so much less painful/achy after taking medication.</p></div>		</li>
