<p>Water doesn't change temperature quickly, and the more the water, the longer it takes to change</p>
</li>
<li>Many fish actually prefer colder water, because oxygen dissolves better in colder water, but this is highly dependent on the fish's natural habitat. Tropical fish won't do well in colder waters because that's not where they evolved. Fish that live in cold mountain streams would die in warmer water. Individuals don't adapt, species do.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is also why for example, with gold fish, you float them in your fish bowl while they're still in their bag of water so the water temperature of the bag gradually comes to the same temperature of the bowl to avoid shock for the fish.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not true, fish gills absorb oxygen from the water, so it's possible for a fish to drown if there's a depletion in oxygen dissolved in the water. Fortunately, lakes usually have enough supply dissolved in before freezing, and air is often trapped beneath ice as a lake freezes over.</p></div>		</li>
