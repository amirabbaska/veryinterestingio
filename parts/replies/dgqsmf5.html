			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so. I mean, look at the earliest civilizations. The Egyptians where miles ahead of the Romans for example. They where a bunch of uncivilized savages in comparison.</p>
<p>And yet, after many thousands of years, they evolved from a tribal society.</p>
<p>Technology and society don't have a set time for developing. It could happen 5000 years ago like the Egyptians or 10 thousand years later. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that some civilizations advance earlier than others, it's reasonable to assume that there are various factors than aid or hinder development. In the case of the Egyptians, having huge amounts of incredibly fertile farming land next to the Nile probably helped them to develop more quickly. </p>
<p>A factor that may hinder development could be having an overly rigid social structure - either strictly enforced egalitarianism, or hierarchy. Both are likely to lead to talented people failing to fulfil their potential.</p>
<p>Going back to OP's point, the fact that current hunter-gatherer societies are typically egalitarian doesn't necessarily mean that our hunter-gatherer ancestors were the same. Maybe the surviving hunter-gatherer societies have remained in this state precisely because they're 'too' egalitarian.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know what your point is... the Egyptians had a pharaoh and a ruling class (Priests/Aristocracy). They were far from egalitarian.</p>
<p>Even if they came from a relatively egalitarian tribal society, they certainly weren't egalitarian at the peak of their civilization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a clarification, I looked up egalitarian and it is defined as &quot;relating to or believing in the principle that <em>all people</em> are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities.&quot;</p>
<p>In your context, would &quot;all people&quot; refer to all the members of the group, or to all others regardless of their grouping?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this context &quot;egalitarian&quot; is used in opposition to &quot;hierarchical&quot;, in the sense that individuals in society generally lack the ability or authority to force others to do something.</p>
<p>Or as anthrobase puts it, they have no power structure except that based on age and/or gender</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism" target="_blank">anarchism</a> is and also you're projecting a lot of your own opinions. I don't think there's anything intrinsically more 'primitive' about not constructing mythologies or having a language which functions differently than others. Also a lot of the work done with the Piraha was of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirah%C3%A3_language#Recent_controversy" target="_blank">questionable quality</a>.</p>
<p>Lots of hunter gatherer societies are egalitarian and we have evidence egalitarianism was quite a common thing before the development of hierarchical societies.</p>

<p>Often they don't</p>

<p>Egalitarian means that no member really has authority to command other adult members to do something.  Leaving aside issues about the research into the Piraha, the society you describe <em>does</em> sound egalitarian.  For example, extended family organizations are often not egalitarian, because a patriarch often has authority over other family members.  Egalitarian systems in the anthropological sense don't imply that anyone helps anyone else...in fact, this could be an example of a situation where nobody is able to compel another to help them, which is what you might expect in an egalitarian society.  Certainly anarchism could be seen as a form of egalitarianism in the anthropological sense, at least to the extent that it implies no hierarchical power structure exists.</p></div>		</li>
