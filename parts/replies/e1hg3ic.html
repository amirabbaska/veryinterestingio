			<div class="markdown"><p>Me and a lot of girls I know suffer with iron deficiency (not quite anaemia). This means it can be extremely hot outside but poor circulation as well as poor ability to regulate temperature means hands and feet are FREEZING.</p>
<p>I like my showers like lava. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a woman who wears pants and long sleeves all the damn time, I wonder when i see people undressed in the summer*. The sun on your skin will warm you faster than sun on fabric on skin. Wearing light colored pants &amp; long sleeve shirts will keep you cooler longer, protect your skin and help you retain moisture. </p>
<p>*this works mostly in high, dry country - like Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Wyoming, Montana, Utah, Nevada and parts of California. If you have some retarded amount of humidity the only thing that can save you is ice packs in your armpits and underwear or hanging out in a Harris Teeter where the thermostat is set on Fucking Arctic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And for those who don't know why women more easily get a deficiency in iron: they require more iron day to day because of the monthly blood loss called menstruation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, my legs don't really get cold that much. Well, they do, but it's much easier to bear and not nearly as unpleasant as my upper body getting cold - the latter's more like, I'm feeling cold to my very core. Wearing short skirts in cold weather is something you can get used to. And it's possible to develop a tolerance to cold through exposure. There are plenty of women who do ice bathing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not everyone is the same. I am a woman and my legs never get cold, just my arms and my feet if it’s winter. And my hands almost never, I can bike in winters without mittens here in Finland (but it’s not good for hands so I try to remember the mittens).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are in a short skirt you are probably also wearing high heels. Their feet are burning. On fire. All pain. Numbness from cold is a blessed relief. </p>
<p>Also, leg cold isn’t bad, it really is just numb. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might more of an occasion thing. I was talking about the scenario in marriages and all. Men would wear a coat, women would sarees (traditional, leaves there midriff open) or skirts etc (if they are younger, leavers there legs (and midriff) open).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That tends to be because women's professional attire tends to be thinner / cover less than men's as men tend to have the exprcration of (wool) suits. Office room temperatures and ACs are adjusted with that in mind.</p></div>		</li>
