			<div class="markdown"><p>What about airliners used for freight, like FedEx's fleet? They don't appear to have windows when you look at the exterior of the plane. Do those aircraft structurally differ from the passenger variants, or is it just a cosmetic thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The primary airframe structure of a freighter fuselage vs a passenger variant of the same model (e.g. 777F vs 777-200) (Note: the 777-3ER is now the most common model being purchased and flown and is just longer) does not vary all that much, in the regard that most all airframes are engineered and built in the same way they have been for years. Frames and Stringers connected to skins that are fastened together at vertical and horizontal joins, frames tie into a floor grid directly and with stanchions (vertical beams). </p>
<p>Now generalizing like this may get me into hot water with some Reddit engineers. For this reason, I am going to say yes they structurally differ- and to answer what I think you are asking- you could not add or subtract windows in the airframe. There are structural differences between variants due to the function of the AP, usually always, but not limited to, the location of doors (and windows) to the aircraft. Anywhere there is a cargo or passenger door there will be changes to the engineering either in the structural build up (use of doublers or high strength fasteners) or in the material used to build the airframe, such as CF vs Al vs TI etc. For example, the floor beams of a 777 pass. are CF, and for a freighter they are AL. </p>
<p>Since I am already writing an essay, let me comment on the rest of this thread by saying a few things- window location is determined by engineering design and is NOT EVER changed by request of the airline. They are where they are and are there for a reason.
Seats are bolted to floorboards, and can easily be swapped out by the tools your grandpa has in his garage. Yes, changing location of stowbins and oxygen mask systems would be a pain in the ass, but still cheaper to do than the going rate of a new widebody these days. </p>

<p>It can be cheaper just to buy passenger aircraft, sent them to the manufacuters to be refitted/interior ripped out and used as cargo than just buy a new cargo aircraft</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that because human comfort is not a concern for these planes, a &quot;freight-configuration&quot; variant exists that can eliminate windows to maximize structural integrity? Would love to hear someone with actual knowledge answer this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait - so I get that the seats can be moved because they're on rails.  But how do they then change all the stuff above the seats - the Oxygen masks, call button, lights, air, etc.?  Don't those have to line up with the seats?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The layout of the cabin accessories, including the overhead bins, vents, oxygen masks, life rafts, galleys, restrooms and seats are as per the purchasing airline. They take many factors into consideration before they decide on a final design. Once it's done, it's very expensive to re-design an existing layout, as you can see.  You move seats, you pretty much re-design everything else that is in relation to the seats. Except the windows  :)</p></div>		</li>
