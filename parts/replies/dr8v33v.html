			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m glad you mentioned that they clean the insulators. In some areas that have a lot of salt and dust (yes I’m from Salt Lake City), the bottom/underside of these insulators can collect dust up in there, making it easier for a conductive path to be made from conductor to ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally, a reply that I believe addresses the OP’s question. In my first job (electrical engineer in a large paper mill) cleaning our 115 KV insulators in our sub-stations was a yearly task given to cub engineers to schedule and plan. Over time dust and crud will build up on the insulators, and can cause an arc fault after the first rainstorm after a long dusty dry spell. The design of the bells of the high voltage insulators helps to prevent this, but periodic maintenance is required for high availability (<a href="http://www.tdworld.com/overhead-distribution/insulator-washing-helps-maintain-reliability" target="_blank">http://www.tdworld.com/overhead-distribution/insulator-washing-helps-maintain-reliability</a>).

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had this issue here in Queensland a few years ago. A long dry spell, then a time with very light rain. There was an old transmission line with small insulators, and when the light showers came through, the leakage was so bad they just couldn't keep the breakers in. Several hour-long blackouts resulted.</p>
<p>Since then they have replaced the entire line with a much bigger one, using larger 'fog disks' to prevent tracking in humid conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a fact that blows a lot of peoples' minds: distilled water is a pretty good insulator.</p>
<p>Until whatever metal or other crap it's in contact with gets pulled into suspension, of course. Then it's not so good. But until then!</p></div>		</li>
