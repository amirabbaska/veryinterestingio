			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know of any specific studies about autistic adults “losing” their special interests when they become depressed, but it would not surprise me. A hallmark of depression (in all populations) is what we call “anhedonia” - which is the loss of interest in things. It may be even more pronounced in autism when special interests are so powerful and helpful. Thankfully, though treatments for depression may not be perfect, they do often help with symptoms such as anhedonia. </p>
<p>Oh, and for the second part of your question, there is a small but growing literature about sexual orientation and gender identity in autism. And yes, it does appear that there is a higher proportion of people who identify as LBGTQAI. Our Preview Issue includes a qualitative study on gender identity amongst autistic adults who were raised as girls. <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aut.2018.0001" target="_blank">https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/aut.2018.0001</a></p></div>		</li>
