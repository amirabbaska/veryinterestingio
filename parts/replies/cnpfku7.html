			<div class="markdown"><p>Try filling a baking tray with white vinegar and putting it in the over at a moderate temperature for an hour, turn the over off and leave for another couple of hours, then wipe out with a damp cloth. Repeat if necessary. My mother cleaned out 20+ years of neglect using that trick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a nooby developer, I can tell you I'd sometimes much rather clean an oven than fix a shitty little bug for an hour. It sometimes like trying to get rid of a fly. You know how they make noise about your head. Then when you open the window and try to get rid of them they just flat refuse to co-operate. And then when it's finally gone you feel no pleasure or relief.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually been the norm for MMOs to be virtually unplayable for the first month or two.  Honestly, GW2 had one of the most bug-free launches I've ever seen, and it still was pretty rough for the first month.  Their biggest problem was a lack of meaningful content, as the game's PvE was incredibly easy because they couldn't balance the game's PvE and PvP well, and they didn't want people to be warded off by dungeons.</p>
<p>FFXIV 1.0 was one of the worst offenders, releasing a truly broken and unplayable joke of a game.  2.0 was better, but even a year after release, there are many issues with their netcode and their server hardware because 2.0 is paying for the 20 million dollar hit they took with 1.0, and they can't upgrade.  As a result, you have a subscription game that over a million people pay a sub for that has a server response ping defaulted to 300 milliseconds, which is atrociously bad for a game that requires twitch play for reacting to things.  It will never be fixed btw.</p></div>		</li>
