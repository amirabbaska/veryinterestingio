			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people metabolize alcohol quicker than others. The average amount of alcohol the liver can metabolize in an hour is 1/3rd of an ounce. Although it will vary depending on the person's size, health and even gender. Women typically metabolize alcohol at a slower rate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do women (in general) metabolize at a lower rate? I mean, the liver function is the same as in men, so why the lower rate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if we assume same size and body fat for male/female, women have a lower level of alcohol dehydrogenase which is an enzyme that breaks down alcohol in the stomach. </p>
<p>Basically, booze is absorbed best in the small intestine, the longer it stays in the stomach, the more alcohol dehydrogenase has time to break it down which causes slower absorption into the blood and lower BAC. </p>
<p>FYI: Also why drinking on an empty stomach gets you wasted. Food holds alcohol in the stomach longer for more of it to break down through first-pass metabolism.</p>
<p>ELI5 - Women's stomachs aren't as good at dealing with alcohol due to lower levels of an enzyme. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if women metabolized at a slower rate would that make it harder or easier for them to get/stay drunk? my boyfriend has a 3% beer and is good for the night but it takes me 4 just to reach the level past tipsy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without regards to tolerance or anything else people mentioned, blackouts are more likely to occur when a large amount of alcohol is ingested over a shorter amount of time. In relation to tolerance, people who don't blackout as much tend to get progressively more drunk as the night goes on instead of all at once. As other people have noted however, blackout tolerance is separate than alcohol tolerance, and unless new research has come out fairly recently, people aren't really exactly sure why some people blackout more than others (beyond speculation).  </p></div>		</li>
