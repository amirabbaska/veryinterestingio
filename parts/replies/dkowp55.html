			<div class="markdown"><p>From <a href="http://summitsourcefunding.com/blog/helium-used-mri-machines/" target="_blank">here</a> &quot;The average MRI machine utilizes 1,700 liters of helium. A standard 18″ balloon requires about .1 oz of helium, and the machine uses about 56,100 oz to give you a mental picture of how much helium that is.&quot;</p>
<p>That's about half a million helium balloons.</p>
<p>Apparently it needs to be topped up periodically, but I'm not sure by how much. Although rare, if there is a fault with the temperature control inside the scanner, the helium may rapidly boil away in what is know as a <a href="http://mri-q.com/what-is-a-quench.html" target="_blank">'quench'</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It seems that's the amount that is in the MRI at any given time and not the total consumption over a year. So that would be over half a million balloons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breathing gas mixtures in both medical applications (reducing gas density in patients lungs), and in commercial diving (reduces inert gas narcosis and oxygen toxicity for divers). Helium is often used to leak test vessels and piping systems, because it escapes so easily (Helium is monoatomic and highly mobile). Helium is used as a cryogenic coolant. At &lt;269°C it's the coldest one we have. It is used to induce superconductivity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Under increased pressures, nitrogen creates a physiological effect in the body similar to being drunk (impaired judgement etc.) which worsens with depth. This is called narcosis, and seems to correlate to molecular size and lipid solubility of the gas in question. Replacing some or all of the nitrogen in a gas mixture with helium alleviates the effect. Oxygen also contributes to narcosis, but because oxygen is metabolized the effect is usually ignored when planning a gas mixture. The problem with oxygen is that under increased pressure it becomes toxic, both acutely (central nervous system toxicity) and cumulatively (pulmonary toxicity). The deeper or longer the planned dive, the less oxygen can be used in the mixture, in order to maintain a tolerable partial pressure of oxygen. The balance, which in air would be nitrogen, then has to be replaced with helium to eliminate the narcosis. </p></div>		</li>
