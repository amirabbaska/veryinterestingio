			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I'm just guessing here but the average door is approximately 48&quot; tall. 2 inches width over the height of 48 inches is 96 square inches of extra material per door. So, multiply that by the millions of bathrooms across the country and it's a huge cost.</p>
<p>Also, the most common type of hinge on bathroom doors I see look like a sort of <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/kKNyV" target="_blank">pipe hinge.</a>. The top part is top down view of the door. I'm guessing this setup is both very cheap and somewhat strong.</p>
<p>Bathrooms in the united States are free man, they are made to be cheap. If it were better and economical the way you suggested, either you would be a millionaire or they have thought of it, and the idea sucks.</p>
<p>TBH I am way more bothered by urinals with out divider walls, or the 50 foot piss bathtubs they have at the Joe Louis Arena than a stall gap. But that's just me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>-The doors need to be made out of high quality material. A material that does not shrink and swell with temperature. If the door shrinks or grows with temp/humidity, it may not close, making it useless.</p>

<p>They really don't, you can have a 2 cm gap but just place a plate behind it. There won't be a problem with shrinking or swelling</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even if this was the reason, what's the reason they're NOT like it in the UK? Materials and labour are more expensive here.</p></div>		</li>
