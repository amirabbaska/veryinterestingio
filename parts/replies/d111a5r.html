			<div class="markdown"><p>Top Lit Up Draft or TLUD is a common method of making biochar, or charcoal made from organic materials. Such as wood and leaves.</p>
<p>I did my senior year engineering project on this very topic. It is all carbon leftover, no hydrogen or nitrogen or oxygen. Well, mostly carbon. It works by a burning process in the absence of Oxygen called <em>pyrolysis</em>.</p>
<p>Biochar is useful for many things, but in my project we soaked the organic material in a solution of Magnesium Oxide, dried it, pyrolyzed it, then used it for filtration of water. It is a good filtration agent because the biochar has an absolutely HUGE surface area to volume ratio. The MgO gave it a net positive charge.</p>
<p>We provided strong evidence suggesting that biochar treated with MgO is a good agent for removing Nitrates and Phosphates from water. This is useful for dairy farms, where Nitrates and Phosphates   (from cow manure) contaminate the water runoff and ultimately the drinking water.</p>
<p>This was cool to see, thanks for posting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity, how exactly would the MgO remove the nitrates and phosphates more effectively than a purely charcoal filter? I'm assuming it has something to do with the positive charge you mentioned? </p>
<p>Seems like a really neat way to improve filters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could this be used in aquariums?  It was my understanding that activated charcoal doesn't remove nitrates from the water, only dissolved organics which might indirectly reduce nitrate buildup.  Would MgO treated charcoal actually remove nitrates and would it be safe for fish?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also make something called &quot;charcloth&quot; which uses this process of burning something with no oxygen (which i think is called pyrolysis). Les Stroud makes it a lot in survivorman. Basically you just poke a hole in a small tin, like an altoids tin, and fill it with cotton cloth and leave it in the fire for awhile until it stops shooting smoke out of the hole. Apparently it catches a spark easily and is therefore great for starting fires. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a video recently where some guys made a katana via traditional methods, starting with smelting their own iron ore.  I think they said they used 1000 pounds of charcoal.  Less exacting tools probably need less charcoal to pound the iron/steel into sufficient purity and to get it into its final shape, but I think he'll need basically the same amount of charcoal to get from iron ore to iron bloom in the first place, or possibly more if he goes with the simplest kiln and bellows he can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you can capture the vapors from making charcoal and burn those as well, they actually burn well once they have been heated up to their vapor point, at that point their activation energy is nearly the same as their surroundings, once this point is reached then the hydrocarbons released while making the charcoal actually burn clean. This idea was used in Europe during and after world war 2, it was used to power the gas powered vehicles owned by civilians because gas was being given to the armies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is nicely envisioned when you think about how they used to make charcoal - by piling a bunch of wood, covering the pile with dirt or clay, and then lighting it on fire.</p>
<p>&quot;Char cloth&quot; is another example of making a similar substance using cloth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does the fire burn if it's covered with no oxygen</p>
<p>How the hell did someone discover this. One day someone decided they would try and burn burnt wood???</p>
<p><em>edit</em></p>
<p>I think I understand now guys
Thanks for the replies. I guess the key analogy is like stop burning your fuel halfway to use later. Excpet you put it out by smothering it and it keeps smouldering while u put it out. Then undergoes chemical change. Because you didn't fully burn it out, the fuel can still be used but has different properties due to the chemical change</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Burying a fire to preserve it has been a fairly well known technique for a while.  If you mostly-bury a burning fire, it'll smolder for a while (say, overnight) so that you can resurrect it later.</p>
<p>As for the discovery that charcoal burns hotter, that probably comes from the observation that once a fire has nearly burned out, the bed of hot coals at the bottom are much hotter (and thus more useful for metalworking) than the big wood flames.</p>
<p>It's not actually that big of a leap of logic to figure out that you can make a big fire, and then put it out to save the best part for later when you need it.  From there, efficient production of charcoal is an iterative improvement.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I watched a documentary once where it showed how they smelt iron in Africa. To make the charcoal they pile huge amounts of wood and set it on fire. They wait actually wait a while for the entire pile to catch fire, longer than I would have imagined, and then they all start shoveling lots of sand/dirt over top. I think they waited 3 days for it to burn and then cool down and when they uncovered it, it was charcoal.</p></div>		</li>
