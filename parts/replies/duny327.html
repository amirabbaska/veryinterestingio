			<div class="markdown"><p>Sadly, there are no standards of purity. Homeopathic solutions are sold at dilutions that are below detectable limits of most standard testing instruments/protocols. It's a free market solution in the sense that if it killed you right away, they'd be pulled off the shelf. If they somehow caused an increased chance of contracting a certain illness 10-20yrs later, the free market does a poor job of regulating those types of outcomes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm afraid it's worse than that. They literally sell water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can be.  There are no inspection, quality control, or advertising laws for supplements that says the bottle actually has to contain what it says in it.  The lack of such quality controls means that some supplements have been tainted by toxic chemicals.  Others have actually <em>been</em> poisons, like selling belladonna (deadly nightshade) as a supplement to help with teething pain, which has injured infants.</p>
<p>The free market is expected to sort all this out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's what I don't understand.</p>
<p>Take this image as an example: <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/BTET-T135-RENDERING-032513-300x334.jpg" target="_blank">link</a></p>
<p>This packaging clearly says &quot;fast relief of pain and irritability from teething.&quot;  How on Earth is that not taken to be a claim to treat or cure a disease?  Even if the packaging also has the usual disclaimer, surely that disclaimer has limits?</p>
<p>To give an extreme example, if the packaging said &quot;cures asthma&quot;, surely the &quot;not intdended to diagnose, treat, etc. etc.&quot; disclaimer would not protect the manufacturer.  Why is promising &quot;fast relief from pain and irritation&quot; acceptable?  Is it because it doesn't mention a <em>specific</em> disease?  Is this kind of distinction within some regulatory body's discretion, and they're simply choosing not to bother?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two issues. First, it becomes a legal question that is beyond my background when they use phrases like &quot;natural relief&quot; vs &quot;treats&quot;. Their objective is to stay in the grey area. Second,  manufacturers do get in trouble for false claims, because they can change their websites instantly and can change their packaging faster than they are inspected. If the claim isn't too egregious, then they can just print their remaining lot of packages and correct after that. If you do feel the language does go too far submit a complaint through your state agency or through the FDA: www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch/default.htm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because everyone in this thread is wrong. Homeopathic drugs aren't treated as supplements by the FDA. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm589373.pdf" target="_blank">They're their own special class of product</a> and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074360.htm" target="_blank">regulated by completely different legislation</a>. If anything the FDA treats them more like real drugs. <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/informationbydrugclass/ucm589282.htm" target="_blank">Homeopathic drugs are allowed to make disease claims when it comes to non life-threatening illnesses or problems amenable by self-diagnosis</a>. So headaches, toothaches, colds, etc., can all be submitted as valid claims for homeopathic drugs.</p>
<p>In fact there are even (non- FDA approved)  prescription homeopathic drugs, which can sometimes make certain more serious claims.</p>
<p>So while &quot;fast relief of pain&quot; is not a permissible dietary supplement claim, it is a valid homeopathic claim. You have lobbyists to thank, if you rightfully think that's dumb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: this is the reason that HeadOn just said &quot;apply directly to the forehead.&quot; It was homeopathy and therefore it wouldn't be legal to make any actual claims about its usefulness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Manufacturer Miralus Healthcare decided not to include any factual claims about the product in the spots after the National Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureau objected to the claim that HeadOn provided &quot;fast, safe, effective&quot; headache relief made in an earlier spot. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeadOn" target="_blank">[From Wikipedia, with old citation]</a></p>
