			<div class="markdown"><p>You are not mistaken! It actually is a detective story. Written from the point of view of an autistic boy who is tasked to write a book about something as a form of therapy. The kid decides to investigate the murder of their neighbor's dog. Much of the appeal is that obvious things seem incomprehensible to him, and at the same time, he looks at social constructs completely obliviously which gives the reader a real sense of the absurdity of some common day to day interactions. It makes you sympathize and understand the struggles very well. </p></div>		</li>
