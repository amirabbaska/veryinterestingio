<p>Asphalt millings are what happens when you grind up an old roadway. Millings can be brought back to an asphalt plant to be recycled into a new asphalt mix where it is considered &quot;RAP&quot; or recycled asphalt pavement. RAP can be incorporated into a new asphalt mix, or the millings can be placed loose in an area where you want to fortify the soil, like a large gravel parking lot. You wont get the same quality asphalt surface you would normally get if everything is hot mixed and rolled, but it will bind up over time and give you a little better wearing surface than just dirt.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I had to put in a new driveway when I bought my house, and it's all clay out here.</p>
<p>So at about 1/2 the price of crushed limestone, putting down 12&quot; of crushed asphalt is a good option (30cm to you other folks).</p>
<p>Additionally, as it settles, the remaining tar gets hot, and it's set up like concrete (so no water / erosion issues).</p>
<p>I might have them spray it down with hot tar eventually, to top-seal the driveway... but it's honestly not necessary at this point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I filled a 6 acre lot with it, the guy that sold it to me just called it &quot;reclaimed ashphalt&quot;. Only problem was he had tons of slag and metal shards in it, and I was trying to park a couple hundred RVs on it. I wasted a <strong>lot</strong> of money on tires that year.</p></div>		</li>
