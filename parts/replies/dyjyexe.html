<p>If 500mg of antimatter touches any normal matter, it will annihilate 500mg of normal matter and mostly both disappear into gamma.</p>
<p>But that's 1g of mass turned into energy.  By E=MC^2, this is a 21.5 kiloton nuclear explosion.  </p>
<p>It could in theory be throttled particle-by-particle, but if you had a 500mg pebble suspended and it in any way touched anything other than single atoms, like the container wall, a grain of normal sand, or just air- it would create a tremendous flash of gamma and heat which would blow apart itself and the container and scatter every antiparticle so its entire mass would annihilate itself against normal matter almost instantly.</p>
<p>Basically, once you have any substantial mass of antimatter (milligrams), you have an unimaginable disaster, that just hasn't happened yet.  (&quot;you're all dead, you just don't know it yet&quot;)</p>
<p>I suppose in theory you could have something in low density gas akin to the Leidenfrost Effect, where the first few gas molecules annihilate, superheating the gas around it, which blasts most of the gas away, limiting the rate of annihilation.  </p>
<p>However, I don't think it could- the gamma energy penetrates air for a very long way in standard air pressure before losing its energy.  It could make a large bubble of elevated pressure and half of it would press inward and accelerate the annihilation.  More important, the small mass of antimatter would surely heat far above the boiling point, become a gas, and explode outward, ensuring instant and total annihilation of the entire mass.</p>
<p>However, you COULD put antimatter in orbit outside the atmosphere.  It will encounter only infrequent contact with an escaping air molecule (frequency depends on how far out its orbit its, and the solar weather in space at the time).  This does cause a lot of heating for a small object but annihilation energy of one N2 molecule is VERY small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Little Boy (Hiroshima) was smaller.  Fat Man (Nagasaki) was estimated at 21kt, so it is coincidentally a logically sound equivalent unit.  I used that example in my other posts.  These were small weapons compared to most tactical weapons, most under 1megaton... 1MT=47.6 grams of its mass is lost as energy.</p>
<p>1 Fat Man = 1g of energy-as-destructive-power.</p>
<p>I do recommend you be careful in terminology- this is not 1 g of antimatter, it would be 500mg antimatter + 500mg normal matter.  The normal matter is JUST as important to the annihilation as the antimatter, just common.</p>
<p>And of course Fat Man was not an antimatter weapon and didn't have any important antiparticles as part of its key reaction, although antiparticles are created at some point, even in the fallout decades later.  The fission, you start with a normal uranium-235 nucleus, hit it with a neutron, briefly promoting it to unstable u-236, and to breaks into a krypton and barium nuclei, throwing out 3 new neutrons and a gamma ray.  None of which are antiparticles, but they do lose mass nonetheless.</p></div>		</li>
