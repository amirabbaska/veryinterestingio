			<div class="markdown"><p>Valance electrons are only those that occupy the s and p orbitals. Because d orbitals are filled one shell down. Compare the electron configuration of Ca and Sc. But as always with chemistry, everything is a lie. And so you have for example sulfuric acid where the sulfur uses more than 8 electrons to create bonds. And metals can create all kinds of weird complexes with 6 or 8 bonds. Then they are using their d-orbitals for bonding. But these are &quot;technically&quot; not valence electrons.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Every year you learn the last year was a lie. I'm convinced if I took it further instead of just what I need for pharmacy, everything I learn will turn out to be almost entirely wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want the truth about chemistry (as we know so far), then you'll solve the full system of relativistic schr√∂dinger equations...except no analytic solution is known for most interesting molecules, so maybe you'll do a computer simulation of the quantum system...except now you're not doing chemistry anymore, you're a grad student in computational physics.</p>
<p>Successive lies we tell students are better and better approximations that allow them to get work done. Every field does this. As someone once said, all models are wrong, but some are useful. We knew about general relativity in the 60s, but Newtonian gravity was good enough to get people to the moon.</p>
<p>But I agree that being clear with students that we're telling lies would do a lot to inoculate people against this &quot;science is so untrustworthy, it's always changing its mind!&quot; mania that's so prevalent today.</p></div>		</li>
