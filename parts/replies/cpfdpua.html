<p>If surgery has to be performed on a patient who has been in a coma for a long time, is anaesthesia administered? Particularly in the case of an emergency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personal anecdote. </p>
<p>My mother back in the 80s was hit by a car and she had a diffuse axonal injury. She was in a chemically induced coma for a few months. Talking with her, she doesn't remember the flight for life picking her up or getting hit by the car or really too much of anything the months following regaining consciousness. </p>
<p>What she does remember is rather eerie too be honest. Her boyfriend at the time (my father) would visit her everyday and would bring music to listen to. This is around the time &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; came out. My dad would bring it in and listen to it with her. My mom prior to the accident hated Pink Floyd yet when she woke she knew all the lyrics to the album and loved Pink Floyd. She remembers hearing the sound of that sexy saxophone in &quot;Us and Them&quot;. It's rather fascinating heating her talk about it. She also remembers the sound of the high speed medical drills they used to cut her skull open to release pressure. Anytime she hears anything like that she has to turn it off or just walk away from it. She doesn't remember the incident but the sound brings her discomfort. </p>
<p>She doesn't remember physically feeling anything but she could feel people were watching her and they were talking. She said it was like she was in a weird dream-state. It's incredibly interesting hearing her talk about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first question is a complicated one and depends on how you interpret what it really means to sense something.  What I mean by that is a patient in a coma may not actually have anything wrong with their sensory organs. Their ears, eyes, skin, etc. may work just fine.  The nerves connecting these sensory organs to the brain might work just fine as well.  The question is whether the brain can interpret these sensations in any meaningful way.  If you are in a coma it is doubtful that you have any higher cortical function and so you do not interpret these sensations the same as someone with consciousness does.  Instead, a person in a coma may simply react &quot;reflexively&quot; which is not a conscious response to stimuli.  For example, if I were to pinch your skin right now, your higher brain function can interpret this in any number of ways (I.e. He's just flirting with me, he is trying to truly hurt me, he is being playful, etc.) and you will make a response to pull away from the pinch followed by maybe pinching me back.  All of that takes higher brain function.  If instead you are in a coma and I pinch you, the response may be nothing at all of you may just extend/flex all your limbs which is really just a primitive reflex and does not require you to consciously interpret the pinch in any way.  So to answer your question, I would say that the lack of higher cortical function means that a patient in a coma can NOT hear, feel, see, etc. anything.  At the same time it technically probably isn't wrong to say that they DO feel, hear, see but just cannot interpret these sensations in a meaningful way. </p>
<p><del>As far as the second part of your first question, most patients who come out of a coma are amnestic to the event and do not remember anything about their time in the coma.  So even if they really did &quot;feel&quot; or &quot;hear&quot; anything it doesn't really matter since it is generally not remembered.  Those that do recall events I would argue were probably not truly in a coma to begin with.  There are conditions that mimic comas such as the infamous &quot;locked in syndrome&quot; which occurs when you have a small stroke in a very bad brainstem location and paralyses you with the exception of certain eye movements.  Very interesting but horrible disease.</del></p>
<p>As far as surgery goes, if a patient is in a coma they will still use anesthesia.  I am not a surgeon or anesthesiologist so I cannot speak any further on that. </p>
<p>I hope that makes sense.  Keep in mind these are generalizations and each case will be different depending on what the cause of a coma is.  There are no rules in medicine and diseases do not read the textbooks.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I've gotta take issue with your 2nd paragraph as I was in a deep coma for 3 weeks and remember quite a bit of my experience. To say that anybody who claims they remember their experiences wasn't <strong>really</strong> in a coma is to exchange an opportunity to learn from that experience for stubborn and smug ignorance. </p>
<p>It seems a lot of people in this thread (and in life generally) do not know that there are multiple levels of consciousness, and that it would be better thought of as a spectrum, though whether it is continuous or categorical (like stages) is unknown. </p>
<p>At the deeper levels of a coma, no, you do not have sensory awareness and cannot remember much of anything. I cannot, for instance, remember the beginning stages of my coma. My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale" target="_blank">GCS</a> score was too low, and presumably the brain structures (hippocampus for LTM) responsible for memory were not functioning properly, if at all. </p>
<p>But later in the middle of my coma, my GCR score was starting to rise and I certainly remember some sensations, people (nurses &amp; doctors), and even thoughts I had. This was all while I was still very much in a coma. </p>
<p>I would also ask you to keep in mind that when you say there are no rules or you can't make generalizations about things like this, that itself is a generalization. There are definitely common rules for what determines the various levels of consciousness, or when memories are able to form and when they aren't. These things are remarkably similar in people, it's only when you explore the idiosyncrasies of an individuals personality that you find great differences. These things are knowable, and someday we will know the &quot;rules&quot; for what exactly makes one case different from the next. If no &quot;rules&quot; or bounded explanations could be made from people's brain functions I wouldn't be studying cognitive neuroscience. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Veterinary emergency/crit care tech perspective here, so not human medicine, but anesthesia is still administered. Most of my comatose patients still have indicators they are not sedated (eye position, pain withdraw, postural reflexes) when they're not under the influence of anesthesia. You base your anesthesia on reflex responses and go from there. Always presume perception of pain. It's not somewhere you'd want to guess they can't feel it when they're aware and sensing pain. Ketamine is a paralytic and was used for a long time in surgery as the only &quot;anesthetic&quot; adminstered, but the patient was aware of what was happening, could feel all of it, and couldn't move or respond. Scarier still is that when they stopped using it as single-modal anesthesia in adults, they continued to use it for years in children because it was believed that children weren't as able to feel pain and babies were completely unable to sense pain. I'm glad we've gotten past this point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, for sharing this. My aunt died on Saturday morning, and reading this helps to shed light on what her last days might have been like. The friends and family thought that she was alert or aware of her surroundings, but I suspected that when I visited, she was either asleep or unconscious.</p>
<p>It was a horrible sight. Even though your words don't exactly comfort me, just having a clearer perspective on her situation helps me.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may be wrong on this but I was under the impression that being aware of conversations only occurs in medically induced comas, which aren't really comas at all.  Real comas occur due to damage to the brain, making consciousness and awareness impossible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern medicine is only as good as the medicine that came before it. It's not perfect, but it gradually improves with every expected and unexpected result or accidental discovery. This may be something that researchers should look into more, now that we've advanced enough to treat these kinds of neurological issues. These kinds of one-in-a-million events frequently help improve our understanding of the human body and medicine in general. We need only strive to improve, and modern medicine will follow suit.</p></div>		</li>
