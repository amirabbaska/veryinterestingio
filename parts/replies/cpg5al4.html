<p>Definitely - it's not even close to being an accurate portrayal, and a lot of artistic license has been applied. However, the portrayal from low orbit - specifically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=w8I25H3bnNw#t=270" target="_blank">at about 4:30 in</a> shows about what a highly reflective surface in orbit would look as opposed to a diffuse one. </p>
<p>The difference at that point is largely one of scale and accuracy/material properties: because of the nature of specular reflections, light reflected off of a highly reflective surface is going to appear to fall off significantly less than that reflected off of a diffuse surface because it scatters less. This analogous to how a laser is able to illuminate (and appears brighter) at a much greater distance than that of an incandescent light bulb: the emitted photons of light are spread across a much smaller area, and thus do not spread as much over distance.</p>
<p>It is also likely that the reflection of the Earth would be significantly more prominent than it is today if the surface of the Moon was smooth enough. You can already see light reflected off of the Moon (earth shine) during certain phases, it would simply be a matter of the light being scattered less. Might take a telescope, but it's theoretically feasible in any case.</p>

<p>Not sure what you mean here, but I don't think it's quite true. The people who made the video positioned the Moon closer to the Earth simply so you could actually see the reflection. In it's existing orbit, the difference between adjacent surface normals is enough to ensure that it is highly improbable the Earth would actually intersect any of the light reflected off the Moon.</p>
<p>If the Moon was still a continuous sphere, however, that wouldn't be the case.</p></div>		</li>
