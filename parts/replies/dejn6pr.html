			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>short answer:</strong> because it manipulates the part of our brain that evolved to be able to discern someone's emotions through their &quot;vocal notes&quot; they use when speaking</p>
<p>music is mathematically satisfying. the frequencies line up in ways that sound consonant, and relax and effect us.</p>
<p>the extremely mathematically consonant major chord (described as sounding &quot;happy, joyful, triumphant&quot;) is different than the more mathematically dissonant minor chord (sad, serious, scary)</p>
<p>before instruments were invented, the human voice was the first instrument. you can tell someone's general mood by the &quot;notes&quot; they talk in, even if you can't understand their language. for example, aubrey plaza's character from parks and rec speaks with different &quot;notes&quot; than mindy kaling's character from the office. people who don't speak english would still be able to discern the characters general moods and emotions through their voice music.  </p>
<p>how can you discern &quot;oh wow, I'm so excited..&quot; said sarcastically, from &quot;oh wow, I'm so excited!&quot; said enthusiastically?  because the &quot;voice music&quot; the speaker uses when they say it.</p>
<p>people first spoke in &quot;voice music&quot; that our brains recognized in order to discern their mood, and making music with instruments is hijacking and manipulating that evolved brain circuit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the only correct response. The rest of this thread is missing the actual question. Emotional response to music is an unintended consequence of the mechanisms through which we respond to speech (for social reasons). There exists a function in our brains that evolved to map sounds to emotions. This function evolved to operate in a certain way specifically within the specific manifold of sound that contains socially significant patterns. This function is unbounded, however, so it also maps sounds that lie very far away from this manifold, even though it didn't necessarily evolve with this intention. Music is to this function as pareidolia is to the function in our brain that maps spatial patterns to facial emotions. The same rules that allow you to discern whether someone is angry or sad allow you to &quot;hallucinate&quot; these emotions in otherwise meaningless patterns of sound, which we affectionately call &quot;music&quot;. </p>
<p>If you view emotions as orthogonal axes then when we create music we are essentially constructing an optimization problem that seeks to find the pattern of sound that maximizes the output of this function along some of these axes. The entire human creative process is then a sort of genetic algorithm solving this non-convex optimization problem.</p>
<p>Frankly I wish there was more research on music from this perspective, but it requires an unlikely marriage of neuroscience, abstract mathematics, psychology and music expertise, so I understand why it's scarce.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unfortunately the jury is still out on the gory details as far as I know. We know that music affects our <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0070156" target="_blank">psychobiological stress system</a> through the release of various hormones like endorphins and cortisone.

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the top theories is that humans had to learn to recognise notes before we could develop speech. The first languages might of been partly musical, like song birds.
Their are universal cross cultural constants in the songs people sing to children and there are musical notes being repeated instinctly by infants as they learn to speak.
So recognising (and responding) to &quot;musical notes&quot; may be a behavioural adaptation like our pattern recognition skills.
Would love a time machine to see how early homo's respond to basic melodies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah seems like OP wants to know the evolutionary biology behind it, not a philosophical answer. This should be really easy to answer in an ELI5 fashion without resorting to metaphores too.</p>
<p>AFAIK after a lot of googling, nobody knows for sure because many explanations might be true. A study also says animal brains react to music much like humans which means it PROBABLY isn't the music we've adapted to enjoying because animals can't make music but enjoys it too.</p>
<p>A study seems to claim that our brain likes rhytm and expecting a sound and getting it because in nature that means nothing unexpected is happening and makes it easier to react when some unexpected sound pops up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really begging a far more complex and philosophical question into why we are conscious and thus why we impart emotional value to many different things which we experience. This sort of varied meaning to all of us serves no true mechanical purpose and that's what makes it so baffling; it can't really be explained in any form of mechanical terminology that we are able to use throughout neuroscience and biology typically. There's a philosopher named Danial Chalmers who has recently become quite popular for his &quot;hard problem&quot; hypothesis concerning consciousness and our emotional responses to stimuli, of you search him on YouTube there are quite a few great lectures that he has on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Musician here. I think part of the answer may be that it's so simple and complex at the same time, allowing us to get into it very easily. Anyone can tap their beat to the music, especially if they feel it. Hit something to that beat and you're participating. It's very inclusive. I think it's built in to us because its auditory. Most of us rely on this sense probably the second most I would guess. You can trace it back to listening for predators or prey in the woods. When something gets louder it gets more intense, you can feel it because it taps into our primal nature. Rhythmic music was the first music to come about, just banging on stuff, everyone participating in the beat. Like a giant drum circle. It then evolved to have melodies over the beat and then finally harmony to support the melodies. It just grew from there. I could go on forever even though I don't have all the answers. Sorry for the run on thoughts but this is what came immediately to mind. I gotta cut it off somewhere so I think here</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's way deeper than that I think. It has to be. I was part of the rave culture of the 90's and experienced the effect a beat (so not specifically music but that's splitting hairs) has on a person. I've noticed that both on drugs and not, dancing to a beat has a very peculiar effect on people, it can definitely make a person enter a trance like state. It's powerful, particularly in a crowd. I remember thinking at the time that this had to be the effect of what a lot of older tribal music, (which I think is very beat oriented) was about. Music is a drug, or it has the same effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since the appreciation of music is so universal, I have theorized that music may have actually played a role in our evolution.  If the basics of music were around 100,000-ish years ago, its possible that the ones who felt the music the most were those who were more likely to procreate.  This is still true in certain social circles today. So it's easy to imagine that if music was a central piece to the night life where your group of people were around a fire rocking out, then the people who were best at making it, dancing to it, etc. were seen as more attractive, and basically got laid more.  This evolutionary advantage would then get spread into the total population over time.  </p>
<p>I've never seen any formal research on this topic, but to me the theory seems very plausible.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be able to give you some perspective as a musician and user of psychedelics. Let's see what comes out:</p>
<p>What's happening during a psychedelic experience is that parts of you brain are communicating that don't normally talk to each other directly. This can lead to things like synesthesia, where your senses get crossed or mixed together (hearing color or colorful shapes is a common one). According to Dr. Carhart-Harris at Imperial College London, one of the very few people who is currently allowed to study LSD, &quot;Normally our brain consists of independent networks that perform separate specialised functions, such as vision, movement and hearing - as well as more complex things like attention. However, under LSD the separateness of these networks breaks down and instead you see a more integrated or unified brain.&quot; -
<a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_11-4-2016-17-21-2" target="_blank">http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_11-4-2016-17-21-2</a></p>
<p>Now what this means for you and I is that an experience on LSD is much more present than normal waking consciousness. We become much more involved and interested in the experience. It sort of gets you back to the feeling of being a child where you've just started to take in and make sense of the world, long before we start taking it for granted. The experience becomes more meaningful because more of &quot;you&quot; is involved. I could never explain the experience, mostly because it's a very personal thing, but I like the phrase &quot;the felt presence of direct experience.&quot; Essentially, it lets you visit the feeling of enlightenment for a while.</p>
<p>If you pay attention to your surroundings right now, what you see probably are labels and names of things. A table, a glass, a computer. What people tend to realize on a large enough dose of a psychedelic is that what we call things isn't what they are at all, and in fact nothing is separate from anything else like we think it is. We name and separate things in order to make things easy to talk about. So that &quot;felt presence of direct experience&quot; is to me, feeling the immediate happening of the universe as something that is all happening right now and that I am as much a part of as anything else, not something &quot;else&quot;. I am a wave in the cosmic ocean, as you are. Everything is it's own crest of a different wave, and waves are something the whole ocean is doing. They are not separate from the ocean.</p>
<p>So to bring it back to music... music allows me to play with simulating or sharing experiences through storytelling, in the same way that a book or poem does. You understand the language to an extent that you can play with it and make believe, and the better command of the language you have, the more riveting and gripping a story you can tell. Music is a language, and so you can build an emotional story the very same way if you understand what sounds create what what feeling and how sounds relate to each other. When you're first learning a language, you can say really basic things like &quot;green&quot; and &quot;Truck&quot; and the more you get into it and the more you assimilate it, the more intricate and nuanced things you can express.</p>
<p>Here's a personal favorite of mine. This guy has an unbelievable command of music as a language and the physical ability to bring it into the world. He plays with shapes and colors and turns them into an emotional journey, and the best part is he's alive right now!: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ptq5Fu4Xiy8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ptq5Fu4Xiy8</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure was interesting to me. As an experienced user of LSD, can you explain some feelings I had during my first (and so far, only) trip? I'll preface this by saying I'm normally a very introverted person, who prefers to be alone most of the time and doesn't really like most people. When I was tripping I was with 2 of my friends, and we were having a blast hanging out, going on nature walks, listening to music, things like that. Then at one point, while I was still very much in an altered state, they had to leave me alone to work on a school project they forgot about. I tried to relax and listen to Hendrix like I normally would with weed, but for some reason when I was alone I felt this deep sense of discomfort. It was almost impossible to describe, akin to paranoia but also close to panic. It was a deep-seated feeling that something was wrong I guess, but it it all went away when I was with them. It was like for the first time in my life I had to be with people, and for some reason it had to be someone experiencing the same thing as me. Is there a reason for this? Would it happen again if I tried tripping again? That's one of the main reasons I've not gone back to it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that feeling but I can't tell you what it means to you. That's for you to digest. I can't recommend anybody try LSD because of how illegal and unregulated it is, you don't know how strong it is, what else is in it, where it came from or anything like that. But, we're all adults, so we're able to do our own homework and get to a point where we feel comfortable in that state of consciousness, or not. I can't tell you what would happen if you did it again because it's always different. I know a good way to have a bad trip is to try to recreate good trips. If you're going to do anything, listen to people who spent a lot of time in that world. People like Alan Watts, Ram Dass, Terence McKenna, Aldous Huxley... and show an incredible amount of respect to whatever you take. A lot of people consider psychedelics to be much like religious sacrament and the experience to be communication with whatever you want to call god. This is why I do them alone most of the time. To me, they are not recreational drugs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know what you mean. Its metaphorically looking off of a cliff at a bad trip. You are either going to fall or stay up. Its such a profoundly deep feeling of anxiety. If you tried mushrooms, they are well known to cause this quite often. If you got it from LSD, this is much rarer, but not impossible. It happened because your friends left you. You must have been anxious about being by yourself, and thinking what your friends were doing away from you. Psychedelics cause you to over-analyse everything. </p>
<p>If you want to trip again, start with a small dose, maybe half a tab of acid. Then work your way up to a tab when you feel comfortable. This is what I did when I had a horribly bad mushroom trip. Next time I did them I started with a tiny dose, then worked back up to normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just a casual user, but it sounds like anxiety to me. I would guess that it was because you were alone for the first time in the trip. Changes of setting have a strong effect on the trip. It's one half of Timothy Leary's &quot;set and setting&quot;. I hardly get anything like that anymore since I take something before I take acid which kills a lot of anxiety, but before I did that it always helped to change where I was, or simply comfort myself in the fact that it's a psychoactive drug that's doing this to me and it would eventually end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm about to tell you a small story about my first time doing an substantial amount of acid. For the longest time, I could never quite get down the guitar part in the first verse of one of my favorite songs ever called Tom Waits by The Fall of Troy (named after the Tom Waits song called &quot;The Fall of Troy&quot;). </p>
<p>Anyways this song is notoriously chaotic once it's reached the first verse, and I could never quite hear exactly what was happening until I was on acid. It's such a fucking amazing feeling of euphoria when your brain makes connections like this. I giggled like a fucking school girl when I heard it. </p>
<p>Music on acid is like hearing music for the first time. I see so much of the music that I like differently now that I've listened to them in acid. Literally a life changing experience. </p></div>		</li>

<p>When I had a 1000ug trip, my SO had me listen to Shpongle. It's not for everyone, but definitely great imo. My brain was able to pick out all these layers in each song, and listen to it at the same time. I remember being dumbfounded by it because it sounded incredible and it was all so clear.
