			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this. It was indeed zircon crystals that they used. It wasn't explained that different isotopes of lead are produced by the decay of uranium. </p>
<p>And, given that they are, i don't see why they couldn't separate the different isotope levels like you suggest. </p>
<p>It turned out that they were detecting the massive amounts of lead in the atmosphere due to lead in petrol/gasoline. And this lead to it being banned as a fuel additive. </p>
<p>I think I'll need to sit down with some paper and sketch this out to better understand, but you've gone a long way to explaining it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah! Well there you go then. Glad to have been of help.</p>
<p>Also to be kept in mind that Pb-Pb is also a thing, much more complex and finnicky, and sometimes produces paradoxical results such as &quot;future ages&quot; in some settings such as Mississippi-Vally-type deposits ... . This method is not used on zircons, but on lead-rich minerals such as galena and can be usefull in provenance studies. It is quite sensitive to environmental contamination such as fuel-born lead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up Clair Patterson.  He's the guy who figured this all out.  It's a great story.  They should make a movie about him some day.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>His story is really interesting. And well told in Cosmos. (it's on Netflix, everyone should watch it!) </p>
<p>I'm <em>still</em> not sure I understand how the dating process works. I still can't get my head around how he <em>knew</em> his original measurements of lead had to be too high. Surely that would just tell him that there was more uranium to begin with, and make his estimate for the age of the earth wrong.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good explanation, but 208Pb is the product of the 232Th decay chain. 204Pb is the only nonradiogenic isotope. </p></div>		</li>
