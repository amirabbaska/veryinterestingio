<p>who builds things like the Large Hardron Collider?</p>

<p>Lots of engineers and accelerator physicists.</p>

<p>I mean, are there dual major Physicist/Electrical Engineers that do this?</p>

<p>For a job this big, each individual subsystem is compartmentalized, and given a dedicated team of physicists and/or engineers to assemble it. For example, you'll have EEs in charge of the power supplies, RF engineers in charge of the cavities, cryogenics engineers in charge of all the cryo stuff which is needed to keep the magnets and SRF cavities superconducting. Then there are accelerator physicists to make sure all the beamline elements are placed in the optimal way. There are alignment people who make sure everything is very precisely aligned according to the technical drawings handed down from the accelerator physicists who design the thing.</p></div>		</li>
