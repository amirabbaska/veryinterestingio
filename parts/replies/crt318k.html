			<div class="markdown"><p>I know some people have tried to push flammability limits to extremes using heat exchangers and porous media.  Unfortunately I never learned much about that - maybe you know someone working on such things.  Anyway, with some active management of the cooling side of things and control over the reactant temperatures, I feel like you could push flame temperature extremely low.  For what it's worth, I figure it still counts as combustion if it would go into thermal runaway were you to &quot;let go&quot; of the heat management.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't heard of any of that work off the top of my head, but I have heard of (and done research on) using diluent to lower flame temperatures.  So for example if you mixed additional nitrogen, helium, steam, etc... with fuel and air, that diluent is just along for the ride but will contribute nothing to the heat release.  So it'll take energy to heat it to the flame temp, but will not release energy.  There's obviously a limit here tho, as too much will make the flame very long and more of a volumetric reaction, by slowing down chemical kinetics, reducing the flame temp, and allowing for larger heat losses.  For a given chemistry (say methane, air, and steam) you could calculate which ratio of fuel, air, and diluent would still ignite but would have the lowest flame temp.  This calculation would take a long time however.  This is the reason why there is no straightforward answer to OP's question... you'd need to do a very tough calculation on a huge selection of possible fuels, oxidizers, and diluents.</p></div>		</li>
