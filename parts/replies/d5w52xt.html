Like as in I see something when I look at a painting and people can see that with their eyes closed on recall? I never see anything at all. I can think of a 'scene' etc. I don't see it. Blackness. Darkness. Nothing. </p>
<p>I feel like I'm broken and missing out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you 'hear' things in your head, like a song or memory or something? Do you not 'see' things in a similar way? A similar thing happens with my wife, and she was blown away by the idea that people can see things in their head. There's a still-being-studied condition called <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/health-34039054" target="_blank">Aphantasia</a> that describes those who  can't see things in their head, though not much is known about it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(Not OP) I do see in a similar way... but only because I can't hear things in my head either! lol I imagine the process is similar in some way, but with hearing.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that I dream normally. I've had incredibly vivid dreams, in fact. Not only that, but sometimes when I'm starting to fall asleep I get images or sounds in my mind (called Hypnagogic images/sounds). Sometimes briefly and faintly, sometimes very vividly. So I know that I am able to experience these inner sensory experiences, but for some reason, not while fully conscious.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And get kind of depressed. You people who can see in your mind don't know how lucky you are! It sounds like the coolest most fun and interesting thing in the world (I'm fascinated by dreams, lucid dreams, consciousness, etc. So that may explain my fascination). I know aphantasia is a new concept, but man I hope someone finds a cure or treatment or whatever before I die. I've found a couple posts in random blogs from people who claim they couldn't visualize at all and learned by constant practice. I tried a bit but didn't see much progress (if any), I don't know if I didn't do it right, or long enough, or maybe it doesn't work for everyone. <a href="http://unchainmybrain.com/learn-to-visualize/" target="_blank">This</a> is the one I tried.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is amazing to read about because I am completely the opposite. Everything in my mind that I picture I can enter in 3D, spin and/or rotate, zoom in and out, as well as fast foward and rewind. It happens with photos and paintings as well.</p>
<p>I can &quot;climb into&quot; Van Gogh's Starry Night and see it like a 3D cinemagraph that I can move the camera around like a video game. I can be in the movie in my mind, independent of the camera. When I get in a reading groove with a fiction book I stop actually seeing the words on the page and a movie of the story starts in my head and I follow that.</p>
<p>I can't get truly lost. I may not know exactly where I am but I've navigated via mental Google Earth in my head since the 80s and can always head the right direction until something is familiar enough to link where I was to the map I already know.</p>
<p>People are like the models in the character creation screen of an rpg. When I remember them I can rotate, zoom, change clothes or hair or whatever. Memories of them are replayed like a movie I have complete bullet time like control over everything.</p>
<p>When a song gets stuck in my head it can be there for weeks in the background. If I'm trying to tune it out its usually a bit of the chorus or a particular verse that constantly pops up between concious thoughts, but if I run with it full brain it's the whole song, instruments included, from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Downsides though. I suck ass at translating those pictures and movies back into things that involve math which makes people think I don't understand something because I can't do the calculations even though I can see it plain as day in my mind. Also I tend to notice a lot of details about situations that I will use to reconstruct the situation I was in at the time in my mind as part of my normal recollection, but if I share them they are either seen as irrelevant or creepy to others.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Brains are unique and weird in many different ways and that's quite interesting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there an opposite for this? I don't have a photographic memory as defined by films but sometimes I feel like my vision is almost taken over and into my head so I see memories as if I am actually doing those things again. I have to make a conscious effort to &quot;snap out of it&quot;. Or is this normal and I'm overthinking it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the only reason why I can't &quot;really&quot; see images when I imagine something but only... it feels like snapshots that fade away very quickly, is that the eye gives a constant stimulus while &quot;imagination&quot; is only a single &quot;burst&quot; of information? That means if there was a device/brain function that could keep those &quot;imagination&quot;-stimuli up and repeat them just like the eyes give constant stimuli, one could fixate the picture and actually &quot;see&quot; what we are imagining?</p>
<p>I mean it is hard enough to imagine a picture. But if we could make a snapshot of it and constantly feed it into the visual cortex you could actually observe whatever you could imagine. Of course we can't do it now, but just as a thought experiment, did I understand it right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a real life experiment you could just close your eyes and imagine something. See if the difference in light and visual stimulus makes the images last longer or seem more vivid.</p>
<p>This doesn't exactly answer your question, but you might be interested to learn that visual memory recall and the ability to &quot;picture&quot; things operates on a kind of continuum. It sounds like you are like me, where recalled images can only be seen briefly and it's hard to make out a lot of detail. </p>
<p>Some people are very, very good at visual recall (although no one truly has a &quot;photographic&quot; memory) and no surprise, a lot of times they tend to be very talented artists. Although it's not necessarily a prerequisite, but based on my experience I'd bet there's a nice correlation in visual art that focuses on &quot;flatness&quot;, and iconic or compositional elements over more &quot;realistic&quot; works that utilize perspective and emphasize lighting and detail.</p>
<p>I have poor visual recall and as such have trouble intuitively translating spacial projections in a way that doesn't look off, as well as problems with human proportion and such, but I've been an active flyer maker for years and tend to focus on textures, iconic text and geometrically interesting composition.</p>
<p>Some people actually have no visual recall whatsoever. A lot of them make it really far into life before even realize that wen people talking about seeing an image in their mind, they're not just being metaphorical. Apparently some are calling it &quot;aphantasia&quot; now.

<p>This is my own visual recall, too. Quick flashes of detail, a blurry abstract feeling of completeness, then on to something else. It's the same when I read: I don't imagine detailed scenes - I just sort of let my brain fuzz in the outlines and don't hold on any one image for long.</p></div>		</li>
