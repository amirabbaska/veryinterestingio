<p>Alcohol percentage is generally quite accurate (it has to be, for government taxation purposes). The behaviour of the yeasts used is well documented through analytical processes. This can then be checked against the change in specific gravity of the liquid as it ferments. That basically shows how much sugar was consumed, which is directly related to the amount of Alcohol produced.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I always thought the change in specific gravity was directly related to the ratio of ethanol to water, and nothing to do with the sugars? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly sugars being processed and turned into CO2 and ethanol being a cause of change in the fermenting liquid's gravity (at least I'm like 95% sure).</p>
<p>Ethanol to water ratio is the cause of that mostly in distilled alcohol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the ethanol is resulting from the fermentation of the sugars so it's both. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specific gravity is a measure of density. The specific gravity of water is about 1, varying slightly with temperature. Alcohol is less dense than water, with a specific gravity of ~0.8, so in principle if we dissolve ethanol in pure water we will end up with something less dense than water as in <a href="http://www.separationprocesses.com/CourseWare/Experiments/Property01.htm" target="_blank">this chart</a>. But this only works if we know we have pure water and pure alcohol and nothing else.</p>
<p>Homebrew calculators are essentially accounting for the fact that sugars (more dense than water) are being turned into ethanol (less dense than water). The final density of the solution doesn't matter, what's important is how much the density CHANGED over the course of fermentation- because that change is due to sugars becoming alcohol.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brewersfriend.com/2011/06/16/alcohol-by-volume-calculator-updated/" target="_blank">This page</a> gives more details. One important thing to note is that the relationship is non-linear, even though we are using linear equations to estimate alcohol, so this system is not very accurate. At large commercial scale I believe more accurate methods like refractometers or HPLC are used.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Accurate to ~ 0.05% alcohol the way we analyse it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually did this in an undergrad lab a couple of years ago. We determined capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin levels via chromatography (LC or HPLC) with a UV-Vis detector. </p>
<p>For UV-Vis, it can be destructive if the sample isn't easily resolved in the liquid or solid state. For a pepper, you'd have to break it down and do a solid liquid extraction to get the capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is you don't know much about UV-Vis. Absorbance peaks tend to be linearly responsive to concentration within certain ranges. If you build a calibration curve using various dilutions of your target compound, you can get a very accurate result of the amount of that compound in a sample. In fact, UV-Vis is way better at quanititation than identification.</p></div>		</li>
