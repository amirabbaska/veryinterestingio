<p>Some cell phone carriers have &quot;HD calling&quot; which is VoIP (it uses data)</p>

<p>That's not true. HD calls are just like regular calls, but with a higher sampling rate. The network and both phones have to support it for it to work. </p>
<p>Source: I helped to implement the very first version of it on the Blackberry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I know next to nothing about how cellular networks function, only computer networks and VoIP phone systems connected to said networks - I'll strike that part of my comment.  I just assumed that HD calling was a type of VoIP.  So with that knowledge, is cellular data not broken up into packets like it is in normal networks with TCP/IP?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, it's been about 10 years since I dealt with the network protocols, so I'm a bit rusty. As I recall, cellphone calls are circuit-switched (as opposed to packet-switched) which gives a lower-latency connection but limits the maximum number of simultaneous calls a tower can handle.</p>
<p>I think the newer standards like LTE have no circuit-switching capabilities, so phone calls would be packetized. I'm sure they distinguish between phone and regular &quot;data&quot; usage though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;HD&quot; part can apply to any sort of voice communication. It's just sampling at a higher rate to capture higher frequencies. I was just pointing out that HD calls on the cellphone network don't need to resort to a completely different protocol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Broadcast engineer here and everything /u/PlaidDragon has said is absolutely correct. In my building I have at least 6 other ways of getting crystal clear audio, but you (as a random person at home) dont have that kit. So we have to use something you already have, and that is a phone line. I don't know of any kit available to broadcasters that can receive 'HD' calls, i'm sure once its available everyone will be buying it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha I might have some insight, if you're in for a story.</p>
<p>I live in a small town and work at a small town radio station.  We have this old very well-known, well-liked car dealership owner named Jim who is a regular customer at our station.  I would consider him the best car salesman I've ever seen/heard.  He knows how to make people get excited by knowing when to yell, when to speak normally, and when to just talk with more enthusiasm.  Jim can make you want to buy a car even if you aren't looking to buy one because he has been doing it most of his life and it's his passion.  </p>
<p>Car salesmen I hear on bigger radio stations (and on TV) from bigger cities seem to yell way too much. I think they are trying too hard to sound excited.  They don't know how to strike that balance that Jim knows how to.  I (and I assume you) I find this to be exhausting and annoying - doing the opposite of what they intend to do.  I think it may be due to inexperience, but that's just speculation.</p>
<p>Long story short, they are just trying to sound excited in order to make the potential customers excited, but suck at it.</p></div>		</li>
