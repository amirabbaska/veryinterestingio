<p>Could geological sequestration be done using trees/biomass as a carbon source?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Geological sequestration projects involve pumping CO2 down a borehole, so plant matter doesn't work for that.  You're probably thinking of something like a landfill where you bury a bunch of trees, but a lot of that carbon will still find its way into the atmosphere over decades and centuries because of decomposition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I mean is couldn't you burn (or otherwise process) the trees/plants to get the CO2?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Peat moss forms in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anoxic_waters" target="_blank">anoxic water</a> and stays there for centuries without decomposing. Dissolved oxygen sucked out of a lake prevents decay.</p>
<p>Sink mature trees to the bottom of the ocean. All that CO2 started underground protected from oxygen. Return it there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been small projects demonstrating the feasibility, but at the moment there is no economic incentive.  You need a carbon tax (or a carbon cap-and-trade system similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_Rain_Program" target="_blank">the one implemented for sulphur dioxide</a> ) in order for sequestration to be profitable.</p>
<p>One of the first places it would be implemented is at power plants, where the CO2 can be captured more easily.  But again, power companies will only do that if it saves money and is cost-effective.</p></div>		</li>
