			<div class="markdown"><p>Why couldn't you make a huge lens that focuses the light into a small point? Couldn't the single point get hotter? I feel like you could focus all the light thats in phase into a single point and produce enough energy to make something hotter, but I don't know enough about the relation between heat storage and light production. </p>
<p>Also, is this for all sources of light or only blackbodies? Because if you have a light source that mostly only produces in a small band of wavelengths then that means you couldn't make things very hot using such a source, even though it may be just as bright. </p>
<p>Though i suppose brightness is a poor mental model to use here, since when dealing with energy it doesn't matter if we can see it or not. </p>
<p>I may have just convinced myself through my own post. Whatever, I'll leave it up anyway. </p>
<p>edit: i got it now, thanks guys! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the single point is hotter than the source, it starts radiating light back at the source. A lens is a passive device, remember - it takes no energy to operate, so the light must flow equally in both directions. If you heat something with a magnifying glass under the sun until it's as hot as the sun, it starts glowing with the same temperature and now sends an equal amount of heat <em>back to the sun</em>. Similarly, if you used a magnifying glass to heat something with the light of the moon, as soon as the thing you were heating is hotter than the moon, it reflects the same amount of energy back at the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue I have with this explanation is that radiative power is defined per unit area. A 1m^2 area the temperature of the sun will emit less thermal radiation than a 2m^2 square area at the same temperature. If you captured all the light from the 2m^2 area and focused it onto the 1m^2 area it would be emitting less than it was absorbing and you could heat it to a higher temperature. Is there something I'm missing here?</p>
<p>EDIT: Realised my error, thanks to /u/IHireWriters for making a couple of things click. My error was in forgetting that thermal emission occurs equally in all directions and this limits how tightly you can focus the light. If you placed your lens very close to the larger area you would capture most of the light from it but you would not be able to focus the light tightly at all, because it would be travelling in so many different directions when it reached the lens. If you moved the lens further away you would capture light that is much more parallel and so could be focused more tightly, but you would also be capturing a lot less light. If you could capture 100% of the light from the large plate and focus it onto the small one then you would be able to heat it to a higher temperature, but this isn't possible with any realistic optical system. </p>
<p>Hope this helps anyone who is stuck at the same point as I was. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't make sense. Firstly, the energy radiated back would only consist of black body radiation in the infrared spectrum corresponding to the temperature, while the energy absorbed can come both from the infrared and the visible part of the spectrum (and possibly higher frequencies if they are reflected). On the other hand, the radiation from the moon most obviously consists of reflected visible sunlight. I don't know how much energy moon radiates in the infrared, but its reflected visible light bears no relation to its temperature and there is no reason we can't heat things hotter with it.</p>
<p>Secondly, the surface of the moon during a moon day heats as high as 123Â°C, which is more than enough for any practical earth heating, more than enough to boil water. I don't expect anyone could boil water with collected moonlight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For light sources, even if you captured all the emitted energy and focused it to a point, it could never get hotter (unless more heat loads are added) as it would only approach the same temperature towards an equilibrium (the focused point will be radiating to the source at the same rate it is receiving).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law" target="_blank">Wein's displacement law</a> is for blackbodies yes, which is for objects that absorb and emit perfectly within any spectrum. In short, the object's material will dictate how well it absorbs and emits, which in a thermal system, also dictates how hot the object can get. An object with a high absorbtivity and low emissivity means it can't emit heat as fast as it receives, and will effectively keep getting hotter to reach equilibrium through radiation (since it is T^4). There are considerations for which materials that are part of the interaction, and in the sun's case, its a black body at 5778K emitting the most around the green wavelength. If the receiving object in question reflected green light (as most plants do to prevent cell damage), they will deny most of the energy, but still absorb the other wavelengths.</p>
<p>In this discussion, I think we're all assuming black body to black body, except the moon, which does emit like a black body,but it doesn't absorb like one, which is why it reflects some of the sunlight we see as moonlight. If the moon was a better or perfect mirror, it would reflect all sunlight, hence meaning it wouldn't absorb any becoming incredibly cold, but the reflected light could still be used to heat things. Ultimately meaning the moon temperature for this entire thread is pretty irrelevant.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A black body radiates energy. Let's just say that we have a surface that encompasses the entire body and captures then redirects that radiation with 100% efficiency to any size point.</p>
<p>If that point were focused properly, the radiative energy will transmit energy to the receiving body.  The thermal energy at that focal point will increase, raising that point's temperature, which will then conduct energy away to neighboring material, and eventually it will radiate energy back out.</p>
<p>We must assume the system eventually comes to a steady state.  The temperature at that point could very easily be at a higher temperature than the original radiating body.  But the surrounding material will be at a lower temperature and thus radiate less.  The total radiative flux from the receiving body would still be less than or equal to that of the source body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because a huge lens wouldn't focus onto a <em>point</em> anymore.</p>
<p>It is due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etendue" target="_blank">etendue</a>.</p>
<p>Think about it from the perspective of the sun.</p>
<p>The larger the lens, the larger the solid angle the lens occupies from perspective of the sun, and the less parallel the sun's rays are when entering the lens.
Thus they won't all focus at the same point anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you could use a honeycomb of lenses and perfect mirrors in a pure vacuum couldn't you.  </p>
<p>Edit: like, a giant dome of mirrors around the entire sun reflecting all the light such that all Ray's theoretically are focused on one point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was gonna say, a concave mirror with the sun shining on it can set stuff on fire but the surface of the mirror isn't as hot as the sun. Or do we not consider the surface of the mirror to be the object giving off the light? I have a physics final in 2 days that involves lenses and mirrors, I should probably know this shit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, the mirror isn't absorbing much light so it's temperature is more based on conduction and convection. </p>
<p>The &quot;source&quot; of light is still the sun or a lightbulb which in both cases involve making some material very hot, to the point it is emitting in the visible spectrum.</p></div>		</li>
