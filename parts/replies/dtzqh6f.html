			<div class="markdown"><p>how closely does centripetal force represent gravity though? I can see how it would feel the same for a person sitting against the outer wall, or hanging from the inner wall for example, but intuitively I think that things like throwing a ball would behave quite differently in this situation - at the very least the trajectory of the ball would change depending on the direction it is thrown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I came across <a href="https://www.artificial-gravity.com/sw/SpinCalc/" target="_blank">this website</a> probably 15 years ago, and still find myself going back every now and then.</p>
<p>A rotating torus with a radius of 80 meters is still going to be too small. The angular velocity is going to probably be too high; turning your head would make you nauseous.</p>
<p>A torus with 125 meter radius can simulate 0.5 g with a rotation rate of 1.9 revolutions per minute, which puts all the safety icons on that website in the green. </p>
<p>On the other hand, that torus, with a circumference of nearly 400 meters, is making a rotation nearly twice a minute. We probably don't have the materials to keep something like that together, which means you have to build a bigger torus that rotates more slowly.</p>
<p>Using centrifugal acceleration is something we can do to simulate gravity, but not until we're building much, much larger structures in orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did a bit of homework on this for a sci-fi project. There are three variables at play in the artificial gravity equation; acceleration, orbital period (the seconds it takes to make one revolution) and the radius out from the axis of rotation.</p>
<p>Acceleration (the desired gravity) can be as high or low as you want, depending on structural stresses and the other two variables.</p>
<p>The radius can be varied, but the key factor is different gravity experienced at the head and feet; you're running the same gravity calculation with two values for radius, even if that difference is just a few feet. Too large a disparity is expected to cause circulatory problems. </p>
<p>For the third variable, we <em>think</em> we have a good fixed value. Current theory suggests that 2RPM (or, a 30-sec orbital period) is the upper limit for speed before you start incurring a severe coriolis effect between the two inner ears, which experience different forces as you turn your head. Slower than that works just as well, but requires a much larger radius to achieve the same acceleration.</p>
<p>If I remember my schematics right, at 2 RPM, 80 meters of radius gets you ~0.5g. I'd have to check my notes again, however, so don't take that as fact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>80m is small, the bigger it is the better. One of the reasons is the uncomfortable feeling that the g on your feet will be higher than the g on your head, remember that standing on the centerfuge will mean your head will be on a smaller radius than your feet and with both having the same rotation speed, that artificial gravity on your feet will be higher..</p>
<p>How much higher ? That depends on the radius.. the smaller it is the bigger the different will be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the geometry and speed of the space station, if it's large and not rotating that quickly, it'll be a fair representation of uniform gravity. There is actually a paper (written at the level of university students) calculating the path of a ball in a rotating space station, <a href="https://search.proquest.com/docview/203894732?pq-origsite=gscholar" target="_blank">here</a> (not sure if you have access). Things can get...complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, but that assumes that the acceleration is universal, or at least linear. If you were on a rocket accelerating through space, then I think a thrown ball would behave just as it would on the ground, but rotation would be different when you factor in any movement apart from straight up/down.</p>
<p>Even straight up/down I can imagine a situation where you throw a ball &quot;upward&quot; to exactly reach the rotational centre, and the ball would go up and just never come down again. Your launch angle and velocity would need to be perfect, but it is possible, and would not be possible in natural gravity.</p></div>		</li>
