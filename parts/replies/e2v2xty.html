So, <a href="https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/road-trip-science-why-the-cars-open-rear-window-hurts-your-ears" target="_blank">not exactly peer reviewed research, but he found</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, although humans can’t truly hear that rear window noise, it certainly is powerful: it hits peaks of pressure of 100 pascals, <strong>equivalent to 130 decibels</strong>. There’s a good reason why our ears can’t stand it for long.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting, I have observed that the degree to which the pressure fluctuates can depend on the car.</p>
<p>For example, my old car was quite boxy and not very aerodynamic. I could drive with the windows down and not be effected by the fluctuations.
However, in my new car which is designed, as all cars are now, to be aerodynamic, opening the windows seems to really disturb the airflow passing over the car. As a result, more air seems to enter the cabin and cause great discomfort to the occupants. So I have to use the air con now to keep cool.</p>
<p>Just my thoughts.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I drive a 2011 Ford focus with flow rear (is that an adequate translation?), where the pressure and noise become unbearable at 60km/h and up. No problem whatsoever in a 2011 Renault Trafic or a 2000 something Mercedes sprinter 213cdi pick up. </p></div>		</li>
