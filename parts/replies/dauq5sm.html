<p>Why is cobalt the limiting factor? Do you have a source?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to what u/Jidairo said, Cobalt is also mostly found in politically unstable regions, so the price tends to fluctuate pretty heavily.  Its use is typically discouraged unless there is no alternative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mr. Robot has actually touched on this. The Democratic Republic of Congo is sitting on a very large supply of cobalt, and they already produce ~63,000 metric tons annually. I believe the show has hinted at proxy wars breaking out as nations fight for control over the mines, which is very possible scenario.</p>
<p>China, Canada, Russia, Australia, Philippines, Cuba, Zambia, South Africa and Brazil round out the top 10 cobalt producing countries, but each only outputs 2600-7200 metric tons, so a far cry from the DRC's production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only for Lithium Cobalt Oxide batteries.  Lithium Iron Phosphate is gaining ground, especially for stationary applications.  Teslas and the Bolt do use nickel rich cobalt anodes, but if cobalt becomes the limiting factor for EV batteries they could swap it out for a manganese solution.  IOW, alternatives for cobalt in lithium ion batteries are already gaining market share.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those two batteries are not interchangeable though, LCO is an energy cell with high specific energy. Whereas Lithium Iron Phosphate and Spinel cells are power cells with lower specific energies but higher current capabilities. EVs use power cells. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True.  LFP isn't ideal for EV applications because of the lower energy density.  Note that this hasn't stopped BYD from making a ton of buses and clawing out a leading position <a href="http://gas2.org/2015/12/28/byd-is-worlds-largest-ev-manufacturer/" target="_blank">in EV manufacturing</a>.  </p>
<p>Anyways I did preface my statement by limiting it to stationary applications - which is where LFP is starting to take over (at least at the grid scale).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lithium Iron Phosphate, while very safe, has a lower cell voltage than alternatives such as Lithium Manganese Oxide. Last I checked, LMO was a more common commercial battery material than lithium iron phosphate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cell voltage isn't that big a deal when you need large amounts of storage.  You're chaining cells together in the hundreds of thousands or more, so you're just changing exactly how they are ganged together to get your required output.</p>
<p>For stationary grid scale utility applications, Lithium Iron Phosphate is becoming the go-to chemistry.  A big part of that is BYD, but there are other suppliers going iron phosphate.  LFP is marketed as safer (which I don't see as important since even the &quot;unsafe&quot; battery chemistries are now incredibly safe) and it has longer cycle life.  But the nickel-rich cobalt batteries seem to closing the cycle life gap.  The big drawback for LFP is a slightly lower energy density, which hurts it for EVs.  That said, BYD supplies a ton of batteries for buses and other EVs in China.</p>
