			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer I was definitely expecting - I think it was a big deal at the time that, when he calculated what the speed of that oscillation should be, it exactly equaled the speed at which they had measured light. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that special relativity was essentially based solely on (1) the assumption that motion is relative, and (2) the <em>observed fact</em> that the speed of light is the same from all frames of reference. Maxwell showed how to theoretically explain that observed speed, but I didn't see his theory as underlying special relativity. If you're talking about general relativity, I have literally zero understanding of it, but if you're talking about special, maybe you can explain how Maxwell's equations figure in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right on those two assumptions, but (2) can also be derived <em>a priori</em> from Maxwell's equations without any additional experimental data.</p>
<p>When you rearrange the terms in Maxwell's equation, you find that EM waves travel at the speed of light. Then, when you do the same problem for a moving observer, the speed of waves remains unchanged! This remarkable discovery paved the theoretical path for Einstein's work on special relativity.</p></div>		</li>
