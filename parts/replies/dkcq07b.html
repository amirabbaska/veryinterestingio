<p>I think the variables/answers we're missing is at what points does population # impact meat demand, and how many of those units are within the % of people who don't eat meat, and at what rates are population vs % of vegetarians growing (comparatively)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends how you define &quot;eat meat&quot;.  Maybe of the 900 who eat meat, only 800 actually do because of cost.  Do the 100 who are too poor to afford meat count as meat eaters or not?  If it's no, then as global wealth increases you'd expect the percent of meat eaters to increase because they always wanted to eat meat, they just can now.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>No.  It's more expensive because vegetarians want to eat exotic and processed vegetables and fruits.</p>
<p>If a meat eater was trying for as varied a diet as a wealthy vegan, they'd be eating snow leopard, penguin, and sturgeon.  But poor meat eaters eat chicken.  No other meat, just chicken.  </p>
<p>That's like being a vegan and eating nothing but rice and beans.  Rice and beans is cheaper than chicken by a large margin.</p>
<p>Government subsidies have nothing to do with wealthy vegans' exotic tastes.</p></div>		</li>
