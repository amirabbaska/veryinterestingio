			<div class="markdown"><p>The phrase &quot;To whom it make concern...&quot;, is that correct?  Is the subject the person in
concern and should actually be &quot;who&quot; or is the subject &quot;it&quot; and&quot;whom&quot; is correct?<br />
Follow-up question: Why is it &quot;A unicorn&quot; and not &quot;An unicorn&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's based on the initial <em>sound</em> not letter. You pronounce it YOU-ni-corn. The word starts with a consonant sound, not a vowel sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;To whom it may concern&quot; is correct. The difference between who and whom is the same as between they and them. It's not &quot;To they it may concern&quot;, it's &quot;To them it may concern&quot;. It works the same as he and him, and she and her.</p>
<p>My guess on the unicorn thing is that the U in unicorn is not a pure vowel. There's a &quot;yuh&quot; sound there (I think it's called palatalization). That's to say that it's not pronounced &quot;oonicorn&quot;, and the &quot;yuh&quot; is a consonant. This is kind of why the English spelling system is bad, vowels don't work right. Nor do consonants for that matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We adopted our daughter from China about 3.5 years ago. She's 12 now and extremely awesome and trying so hard in school. Sometimes she'll ask me questions like &quot;Why is there an 'H' in 'Why'?&quot;<br />
The unicorn question has already been asked, too.<br />
The English language really is a disaster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can fix a lot of problems like these if you can read a sentence and identify what is the subject, verb, object, noun, etc.</p>
<p>Like with &quot;affect&quot; and &quot;effect&quot; which is the verb and noun form respectively. </p>
<p>American's aren't really taught grammar properly since we just learn how to talk/write naturally.</p>
<p>Personally, I didn't learn about the intricate details of grammar until I started learning a foreign language. You start learning about verb, adverb, participle, preposition, etc. You can then apply it to your native language. </p></div>		</li>
