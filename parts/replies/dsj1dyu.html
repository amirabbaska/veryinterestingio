<p>Edit- let's say we have a sieve inside of a bucket, and we add water to the sieve and it drains into the bucket at a rate of 1 liter every 15 minutes. The sieve and the bucket will have seperate volumes individually, however as a system (sieve and bucket) the volume is the same after adding the water regardless of how much time has passed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't get your point. He's asking why absorbing takes time but you feel INSTANTLY the satiety, you are telling him that it's because water absorbs instantly and that's not true at all. Neither does Na+ and if you put some of it in your mouth you will instantly feel thirsty</p></div>		</li>
