			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in Electronic Devices II in school, we spent the entire semester designing a 5 stage differential amplifier (gain&gt;=500) using the MOSFET. At the end of the semester, the professor tells us this is basically an op-amp. I thought that was pretty cool. I bring this up because I found out recently some engineers like to build their own op-amps because then they will always have a reference in case they aren't sure about an op-amp they are using. And they'll know exactly what certain properties are, such as the internal resistance between the two input pins, and the actual current running between them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it seems OP might be asking for more specific info about the actual compositional material and how the combine together and restrict/direct electron flow. Though, OP should be more specific. </p></div>		</li>
