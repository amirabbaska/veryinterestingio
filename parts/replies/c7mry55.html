			<div class="markdown"><p>For those of you who are interested, this actually touched upon my undergraduate research in psychology. The strengthening and weakening of these mental links during retrial is a phenomenon called retrieval induced forgetting (RIF) <a href="http://www.memorycontrol.net/abb2000.pdf" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>RIF occurs when you attempt to retrieve a target memory item. Related memory items that may interfere with the target memory are inhibited in order to facilitate the retrieval of the target. </p>
<p>I got excited because it's rare I get to take about my research haha. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the other day a friend and i made up a word game that uses a deck of cards where we would each draw a card, and our cards' suits corresponded with the kind of word we had to use to add (as consistently as possible) the &quot;next word&quot; of our story. Hearts were even-syllable words, clubs were words with two of the same consonant, yada yada.</p>
<p>This task proved incredibly difficult to perform, and i don't know why. Would you blame RIF? It came as quite a shock to both of us how challenging it was to, for instance, come up with a cohesive two-syllable word that would add to</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting! I'm glad you've provided so much information because I was wondering this as I prepared (barely) for finals last week.  I skim over my books for the first time typically the night before a test.. I always do well (usually getting anything from an 85/100 and up) by simply going with what my gut is telling me when taking the test (so long as they're multiple choice).  If on the other hand you asked me the answer to some abstract question that I <em>should</em> know the answer to because I've read it...I'm stumped.  This must be because I have awesome recognition and nearly-retarded free recall, haha.</p></div>		</li>
