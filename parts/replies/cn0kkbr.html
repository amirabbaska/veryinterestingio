			<p>If you qualify for a pell grant. Some of us fall into the bucket where our parents make just enough money not to qualify for much FinAid, but not actually enough to help us out.</p>		</li>

			<p>Pretty much the entire middle part of the country from Michigan to New Mexico. There are inland exceptions like parts of Austin. But generally this is true. <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Here's the alternative formula:<br><br>1. Choose an out-of-state school because you want to get away from your parents.<br><br>2. Take out loans to cover astronomical tuition costs.<br><br>3. Study something that you think sounds cool, regardless of job prospects.<br><br>4. Get mediocre grades but have a great social life.<br><br>5. Graduate with massive debt and no job because you have an unmarketable degree and mediocre grades.<br><br>Here's what I hear all the time: &quot;I don't want to study X because that career doesn't appeal to me.&quot; You know what else won't appeal to you? Being a waiter/waitress because you can't get a well-paying job with whatever cool degree you chose.<br><br>I don't blame anyone who made those choices. I think teachers, parents, guidance counselors, etc. failed our generation by encouraging them to do exactly those things. Hopefully there can be some form of debt relief for these kids, because the notion that people are going through life with 100K in private student loan debt is absurd.</p>		</li>
