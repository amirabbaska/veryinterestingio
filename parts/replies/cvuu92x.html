			<div class="markdown"><p>The earth has a mass of 5.972×10^24 kilograms. </p>
<p>It has a variable weight because it isn't on a planet. You could say that the force of attraction between it and the sun kind of gives it weight in the same way the force of attraction between you and the earth gives you weight, but that's not a useful scale of measurement, and is really just faffing about changing the definitions of things. </p>
<p>Edit: for funsies: if the earth were on the earth, and you used one earth as a reference, the earth would weigh something like 13,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 lbs. By unit analysis (convert kg to lbs., mass-&gt;force = mass • acceleration (gravitational pull of earth) aka weight).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost the correct answer. In this configuration, the weight of the earth (plus the top of the scale) is the same as the weight of the bottom of the scale. This is because weight is the downward force of one object in the other object's gravitational field. This means that the weight of A in B's field is the same as the weight of B in A's field, since the force is equal and opposite.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And to clarify an important point - the earth and the scale don't experience the same accelerations. Use Newton's second law: </p>
<p>m a_1 = G M m / R^2</p>
<p>and find the acceleration of the scale is</p>
<p>a_1 = GM/R^2</p>
<p>Conversely, the force of the earth is</p>
<p>m a_2 = G M m / R^2</p>
<p>So the acceleration of the earth is</p>
<p>a_2 = G m / R^2</p>
<p>Since M is the mass of the earth and m is the mass of the scale, a_2 is much much much smaller than a_1. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even simpler, using F=ma and Newton's third law (for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction) you know that the force exerted on the scale by earth is equal to the force exerted on earth by the scale. </p>
<p>So m_s <em> a_s = m_e </em> a_e </p>
<p>a_s / m_e = a_e / m_s</p>
<p>So the accelerations are only equal if the masses of the objects are equal, which we know they aren't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you asked about weight, so in a sense you ARE weighing the earth.  Like u/VeryLittle said, because of Newton's third law, the earth and the scale both exert the same gravitational force on each other.  So, if a scale weighs 10lb ON EARTH, you could say the earth weighs 10lb &quot;on the scale&quot;.  Remember lbs is a unit of force.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you put the scale upside down and you can still read it, wouldn't you get an accurate measurement of the scale itself? </p>
<p>This would be a great answer for a trick question: How do you make a scale weigh itself?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah! And that's a super profound point because it means the mass of the object is equal to the <em>active gravitational mass of the object!</em> It could have been possible that we lived in the universe where only half of the mass of an object contributed to the gravitational force, or that Newton's 3rd didn't apply and the two objects would experience forces of different magnitudes.</p>
<p>It's a great question that I might add to my quiz-question bank. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you mean by accurate, really.  Most scales are calibrated to offset the portion of the weight of the scale that could register on the scale itself.  So any adjustment would be subtracted from the displayed measurement of scale in this scenario, throwing it off (at least a little).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So an upsidedown scale has mass that provides a gravitational field to weigh the earth. That field is related to the mass of the scale itself. If the scale has a mass of 1kg, then it will be weighing the earth and telling us the earth is 1kg. That is obviously wrong. Or is it? Does it not just mean the scale needs recalibrating? What used to say &quot;1kg&quot; should now read as &quot;5.9x10^24&quot;? It's like the scale is sitting on a minuscule planet, with the earth on top of it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, the constant built into the scale has earth's mass baked in g=GM/r^2,  where M is the known mass of the Earth. In order to measure the mass of the Earth one would need to replace the mass of the Earth with the mass of the scale. </p></div>		</li>
