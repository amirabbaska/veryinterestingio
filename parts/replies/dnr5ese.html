			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct, not ImTheRealBruceWayne. There was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3np7qw/eli5_what_exactly_was_the_danger_of_the_y2k_bug/" target="_blank">a post about it a year ago</a> and a number of people who actually worked on fixing issues in the years prior posted about their experiences. It was really interesting. And included systems that were pretty important! I remember someone talking about making sure that kids' vaccination records wouldn't get messed up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this was mainly it. People in the business knew there was a problem years in advance and they hired IT experts to fix it. By the time year 2000 came around, most of the bugs that were overlooked were fairly minor.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how you look at it.</p>
<p>On one hand... quite a lot was done to prevent Y2K problems.  A complete shit ton of money was spent by spooked CEO's to prevent this.  There is really no way to say what would have occurred if this money and time had not been spent.</p>
<p>On the other hand... at the time the media panic had reached levels of complete and total insanity.  Your wristwatch was gonna stop working, elevators would plunge into seas of fire - jet airplanes would fly into the world trade center!</p>
<p>None of those things are even possible!</p>
<p>Having said those words.... the problems were real.  2 digit year fields flipping over to '00' because they were running on antiquated hardware - it was real.  That hardware was all over the fucking place.  The question of 'does this problem exist in your system?' was a valid question that needed addressed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true entirely.</p>
<p>It got blown out of proportion for sure, and home users never were going to have an issue.</p>
<p>However, lots of industry software did need to be updated. (banks/industrial).</p>
<p>Not world ending. But it definitely was an issue (was blown out of proportion though).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It definitely could have created massive problems if it hadn't been fixed. Bank accounts emptied, power plants shut down, ice cream freezers everywhere left to defrost. Thankfully, it was a relatively simple fix that required many diligent programmers updating software. It's like you're driving a bus full speed towards a wall, and all that is needed is for the driver to slow down and turn slightly to avoid it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally disagree with this statement. I was hired out of college in ‘98 when people were getting poached from other disciplines just to fill the massive resource need to go through the lines of code. Especially when distributed platforms were still new and everything ran on big iron. Thinking about the sheer amount of COBOL code that had to be parsed through makes my sphincter pucker. </p>
<p>Was some of it sensationalized? Yes. Was there a real threat of shit being broke if we never caught it? Yes. Would nukes have launched, probably not - could the banking industry gotten totally fucked up - oh yeah. </p>
<p>The fact we saw it coming between 5-7 years ahead of time helped a lot. Slapping a sticker saying “Y2K” certified on a toaster was a little extreme. Maybe checking lines of code in some random computerized piece of an elevator - eh, could be argued. </p>
<p>Damn this brings back the night of the event and the big book of “What the fuck to do when the world blows up - Step by Step” sitting next to me, laptop, and pager that evening. </p>
