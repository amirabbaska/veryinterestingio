			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about direct staffers but i assume it's livable. Most of the fellowships pay about double what a postdoc pays if you are &quot;early career&quot; (0-5 years after PhD), with pay going up slightly for later career  stages. </p>
<p>DC isn't THAT expensive as long as you realize you will be paying ~1/3 of your income on rent and don't shop for groceries exclusively at whole foods or go out every single night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a former congressional scientist, PhD in mechanical engineering. It really depends, but from what I gathered, you can expect pay to be between $60k and $80k starting out as a legislative assistant. I started out as a policy advisor and my salary was in the low six-figure range. Salaries of staffers are publicly available, so try Googling for congressional staff salaries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All Hill salaries are public via LegiStorm. You can type in a specific staffer's name to get their recent salary history or browse by office, committee, state, etc.</p>
<p>My take as an advocate in DC who looks up every Hill staffer I meet is that the spread is much broader than the private sector (or executive branch). The staff assistants are paid far less than a comparable position at a DC-area non-profit and they use way more unpaid labor, but the professional committee staff (policy people) are paid somewhat better than a comparable analyst position at a think tank or other research company. Policy staff within a specific member's office seems to be comparable to private sector.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems I missed the boat on this AMA again... In case you're still answering questions: did you do a postdoc before doing a fellowship? And considering the current climate, do you think these jobs will be even more competitive now? I want to go into science policy, but I'm kind of doubting my abilities and competitiveness....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer too many personal questions about my career path. </p>
<p>And I don't know if it'll get more or less competitive. I hope more. I fear less. </p>
<p>And don't doubt your abilities. Work for it! There are lots of ways to get here and we need a lot of people doing this work!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In order to get a job like yours, does one need to be in a clearly policy-related field (environmental science, health, etc), or is &quot;scientist&quot; more or less sufficient?  Are positions like yours permanent, temporary, or dependent on who's in office?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but work in policy in DC. If you work for a Member's office, you lose your job if they lose the election and you would need to apply to another Member's office if you wanted to stay. If you work for a committee, you're either majority staff or minority staff. If the majority switches parties within your chamber (House/Senate), your job could be in jeopardy if the new majority party so fundamentally shifts the focus of the committee that they need to adjust staffing and they need fewer people in your issue area (e.g. Ag committee focusing a ton on nutrition vs a ton on agriculture).</p></div>		</li>
