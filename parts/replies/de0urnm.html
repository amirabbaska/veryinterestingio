<p>Suicidal thoughts seems like something that different cultures deal with in vastly different ways, and with varying degrees of success.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your excellent post. Now how do we address the  anti-medication stigma? I see that as being the biggest roadblock for helping those with depression (hits close to home for me).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Person A has a real illness with mostly subjective symptoms (migraine headaches) and suffers and seeks treatment and is prescribed effective and science based medication (that works for some but not others), even though the illness has social, psychological, and biological influences.  Everyone tells person A &quot;make sure you take your medication&quot;.</p>
<p>Person B has a real illness with mostly subjective symptoms (major depressive disorder) and suffers and seeks treatment and is prescribed effective and science based medication (that works for some but not others), even though the illness has social, psychological, and biological influences.  Everyone tells person B &quot;you shouldn't take medication&quot;.</p>
<p>I don't get it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Overall, the rate of suicide in the Western world is generally 11 per 100000 per year. Having depression increases your risk of suicide by 3 to 5 times.  Therefore, we can translate those rates into 33 to 55 per 100000 per year.  Being depressed includes suicidal thinking as part of the illness, but it is not a common outcome to die by suicide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm,</p>
<p>Total</p>
<ul>
<li>320,000,000 (2015 US Pop)</li>
<li>44,193 (deaths by suicides)</li>
<li>13.81 per 100,000</li>
</ul>
<p>Depressed</p>
<ul>
<li>25,000,000 (depressed)</li>
<li>22,096 (1/2 of suicides are depressed)</li>
<li>88.39 per 100,000</li>
</ul>
<p>Risk from depression</p>
<ul>
<li>88.39/13.81=6.4</li>
</ul>
<p>6.4x more likely to die by suicide if depressed.</p>
<p>Looks more like almost 90 per 100,000.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The number given is &quot;The western world&quot; the numbers you're using are US. This could be the reason for the difference, I&quot;m not saying you're wrong, but you're clearly using a different population size. IT's plausible that the US has a higher suicide rate then say Europe or Canada etc. I wouldn't immediately disregard the other number</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Britain's, for example, is lower.  I'm cool with 13 being the number in people's heads too.  It floats between 10 and 15 for most of the Western world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure where you got the half of suicides are depressed number from, that's totally fabricated. It sounds extremely extrapolated.  It runs counter to almost all of the non-poorly-conducted (ie horribly constructed psychological autopsies) studies of suicide we have.</p>
<p>Regardless, even if was to accept the number, we would both agree that 90 per 100000 per year is not a &quot;common outcome&quot;.</p>
<p>Edit: I googled &quot;what percentage of people who die by suicide have depression&quot; and saw your number.  It's totally unsupported by science and a common advocacy myth (alongside &quot;90 percent of suicides have a mental illness&quot;) that has been very hard to remove from advocacy groups.  Ideally you wouldn't use Google for your numbers, rather actual science publications.  There are large population studies available showing the  suicide odds ratio being 3-5x with pretty good confidence intervals, when adjusted for other factors.</p></div>		</li>
