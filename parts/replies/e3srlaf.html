			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  Your monitor, can mix RGB lights through additive mixing to get white.  A printer can not do that.  It uses Subtractive mixing.</p>
<p>I also  think yellow would be impossible to create with RGB ink.  Red and green makes yellow.  On a monitor producing light that is true.  If you mixed red and green ink, you would probably get a brown, or some other ugly color.  So, I don't think an RGB ink printer would be possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, &quot;RBG ink&quot; will never exist. It will make the same gross grey-brown that you made in kindergarten by mixing all your finger-paints together. When digital artists are creating work to be printed, they have to make sure that the program they're using is set to code the colours according to the CMYK spectrum, so that the colours will print looking the same as they do on the screen. Respectively, work made for digital viewing is done in RBG because that's how it will be displayed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Large format printers use CMYKRGB+ grey, photo grey, photo cyan, matte black and photo magenta in a 12 ink process (as well as other variants). You can print purely in RGB on those and itâ€™ll look ok. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep, did this in 6th grade art class.  We called it muck (those crayola paints really gave it river slime consistency).  </p></div>		</li>
