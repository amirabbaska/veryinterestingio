			<div class="markdown"><p>Fine, I'll leave out &quot;back&quot; and &quot;front&quot;.  If you look at a snail shell, the thin rim part that overhangs out into the air is the part that grows.  If you look at a toenail, the thin rim part that overhangs out into the air is the part that does not grow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It shouldn't be scraping at its shell at all. Maybe to clean it, but I'd still keep an eye on it. Aside from the cuttlebone, what does it eat?</p></div>		</li>
