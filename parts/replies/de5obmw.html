			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first paragraph isn't necessarily correct. Due to the fractional reserve banking system, when you put money into a savings account, the bank only needs to hold on to about 10-20% of that. So let's say the someone puts 10,000 in a bank account, and the required reserve rate is 10%, so the other 9,000 of that can be loaned out by the bank to someone else. If someone gets that loan and puts it into their own bank account then that bank can loan out 8,100 of the 9,000, still holding 10%. </p>
<p>This fractional reserve system is what ultimately made banks fail left and right in the late 1920's and 30's because there people would all try to withdraw their funds at once, and the banks simply couldn't pay it out for everyone. That is called a &quot;run on the bank,&quot; and if it happened today, I am confident it would destroy the global economy lol. </p>
<p>About the only way that your money isn't contributing to the economy in some way is if you have it all in cash in your mattress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to having to hold the 10-20% reserve on savings accounts the investments they can do is also limited to low risk investments like mortgage loans and treasury bonds. You will not find much of your emergency savings that gets to the venture capitalist market or other high risk markets that improves the economy by a lot. However your long term savings will easily find its way into these high risk markets. This is why some pension funds loses up to 50% of their assets whenever there is a crash while the savings accounts are pretty much guaranteed. So my statement still applies and savings accounts do a lot less for the economy then pension funds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first paragraph isn't correct. </p>
<p>Banks need to keep a certain percent of &quot;cash&quot; available on hand that they cannot use to put into risky things like investing, but they can still give out loans based on their &quot;total cash&quot;. </p>
<p>Say they are required to keep a 20% reserve of all deposits.  You put 20k into your bank account, and now the bank can loan 16k to someone else based on the 20k you have in your account.</p>
<p>If all depositors at the bank put in a grand total of 100k, the bank can only give out 80k in loans.  If there is 100 million in the bank, they can give out 80 million in loans.</p>
<p>And loans have a massive impact on the economy because those loans are almost immediately all spent on a variety of things, directly boosting the economy.</p>
<p>So to say that putting money in a savings account doesn't impact the economy is completely wrong.  Your 20k probably isn't a lot, but with millions of people putting savings into banks, thats millions of people able to get loans to buy cars, houses, and start businesses.</p>
<p>Edit: to note, in the US, the required reserve amount isn't a lot.  Only 10% for major firms.  Additionally, there is a distinction between the checking account (quick access to money) and a savings account.  The savings account actually requires no reserve if it is owned by an individual.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My question is, if it does boost the economy, why are your savings taxed if you die when the money is supposed to go to family? What's the incentive not to put it in a can and keep in the ground?  </p>
<p>A friend of mine lost most if his dad's money to tax. They took nearly $100000 or something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inheritance tax is not making people spend their money before they die. Saving your money in a fund for your kids will give them far more money after tax then if you bury it in your garden (which you still have to pay inheritance tax for). And way more then if you spend the money on yourself and leave your kids with nothing. The tax is there as an incentive for your kids to make their own fortune and not rely on their parents fortune as well as a tax on the rich who have a lot of inheritance. The tax money is going to schools, military, universities, infrastructure, etc. so it is boosting the economy and helping the people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inheritance or &quot;death&quot; tax also doesn't kick in until about 5.5 million federally and an average of 1 million for the 20 that have some form of it. And to add to that that's per person so doubled for couples and it's also net assets. To put this in perspective, 4,400 people were subject to the federal tax in 2011 out of the 2.5 million that died that year so this really only affects about .1%. Harder to find stats in the states but I assume it's out there. </p>
<p>As another poster noted, it's better to keep assets where they earn returns, not only does this not apply to most people, even if t does the rates go from 0-20% for the states and up to 40% federally. Having assets earning even average returns over their life can offset the costs. Also I would like to note I am not advocating one way or another for estate tax just pointing out it doesn't affect most people and even for those it does it's better to invest and earn returns on the income to offset the tax anyway. </p></div>		</li>
