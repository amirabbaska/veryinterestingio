			<div class="markdown"><p>For example in that one Alien Game (Forgot the title) the Alien has &quot;two brains&quot;. The one don't knows your position and searches for you, because it controls the body. The other brain knows your exact position. The second one sometimes gives the first brain tips on where the player is. </p>
<p>I like this concept just wanted to share it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alien Isolation, I found the concept interesting and I think the name sums it up brilliantly: AI Director, The Director always knows where you are and may send hints to the Alienâ€™s AI as you progress, or work out where you are probably heading so hint there, but never explicitly says where you are. It keeps the tension the game wants to have, without feeling unfair</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many older games had 'meat seeking missiles' that once they detected you they could and would follow you forever across the map.</p>
<p>Everquest (one of the first MMORPGs) was like this early on because it had to run on shitty old computers and they couldn't spare the cycles for real detection or retreat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember in Oblivion I was running from the guards in the Imperial City, but one guard still pursued me after I left the gates. I swam all across Lake Rumare, and yet he still followed me. I played a thief, didn't want to kill him, but I had to after that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A parallel that could be made is with aiming. AI could easily have perfect accuracy (aimbots) but it still misses a good percentage of the time. The point is not to be as efficient as possible but create a &quot;believable&quot; experience.</p></div>		</li>
