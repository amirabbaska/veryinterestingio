			<div class="markdown"><p>So if oil prices decrease a lot in a short time, as they did, then their &quot;replacement profit&quot; goes up because they subtract the current price of oil at the time of filing, not the price they actually paid (which may be much more). At the same time, they write off the value of oil reserves/fields that they hold due to the price decrease, which would lead to losses. Seems like it would somewhat balance out in the end.</p></div>		</li>
