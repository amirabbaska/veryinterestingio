			<div class="markdown"><p>We see that extensive synpatogenesis takes place between different types of neurons, including the myelination of axons. Some neuronal networks form. We hope that experts in neurodevelopment will take this up, so that we learn, how physiological this is.</p>
<p>No microglia (workin on this), but more atsrocytes and oligodendrocytes than any other model I am aware of.</p>
<p>We see that all this forms in a self-organized manner, thus we obtain brain structures and some functionality, which cannot be found in traditional cultures, where cells look like eggs in a pan &quot;sunny side up&quot;. In 3D they have so much more cell;cell contact. </p></div>		</li>

1) we have a neuronal network formed within the aggregates. we have dendritic spines, active synapsis. Learning and memory is not our field, but  we would be happy to collaborate with the experts in this field to advance in this direction.
2) our system has different types of neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, fully myelinated axons.
3) advantages over primary neuronal cultures are that our system is from human cells,  not rodent (what the primary cultures are from). Our system can be up-scaled to high throughput easily. we can produce thousands of mini-brains per week. From this prospective the system can be used for drug screening
Thank you for your questions! </p></div>		</li>
