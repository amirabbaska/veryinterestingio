			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that it's now against the law in the US for commercials to be significantly louder than the show.  The bill was called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Advertisement_Loudness_Mitigation_Act" target="_blank">CALM Act of 2010</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They get around this by keeping the maximum volume under the limit, but making a higher % of the sound near the maximum allowed volume range.</p>
<p>So yes, the loudest sound during the commercial isn't any louder than the loudest sound in the show - but while the show may have a guy yelling for a few seconds, the guy in the commercial is yelling the whole 30-60 seconds he's on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of the movie as being mixed within 100% maximum with few to no sounds actually peaking too 100% (because this would be poor audio design)</p>
<p>Now the commercial is set to 100% and peaking constantly because it makes it loud af   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny thing about this, it’s not that the commercial is louder, it’s that the commercial is set to the highest volume point of the show, so while the show changes volume to add drama by raising it for shouting scenes and lowering it for somber scenes, the commercials don’t change along with the context of the show. This is the real reason commercials seem louder than the show.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war</a></p>
<p>when vinyl singles records were being pressed for juke boxes as their primary outlet the artists and producers wanted theirs to be louder than the others so it had more chance of being a hit. the same loudness push helped them stand out for radio play.</p>
<p>it happened again in the 1980s when tracks were made louder to stand out in compilation (various artists) discs that were common at the time. this became less common once players had auto leveling tech built in.</p></div>		</li>
