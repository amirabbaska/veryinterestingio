			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's not that everyone else is aging faster, the people on the spaceship are experiencing time more slowly.  From the outside 20 years is 20 years, but the people on the ship will not have aged 20 years.</p>
<p>Now if they spent 20 years (according to ship time) <del>at</del> near light speed, THEN everyone they know on Earth would probably be dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on your frame of reference, if you are on earth the people on the space ship are aging slowly, if you are on the spaceship people on earth are aging quickly. This is why time is relative. There is no 'objective' time, only time as a specific individual experiences it (based on gravitational forces and speed).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're half right. Time is relative, but the people on the spaceship don't see the people on Earth as aging quickly. If you are on the spaceship, it appears as if the Earth is moving away at near light speed, and hence you would see the people on Earth as aging slowly. Both parties see the other as aging slowly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close to light speed--not &quot;at&quot; light speed. You have a peculiar situation where an infinite amount of time will have passed if you actually move at &quot;c&quot; (or some interpretation of that in accordance with having &quot;c&quot; as your velocity when referencing the time dilation equation). Everything would be dead.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right.  I seem to recall a thread discussing whether photons experience time, and the consensus was &quot;no&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
