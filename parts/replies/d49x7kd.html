			<div class="markdown"><p>My gf's mum used to work at an office, and if the stamps aren't stamped over to show they are used she would remove them carefully and reuse them. They had drawers of them, worth Â£100s. Now she works elsewhere and the supply is dwindling. We used loads of them to send hand written letters to companies we liked complimenting (sincerely) their product in the hopes of free stuff, so far I've got a hand written letter from John Haynes (of Haynes manuals) and a Rubicon notebook amongst others.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In Australia I once accidentally dropped a letter in the box without a stamp. Went inside to pay and they said don't worry, donate the 50c (still got delivered)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend (in the States) received mail from me (in Australia) with no postage on it too (I had put it on, but it slid off the tape), which boggles my mind.  I did get a notice that said I owed $4 and please come to an Aus Post location to pay it (which I did!).  How does the Aus Post have so much trust in me?  And why the hell did America carry on with the posting?  How is even $4 enough to cover the time, effort, fuel, etc. that is required to deliver pieces of paper from my hand to anywhere in the world (in four lines or less!).  So many questions...</p></div>		</li>

<p>The destination country doesn't collect postage due unless the origin country says it's postage due. <a href="http://pe.usps.com/text/imm/immc7_007.htm" target="_blank">Specifically, they put a T stamp with a fraction of the First-class letter postage paid, which is then converted to the destination country's currency.</a> If there's no stamp on it and no T stamp, they don't collect because they don't know if it was prepaid or something. So if Australia doesn't bother T-stamping, it won't arrive postage due.</p></div>		</li>
