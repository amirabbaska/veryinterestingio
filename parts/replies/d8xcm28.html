<p>This video contains a very good explanation for the phenomenon in question, as well as explaining how many other aspects of human decision making approximate the way efficient computer algorithms would make decisions; this one is called &quot;the explore/exploit tradeoff&quot;.</p>
<p>Essentially the explanation is that the value of experimenting with new behaviors and seeing their payoff declines over time, because the less time you have left to live the less time you have to take advantage of any new knowledge that you acquire by experimenting.</p>

<p>This is why; there is not an obstacle to this explanation.</p>
<p>Edit: just noticed he edited to acknowledge this possibility. Either way I recommend the video I linked because it's quite interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So exploration/exploitation need to be traded off because you have a finite amount of time to live for, but also because you get better at gaining rewards without exploring (i.e. you've found a routine that works).  </p>
<p>In my view &quot;play&quot; is common in children and becomes less common for adults and then stays &quot;less common&quot; as adults progress through old age.  If maximizing the value of remaining time were really the main factor, I think that &quot;play&quot; would undergo its sharpest decline in old age.  I don't think that this is really the case, but it may be true in the case of someone with a terminal illness or something.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To think that adults do not play I think is not correct, I think that as our mind matures, our actions change. I think maturity is the driving force which constricts play. An animals first instinct is to survive, whereas a child is not burdened yet by this responsibility, so they pass the time doing something that they enjoy doing. When you're an adult, you have free reign and nobody to govern your actions, and can do things such as watch tv, or play games. If there was no electricity in our homes for example, I think the home atmosphere would rely more heavily on social play when work was over, to do something enjoyable to pass the time. If we compare this to children who have rules to obey, forced to go outside and limited electronics time, they need to rely on imagination which comes with a growing mind, and of course stimulates learning.</p>
<p>This is my own personal views, none of this is fact but I think it makes some sense</p></div>		</li>

<p>We shouldn't consider this to be a fact, it is a theory that fits into certain expectations of what constitutes a correct answer, especially within evolutionary biology</p>
<p>I like to think (playfully) that animals, like humans, become wiser over time, less naive, more familiar with pain, difficulty, loss, futility. And that the adult individual is overburdened with awareness of the challenges of simply living that the young have yet to be traumatized by.</p>

<p>These are not mutually exclusive explanations. One of the first things you learn when you study the evolution of behaviour are with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinbergen%27s_four_questions#Evolutionary_.28ultimate.29_explanations" target="_blank">Tinbergen's Four Questions</a>. Essentially, depending on what you mean by &quot;why,&quot; there are different questions being asked, and consequently different explanations. This is also called &quot;levels of analysis.&quot;</p>
<p>Most of these answers are providing ultimate explanations, and you've come up with a proximate (mechanistic) explanation. It's a bit like if someone asks, &quot;why do humans have sex&quot; and one person answers, &quot;because humans that had sex spread their genes&quot; and another answers &quot;because it's fun.&quot; <em>Both</em> are true; it's just that two different questions are being answered. You're answering, &quot;What are the psychological reasons that people don't play as much as they got older,&quot; and others are answering, &quot;Why did play in children evolve?&quot;</p>
<p>It doesn't make sense to set up a psychological explanation against an evolutionary one; they're answering two entirely separate questions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the dissenting comment. However I think you are making too strong statements and not understanding what people are saying about learning and going too far in the other direction. </p>
<p>It is established that playing is valuable for learning even if it is possible that it isn't it's purpose. Playing contains practice and exercise of skills which makes it useful for individuals preparing for adulthood and both of those are well established methods of becoming better at things. That is, individuals certainly become better at the activities they do during play. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The idea that playing benefits an individual's learning skills need to survive has a built in explanation as to why older individuals would play less:</p>
<p>You stop playing as when you get older you need to devote your energy to the more serious responsibility you were playing to get good at. E.G. Young people &quot;play&quot; hunter but stop &quot;playing&quot; hunter once they grow up and start hunting for real.  Actual hunting takes over the learning part from playing and is a more useful use of time and energy. </p></div>		</li>
