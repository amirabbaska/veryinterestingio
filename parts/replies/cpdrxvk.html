			<div class="markdown"><p>Why can they be secret in the first place though?</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for the replies, it seems the secrecy of it, after it comes to light, is mainly so people won't have time to react to it so personally I'd say it's all crooked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they're discussing things that shouldn't be public for security reasons, if they're discussing things that deal with certain companies IP that they don't want to make public, or because people flip the fuck out anytime they don't like something that's brought up so they discuss things, come to an agreement <em>then</em> make their ideas public.</p>
<p>The &quot;secret committees&quot; aren't some official part of the government process.  It's a bunch of legislators that get together to hash out a bill to propose.  Proposing it is where the official part of it starts.  There's really not much of a benefit to publicize a bunch of guys brainstorming sessions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it is less true in the current climate, behind closed doors is where a lot of the compromising happens as well.  Senators and congressman aren't always as willing to compromise with the other party when the cameras are on them, so having the anonymity of the closed-door sessions can, theoretically, make them more willing and likely to make decisions that advance the bill but wouldn't be as popular back home</p>
<p>Again, in our current political climate, this is less the case, since compromise seems to be a four-letter word...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's incorrect, it is officially part of the government process. The Senate Select Intelligence Committee is always secret and it is a part of the legislation process. All bills start in the committees where they are relevant (ie appropriations, energy) before they move to the main floor of the senate for a vote. The Intel Committee is the only secret one because they discuss classified material--anything from our top secret Intel on enemy nations to where our bases are to how many people work for the CIA. You need a venue for Senators to learn about this in private so that they can get the full information. </p>
<p>Maybe it sounds sketchy, but it's way better than intelligence groups operating without oversight because they have no way to tell elected officials what their main concerns are. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true. This happens in the everyday workplace all the time. Anyone who's worked in an office would recognize this. People have closed meetings to discuss subject matter for other meetings constantly. There's always someone who will flip out of something's brought up, or if something isn't brought up, so people get together to talk about what's gonna happen when they talk about something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Laws are like sausages, it is better not to see them being made.&quot; - Otto von Bismarck </p>
<p>Private might be a better word.  Getting things to work with a lot of people with different ideas and motivations is complicated.  They need to be able to negotiate and hash things out before they go public or i'ts hard to get people to be frank and open.  Plus you'd risk having too many cooks in the kitchen when working on the project as they would all of a sudden be swarmed with other people's suggestions, scrutiny, and whatnot.  </p>
<p>If you forced every part of it out into the open (which would be impossible, legislators would just meet on their own time privately), you would get less done and more populist demagogues pushing feel-good bad policy.</p>
<p>Try working with a few hundred people, coordinating large policy proposals, getting compromises and agreements and do it with the news media staring you down.  </p>
<p>Having the final decision making and biggest debates public is probably as good as can be done with an ugly process.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best justification. If a discussion is public, everyone in the discussion has to be &quot;on&quot;. And a politician who's &quot;on&quot; is a massive pain in everyone's ass - they can't make compromises, they can't make deals, they can't even admit that the other person has a valid point of view half the time.</p>
<p>Something that also feeds into this is the primary process and the extremism of core 'grass roots' supporters - even if a large majority of your constituents would actually approve of you making a few compromises to get some shit done, the small subset of people who vote in primaries, do fundraising, volunteer, etc. probably don't. </p>
<p>So if they're in 'public', a politician has to be thinking &quot;what is the most hard-core, unhinged, component of my constituency going to make of this, if I agree to bend on issue X in return for some concession on issue Y?&quot; and a lot of the time the answer will be &quot;they will throw money and primary support at someone  less flexible and more ineffective than me&quot;.</p>
<p>So sometimes, if you want some actual gross give-and-take politics to get done, you need to give everyone involved a room where they can actually talk shop instead of fulfilling the blowhard fantasies of their party base.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll concur with this. Deciding who to invite to planning meetings is an art - you want to keep the people who can move the process forward involved, and there are often folks you <em>don't</em> want in a meeting.</p>
<p>Nothing hurts more than crafting a meeting with the right people involved, and then seeing a clueless coworker forward the invite to a bunch of random people &quot;just in case we need them.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The top voted response here isn't entirely correct. There is only one secret committee, which is the Senate Select Intelligence Committee. It is secret because they discuss classified material that has important national security concerns. You need a way to inform senators about the stuff the CIA and others are doing. Nothing can become law in secret, though--the resulting draft legislation from the Intel Committee moves to the floor of the Senate, where everything is televised on public TV channels. </p>
<p>Maybe it sounds sketchy, but the alternative is having no way to inform elected officials about what the intelligence community is doing. That's way worse. </p></div>		</li>
