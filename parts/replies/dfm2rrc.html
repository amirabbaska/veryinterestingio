<p>The same information they are currently selling.
Baffles me that people don't actually pay attention to what the story actually is about and it doesn't take more than actually reading an article to understand it.
The policy was put in place in December by the Obama Administration when they were leaving office. It is now likely being repealed so there is no real change.</p>

<p>Question: if I promise to pay you for something, and then reneg the next month, before I'm supposed to pay you two months from now, no harm, no foul?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything that has been going on for years will be going on. Nothing changes. This wasn't a hot topic in December because it wasn't that big of a deal one way or the other. No one championed it as a huge win for privacy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Big tech companies like Google and Facebook which already capture this data and sell it don't like the competition from ISPs. If ISPs can't sell it then the firms that are gathering the data can charge more for the data. </p>

<p>There's a big difference.  If I don't wish to have Google collect my data, I can use ad blockers, not sign up for their identifying services, and avoid them as much as I can.</p>
<p>If my ISP is allowed to collect and sell this information, I don't have any options, other than to stop using the internet.  That's looney talk.</p>

<p>This is simple. Both sides have been trying to take care of their donors. </p>

<p>I'd be interested to find out who's running the &quot;Big Privacy&quot; lobby that are &quot;being taken care of&quot; by regulations like the one that just got blocked.  Maybe I can collect some of that sweet, sweet, foldy, spendy money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Comparing this to Google or Facebook isn't quite right, as the EFF points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google doesn’t see everything you do on the Internet (neither does Facebook, for that matter, or any other online platform)—they only see the traffic you send to them. And you can always choose to use a different website if you want to avoid Google’s tracking. None of that is true about your ISP. You probably only have one, maybe two options when it comes to ISPs offering high-speed Internet, and your ISP sees everything—they have to, in order to send your traffic to the right place. That’s why we need the FCC’s privacy rules: ISPs are in a position of power, and they’ve shown they’re willing to abuse that power. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't more competition with ISPs because regulators have wanted to treat endpoint ISPs like utilities which has prevented competition. </p>
<p>Additionally, if people want privacy, a market solution will be developed.  Maybe you pay more for privacy with an additional security level on your current ISP, or there is an ISP that provides policy protections in their SLC, but if people want it and are willing to allow for the revenue stream to make it competitive, it will happen.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Actually, there isn't more competition because ISPs have colluded for decades to stay out of each other's markets so they can merge later. They lobby local governments to pass laws that keep competition out, as we've seen with Google Fiber's failed attempt.</p>

<p>There shouldn't be a market solution for a <strong><em>basic human right.</em></strong></p></div>		</li>
