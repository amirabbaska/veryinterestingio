<p>The term regolith combines two Greek words: rhegos (ῥῆγος), &quot;blanket&quot;, and lithos (λίθος), &quot;rock&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The greek 'γ' should correspond to a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_velar_stop" target="_blank">&quot;voiced velar stop&quot;</a>, e.g. in English: <strong>g</strong>a<strong>gg</strong>le  [ˈɡæɡɫ̩]    'gaggle'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In English, there is only a choice between &quot;hard&quot; g (as in &quot;get&quot;) and &quot;soft&quot; g (as in &quot;gem&quot;) before the letters &quot;e&quot;, &quot;ae&quot;, &quot;i&quot; and &quot;y&quot;*, so both g's in &quot;megaregolith&quot; are hard.</p>
<p>* There are a very small number of exceptions to this rule: &quot;margarine&quot; (which was originally pronounced with a hard &quot;g&quot;), &quot;gaol&quot; (which is now almost always spelled &quot;jail&quot;), and words such as &quot;judgment&quot; which can also be spelled with an &quot;e&quot; after the &quot;g&quot;.</p>
<p>EDIT: &quot;margarine&quot; originally had a hard &quot;g&quot;</p></div>		</li>
