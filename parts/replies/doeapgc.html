			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypoglycemia only specifically refers to low blood glucose levels, not any uncommon side effects of that. </p>
<p>Funny thing is that when most people i know are low,  we get incredibly hungry and will eat tons and tons unless we actively stop ourselves. It's the body trying to protect itself since it needs that to keep going. Must be frustrating to be fighting against your body just to keep it going</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have the right idea it's incredibly frustrating, I literally have to force myself to eat through the nausea, and when I don't do that well enough I feel incredibly weak. I have to supplement with protien drinks like boost to stay functional. I feel like my body is defective, but the warranty period is well past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, when you said you have to force yourself to each through the nausea, that just brought up old memories of me as a kid sitting downstairs forcing myself to eat a slice of bread in an attempt to just get something on my stomach so I could sleep.  I usually ended up ripping up pieces and rolling them into small balls so I could swallow them like a pill with water.  I'm much better now on my intake of food so I don't have to deal with it, but those were terrible times.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you're less likely to have this side effect of you're overweight however</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about that, but my knowledge about hypoglycemia is in the context of diabetics (1&amp;2). It's possible that hypoglycemics (can only go low, not high) have different reactions, or that other conditions also affect it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have non diabetic hypoglycemia. My blood sugar will drop drastically between meals. If I go too long without eating I’ll get sweaty, shaky, light headed and nauseous to the point where I will throw up. I have to make sure I always have food on me or plan my day around meals. It’s the worst feeling </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually went to school for dietetics and nutrition. One of my undergrad lab classes was really hands on. For our diabetes unit, we received glucometers and had to test our blood sugar 6x a day for a month and record it to see how diabetics live. We did it in various settings: pre and post exercise, fasting, after eating, etc. Anyway, my fasting blood sugar was like consistently 60mg/dL and under. I’m a science nerd, so when I feel crappy, I’ll test my blood sugar “just for fun” to see what it is. </p></div>		</li>
