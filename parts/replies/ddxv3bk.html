			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that has to do with the limited scope of reach by a train. You can't really take the train to where you want to go. You can only take it hostage. A lot of airline hostages want to take the plane to other countries. However, trains are limited by the tracks that are available to them (not to mention the fact that police will easily able to divert the train using track controls).  Edit: grammar</p></div>		</li>

<p>Casey Ryback hops on a Colorado to LA train to start a vacation with his niece. Early into the trip, terrorists board the train and use it as a mobile HQ to hijack a top secret destructive US satellite.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The Taking of Pelham 123&quot; was about a (fictional) NYC subway hijacking. Hijack primarily means taking control of a vehicle, not necessarily changing its <del>destiny</del> destination. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re France, this is more than train stations. Groups of soldiers are walking the streets in major cities, esp. at tourist attractions, and even in the Metro. You can see soldiers walking the boardwalk in Nice, and along boulevards in Paris, winding their way past rows of Parisians sitting at cafes (not just train stations). They are deployed and patrolling as if in wartime, and have been since shortly after the Charlie Hebdo attacks. The recent attack at the Louvre Mall was against one of these patrol squads. It's a bit different than if it were train station specific, or to prevent a hijacking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in Paris in late december, and I remember seeing armed patrols everywhere. Airports, metro stations, streets, everywhere. It felt as if the entire country was extremely paranoid something was gonna happen.  </p>
<p>On a related note, at the airport on the way home, my mother (being the asian tourist she is) decided to take a pic of the soldiers. They immediately noticed and had her delete the pic.   </p>
<p>Nevertheless, she still managed to take some pictures of them throughout paris.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an American that's not that weird. Going into the major train stations here in NY (Grand Central and Penn Station) you'll generally see normal city police, antiterrorist city police, state troopers (state level police) and the national guard (army) all posted around. </p>
<p>I guess the French equivalent would to have the cops, gendarmes and soldiers within spitting distance of each other. </p></div>		</li>
