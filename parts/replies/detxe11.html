			<div class="markdown"><p>So, when someone buys a home,  they don't all of a sudden start paying property taxes,  if they exist in the area. If you are paying to live somewhere,  you are paying property taxes,  just not directly. That money is included in the cost of rent. When you purchase a home,  you just become directly responsible for the tax. Many people when shopping for a home focus on their mortgage amount when they should be factoring in at least the mortgage,  taxes, insurance, hoa, and maintenance. Owning a home is more expensive because people don't think of everything that goes into being responsible for property. </p>
<p>You don't get the money back when filing, but you can use it to help lower your federal taxes. </p>
<p>People past retirement age do still pay the taxes. However,  property taxes have the ability to get exemptions applied.  Things like living at the property you own,  veteran,  age,  etc. can all help cap or reduce the amount you owe on property taxes. </p>
<p>If a state doesn't charge property taxes,  they likely have the money flowing in from other areas.  Maybe higher sales tax or a state income tax. I believe South Dakota gets a majority of its revenue from sales taxes. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Only if you look at the total amount of money coming out of your bank account every month. With home ownership roughly half of what you pay each month ends up in equity, aka no money lost. With rent, 100% of your money disappears forever, and rent climbs perpetually. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only the mortgage part goes into equity, the rest is essentially a loss.  Then you have to remove what you paid on interest, assuming you pay it off which many people home hop and upgrade along the way or if the loan lasts the full term is about half or more of the home value.  Additionally, some houses can depreciate in value instead of holding or gaining value. </p>
<p>So yes,  you do gain equity in the house but it isn't as valuable as most people make it to be imo. If you have a liability such as a house,  it's just that unless you have it generating revenue,  then it is also an asset. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Have you ever owned a home?  Because the bank will require monthly payments that are held in an escrow to cover your property taxes.  So your very first payment will absolutely have your property taxes calculated in the costs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How the heck are you getting upvoted? Yes, they most certainly do.</p>
<p>You start owing taxes the second you take possession of a home, in fact if there are back taxes, depending on where you live and how you purchased, you are responsible for those as well.  If you are instead referring to a quarterly or semi billing method then you are either being purposefully misleading or just ignorant. The bottom line is you start &quot;paying taxes&quot; the very second you sign the dotted line.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I am just blown away by your incorrect responses here.  You make it sound as if there are exception abound,. nothing to see or worry about here!!</p>
<p>In <em>some</em> states there are percentage discounts for age 65 and older. It's the same for vets and most of it is predicated on disability, in fact almost every single exception is based upon disability and it is neither uniform or federally mandated. There is absolutely no place in the United States that gives you a discount or nixes your tax liability for &quot;living at the property you own.&quot; unless again, being misleading, you are referring to rental towns (coastal) predominantly rented out during the seasons that have higher mill rates for non residents specifically for that reason.</p>
<p>Honestly, are you doing this on purpose?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are misunderstanding my points. </p>
<p>The first one is that you're paying taxes on the property you tent because it's factored into your rent.  Someone that is renting out a property isn't like to pay that out of their own good will and not pass it on to you as the renter.  You pay the taxes for the property just not directly to the government. </p>
<p>On the second part, I never said everywhere has exemptions. Not everywhere even charges property taxes. Also,  taxes or anything for that matter is pretty much not uniform. Everything is a case by case basis. And I never said you didn't have to pay taxes due to exemptions. I said you can get caps and reductions for those exemptions. </p>
<p>For example,  for living in a house you own in Texas,  you can reduce the value of your property by $25k on school taxes ($$35k if 65+. Also reduce the value of your property by $3k for county taxes or if 65+ and there is a local rule better you get that. Addiontal exemptions may apply due to local.</p>
<p>Again,  everything is specific to a specific situation. Not all federal tax deductions or credits are available to everyone everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a whole different ELI5, but property taxes don't go to the state - they go to the city or county, and they pay for schools. Public schools aren't funded by income taxes, or sales taxes, or corporate taxes - they are paid for locally by property taxes. This is (one of) the reasons why schools in expensive areas are better than schools in cheap neighborhoods - the people in expensive neighborhoods pay more in property taxes, which means they pay more for the school. </p>
<p>Edit to everyone replying saying that this isn't always true. Yes - I did not want to get into a full explanation of school funding methods in the United States in three sentences. He was asking why people have to pay property taxes, and in the United States, the vast majority of school funding (though not all), in most places (though not all), comes from property taxes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember when I was young and lived in the Chicago land suburbs. It was a very wealthy neighborhood right next to rather poor suburbs. Literally split by train tracks. My dad was paying $30k just in property taxes. k-8th grade schools were moderate since the poor side of the suburbs went there and our high school was CRAZY huge and well funded. Like holy shit so much stuff. I remember taking summer school classes on medical engineering. MEDICAL ENGINEERING. After my freshman year I moved to the boondocks and I had no idea how fortunate I was before. Property taxes were less than $1k a year and the schools... were pretty bad. They had more generic electives like shop and home ech. The teachers were very good at scrounging up materials to keep the classes going. Now that I'm an adult I donate whatever I can whenever I can. But it was one hell of a culture shock. Previously I had 3 minuets for passing periods and I had to run across campus just to not be late for my next class and this school in the middle of nowhere had 5 minuets and there was literally no reason to have such long passing periods. You could take a shit, get a drink, go to your locker, talk with your friends and still make it to your class with time to spare. It was crazy to me. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This varies. Many states do provide funds for schools, but communities will often augment it with funds from property taxes. If you can attract top teachers by paying more, investing in infrastructure, etc. you can drive an upward trend; this is how many of the highest income counties got/stay that way; it was certainly a driver in our home purchase, though I know some states/areas the top earners just pay for private schools (much more expensive typically). The problem with only funding from property taxes is it tends to drive economic divides, the wealthy areas invest in schools, poor areas can't and get worse outcomes, which drive even more economic depression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue it's the other way around. Communities pay for their own schools, and then the state augments that money to even everything out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting because there is a clear partisan divide in methodology here. States are split in what they do based off of their local politics.</p>
<p>On the right you have the love for free market economics, the free market theorist sees income equality as self correcting absent of other factors. So the theory is this: higher income areas with become less accessible as they become more desirable. Which leads to tolerable inequality and (most importantly) market equilibrium.</p>
<p>The idea here is supposed to be that even though the high income areas can tax MORE they will eventually have less people to tax. Less people can afford to live in those neighborhoods and more people can afford to live in the poor neighborhoods. </p>
<p>So as income inequality grows, the poor neighborhood's tax revenue will increase because they have more people to tax despite getting less revenue per person. </p>
<p>This (hypothetically) leads to a system of natural barriers. Even though the rich schools will be better than the poor schools, they can only get SO MUCH better before their costs make them unaffordable for their demographic.</p>
<p>On the left there's a more interventionist economic policy that simply calls for states, or the Fed to supplement poorer areas to &quot;even&quot; out school funding. The idea is the market cannot correct on its own, there are several theories as for why. </p>
<p>The two opposing theories are why some schools seem to randomly gain and lose federal and state funding as either party's agenda gets traction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends. For instance, in Ohio <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeRolph_v._State" target="_blank">it was declared unconstitutional (Ohio constitution) to use property taxes to fund schools</a> although Ohio is still in the process of moving away from property taxes. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/in/2015/01/04/the-basics-of-school-funding-difficulty-defining-fairness/" target="_blank">Indiana spends very little property tax on schooling</a>, the article says less than 15%. In fact, &quot;As of 2012, U.S. Census data showed that just two states had a greater percentage of school spending coming from the state rather than local, federal or other sources than Indiana’s 51 percent. Only five states relied less on local taxes to fund schools.&quot;</p>
<p>Indiana uses other taxes such as sales tax and license plate tax to fund schools from a state level so that all neighbourhoods are treated equally.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a problem in many states and cities that schools are funded locally. But not all states are that way!</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are some people who believe that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_as_theft" target="_blank">taxation is theft,</a> but things like police and roads have to be payed for. That money has to come from <em>somewhere</em> and that's usually from taxes. Also keep in mind that if you're renting you're still paying property taxes in the form of slightly higher rents.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Being a little hyperbolic here. Many governments would consider their property taxes to be very reasonable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do people who are past retirement age have to still pay those property taxes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but a lot of times people who are retired move to place were the tax code in more in their favor (places with high incomes taxes and low/no property taxes).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A state like Sourh Dakota, who has no property taxes, how do they recoup that loss or is it just an altruistic motive by the state? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They get it from other areas like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-your-state-gets-its-money/" target="_blank">sales tax, income tax, and sin taxes.</a> States can't be &quot;altruistic&quot; unless they want to run up a huge debt and bankrupt the government or drastically cut back on government services.</p>

<p>Every governing body, by definition (introducing the budget), believes its rates are fair and just.  What kind of answer is that?</p>
<p>My mill rate is 29.97, the resulting tax is more than I have EVER paid anyone in rent. It is not hyperbolic, it just depends on where you live and in most places, it's pretty darn high.  I pay over 12 thousand dollars a year.  If I am lucky to live another 50 years and it stayed the same (lol it goes up every single year) I will have paid more in taxes than I did for my home and in fact, it will take just over 30 years to reach that milestone, which coincidentally (lol again) coincides with the number and length of payments I would have to make had I not paid off my home.</p>
<p>Now, I don't know about you but paying for your home TWICE and beyond is hardly &quot;reasonable&quot;. I would much rather have a consumption tax, tax sales higher, cars, wines, pot, porn, soda and chips whatever..but my home? </p>
<p>Guess how many homes in the USA are stolen by states and sold off because the elderly/retired can no longer afford their property taxes.  They pay off their home after 30 years, retire then get evicted.. Good old USA!</p>
<p>I take it you do not own your own home.  I am not a fan of paying on something I have already paid for and doing so for the rest of my natural life and having it potentially taken away from me.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Im a homeowner who is quite grumpy about the manner in which they assess property value, but it would be hard to call our taxes &quot;enormous&quot;.  Theyre a decent chunk of change to be sure but its not the end of the world-- if you're able to afford the house you can afford the taxes.</p></div>		</li>
