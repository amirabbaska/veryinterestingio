I also have an s8+ which has a really awesome camera for a smartphone and I love it to bits so I'm just making sure I dont kill it while I'm at it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might have gotten this advice already but why not make a pinhole camera box to watch it instead?  Use foil on one side of the box to make the pinhole as tight as possible and if you want bonus points use a big box and on the other side put tissue paper. Focus the sun onto the paper which will make the eclipse progress easily visible safely from the other side.  Your phone will have a much easier time capturing accurate progression shots on that vs just the sun, which will be an overexposed splotch no matter how you shoot it.  For internet karma use a big section of foil, put many dots in a cool pattern, and rule /r/mildlyinteresting tomorrow with your fibonacci spiral eclipse art.</p></div>		</li>
