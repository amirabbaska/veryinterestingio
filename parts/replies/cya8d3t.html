			<div class="markdown"><p>The other issue is that for <em>very</em> loud sounds, the sound doesn't only reach your eardrums through your ear hole. When you are working in close proximity to large jackhammers and similar equipment, its recommended you use both ear plugs and over the ear muffs. In the case of your headphones, they might not cancel out the reverberations travelling through your skull.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The human skull and body has a limit to how much sound it attenuates. I seem to remember that the attenuation of the head is somewhere in the region of 40 decibels. Very loud noises can still cause hearing damage by transmitting the sound to the eardrums straight through your skull or body.</p>
<p>So for super-loud environments, sound protection that covers the whole head is required. I don't think full-body spacesuit type protection is employed for sound attenuation, but helmets are. See e.g. <a href="http://acoustics.org/pressroom/httpdocs/162nd/Dietz_3pNS3.html" target="_blank">http://acoustics.org/pressroom/httpdocs/162nd/Dietz_3pNS3.html</a>.</p>
<p>There's ample evidence that the OSHA guidelines for sound exposure are insufficient in some conditions. E.g. helicopter pilots are known to begin suffering from tinnitus even though they are (after protection is applied) exposed to continuous noise which is below the OSHA guidelines.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is why double hearing protection is required in any job that is working in an environment of 90+ decibels for an extended period of time. In an aviation environment, a turning jet is easily 100+ decibels. A jet turning at max power is 130+. That noise level will only take 5-10 minutes to start damaging your hearing permanently. And once your hearing is gone, it is gone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The aviation line definitely performs better since it's a professional-grade product. But, if I recall, the maximum ambient noise level the A20's can handle is around 115dBC (not dBA). Something like that. So, definitely more noise cancellation than the QC audio headphones, but still not as optimal as actual hearing protection, like specialized ear muffs or ear plugs. If someone is firing a rifle next to you at around 140-160dBA, I wouldn't rely on A20's to keep your ears safe.</p></div>		</li>
