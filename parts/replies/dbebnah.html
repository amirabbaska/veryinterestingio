<p>I disagree with this point. The military does it pretty well. There are age groups that change the fitness standards and it wouldn't be difficult to grandfather older cops into a subset of standards and apply the new to only new cops until all the old ones retire. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The military is a different animal altogether, despite similarities. And Law enforcement was using the military standard for a long time, but as it seeks to distance itself from being 'militarized' in all things so that doesn't seem to be something many departments are interested in.</p>
<p>I guess I have to clarify this again. I am not saying it is difficult <em>in concept</em> but rather in reality. Practically speaking from seeing it firsthand, it is not as easy as you would think.</p></div>		</li>
