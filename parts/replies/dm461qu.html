			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not precisely what OP is looking for but gcc is the most recent common ancestor of <em>most</em> software out there today including web stuff, Python, the most commonly used operating systems, and the large amount of C and C++ software out there. GCC does have a bit of a lineage from earlier versions of itself into the B compiler into TMG. It's not the true primordial language as there are definitely things (Fortran for instance) that do not come from that lineage and so it doesn't precisely fit OP's question, but it's probably the closest to what he is looking for.  </p></div>		</li>
