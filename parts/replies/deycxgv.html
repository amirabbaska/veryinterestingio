<p>Holy shit. What if our brains are working against us? And deciding what information is important without asking my opinion? Do I forget my anniversary because my brain is trying to sabotage my relationship? Am I a brain piloting a body or is my brain piloting my body without me? Fuck im high</p>
<p>edit: you guys are fucking me up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an awesome Radiolab episode called <em>Blame</em> that goes into this a little. They get into kind of an argument and their science guy du jour (Malcolm Gladwell?) makes a strong argument that you cannot separate <em>self</em> from <em>brain</em>. Any argument or idea that tries to distinguish &quot;What I'm doing&quot; from &quot;What my brain is doing&quot; basically presupposes an extra entity that makes you You but is not bound by biochemistry, is not governed by the brain at all, which is of course nonsense.</p>
<p>In reality, the brain is just a very complicated system, and it can feel more than one way about things. The memory centers part of your brain can &quot;decide&quot;, based on evolutionary pressure and your(/its) personal experiences what qualifies as memorable, while the moral orblogical reasoning centers have a totally different sense about what qualifies. The two inform and affect one another, but both act with significant degrees of independence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the brain does something, such as think a thought, you become presently aware of it. When you interact with the thoughts, emotions and processes of the brain, and the brain/body is functioning properly, you then can choose to do or not do things, to agree or to not agree with the brain's analysis.</p>
<p>In each instance you are interacting with the brain/body to fulfill a conscious action in the physical world. The &quot;you&quot; is consciousness; to observe the brain, something other than the brain is requiredâ€”the observer, the &quot;you&quot; which ultimately utilizes the brain and body. Seems like we're splitting hairs, but it's a potentially significant oversight to think that the brain is the end-all be-all of conscious existence.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You'll be alright dude. Your brain isn't out to get you, it just likes giving you a hard time about stuff once in a while. I recommend trying to relax and drinking some juice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close, but not entirely correct. The area of the brain that you truly identify as &quot;you&quot; is primarily your frontal lobe, the lobe responsible for decision making, judgment, problem solving and so on. Damage to the frontal lobe can often result in complete personality changes. When someone says &quot;my brain did X&quot;, they are most likely referring to parts of the brain which they have no conscious control over.</p></div>		</li>
