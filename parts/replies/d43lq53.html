			<div class="markdown"><p>well first off, its brutal.  We are under weekly/daily pressure to have good returns for our investors.  It all comes down to your verified track record.  We were a small hedge fund until we had 5 years of a solid track record.  After that, money started pouring in.  When we have a down year we hope our investors realize that its just a bump in the road considering we have so many years of quiet, solid returns.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you attribute your performance to? Whats your strategy? How do you think you're differentiated from other funds, and why do you think your fund will outperform as compared with other asset classes, generally? </p>
<p>I work in er and just took the third level of the cfa so I've got some background, and found it amusing and disheartening how half the cfa curriculum focused on teaching tools which could presumably lead to greater ability to analyze securities, but then the other half is teaching that they don't actually work and that investors are better off just going in to indexes and the like. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Our company's hedge fund has about two years so far.  We have heard this story from uncountable numbers of sources.  Things start taking off at three years, and roll at about five years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually, investments in hedge funds are for a period of time: You give me $5 million dollars for five years and at the end of that time I'll give you big profits, promise! They're not meant to be as liquid as mutual funds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all have specific lockup periods. Theyre not as liquid as mutual funds but not as illiquid as pe funds or distressed funds usually (unless the hf is a distressed fund). Usually you can get money out every quarter or so, though sometimes after a year or two. Early withdrawals or withdrawals before a certain period though can result in extra fees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that investors in a hedge fund are partners in the fund as well (limited partner). The assets of the fund are <em>literally</em> owned by the pool of investors, versus the traditional idea of an account.</p>
<p>And to the other person's comment, every hedge fund have partnership agreements that dictate redemption periods. Meaning you can't call the fund and withdraw your money like an etrade account, and with most funds there is a relatively long period of fractional redemptions and minimum investment periods. There are usually special exemptions -- a key man provision allowing a rush if a particular primary partner leaves -- however these restrictions are for the protection of all LPs, because hedge funds often invest in illiquid assets and it can be tactically bad if they were rapidly forced to divest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed that the days of 2&amp;20 in the current environment are mostly done (although I recently saw one guy asking for 3&amp;30... ambitious!)- do you think returns will pick up again as the industry shrinks back a bit?</p>
<p>Also with the whole liquidity provision instead of banks now that prop trading is dead?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as the hedge fund business I assume returns will go up by comparison to the overall market just for the simple fact that if you are the smartest or most talented analyst out there, you will start a hedge because that is where you can get paid the most.  As far as my little corner in the hedge fund business I am less optimistic.. Like you said prop trading is dead and we made our money on sniffing out large prop positions that are about to be covered and getting ahead of that move.  No prop positions = no edge for us.  Kind of a bummer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. I'd like to believe that it'll pick up because we're all so very smart but I suspect some thinning of the herd might help first- and it seems like it's much harder to get startup capital or up to 100m nowadays.</p>
<p>Interesting stuff! Was that not already pretty niche/capacity constrained and squeezed by HFT? Any chance you can get ahead of big ETF/mutual rebalances instead? Thanks for answering!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yep, back in the day things were different! Even some of the big expensive holdouts are reducing their fees now though, or letting long term investors rotate into lower cost share classes, so to have someone (it was a new launch actually) come in at 3&amp;30 was pretty surprising, especially since lots of them nowadays are asking 1.5&amp;15 or less for seed</p></div>		</li>
