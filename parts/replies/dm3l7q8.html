			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay. So I understand where you're coming from. My ex is a news-magazine owner. Before we were exes, he had one of his reporters do an interview with a local politician that is very much anti-Bondi. She basically stonewalled him the entire interview constantly. Even the most basic human questions were met with harsh opposition (she literally answered &quot;how are you?&quot; with &quot;That is neither here nor there.&quot;). How does a journalist get past an inherent bias against an organization? </p>
<p>Edit: the publication is pro-lgbt and the interviewee was an anti-Pam Bondi Republican who is also anti-lgbt</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes subjects already have their minds made up before the interview. I do believe as a journalist it is your job to break those barriers but it's not always possible. Usually if the person agrees to give an interview they are either just being nice or the subject thinks they have something to gain from granting it. </p>
<p>The politician may be a busy person and felt questions like that were wasting their time. Some politicians are also used to talking with media and basically know what they are going to say and not say. Each situation and interview is different though. You have to be able to read the person and appropriately decide on the fly how to adapt your questioning. I interviewed the trade commissioner for Iceland once and being foreign his conversational mannerisms were unlike any other interview I had conducted before. He was no nonsense but answered every question professionally and with detail. I just had to refrain from asking personal questions and keep it short. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd argue it's more of a cultural thing. In some regions, the general public is less tolerant to certain kinds of social behaviour. Lying - or the sometimes as less harmful considered &quot;being cryptic&quot; aka &quot;open to interpretation&quot; kind of talk - is judged differently.</p>
<p>Also, it's interesting to observe that it depends in which areas people are not telling the truth. For example, lying about product features will cause different reactions than lying about your first kiss.</p>
<p>However, different people also will react differently. For some, lying about your first kiss is no big deal - for others it's a crazy lie, labeling you as dishonest. Some people literally rage because of product feature lies, for others it's just &quot;meh, typical marketing strategy, nothing to see here&quot;.</p>
<p>This doesn't always correlate with the actual value or relevance of something in context of society, but mostly from a subjective point of view. </p>
<p>Politics is one of the few topics that impacts pretty much everyone and of that <em>most</em> people are aware. So that's why in some countries people are more upset about the truth not being told because they realize how that might impact their lives.</p>
<p>However, even then it often is just more about the drama than the actual lying. Because if the truth was so important, people wouldn't be so naive to trust everyone all the time and investigate such things on a regular basis. Societies also would have certain measures to prevent lying politicians to become a thing in the first place.</p>
<p>So in the end, <strong>it's all just about the amount of (naive?) trust a society is willing/able to have</strong>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think if you look at each region, you'll find it's not all that different. Stephen Harper was quite selective about who did and didn't ask him questions at press conferences, for example.</p>
<p>And look at what aggressive reporting got the Rebel Media in Canada: temporarily had their access to the Alberta press conferences revoked (and only reinstated after a LOT of badgering), and the leader of the opposition flat out refuses to do interviews with them. Probably doesn't help that their guy in charge is a lunatic who recently fired everyone but <a href="http://www.boredpanda.com/fake-slashed-tire-tweet-laura-loomer/" target="_blank">crazy tire lady</a></p>
<p>You need to be a pretty big name in journalism (in Canada, Peter Mansbridge comes to mind) to be able to ask those hard questions and not get shunned by the government (or whomever you happen to be interviewing). And even then, they still tend to stick to softball questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it might have to do with cultural differences. Im from the south and not just my interviews, but every conversation is a dance and a ritual. The greetings alone are ridiculous and fake. </p></div>		</li>
