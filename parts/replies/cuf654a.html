<p>Sounds like another crazy-sounding syndrome to me. Better get that checked out by a Neuroscientist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's certainly an interesting question, and lends to some thought regarding nature vs. nurture, i.e. is sexual preference genetic or could it be partially caused by formative events? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a news story once about a male that was born slightly deformed... Down there. Because of the way his man bits were somewhat inverted the doctor thought he was a she and did a bit of rearranging to fix 'her' girl bits. She was raised as a girl and it wasn't until she hit puberty that they started to recognize things weren't coming to shape right. It was around then that they discovered she was really a he. The parents opted for surgery to fix the inversion and the kid was a boy again. (It didn't get into details on what the final version was like down there, functionally). Well at this point 'she' had to learn how to be a 'he' and reverse previous learning. Which lead to a really confused child. When the person became an adult he finally saw himself as a he and was also a gay man. </p>
<p>So the question is, did living the formative years as a female influence sexual preference? Maybe the forced change from female to male and dealing with the confusion, being forced to now be straight in contradiction to being straight before... Or maybe it was in the genetic script from the start? </p>
<p>I don't know if it is directly relevant, but there are studies that have shown sexual imprinting. Where an animal was born and the first thing it saw was another species, and it became sexually attracted (tried to mate) with that species as an adult. This even happened with inanimate objects. I seem to remember a safari animal imprinting with a jeep (elephant maybe?) and another story with a ping pong ball. But it's been so many years since I looked into these things so I can't remember exactly. And its bad enough I'm commenting on Reddit at work, let alone trying to search for the above scenarios on our network.  </p>
<p>Edit: I am well aware that deformed testicles would cause abnormal hormones. Although that could play a role in the development, the whole reason it was discovered that he was a male was that he began male puberty as his testicles were intact. They were just inside him. Remember, gay men with perfectly formed testicles exist and are quite common.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, not really. Brain damage that physically alters the brain and changes a person is not nurture. It's mechanical change in the brain. It would be like cutting someone's right arm off and declaring society made them a lefty. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At this point, the consensus seems to have quietly slipped towards the nature side of that answer.</p>
<p>I remember in the 90's when it was a big thing. If it's &quot;nature&quot; it's a disease that can be treated. If it's &quot;nurture&quot;, it's a choice that they can choose not to make. That's what I remember being discussed when the topic came up. We've moved to the nature side of things, but without making a big fuss over it like it was feared there would be.</p>
<p>I personally don't think it's a problem either way, but obviously a lot of people did and some still do. <em>shrugs</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose it would be even harder to draw a conclusion from a single case, given that if someone loses their memory they might also lose their reason for being closeted. They may have been misidentified as one or the other orientation in the first place. </p></div>		</li>
