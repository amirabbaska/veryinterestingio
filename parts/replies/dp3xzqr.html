			<div class="markdown"><p>Only if the metal was below freezing. The metal isn’t colder than the surrounding area, it just causes temperature equilibration to happen more quickly. Go get yourself two pieces of food (I don’t know, chicken or something) and heat them up. Put one of them on a metal plate and another on a plastic plate. After 10 minutes the one on the metal plate will be colder than the one on plastic...but after 3 hours they will both be at room temperature. Just because the heat leaves faster does not mean you will ever get colder than ambient. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is actually simpler than that.</p>
<p>What people don't seem to realize is just how &quot;hot&quot; the human body is. my SKIN is 92'F right now (my hand not even my core)</p>
<p>most of us don't truly grasp the meaning of this fact.</p>
<p>we are &quot;HOT&quot;</p>
<p>the reason this confuses people is its 80'F outside and we are like its so damned hot out.</p>
<p>the reason 80' feels so hot (usually humidity is at the root of it) is because we are &quot;air cooled&quot; so as ambient temp approaches body temp we can't &quot;dump heat&quot; as easily. or sweat to evaporatively cool ourselves.</p>
<p>so when you touch an 80' piece of metal its not COLD by any means but it IS 12' colder than &quot;YOU&quot; are so you perceive the delta in temperature as your hand &quot;warms up&quot; the metal and the metal readily and greedily takes that heat from you.</p>
<p>our brains and lack of knowledge trick us into thinking &quot;ohhh cold&quot; when in reality what we mean and don't fully understand is no. just &quot;cooler than I am&quot; so heat energy moves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible, but difficult. First off, the metal itself needs to be below the freezing point of water. This is because heat transfer is proportional to the difference in temperature (among other things). If your hand is colder than the metal, the metal will warm your hand instead.</p>
<p>Also, any temperature change for the bulk of your hand would take a while, because your hand stores a good amount of heat and doesn't conduct it as well as metal. The skin you touch the metal with might freeze but the rest of your hand would likely stay warm. (Also, your hand is continually getting warm blood from the rest of your body.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Metals are dense (high mass/volume ratio), they're crystalline and they have free electrons.</p>
<p>High density means that every jiggling atom bumps into its neighbors, making them jiggle. The jiggling propagates easily. It wouldn't be that effective if atoms were far away from each other, since they would barely ever meet.</p>
<p>Crystals are neatly organized, they've got a very regular structure. Vibrational waves can propagate quite far with little absorption, allowing the quick transport of energy on long distances. In an amorphous material, waves crash into the mess of atoms and dissipate pretty much immediately, which keeps the energy in place.</p>
<p>Free electrons are able to transfer kinetic energy to neighboring atoms very quickly. They're light, therefore fast, and are barely held in place by the nuclei. In materials that don't conduct electricity, electrons are kind of stuck so can't really transfer kinetic energy very far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same property that makes metals good conductors of electricity.  In metals, the valence (outer) electrons on the atoms are able to move relatively freely between atoms.  This is commonly referred to as an 'electron sea'.</p>
<p>As heat is the vibration of molecules, the free movement of these electrons serve to help 'transmit' this vibration throughout metals better than other materials.</p></div>		</li>
