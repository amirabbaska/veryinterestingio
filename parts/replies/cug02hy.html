			<div class="markdown"><p>So I'm going to try to simplify this for myself, and hopefully I've been understanding this properly.</p>
<p>When a black hole is formed, it actually separates into two regions: the singularity and the event horizon. The singularity is essentially a zone devoid of information (whether or not there is information within the singularity being moot as we cannot actually see into that region). The event horizon is then much like a pearl being built up around a grain of sand as information flows towards the singularity.</p>
<p>This information is, however, now &quot;unreadable.&quot; It's been translated from 3 dimensions to the 2 dimensional surface of the event horizon.</p>
<p>So, if I have all of this correct... Hawking radiation is then particles &quot;striking&quot; the even horizon and knocking bits of information loose?</p>
<p>Just taking this jumble of thought further (again, assuming I'm understanding correctly) the information bubble around the singularity might act as a fluid. This flow of information would, as it is bound to the singularity by gravity, flow across the surface and come together antipodally (I'm imagining flow around a spherical gravitational object). This would allow for the other escape of information we see from black holes, the relativistic jets.</p>
<p>In a sense this also would eliminate the need for a &quot;rotating&quot; black hole. The singularity itself could not be said to rotate, as there's nothing &quot;there&quot; to rotate. The direction of information flow across its surface would be what gives it the appearance of rotation. (If I understand correctly, this describes the Penrose process.)</p>
<p>This is just a bunch of rambling. As usual, Dr. Hawking has blown my mind. It'll be a while before I can even start wrapping my head around this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, so this is one of the great challenges of thinking about black holes, is that we have to think about them in the context of general relativity (the physics of gravity and planets and stars) and quantum theory (the physics of small particles, atoms, light, etc) these theories as you know don't work well with each other.  But that's what makes BH's so exciting!</p>
<p>Some of the concepts you mentioned are incorrect because of this, so let me see if this helps clear things up:</p>
<p>Let's start with a classical black hole, which I can tel you have a good understanding of its basics.  Before hawking, physicists believed that once a black hole formed, it stuck around forever. This is a big no no, so what do to? Hawking figured out that black holes actually radiate light! They &quot;glow&quot; in this sense. The larger the black hole, the dimmer its radiation. How do they do this when NOTHING can escape the black hole?</p>
<p>It turns out that in every point in space, there is a little bit of energy. You've probably heard that energy and mass are interchangeable, so at every point in space, that little tiny piece of &quot;vacuum energy&quot; can actually take the form of particles with mass! So, what you can measure (and you actually measure this in a lab!) is that at every point in space, many trillions of times per second, little pairs of matter and anti matter particles are popping into existence, then they make contact, and turn back into massless energy. </p>
<p>At the event horizon, something profound happens. Whenever a matter-antimatter pair pops into existence, the anti-matter particle gets sucked into the event horizon, and the matter particle is free to roam about the Universe as high energy &quot;Hawking radiation.&quot;  Inside the black hole, that anti-matter particle takes the total mass of the black hole down by one tiny notch. Eventually, the black hole dissolves away over a loooooong time. </p>
<p>It took many years to convince hawking that this special radiation had anything to do with stuff falling into the black hole, but it does!  The event horizon surface, and thus the emitted radiation seem to contain ALL of information from the I falling matter. The underlying reasons of this are still unknown -- that's what we're trying to figure out!</p></div>		</li>

<li>Black holes aren't flat, they are squished spheres. </li>
<li>An object that pulls on itself like a molecule or planet. This creates an instability and thus rotation. Rotation stabalizes around a theoretical axis. Depending on rotation and strength of particle binding effects how squised a sphere you get. </li>

<p>Never said they were flat, just that they were projections onto a 2D surface. The surface of a 3D object is 2D. You can only plot (x,y) on it, even though the object itself may have a 3rd plot. The object that the surface wraps may be any shape... in fact I believe it would be realistically impossible to find a perfectly spherical black hole in nature (any slight variation in matter distribution entering the event horizon would alter its shape through gravitational effect).</p>
</li>
<li>Centrifugal force would certainly play a part in this and there would be a general axis of &quot;rotation&quot;. But if it were, instead of axial rotation, flow over the surface of the singularity--no matter its shape--you would get the same result, though through different mechanics. And it seems to me the results would also be different. Unless I'm completely wrong. Or, perhaps, both are correct and then you have a chicken-or-the-egg scenario, as it would be difficult to tell whether the rotation or the flow began first.
Too, you would have to determine the properties of information in the event horizon. How thin does it spread across the surface of the singularity? How fast does it move? And a lot of other things I can't even begin to pretend to be qualified to ask.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holography still makes sense and is still in play. Holography is a way to solve the information paradox.  Unfortunately, there's another paradox (&quot;AMPS&quot; or &quot;Firewall paradox&quot;... Although the firewall is really a proposed solution, not the actual paradox.)</p>
<p>It goes like this: there are cherished principles of physics.  Namely: unitarity, non-locality, and the equivalence principle. </p>
<p>Black holes seem to only work if one of these isn't true for the case of a black hole. There is absolutely zilch evidence that unitarity or non locality could every be violated, so the AMPS guys proposed that the equivalence principle might break down at the event horizon. The consequence: total incineration before anything could enter the black hole!</p>
<p>So, a good theory of black holes should resolve both the information paradox and the firewall paradox. </p>
<p>Hawking's argument models out going radiation as a &quot;super translation&quot; of the ingoing stuff, so therefore there's no firewall paradox, because the ingoing stuff is fundamentally transformed at the event horizon.  Physics is safe! (If the idea holds true... And that's a BIG if!)</p></div>		</li>
