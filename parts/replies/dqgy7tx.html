<p>Science never really answer why questions. It just answers how questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This clearly isn't the case. Whether science can answer both why and how questions is typically a function of the extent to which the system under analysis is sufficienctly accessible to observation/experiment.</p>
<p>For instance, take &quot;why does the sun rise in the east?&quot;, we are now in a position to answer both the why and how of this query. How: the earth rotates, why: gravity. In contrast &quot;why is there gravity?&quot; asks about processes we simply don't have sufficient access to to answer. Perhaps one day physics will progress to the point we can answer that question. I would certainly hope we are aiming that high. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The &quot;why&quot; is still &quot;how&quot;.  Gravity is not the reason, it's the mechanism.  The world does not &quot;obey&quot; the laws of physics, they only describe our ideas about how the world works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can only say this because of the perspective we now have on gravity/orbits. The nature of science means that answering any why questions exposes new how and why questions about the answer.</p>
<p>Likely you can repose all how questions as why questions. Which would also mean the distinction is meanigless</p>
<p>Nevertheless &quot;why does gravity exist?&quot; (and similar why questions) are unanswerable not because science can't answer Why questions but because we don't yet have access to data needed to answer the question.</p></div>		</li>
