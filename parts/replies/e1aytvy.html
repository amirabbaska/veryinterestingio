			<div class="markdown"><p>they will still be crossmatched after the transfusion has happened (hopefully with specimen collected before the transfusion) - otherwise you will get dual populations in your forward typing.. but able to account for if transfusion has already happened - you will still see incompatible O-neg blood transfused. There are a boatload of other antigens present sans ABO/Rh. </p>
