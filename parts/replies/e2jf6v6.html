			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting note- babies can also be born a “mosaic” trisomy, which means that some of their cells have extra third copies of the chromosome (ex. Chromosome 13), and some are normal cells with only 2. These kids tend to live longer (at least for some of the more fatal chromosomal disorders) and be less affected than those with the traditional non-mosaic trisomy disorders.</p>
<p>Source- my younger brother had (non-mosaic) trisomy 13/patau Syndrome and my mom belonged to an organization for families of kids with trisomy, so we used to get a lot of pamphlets about kids with various disorders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point.  That occurs when a progenitor cell in the embryo (depending on the stage of development &quot;embryo&quot; might not be correct, but I'm already pontificating pretty hard for an ELI5, so embryo it is) has an error in chromosome distribution to the daughter cells rather than it occurring in the sex cells prior to the formation of the zygote.  Thus all the cells &quot;descended&quot; from that progenitor cell has a trisomy but all the other cells are &quot;normal&quot;.  So instead of double the proteins coded for by that chromosome you have an incremental increase proportional to the number of descendant cells of the place where the error occurred.</p>
<p>Mosaicism is actually normal in all genetically female organisms.  As all cells have two X chromosomes, and only one is necessary, one of them is inactivated (producing a coiled bundle of an inactive chromosome called a &quot;Barr body&quot;, but each cell inactivated one at random - so half the cells have one X copy active, the other have the other one active.  This is responsible for the phenomenon of calico cats: only females are calico, and is a result of &quot;patches&quot; of coat worst color is determined by different X chromosome products.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for explaining this. I have the mosaic variant of trisomy 20. I’m male, 28 y/o, alive and well. I’ve wondered why it is that I’m fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the gene for the tau protein is located on chromosome 17 (17q21.1).  You are referring to the amyloid precursor protein
(21q21.3). It is over-expression of this protein that produces Alzheimer's in Down syndrome.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well spotted.  Med school was 20 years ago and some things I don't use much  have clearly gotten rusty.  Thanks for the correction and apologies to those I have wrong info to. Cheers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The chromosomes are numbered in size order, so the smaller numbers have a higher chance of producing more proteins that in excess are incompatible with life.&quot;</p>
<p>Why is this?    The size vs damaging-protein link isn't obvious to me at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that the size corresponds to more genes that produce proteins within the chromosome so there’s just more kinds of proteins vs a smaller chromosome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, that point  wasn't made super clearly.  Chromosomes are long strings of DNA, with many genes (each instructing the cellular machinery how to make a specific protein) just kinda string together.  An analogy that comes to mind that certainly breaks down under enough examination but describes this concept relatively well is that of a VHS tape with several movies recorded on it.  A longer tape filled with random movies will have a higher chance of having a really bad movie on it than a shorter tape.  </p>
<p>It's just that the lower numbered chromosomes in general have more genes on them, and thus a higher chance in broad terms that one or more of those proteins, if over produced, will be harmful.</p>
<p>One might then say, well if there is a higher chance of &quot;bad&quot; proteins with a larger chromosome, shouldn't there be a higher chance of a &quot;helpful&quot; protein?  Theoretically yes,  and certainly this is a significant mechanism in the evolution and adaptation of species over a geologic time scale, but a multicellular organism is such a complicated Rube Goldberg machine of a contraption that it is overwhelmingly more likely that a perturbation will be detrimental than helpful.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh that makes sense.    My confusion was that I interpreted the size-ordering of the chromosomes to be small-&gt;large, couldn't figure put why a small chromosome would be more dangerous   :)      Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
