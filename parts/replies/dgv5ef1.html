			<div class="markdown"><p>Can we clarify what you mean by &quot;shots&quot;? Spirit (liquor) measures vary from country to country. In the UK it can mean either 25 or 35ml - both are legal measures. At home, it could mean a finger shot which is a completely variable amount.</p>
<p>Other countries have 50ml or more spirit measures. Depending on who's reading they could get quite a skewed idea of the quantity involved when you say &quot;24 shots within 1 hour&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It still blows my mind knowing this. When I was at the peak of my alcoholism I was at .4 BAC without having a drink for 5 hours when I  was hospitalized for acute pancreatitis. The doctor couldn't even tell by my behavior that I was drinking because I was completely coherent and talking to him just fine with no slurring in between the screaming in agony. It's crazy what the body can get used to. I was drinking a handle (about 2/3 gallon) of vodka a day for a couple months before my pancreas finally started digesting itself. I can't even imagine how high my BAC was every day before that when I wasn't too sick to drink anymore.</p>
<p>Edit: About a half gallon, not 2/3</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI a &quot;handle&quot; is 1.75 liters, or a little less than half a gallon (3.79 liters).  </p>
<p>It's still a ton for daily drinking, but significantly less than 2/3 of a gallon.  (About 2.5 liters)</p></div>		</li>
