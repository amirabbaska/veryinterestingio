<p>1) Your answer seems to ignore the first part of OP's question, which was about Local Temperatures. There is certainly a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island" target="_blank">Urban Heat Island</a> effect, which can raise nighttime urban temperatures by around 12C over surrounding landscape. This is largely attributed to the paved-spaces in urban areas, which absorb heat during the day and radiate it back out at night. </p>
<p>2) There is much more 'Paved Surface' than just roadways. Parking lots, rooftops, drainage systems and more are all paved and should contribute to the total. I'd venture to say that there are many more times this type of pavement than traditional road-ways. </p>
<p>While researching this, I learned that Concrete has a much higher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo" target="_blank">Albedo</a> than bare-earth or vegetation (meaning it reflects more light back into space),  Asphalt on the other hand has a much lower Albedo. So without more information on the breakdown of what all this 'Paved Surface' is made of, Global-Conclusions look dubious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to what you said, you have to look at the whole energy balance not just albedo. Asphalt will reradiate a lot of that heat as IR whereas vegetation would absorb some energy in photosynthesis and release some energy as evaporated water. Asphalt and concrete can't even hold water, which is a separate problem. It's a complex question.</p></div>		</li>
