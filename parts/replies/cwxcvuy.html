			<div class="markdown"><p>So what about the people who claim that no study has shown unemployment going up after minimum wages increase? Are they wrong? Or does different data show different results?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This could be for any number of reasons. There are many other factors that go into unemployment rates other than wages. Economic models make many assumptions to simplify the world we live in, so its very possible that some of our assumptions are not perfect and that there are other factors that contribute to our model that are not included, not to mention that some models don't seem to work at all in different countries (see: Developmental Economics). Lots of times this results in studies of the real world not lining up smoothly with our economic models.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that <em>no</em> study shows unemployment going up, it's that they can cherry pick some study that didn't measure a change in unemployment. These are easy to find given a small enough sample size (say a small New England state) and a small increase (the minimum wage goes up a few cents). So you end up with a minimum wage hike that affects very few people. Factor in that so few people actually make minimum wage in some areas (suggesting that the minimum wage is close to the natural price of labor anyway) and it's easy to find an example of a minimum wage hike that didn't produce a bump in unemployment that's distinguishable from noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on a bunch of factors. For an obvious one, imagine what would happen to unemployment if the minimum wage was raised to $1000/hour tomorrow. Now this doesn't mean minimum wage is bad, since it's one of the few price floors/ceilings that can potentially outweigh it's negatives with positives. The real trick is what amount it should be. <em>generally speaking</em> the people who actually study and understand this stuff like a minimum wage up to around $9-10 and ideally set regionally instead of federally. The highest any respected economist goes is $12.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is many people have a childlike understanding of the economy. Poor people are poor because they don't have enough to money, so pass a law giving everyone more money and the problems solved. People with college degrees make more money, so make it easy for anyone to get a degree, now everyone will make more money. They don't take into account, once you've devalued the currency or cheapened a college degree, it no longer has the same value it did before you screwed with it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I'm going to make some counterpoints just to rebuke the &quot;its really simple, everyone else is just a child&quot; angle on the economy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>devalued the currency</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm assuming this is in relation to giving people money. Controlled predictable monetary base inflation is not a problem at all for any stable economy. The United States has 1.34 trillion dollars of actual notes in circulation and the federal reserve printed 297 billion dollars of notes last year. The vast majority of money printed replaced money destroyed or unusable, but the monetary base of US dollar notes is inflating.</p>
<p>That number is pretty, since you could call the non-reimbursement of destroyed bank notes that are no longer usable a tax, and just give every American citizen a dozen benjamins each year without having inflated at all.</p>
<p>Of course I'm only talking about the physical paper currency here. The vast majority of federal revenue and debt is dealt in bonds, and an incredible supermajority of USD transactions around the world are digital and never involve the actual paper money. Numbers change on several computers and no physical paper changes hands.</p>
<p>If you are talking about the macroeconomic impact of &quot;new&quot; money being directly injected rather than through quantitative easing it is still an untested hypothesis to take a stable by most measures healthy economy and dramatically increase the monetary base inflation through direct cash injection to citizens. Of course the currency would rapidly lose value, but if its a controlled loss and is not carried out by a failed state (which is what all the hyperinflation stories are really about - states that lose their sovereign monetary authority and thus lose all credibility their money is worth anything in international markets to give it any value).</p>
<p>Remember, monetary inflation hurts those who are already holding the currency. As a percentage of wealth that disproportionately impacts the poor since their savings are often in cash, whereas the savings of the rich are in investments that appreciate against an inflating currency. But if you are offsetting direct money injection with direct cash through a citizens dividend or some such, the rich are in the losing position because they are losing a larger absolute amount of money despite having a smaller portion of their wealth in cash, they would still have an absolute amount of cash money greater than the poor on hand regardless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cheapened a college degree</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This depends on how you perceive the value of a college degree. Besides any job related prospects college obviously has the ancillary benefits of cultural conditioning and life experience. And education has been valued for centuries not for the prospects of the job you can necessarily get with it but by the social benefit of having an informed and knowledgeable citizenry. If you ignore the gate-keeping that the wealthy of the world use degrees for (and remember, they only do it because they <em>can</em> - degree requirements are a symptom, not a root problem, relating to a general decline in available labor to satiate first world economies) there are still practical arguments with obvious reasons why one can take a stance of &quot;college for all&quot; besides ones based around money.</p>
<p>I'm not sure who is actually proposing that by giving everyone a college education they will all make more money, though. Its already demonstrable today with rising numbers of graduating BAs a percentage of the population that the number of college educated graduates have no impact on the number of degree utilizing job offerings. The only growth sector degrees have is in entrepreneurship in relevant segments, and that is barely a register on overall economic health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe so, but the possibility of increased wages is only one factor in education.  We should also consider the benefit of having a highly educated society compared to an uneducated one.</p></div>		</li>
