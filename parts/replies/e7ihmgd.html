			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, the legal definition of a &quot;sundried tomato&quot;, at least in the US, does not actually require them to be dried in the sun.  They're free to use large industrial dehydrators which dry out the fruit much faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, basically all of the energy we use can be traced back to a sun one way or another. Whether its solar energy directly from our sun, wind energy driven by sun-induced pressure differentials creating the movement of air,  chemical energy (from coal, petroleum products) that was solar energy stored by plants millennia ago, or even radioisotopes used to produce nuclear energy which were born in the heart of a dying star as it went supernova, nearly all energy we have available to us can be traced back to a star.</p>
<p>So it's entirely plausible that, regardless of the method used, those &quot;sun-dried tomatoes&quot; could conceivably be described as having been dried by energy from a sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make it sound like it's probably easier to list the energy sources that <em>don't</em> come from a star, so out of curiosity, any ideas?</p>
<p>Fusion of hydrogen (maybe interstellar hydrogen?) comes to mind, with the assumption we can actually get it efficient enough.  Maybe some sort of gravity based source (some kind of tidal generator far outside any solar system?), or some way to harvest background cosmic radiation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sun is just our star, so I don't think nuclear energy fits into sun-powered. Neither does hydroelectric generators (unless you stretch the definition because Oxygen was produced by a star long ago, but then it becomes a useless term since everything that's not hydrogen was too)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tomatoes rotting down into the soil isn't the end game of a strategy to help tomato seedlings; fruits evolved to facilitate seed <em>dispersal</em> by way of animal GI tracts. There's no water-retaining tomato flesh to speak of in faeces after it's been deposited. </p>
<p>For those tomatoes in the wild that do land by the base of the parent plant and rot, the vast majority of each fruit (95% by weight) is only water anyway. There's almost no significant nutrition relative to the tens of seeds inside each that would be competing for a share in each individual tomato fruit's contents. The majority of a tomato's non-water components is carbohydrate, which seedlings make from plentiful carbon dioxide in the air, rather than by taking it up from the soil.</p></div>		</li>
