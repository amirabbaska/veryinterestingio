			<div class="markdown"><p>And further, to generate electricity from the heat off the the Pu 238 you need to create a thermoelectric generator (look up seebeck effect). This requires a cold and a hot side. The fins help reduce overall heat and help create a colder &quot;cold&quot; side. The larger the temperature delta the larger the possible current flow. </p>
<p>Edit: wow, this was aparently popular. Edited a terrible electricity comment that was typed quickly on a phone while pooping...</p>
<p>Edit 2: I knew this came from the Martian, haha! If you liked the movie and haven't read the book for the love of whatever you believe holy READ (or listen to) the Martian. The book is effing amazing, scientifically accurate, and funny as hell. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is an example of when it's wrong to think of heat as an entity instead of a process. Heat (as energy flux vs latent &quot;heat&quot;) is directly proportional to your delta <em>and surface area</em>. The fins <em>increase</em> heat by <em>increasing the surface area</em> thereby increasing power and electricity compared to a no fin case. The temperature difference over the peltier device is a consequence of the difference between reaction rate and energy transfer rate... which is complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat is not the same thing as heat flux (or energy flux as you have called it). Flux is defined as &amp;amp;amp;lt;quantity&gt; / (area <em> time). Heat is the quantity, heat flux is heat per area</em>time. Two related but very different things as shown by the different units, just as distance and velocity are very different things but also related. </p>
<p>For analogy, this is like saying mass and mass flow rate (or, if we divide by cross sectional area, mass flux) are the same thing. Or probably more lay terms, assuming constant density at the interface we have in equivalent terms volume and volumetric flux, where the analogy for temperature is now pressure, and higher pressure translates to more volume of a fluid crammed into smaller volume of a container. So, a greater temperature means more heat in a given (control) volume. </p>
<p>Flux, then, is the rate of transfer of volume or heat into or out of that control volume. Not the actual thing being transferred until we integrate the flux over area and time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly, the RTG in the Curiosity rover produces 2000 W of heat. The heating element on my electric stove at home produces a maximum of 1700 W for the 9&quot; diameter element and 2700 W for the 12&quot; element. </p>
<p>You could use an RTG to boil water, but even large scale steam generators are only about 35% efficient at turning heat into electricity. The RTG on Curiosity turns that 2000W of heat into about 100W of electricity, and does so as a mostly solid state device with no need for water or moving parts. An RTG steam generator might be able to produce 700W of electricity (if you ignore for a moment that big power plant steam turbines are much more efficient than tiny ones) but its going to be big, heavy, and complicated, with fluid water, valves, seals, gaskets, and so on. Not very practical, especially for space exploration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lump of plutonium as used in a NASA RTG glows red-hot sitting in a room by itself. If you splashed it with water it would make steam, and you could use the hot pressurized steam in an engine like any coal, gas, or nuclear plant to generate electricity.</p>
<p>It just wouldn't be very much, being smaller and quite less active than a critically fissioning reactor core. A plutonium Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator is fed on the scraps of that party-sized feast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be possible to construct a steam-powered generator with the amount of Pu238 that's in an RTG. However, the current design is just about ideal for space-based applications.</p>
<p>Since an RTG is powered by the Seebeck effect, there are no moving parts, and a minimum of parts at all. A 50-year-old RTG will work exactly as well as a brand new one, minus losses due to decay. Conversely, a steam generator would have liquids moving around, spinning turbines, all sorts of heavy things that could break.</p>
<p>There is a break-even point where an RTG-type design just can't put out the power that a conventional generator of the same mass could, but the power demands for most space probes are a long way from that point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong: Specifically, the heat is created when the alpha particles collide internally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. An alpha particle cannot penetrate even paper, so if the decay is anywhere deeper than the near surface of the sample, it will most likely stop as a helium nucleus, release its momentum as heat, and abstract two electrons from two atoms nearby, releasing more energy as heat by becoming a more stable helium atom and the something elses being 1/2 charged positive ions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the helium outgas, increasing pressure within the plutonium or the container for the plutonium?  </p>
<p>I understand that the amount of helium produced is small, so perhaps it's more appropriate to ask what would happen if you tried to build an ultra-high-vacuum chamber out of plutonium instead of stainless steel? </p></div>		</li>
