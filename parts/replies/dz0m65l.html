			<div class="markdown"><p>Much of it is due to Larry Flynt and Hustler Magazine.  Jerry Falwell sued the magazine over a parody advertisement they published using his likeness detailing a fictitious &quot;first-time&quot; with his mother that Falwell claimed caused emotional distress.  The case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court, where Falwell lost 8-0, with a ruling that the parody was protected by the First Amendment since Falwell was a public figure and the parody wouldn't have been reasonable considered believable.  </p></div>		</li>
