<p>It is actually a tenet of Judaism that &quot;a Jew is someone born of a Jewish mother.&quot;  This is likely a carryover of the early tribal origins of Judaism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also like to mention that the origins of Hinduism is a complex one to explain. It was a lengthy process of integrating various cultures and societies into a unified <em>way of life</em>. I would also go as far as stating that it's only in the recent times that Hinduism <em>had</em> to become a religion.</p>
<p>One of the simpler explanations I heard from my grandfather was: &quot;A person born below the Sindhu(Indus) river and the Himalayan range is a Hindu. His life is guided by those principles we call Hinduism.&quot; (it's not that great of a translation). This is also why conversion is a strange word for Hindus as there's absolutely no mention of it in any of the holy texts. AFAIK you cannot convert into Hinduism but everyone is welcome to live a life by the principles of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this. There's some interesting parallels here to what you said about Hinduism and to Judaism (check my gilded posts. I wrote out a long piece some months back explaining how Judaism is more a set of guidelines for living than so much of a worshipping a deity kind of thing. It was within a discussion where someone was trying to comprehend how Jews could be atheists or why someone identifies as Jewish without believing in G-d. Sounds like Hinduism is similar then (though Judaism does have formal conversion rituals and requirements for someone who does wish to convert. As well as very basic set of laws that's basically for those who aren't Jewish to follow. To become Jewish means you are now required to follow a much more lengthy and stringent set of laws and so in that sense it's actually easier to not convert. Easier to be a good non Jew than a good Jew). </p>
<p>But anyway, I think I was going off on a tangent with conversion. I think it's interesting that groups like Hinduism and Judaism are so much of a way of life and that in its own way kind of excludes other people from joining or makes it harder, certainly. Whereas say Christian evangelicals just require the sinners prayer and belief in Jesus. Or in Islam if you recite the right phrase you're Muslim. Very much a statement of belief for those two and by no means would I even try to quantify one or the other as better. What's notable is just that it's different. The way of life focus definitely leads to more of a tribal aspect than the statement of belief focus does. </p></div>		</li>

<p>“You shall not intermarry with them; you shall not give your daughter to his son, and you shall not take his daughter for your son, for he will cause your child to turn away from Me, and they will worship the gods of others” (Deuteronomy 7:3–4).</p>
<p>The implication is that children from such a union will be torn away from Judaism. Since the verse states “for he (i.e. a non-Jewish father) will cause your child to turn away . . . ,” this implies that a child born to a Jewish mother is Jewish (“your child”), whereas if a Jewish man marries a non-Jewish woman, the child is not Jewish—and as such there is no concern that “she,” the child’s mother, will turn the child away from Judaism.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even that is under a bit of contention.  There are some who argue that until recently it was passed on from mother or father to child.  Those same people argue that the switch to mother only was because recent (1600's on) raids, pogroms, and other incursions into Jewish life would often leave women pregnant by no fault of her own and with no involvement by anyone else who is Jewish.  Essentially, that the child may be a result of a traumatic event, but they won't shun him/her from the community.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The definition you've given is actually the definition for &quot;monolatry.&quot; Henotheism would be acknowledging that many gods exist, but believing that one is more powerful than the rest and most deserving of worship. Slight distinction, but relevant when talking about the development of ancient Israelite monotheism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did the Jews never try to spread their religion like the other monotheist religions did?</p>
<p>My family on my mother's side is Jewish but their origins are obscure. As far as I know they're all Tunisian, but apparently some of my ancestors came from Italy. Plus there's the whole Ashkenazi/Sephardic thing that I don't really understand, and I'm not sure which one we are, although my grandmother says we're Sephardic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, conversion was never part of the mission statement for the Jews. Jews and Gentiles are beholden to a different set of laws in Judaism (the latter being the Noahide laws), but since Jewish people don't have a concept of heaven/hell, there's less of an impetus to convert. </p>
<p>Broadly speaking, Ashkenazi = Eastern European roots; Sephardic = Middle East/North African roots. So yeah, if your family's from Tunisia you'd be Sephardic. Although I've never really understood this one either; if one were to go back far enough, would we not all be Sephardim? </p>
<p>Edit: The people who have responded explain this better. Essentially, Sephardim = people who were kicked out of Spain/Portugal during the Spanish revolution and went south. Also apparently Jews used to proselytize, but not so much any more. Thanks redditors! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ashkenazi and Sephardic are the two largest ethnic subdivision among Jews. Ashkenazi Jews lived in Europe in the Middle Ages while Sephardics lived in Spain and Portugal, but in the 1490s were expelled and disbursed throughout Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Because many Sephardic Jews immigrated to Islamic countries the term is sometimes erroneously applies to all Jews from these countries (who would be better described as Mizrachi Jews, usually). </p>
<p>Sephardic and Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews don't have significant religious disagreement, but they do have very noticeable differences in tradition, culture and ritual. If you are American, you probably have only encountered Ashkenazi Jews in large numbers but in Israel and Western Europe both communities are common</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't see this as an answer to your question, but the Torah does have provisions towards the conversion of people into their religion. It is stated for example in Exodus that Israel left with many other people from other ethnic groups. There are laws regarding foreigners living in their lands, which might indicate that conversion might not be compulsory, compared to other cultures. There are laws regarding protection of foreign slaves and equal rights for foreigners living in Israel. According to books in the Old Testament, Moses is stated by the bible to have married a black woman, and Solomon married women from different parts of the world.</p>
<p>Regarding the New Testament, something very important to mention is the fact that the word <em>Jew</em> relates of the name of the tribe of Judah, and not of Israel as a whole. According to tradition, tribes of Israel were scattered around the world after the Assirian conquest, whereas the Jews who were taken captive to Babylon were able to return and rebuild their land. You can see this point supported by the salutations at the beginning of letters in the New Testament. Paul, for example, wrote letters to gentiles (non-Israelites) and Israelites (of which some were Jews) living abroad in other parts of Asia.</p>
<p>I personally think (I'm willing to hear other response to my comment!) that this racial vision of Israel is more modern and linked to the view of Jews, their land and their heritage. What it's left out of the picture is what I don't know well, which is the Talmud and other Jewis traditions. Perhaps someone can point us out in that direction.</p></div>		</li>
