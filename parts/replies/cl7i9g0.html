			<div class="markdown"><p>There are surfaces platelets won't stick to, and most of the circuit is coated in it these days, however the oxygenator has a large surface area and isn't able to be covered in the same stuff, so, at least currently, the main problem with clot formation in ECMO circuits is the oxygenator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a nurse, it's a constant struggle to keep most peoples IV's clear and free from clots (aggregated platelets trying to block up the hole). We flush them frequently and even then sometimes they clot of. I've never had a patient who had the same IV for weeks- if you're lucky it will be a week. If they need more long term access they will put in central lines or PICC lines that usually need to be heparinized daily at least to keep them from clogging up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An IV lasting only a week isn't a matter of luck of keeping the line patent. Even if an IV can last longer than this, best practice standards dictate removing an IV and inserting a new catheter after a week to keep infection risks down. The move to central/PICC lines if long term access is needed is because that's what those lines are meant for, unlike peripheral IVs. Also, not all central lines need to be heparinized daily. Ports go an entire month between needing to be heparin locked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No (at least not for long periods with lots of turbulent movement, platelets are more likely to be activated in turbulent flow), people with picc lines or central lines (im assuming thats what you are talking about because you obviously dont leave a normal iv catheter in for that long) must have it flushed with saline and heparin(an anticoagulant) at least once a week or the line will become clogged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least once a <em>month</em>. Ports (non-groshong) have to be flushed and heparin locked once a month. <a href="http://www.bardaccess.com/picc-grosh-cath.php?section=Features" target="_blank">Groshong lines</a> only require a saline lock due to their unique catheter tip valve. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd like to add that these machines do exist. One of the systems used in the ICU is ECMO which is a heart lung machine on steroids.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, and the &quot;blood&quot; being pumped around would need to be more than just &quot;oxygenated&quot; too - the blood is the major transport system of the body and provides not only oxygen but nutrients and hormones/other signalling molecules. </p>
<p>I guess that most of us typically think of blood mostly in an emergency medicine context - when someone has trauma we need to stop blood loss to maintain oxygen supply to the brain. But, in non-emergency and long term situations, the blood is essentially responsible for facilitating near enough every process in the body. The organs like the brain only function and control if there's the blood there to carry its messages around.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, they also are involved in secreting Angiotensin Converting Enzyme. There are drugs that are perscribed for blocking the action of the enzyme to decrease blood pressure in hypertensive patients. So it would definitely decrease blood pressure. </p></div>		</li>
