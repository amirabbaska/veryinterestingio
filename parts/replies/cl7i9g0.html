			<p>There are surfaces platelets won't stick to, and most of the circuit is coated in it these days, however the oxygenator has a large surface area and isn't able to be covered in the same stuff, so, at least currently, the main problem with clot formation in ECMO circuits is the oxygenator.</p>		</li>

			<p>Replacing parts probably means surgery which is a danger in itself. So while the machine may be fixable, you can't keep somebody under a constant state of surgery and recovery. The body will give out eventually. </p>		</li>

			<p>Surgery is a pretty huge shock on the body and it takes a large amount of time and resources to repair itself. Doing that over and over eventually exhausts the body to the point that the patients weakened system will get hit by infection or any number of complications and they will not survive.</p>		</li>

			<p>Infection. Most people don't realise how many billion bacteria coat almost every surface in a hospital. Most every cc of air is full of little floating bacteria clumps. And having your blood circulate outside your body in a hospital is the best way to get those bacteria into your bloodstream. Cue: distributed clotting disorders, septacaemia, etc.<br><br>Oh, and viruses, fungi. Them, too. </p>		</li>

			<p>Themantogoto has the right idea. <br><br>Your body can only handle so much in terms of damage and repair. Surgery can really run your body through the ringer - from the medicines and anesthesia used to the actual cutting in. <br><br>This is why many elderly people live with conditions that are treatable via surgery - many doctors don't want to risk them dying during the operation so they live with the ailment. </p>		</li>

			<p>This actually sounds like a pretty a pretty trivial engineering problem to me. You just need a second oxygenator with a bypass valve built in, so that you avoid the issue of having to 'hot-swap' a crucial piece of life support. Take away that problem and what else is truly stopping an indefinite bypass machine?</p>		</li>

			<p>There are numerous other problems associated with ECMO. You're immune system basically freaks out with all the foreign tissue causing activation of the compliment system among other things. Even changing when out the oxygenator constantly you'll eventually have failure organs like the liver and kidneys. Also, in order to change the Oxygenator you have to how off the entire circuit to put in a new one, so you lose all the blood flow through the system for a few minutes every time.

			<p>The alternative complement pathway binds anything that isn't capable of brushing off the initial C3b.  To my knowledge titanium, nickel, and biocompatible plastics are all subject to this.  I'm sure there are ways to mitigate this such as drug eluting surfaces, anticoagulation, etc. but it's still a real problem.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>My son had ECMO treatment when he was an infant.  What I never quite understood is why the body swells so much in response to the treatment.

			<p>They would need some amount of clotting to heal from the surgery.  If they were able to heal, their only benefit would probably be that they didn't need to take the blood thinners that Total Artificial Heart/Mechanical Valve patients take.</p>		</li>

			<p>The first bit of the circuit to clot is the oxygenator (with obvious problems).  Have you ever run someone on a circuit unanticoagulated??  The fibrin deposition starts early, and the oxygen clot off is a terminal event (young patient, cerebral haemorrhage from anticoagulation, family did not accept turning off the circuit, took longer than you would think)</p>		</li>

			<p>Unfortunately,  and I'm certainly not bragging,  we're &quot;really good&quot; at running patients on ECMO without anti coagulation.  We sacrifice the circuit over the patient, I guess. I once worked ECMO nights for a week straight.  In that one week I did 9 emergent centrifugal head changeouts because THEY clotted off and decoupled BEFORE the oxygenator.  Not a fun week.</p>		</li>

			<p>As a nurse, it's a constant struggle to keep most peoples IV's clear and free from clots (aggregated platelets trying to block up the hole). We flush them frequently and even then sometimes they clot of. I've never had a patient who had the same IV for weeks- if you're lucky it will be a week. If they need more long term access they will put in central lines or PICC lines that usually need to be heparinized daily at least to keep them from clogging up. </p>		</li>

			<p>CDC recommends peripheral IVs stay no longer than 96 hours, due to risk of infection. Does your institution have any protocols on this? <br><br>Signed, fellow RN.</p>		</li>

			<p>I tried to find our protocol without being on our intranet (I'm off for a few days) but I can't seem to find it. I have heard both the 96 hour rule, and also that if it's still working properly and shows no signs of infiltration or irritation that you should leave it in (the thought process being the more often you're sticking someone the more times you're introducing the risk of infection). That being said, I really don't think I've had anyone on my unit who has made it longer than 4 days with the same IV. ER typically sends them up to us with an AC which goes pretty fast since it's right in the crook of your elbow &amp; people move around a lot. When we get a new site we try to get a forearm site, those might last 3-4 days but by that time the patient is usually being discharged or lined up to get a PICC. </p>		</li>

			<p>An IV lasting only a week isn't a matter of luck of keeping the line patent. Even if an IV can last longer than this, best practice standards dictate removing an IV and inserting a new catheter after a week to keep infection risks down. The move to central/PICC lines if long term access is needed is because that's what those lines are meant for, unlike peripheral IVs. Also, not all central lines need to be heparinized daily. Ports go an entire month between needing to be heparin locked. </p>		</li>

			<p>You're totally right on this. I was trying to keep it simple and not go too into depth about the different kinds of ports/central lines/PICC's. And just out of curiosity, because I have no experience with accessing them or using them outside of the hospital, you're talking about not needing to heparinize ports that are not currently accessed correct? Once you access them for use I was always told if you're clamping them off- in other words no fluids are running- you should put 3 mL of heparin in the line, clamp it off and then draw that back off before using it again the next time. What are your thoughts or experiences with this?</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Praddict" target="_blank">Praddict</a>
			<p>Yeah, and in the case of people who walk around with embedded ports, they'll need a heparin flush every now and then just to make sure that the port is still clear if it needs to be accessed for any reason.</p>		</li>

			<p>No (at least not for long periods with lots of turbulent movement, platelets are more likely to be activated in turbulent flow), people with picc lines or central lines (im assuming thats what you are talking about because you obviously dont leave a normal iv catheter in for that long) must have it flushed with saline and heparin(an anticoagulant) at least once a week or the line will become clogged.</p>		</li>

			<p>At least once a <em>month</em>. Ports (non-groshong) have to be flushed and heparin locked once a month. <a href="http://www.bardaccess.com/picc-grosh-cath.php?section=Features" target="_blank">Groshong lines</a> only require a saline lock due to their unique catheter tip valve. </p>		</li>

			<p>True, and the &quot;blood&quot; being pumped around would need to be more than just &quot;oxygenated&quot; too - the blood is the major transport system of the body and provides not only oxygen but nutrients and hormones/other signalling molecules. <br><br>I guess that most of us typically think of blood mostly in an emergency medicine context - when someone has trauma we need to stop blood loss to maintain oxygen supply to the brain. But, in non-emergency and long term situations, the blood is essentially responsible for facilitating near enough every process in the body. The organs like the brain only function and control if there's the blood there to carry its messages around.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Actually, they also are involved in secreting Angiotensin Converting Enzyme. There are drugs that are perscribed for blocking the action of the enzyme to decrease blood pressure in hypertensive patients. So it would definitely decrease blood pressure. </p>		</li>
