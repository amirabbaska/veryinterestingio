			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, thanks to its orbital resonance, Neptune is not the easiest thing to make it collide with. It's probably easier to make it collide with Uranus.</p>
<p>Altering its orbit would certainly take more energy than we're capable of mustering, though. I don't have any math to back this up, but considering that it took one of our biggest rockets to get one of our smallest probes out there, even if we had the explosive capability to alter its orbit in any important way, we'd be at a loss getting those explosives to where they're needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to disagree.</p>
<p>The Pluto flyby cost less than a football stadium (in the US). It was designed to minimize costs and to a certain extent travel time.</p>
<p>If we don't care about that, we could pretty easily build a probe with a lot more delta V, like one of the abandoned nuclear bomb-drives, and get there with whatever payload we could reasonable expect to put into orbit.</p>
<p>Nasa exploration is small scale because they try to make effective use of peanut funding, had to cancel most of the mad science ideas back when public sentiment turned against nukes, and don't generally do things for shits and giggles. The proposed project would solve most of these priorities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While nuclear has a high delta V, the ISP isn't that high compared to other engines.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons the probe wasn't able to orbit the pluto-charon dwarf planets. They put most of the energy into getting there fast, accellerating most of the way, instead of acelerating to get there ans decellerating to be able to orbit.</p>
<p>The ISP prevented the required amount of Delta V to be expelled in the time window they had.</p></div>		</li>

<p>make it collide with Uranus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried to refrain. I really really did.... </p>
<p>However to save myself. I am curious as to what effect this would have on Uranus? Being that is a gas/ice giant? As an addition to this if we could hypothetically collide more or larger sold celestial object with a gas giant (like Jupiter) could we birth a new sun? Or would it cause the gas giant to dissipate? (not sure if this is the right word) and create an ort cloud of sorts? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Heh.</p>

<p>AFAIR you need 13 Jupiters to have enough pressure in the core to initiate a fusion reaction (&quot;ignite&quot; the sun).</p>

<p>It all depends on the collision. It would definitely be possible to slowly drop mass into Jupiter until it <em>ignites</em>. It takes someone with more astrophysics knowledge than me to confirm if two Jupiters could collide in any way to <em>dissipate</em> each other. In my limited knowledge, if the collision generates more energy than the binding energy of each planet (due to the speed of the collision), it should be doable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would probably be a major impact and cause an &quot;environmental&quot; catastrophe, like an asteroid on the Earth. But the gas isn't like, loosely held in place - it'd still be a planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pluto is almost half ice,  so there is a solution in the book SevenEves.  </p>
<p>Bring a nuclear reactor to Pluto and use it to sublimated ice into vapor that ejects to push the planet. Over time you melt enough ice and lower the mass as you push and you can move it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Er that's not at all a solution to the energy problem, for that to actually work you need the water vapor to move at escape velocity, which requires more energy than merely sublimating it. Either way your nuclear reactor still has to generate enough energy to move the planet, the same energy as a big rocket or bomb or whatever, the fact that there's ice on Pluto isn't helpful other than as a material to eject into space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldn't even have to do the second part. Seems like it'd be easier to start distributing the rocky material to Charon and the other moons. Pluto can't re-coalesce if other bodies trap the material. And the escape velocity's got to be pretty low, right?</p></div>		</li>
