<p>Yours is the best answer in the thread. It includes all effects, is nicely organized, and includes a specific example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if the spacecraft hits the speed of light, the final signal that's emitted just after the craft reached light speed would never reach Earth, correct? Also what happens when the spacecraft is travelling towards Earth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there was something like &quot;a spacecraft hitting the speed of light&quot;, on it time would not move any more and it would not send out another signal in the first place.</p>
<p>It's good that relativity theory does not allow any massive body to achieve light speed, because it would lead to lots of weird and contradictory things such as this. What can we say is: In the limit where the speed of the spacecraft approaches that of light, the time between signals goes to infinity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can replace β with -β in the formulas. γ*(1-β) is always smaller than one, so that the signals will arrive more often than once per second.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the signal was emitted at the exact antipode of the ship's velocity, then the signal would be redshifted into nothing. The signal would carry no energy, so it would not exist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mathematically this is the result, but we don't conclude from this that the signal is not emitted, we conclude that we can't travel at C to begin with.</p></div>		</li>
