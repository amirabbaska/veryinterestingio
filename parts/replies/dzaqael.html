			<div class="markdown"><p>Worker bees are not sterile. Their ovaries are underdeveloped and they have not mated. The pheromones released by the queen as well as their diet as a larva suppress their sexual development but in cases where those pheromones go away it is not uncommon for some workers to start laying unfertilized eggs. </p>
<p>We also see worker laying in <em>apis mellifera capensis</em> the race of honey bees native to South Africa where female workers often turn into laying workers and can destroy hives of non <em>capensis</em> races by laying only drones and overwhelming the hive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct.....if a queen dies without a replacement or without a fertile queen cell, a few workers will start laying eggs in her stead. Their eggs will produce only drones (male bees) and the hive will eventually die out. A good beekeeper can usually tell if the hive is not queen-right when he goes into the hive. There are subtle signs to seasoned beekeeper. Excessive amount of drone cells is a dead giveaway! You can replace the queen with a new queen if you catch it in time and all be well if they accept her, which they usually do 90% of the time.</p></div>		</li>
