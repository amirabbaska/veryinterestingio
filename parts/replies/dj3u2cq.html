<p>For people looking up info on people in Lexis itself, they either only have access to publically available records (addresses, death records, criminal records... these are all public info) but anything more in depth requires special authorization. Private Investigators can get this authorization as I recall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from private investigators, law enforcement and financial institutions have that authorization as well.  I work in the financial sector as manager of a collections department.  We frequently use Lexis to find debtors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I do not know ALL of the information available about the dead person, but I know things like name, spouse's name, parents' name are available. Additionally, information about debts and property owned by the deceased are things I know are available.</p>

<p>Yes, they're listed on &quot;Death Certificates&quot;, and look similar to a birth certificate. </p></div>		</li>

People keep saying that it's only &quot;publicly available information.&quot; This is not the case, pay a lawyer to have a report generated on you, you'll be amazed what all is on it.</p></div>		</li>
