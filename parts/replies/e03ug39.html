			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s headroom in the frequency response. Typically, speaker drivers will have a reasonably flat frequency response, except for the ends of their useful range, where it tapers of. If the goal is to have a flat frequency responce for the entire audible range, manufacturers make the useful range wider, thus putting the non-flat bits outside of the audible range</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at a frequency response chart of most speakers or headphones, there is usually a <em>dramatic</em> dropoff at around 12khz.  They will advertise a 20khz top frequency, but in reality the response at that frequency is usually pretty minimal.</p>
<p>This is fine, considering most human hearing drops off much the same. 20khz is more less the absolute upper limit of human hearing, but most people can’t hear it at all after about age 35.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An audio amplifier or speaker that is capable of playing much louder than you need and at frequencies much higher than you need will sound better at the levels and frequencies you actually listen to. </p>

<p>All of this is captured in the transfer function of the speaker. The portions above 20 kHz are irrelevant</p></div>		</li>
