			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always assumed the Oval Office is just a stage room and nothing actually goes on in there unless there's a photo op or a questionable dignitary visiting.  Like if you only ever let your grubby friends hang out in the living room but your real man cave is in the basement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  The oval is a secured room like the situation room.  Work and sensative information is exchanged there.  Daily NSA briefs are done there.  The red phone was located there.  Nixon was impeached for what was said in that office and recorded by him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this.  If the information is sensitive enough, there's probably a few SCIFs in the white house where they discuss it.  The president even spend much time in the oval office?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on the preference of the President. Obama for example was not known to use the Oval Office for much other than fluff (photo ops, ceremonial bill signings, etc...). He didn't even like addressing the nation from the Oval, there was a specific hallway he liked to use for that I believe.</p>
<p>Most of the really sensitive national security stuff is definitely going to happen in the Situation Room which is as secure as it gets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not THAT, though there probably is an aide or someone who literally is tasked with digging through couch cushions, looking under all furniture, etc etc after every meeting to catch anything the secret service might not have detected or similar and then remove and/or dispose of what they find. </p>
<p>Plus, it's just good housekeeping. I've never seen a messy oval office photo except in one or two cases of historic events, and even then that really wasn't too disheveled!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How unlikely would it be to get a traceable source? Obviously were dealing with hypothetical situations, so if they reset the room a couple times a day, it wouldnt be hard to say, okay, these people were in there, so this bugged pen (or whatever) we found in this couch cushion mustve belonged to one of them.  Well these 3 people sat on this couch.  I doubt it would be difficult to figure out.  Regardless, im sure most items 'forgotten' in the oval office are innocuous. For someone trying to record stuff it wouldnt just be a spy pen i could get at spys r us at the local outlet mall. It would have to be high tech and worth the risk.  Those are what the maids and secret service would notice, and would want examined.  </p>
<p>I wouldnt be surprised if this type of stuff didnt happen regularly and is just swept under the rug.  Why would they tell anyone about it?  If the public heard that sweden was tapping us, what we do with that info besides go crazy one way or the other?  And if it was a country we already have beef with, they probably would never get the chance to do that. And if it was some north korean 007 spy movie mole operative type shit, some fantastic shit that only happens in oceans 11, i think the original idea of the maids noticing or one of the aides or secret service would  somehow or another notice a peculiarity in whatever object it was. Youd have to be damn good at replicating and placing and retrieving an object, and on top of that know that they were going to discuss in full detail some state secret well in advance in that particular room.</p></div>		</li>
