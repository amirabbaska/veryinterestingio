			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Dietitian here. There are established Upper limits (UL) for most (not all) vitamins/minerals. I remember we did a meta analysis on taking &quot;antioxidant&quot; supplements (this was the big thing when I was in undergrad). This includes vitamin A, C, E among other things. I remember a group of doctors did a study with the effects of vitamin E and the high intake lead to increased bleeding and created a brain bleed in one physician; the study was halted. A, D, E and K are fat soluble vitamins. Also, most commercial packaged foods are fortified with vitamins and minerals now (grains by law with iron/folate/Vit B) and I personally believe that supplementation is in no way necessary unless you are deficient in a vitamin/mineral and cannot consume effective amounts from food sources.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. We don't know what &quot;healthy&quot; serum vitamin D levels even are. It's crazy- current 'estimated' levels suggest 20-50 ng/dL of 25-OH D (Vit D2- is activated into D3 by the kidneys). Even lab tests say on them when a D panel is ran something about that is what research suggests. Apparently, everyone is deficient. I work in behavioral health and many of my patients have seizure disorder. Depakote/Valproic Acid increases the turnover of vitamin D in the body,
So most of my patients do take a supplement per their physician. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you are saying but what about a person who works out or regularly exercises. They are doing 2 to 100 times more work than the average sitting person which the daily values are based on.</p>
<p>I used to be super obsessed with vitamins, worrying about bio availability and looking into getting liquid vitamins and all that crazy shit. Now I just take a MV for peace of mind. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Regular multi vitamins don't make me feel any different, healthwise. Can you take prenatals if you're not pregnant?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prenatal vitamins have more folate and iron (more blood volume gained during pregnancy= lesser concentration of red blood cells/iron/oxygen, folate is recommended as the neural tube develops in the first trimester- folic acid is essential in preventing spina bifida. [i did read the study on folic acid in pregnancy and autism, very interesting ]). There are some other increased vitamins/minerals. I also want to say that prenatal vitamins have a different coating, but that may be my imagination. There is no harm in taking a prenatal if not pregnant. They actually recommend it for women of child-bearing age, because most don't find out they are until a few weeks-month or so in and the neural tube is already developing. You will just pee out everything your body doesn't need, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be followed that since vitamins in general don't absorb well unless eaten with food (Make sure to eat with a meal or snack!), they make up for it by simply putting extra in there of the vitamins that don't really harm you if you get extra.  </p>
<p>That way even if you take it when your body wouldn't normally absorb it well, by having a large amount, you have a better chance of absorbing more of it and thereby getting your recommended amount. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some vitamins are not as bioavailable as others so a higher percentage needs to be taken as your body only absorbs a fraction of what's there.
Sometimes this can be increased if taken with fatty oils/foods.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot; The findings have not been peer-reviewed or published in a journal; the press release referred only to a brief scientific abstract that is being presented at a conference this week.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if the findings hold up to the scrutiny of peer review and, so, warrant publication in a medical journal. Even if they do, after that, the correlation would need to be seen again, and again, in multiple studies, before it could reliably be said to exist. &quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting that they distinguished between synthetic supplements and natural food occurring folate.
You do in fact store B12 in your liver, because it's the only B vitamin that only occurs in animal products, and eating meat every day is a fairly recent addition to the human diet we've evolved to store it. </p>
<p>I think more research is needed to find out if synthetic folate is not processed the same way as naturally occurring folic acid and therefore stored in our fat cells as a toxin. </p></div>		</li>
