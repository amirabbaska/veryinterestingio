			<div class="markdown"><p>For clarification, I am not saying the &quot;going down the wrong tube&quot; quote is an accurate representation of what is actually happening inside our bodies, but rather was using the quote to try and help the community recognize the unpleasant pain that I was referring to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it actually is an accurate representation.  You swallow something like water and it goes into your trachea instead of your esophagus, hence the wrong pipe.  Your cough reflex should kick in and be able to get the water out of your trachea.  If you didn't have a cough reflex, you would aspirate the stuff into your lungs and you could get pneumonia.</p>
<p>But then there's another phenomena that /u/s6xpoolsc is referring to as well.  When you're eating and swallowing too fast, which causes your esophagus to spasm and causing pain as it follows the food down.  I know I get that a lot when I'm just wolfing food down when I'm high.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was eating out a few weeks ago and had the latter occur to me in a restaurant. I remember swallowing food and water as well as a ton of air all at the same time, and having it be very painful. Then I remember waking up at the table with everyone around me staring. I was really confused, they said I was unconscious for about 30 seconds</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I had an episode of Vasovagal Syncope. Basically I swallowed something so big it impinged my vagus nerve which in turn dropped my heart rate and BP rapidly causing me to black out. It took me about 5 minutes after I regained consciousness before I pieced that together, I was scared until it made sense.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a third pain, one that I wish on no one.</p>
<p>Imagine you're thirsty and have a large glass of water.  You take two big gulps.  The first one goes down and your muscles constrict to push the water down.</p>
<p>Before the muscles release, you force the second gulp into your throat.  It goes down the right tube.. But the tube is blocked.  Due to your thirst, you were drinking quickly, and the fat moving water note has nowhere to go.</p>
<p>It suddenly stops, and the force of the water above it pushes it out at the sides, pushing against the side of your throat and causing a very uncomfortable pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you've still described two different phenomena. When someone says &quot;went down the wrong tube,&quot; they're referring to something (usually a liquid) going down your breathing tube, causing you to reflexively cough, beyond your control. </p>
<p>When you &quot;swallow something wrong&quot; it goes down the right tube, but seems to sort of get stuck in your throat somehow. Doesn't always cause you to cough, but it is uncomfortable, and slightly painful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe what you are describing is when the food or drink gets caught within the ring of the peristaltic wave rather than being pushed just ahead of it.   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peristalsis" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peristalsis</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. I've done this a bunch. Is it soda that you're drinking? Sometimes I think it's because the soda was carbonated and expanded further on a max sized gulp causing the pain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people when saying it went down the wrong tube refer to food or water going into the tube going to their lungs (trachea/larynx) rather then the tube to the stomach (esophagus).  This is usually followed by vigorous coughing.</p></div>		</li>
