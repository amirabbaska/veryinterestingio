			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason grog was a stable on ships in the old days was because water would go bad after a while, but the grog had a low enough alcohol content to keep crewmen from getting drunk while sterilizing the water within it to keep it fresh.  Our ancestors also really liked Galapagos turtles because they tasted great and could store about 50 lbs of freshwater inside of their bodies.  They also didn't need to be feed or hydrated very often...  It was like having a living barrel of fresh water on board that was edible and delicious.<br />
Edit: I guess grog didn't sterilize water at all to the point of what I thought... I guess it just made water drinkable a little bit longer while getting people buzzed while they were possibly sailing to their death by attrition...  I stand by my turtle comments though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The turtle has a sac of flesh in its body that absorbs water and keeps it there, purified and ready to drink, for the turtle.  That is how they are evolved to survive in both the short and long run.  We first learned this by eating those turtles, in process discovered that they have that giant sack of fresh water buried in them.  So we basically kill and butcher the turtle, remove the contained fresh water sack from beneath its shell, drink the fresh water, and enjoy the savory turtle meat as an extra bonus to surviving on a ship sailing across oceans at a very slow pace sometimes.<br />
The reason Galapagos turtles are nearly extinct is because they apparently taste delicious and contain a bunch of fresh water within their bodies as a survival extinct.<br />
Edit:  Freshwater, nutrition, and morale on ships were a big deal back in the day because ships moved a lot slower, at the behest of the winds and currents they rode.  Having a couple of Galapagos turtles could make the difference between survival and death in some situations for the old school sea travelers.  Having a delicious, fresh meal was just a happy byproduct.</p></div>		</li>

<p>how do you make a cooking fire on a wooden ship without burning down the ship?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FAT TOM is the mnemonic device used in the food service industry to describe the six favorable conditions required for the growth of foodborne pathogens.</p>
<ul>
<li>F = Food - there needs to be something they'll eat.  Well, food is food...</li>
<li>A = Acid - it needs to be the right pH.  If something is too basic or too acidic, the bacteria and other pathogens won't grow.  4.6 to 7.5 is what they like, with the sweet spot being 6.6 to 7.5.</li>
<li>T = Time - the pathogens grow on a <del>logarithmic</del> exponential scale.  Your body can generally easily fight off small amounts, but when they grow too large it's too difficult.</li>
<li>T = Temperature - food should be stored below 40 degrees Fahrenheit, or above 135 degrees Fahrenheit because they thrive between those temperatures, with the sweet spot being 70 to 104 degrees.  If I remember correctly, food service doesn't allow anything to be held within those two temperatures for more than 2 hours.</li>
<li>O = Oxygen - most foodborne pathogens need oxygen to grow.  There are exceptions, like botulism, but for the most part there needs to be an oxygen rich environment.</li>
<li>M = Moisture - there needs to be enough water activity for the pathogens to grow.</li>
</ul>
<p>So for beef jerky there's low water activity.  For things that people have canned the oxygen has been removed from the environment.  With sauerkraut it's the acidity that's been changed.  Sauerkraut, kimchi and other fermented foods have a pH in the 3 to 4 range, usually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For canned goods, isn't the usual safety mechanism that the can is heat-processed after being sealed, so all the bacteria inside are killed and new ones can't get inside?   Or some of them survive the heat treatment, but can't multiply due to lack of oxygen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salt doesn't stop bacteria growth in sauerkraut. In fact, the sour taste of sauerkraut is because of bacteria. Lactibacillus convert sugars in the cabbage and brine to acid.</p>
<p>Lactobacillus is quite salt tolerant and the salt in the brine helps it achieve dominance over other potential bacteria. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfectly right. I just want to add, for the five-year-olds, that not all bacteria are dangerous. <em>Lactobacillus</em> is one of the good ones and it doesn’t make us sick, but instead outcompetes other bacteria and so have a protective effect. <em>Lactobacillus</em> gives us sauerkraut, kimchi, yoghurt, smetana and is in fact found naturally in the vaginas of humans and several other mammals — all because of the protection against other bacteria.</p></div>		</li>
