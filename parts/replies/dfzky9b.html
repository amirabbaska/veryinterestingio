			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not 100% sure if this answers OP's question. Your response correctly recognizes that the gravity field due to, for example, the earth is going to fluctuate proportionally with changes in the density of the earth. But I understood the question to assume a uniform mass, essentially asking &quot;is Newton's law of universal gravitation exactly true for all points or is it an average&quot;. The answer to that is, as far as I know, that gravity is perfectly distributed, does not fluctuate, and has no hot or cold spots. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, uniform mass does not equate to a uniform distribution of gravity. Even though uniform density is what prevents hot and cold spots of gravity in an object, the object's shape and environment also play a very large role; a spherical mass is less likely to have hotspots than an L shaped object.</p>
<p>It's also worth note that gravity is measured in units of acceleration from a reference point. There is 0 perceivable acceleration in the center of gravity of an object, yet the gravity (perceived) on the outer surface of a sphere is much higher than the sphere's center, where gravitational forces are cancelled out by eachother.</p>
<p>Therefore the map of an object's gravity is not constant with uniform mass, but is constant in a spherical mass of uniform density. Your scenario of a sphere with uniform density is the exception, rather than the rule.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this not the case (about electromagnetism, not my microwave)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. We know from quantum theory that all matter at the quantum level is chaotic and unpredictable. Therefore, the quantum answer is: yes there are hot and cold spots. Not to mention the existence of gravitational wavesâ€”these have been experimentally confirmed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NASA's GRACE mission uses gravity to essentially measure changes in the Earth's mass distribution. It can be used to measure polar ice volumetric change, ground water content, and surface pressure. </p>
<p>It does this by measuring the distance between two satellites flying in formation. The closer they get, the more they are affected by gravity, and thus the more mass that is underneath them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gravity on earth isn't equal and there are spots where there's more gravity than others. In fact, there are places where the sea level is 100 meters higher than at other points due to this fact. </p>
