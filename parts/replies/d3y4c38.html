			<div class="markdown"><p>So this third party is what is called a debt collector?</p>
<p>And are the rights to the loan completely transferred to the third party? I guess this must be the case since John Oliver was able to forgive the debt on his own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes and yes. The fact that the loan is completely transferred is how the debt collectors make money- they buy the loan for pennies on the dollar, and then as long as they get more money than they paid for it, they're making money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't get the second part of it. Why would a bank or any other institution agree to get less money for a loan by selling the rights to a debt collector when they could make more money on their own? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;pennies on the dollar&quot; is a bit of a misnomer.  When collection agencies buy debt from a company they get it for more than pennies on the dollar.  They'll typically get about 30% then the company calls you and they can try to collect.  Generally, they will only make you pay a certain percentage of the initial debt which gets you a break and them a profits (usually 200%).  If they can't collect, then they will sell to someone to recoup their costs somewhat and then THAT person is paying about 10% and if they cant collect, they can sell it then that person is paying pennies on the dollar.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity, could the banks write off any sort of losses from not fully collecting on the outstanding debts after they sold the rights to the debt collectors? Or, since the Banks or loan services sold the rights to a third party, even for a very small sum compared to the debt amount, then they accept the loss and move on?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in this instance.</p>
<p>There are two different types of &quot;debt collectors&quot;. The first is also called a <em>collections agency</em>. They don't actually buy the debt, they agree to track it down for the original creditor in exchange for a sizable portion of the payment. When this happens, the debt is still owed to the original creditor, but the collections agency is authorized to collect it. They will often settle your debt for less, but they will not drop it entirely, because that isn't what they were hired to do.</p>
<p>The second type is also called a <em>junk debt buyer</em>. They buy the debt outright. At that point, they hold the rights to the loan entirely and can do what they want with it, including writing it off entirely as John Oliver did.</p>
<p>In general, it's more difficult to eliminate a debt of yours if it's in the hands of a collections agency -- they're less likely to settle for a drastically lower amount, and if you somehow get them to back off with the debt still unpaid, the original creditor can just hire another collections agency. A junk debt buyer may be more willing to settle for less, and if you get them to back off, there's nobody left to pay. However, there is a greater tendency among junk debt buyers to violate fair debt collection practices, as they aren't answerable to the original creditor, and they have a much higher reputation of being unscrupulous. (With the exception of John Oliver, of course.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But he sent it to a charity or something, right?  That's the point I don't get. How can he just decide to do that, and if he just decides, why doesn't everyone?</p>
<p>Wouldn't the charity who forgives debt have to choose <em>you</em>, not the other way around?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally that is how it works. The charity he sent it to [RIP Medical Debt] (<a href="https://www.ripmedicaldebt.org/how-it-works/" target="_blank">https://www.ripmedicaldebt.org/how-it-works/</a>) normally studies portfolios and decides which debts to purchase and forgive. I suspect they were more than happy to get the recognition he brought to their work by accepting Oliver's debts even if they might not be ones they normally take. </p>
<p>I'd really like to see more on how they work normally though. Debts are often sold in big groups so you wouldn't normally get to cherry pick individual debts. Maybe they just target medical bills that are severely delinquent? Also they say that they structure it in a way that ends up with no tax liability to the debtor (normally having a debt forgiven is counted as income to the IRS) and I'd like to see how they handle that too. I guess if they keep it below a certain amount per person they could eliminate their own gift tax expense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is a quote from their website:  <a href="https://www.ripmedicaldebt.org/about-rip/" target="_blank">&quot;Once this debt is in our possession, it is abolished as a gift from RIP to the patient. No strings attached.&quot;</a></p>
<p>Here's some analysis of the tax implications by another organization that seems to be doing the same thing:</p>
<p>Miller, Kunstler, and Hrbek told Tax Analysts that forgiveness of the debt does not result in income to the debtor if that forgiveness comes from a detached and disinterested generosity. Lion said these debtors seem to have a good case that they’re receiving an exempt gift rather than a taxable gain. Mayer agreed, saying the debt forgiveness counts as a gift under section 102. He said that when Rolling Jubilee buys the debt, it doesn’t know who the beneficiaries are but discharges the debt purely out of a desire to benefit those who incurred it.</p>
<p>“It seems to be that’s about as detached and disinterested as you can get,” Mayer said. “The one weird thing is usually you don’t think of entities being detached and disinterested givers — you just think of individuals.”</p>
<p>Robert Willens of Robert Willens LLC said he believes the IRS would resist the characterization of these cancellations of debt as gifts but that they’ll “get lost” in the reporting process anyway.</p>
<p>“Since there’s no way for the IRS to verify all this, there won’t be much enforcement on their part,” Willens said. “That’s not the way we like to do tax planning, but I guess it could work.”</p>
<p>Mayer said he doesn’t expect immediate IRS movement regarding any aspect of the Rolling Jubilee program. Unless the dollar volume grows higher or there’s an indication of someone with Rolling Jubilee personally profiting, it won’t be a high priority for the IRS, he said.</p>
<p>Mayer said he doesn’t think the IRS would act “until at least an initial Form 990 is filed,” adding, “Even then, of course, the IRS has three years at minimum to audit the 990, and they may or may not bother to do so depending on their other priorities.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He used the assistance of a charity to handle some legal and logical issues, but that's not an important factor in what happened. He bought the debt, and then forgave the debt that he owned (essentially). Neither he nor the charity could forgive debt they don't own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>he paid for the debt, the charity just does the leg work to make sure the people dont have to pay taxes on the forgiven debt.</p>
<p>If he pays off the debt it counts as income and is taxable.</p>
<p>If he forgives the debt its not taxable.</p>
<p>the charity does the legal paper work to make sure the people being forgiven don't get screwed over (owe a ton of taxes when they didn't really have to pay the debt anyways).</p>
<p>basically, if its handled wrong, hes doing way more harm than good.  the charity specializes in doing it right.</p></div>		</li>
