<p>Currently, the National Electric Code (U. S. A.) requires a receptacle every so many feet, so walls pretty much have to have them.  You can divide rooms with just flat panels, but if they exceed a certain length, you have to figure out how to put power where the code tells you to put it.  If the panels slide, or move in some way, I guess that would be a door, and would eliminate the need.</p></div>		</li>
