<p>I always felt like this issue demonstrated one of the core problems with the way that Hillary ran her campaign: she went into defensive 'damage control' mode way too easily, when people wanted sincerity.</p>
<p>With this issue in particular, she refused to admit her own prior record on the issue and explain why she'd changed her mind. She instead sense to want to pretend that she had never <em>really</em> opposed gay marriage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With the gay marriage thing, it wasn't the fact that she changed her mind on the topic, but it was that she had openly said on the Senate floor that marriage is a special bond between a man and a woman, and then during her run for president claimed she was a gay rights supporter with no mention of her past. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I would have easily accepted her changing her mind on the topic, especially if she articulated her thinking on the matter, as obviously a ton of people changed their minds over that ten-year period. </p>
<p>Instead she refused to acknowledge it at all, which just made her vulnerable considering that she's on the record on video saying the opposite.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fuck that. Hillary acted like she always was in favor of gay marriage when she was very clearly against it. It would have been fine in my eyes if she had said &quot;I used to be against it but now I realize xxx&quot; (even though that may still be bs) or &quot;I am still personally against it but I accept that public opinion has changed blabla&quot; but she was just completely insincere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I would very much like to live in the reality where politicians pander <em>occasionally</em> :) </p></div>		</li>
