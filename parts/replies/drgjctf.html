			<div class="markdown"><p>Or put another way, take two of the same animal - one with a short life gene and another with a longer life gene, if both of them produce the same number of offspring then there is no evolutionary pressure for the long or shorter life span. It's only when one manages to out survive the other in the game of successful reproduction do we get longer or shorter lifespans.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Once the longer lifespan animal has had the appropriate amount of offspring, the parents then have to compete with their offspring for the scarcity of food.  When shorter lifespan animals die out, the offspring of those animals can fill the 'niches' in the animal ecosystem.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In other words, shorter lived lifeforms allow for faster adaptation by &quot;cycling&quot; generations faster.  This is part of why bacteria gain antibiotic resistance relatively easily.  (Another part is that bacteria can share DNA, unlike more complicated organisms)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're basically saying &quot;if there's more of a species that's bad for the species because more competition&quot;, that doesn't make sense. You're right that if you only look at the offspring, they have slightly more competition, but the species as a whole isn't worse off because of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the answer is from an evolutionary perspective, but not exactly that way, it is more like animals that randomly live more would bear more offspring that live more also and thus lengthening the lifespan of the species, but only if living more is a &quot;helpful&quot; factor for reproduction, which could very well not be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you and jas_far are saying is equivalent. Of course species don't &quot;invest&quot; or &quot;analyze&quot; their strategic choices, and it's all implicitly done by natural selection--but it (finalism) is a useful perspective and evolutionary biologists are trained to be able to jump from one to the other and/or see both at the same time, or simply as the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>From an evolutionary perspective, if an animal is likely to be eaten early on in its life, it doesn't make sense for that species to invest energy on lengthening its life. More likely, it would invest its energy in producing as many offspring as quickly as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, to what end? What's the point of popping out hordes of babies if they're not around long enough to take in more of life's experiences?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quality of life doesn't matter for evolution, as long as the genes are passed on to the next generation. They can live for a day as long as they reproduce and the offspring also survive long enough to reproduce and so on. Evolution isn't some active force improving organisms, it's just a side effect of genes being favored that increase survival and reproduction</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there is no end, it's just pretty much random circumstance of evolution</p>
<p>If your species is getting eaten early on in life and you have a mutation that helps you make 10x as many babies as the normal amount for your species, then you're more likely to end up with more children that escape getting eaten. Then those children will have your genes and will likely also be able to have as many children as you did. Eventually the species will have evolved to have a large number of children simply because the individuals that had more children had more of them survive.</p>
<p>Obviously this is oversimplified and there's alot of more variables and such that are thrown in.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGL4HPuFKZA" target="_blank">here's</a> a video that might explain it better. He does make it more about the genes but I don't really agree with that.</p></div>		</li>
