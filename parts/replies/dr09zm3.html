<p>Doesn't that depend where you stand?</p>
<p>If you walk around the machine and face it from the other side, the headstock is now on your left. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but I imagine that you would want the cutting surface of your tool to be pointing upward, just for visibility. So if you want both that and to operate the carriage with your right hand there is only one way you can set a lathe up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point about the direction of rotation. That's what I was missing. </p>
<p>It wouldn't be just about visibility. The ability to brace the tool would be more important. If you stood at the &quot;back&quot; side where the work surface is turning upward toward you, and placed a tool against the surface, the rotation would tend to force the tool up and away instead of letting it bite in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, look at the hand controls on the picture. That's the side the operator must stand on when running the lathe.</p></div>		</li>
