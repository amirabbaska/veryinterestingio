			<div class="markdown"><p>this is the best answer. it has more to do with the materials available to build wings than engines. see gliders. no engines so they have the most efficient wings possible to make with the materials at the time.</p>
<p>wings are more efficient the thinner they are while being as long as possible, in fact the most efficient wing is infinitely long,ish.</p>
<p>modern bi planes are completely moment of inertia and surface area driven, also street cred. it's harder to spin big wings through the air compared to small wings. you could fly with 1 small wing and spin very quickly (modern fighters) but you have to fly so fast it sucks for an airshow.</p>

<p>Wait, why is there a question mark at the end of that? When you went to work today, did you design aircraft? If so, we've cleared that up and you probably do indeed design aircraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not only the extra structure that increases drag. The lower span of a biplane also results in stronger tip vortices which leads to an increase in induced drag. </p></div>		</li>
