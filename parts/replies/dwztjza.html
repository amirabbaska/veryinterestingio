			<div class="markdown"><p>I have noticed that my English sounds worse than I think it does. In my head, I am accentless. People tell me the same thing, but when I listen to recordings of my own voice I can hear an accent that doesn't exist in my head! Annoying! And I don't have the slightest clue how to correct it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do. And for the most part people can't tell I'm not local. At most they will say I sound Canadian (which I don't really agree with). But I exercise a lot more scrutiny, I work with languages and translations, so I get very particular about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah it doesn't really. My parents emigrated from a European country to another European country before I was born.</p>
<p>My first 5-6 years I spoke my mothertounge at home, and then progressively shifted to the national language when I started school. I still have the accent of my mothertounge even though I cannot speak it fluently now as an adult. It doesn't fade away it's like my mouth is stuck that way. </p>
<p>So, when I speak English I've basically got two accents. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An incredibly long time. I've worked in the UK with some colleagues for 10-20 years, and I can hear a similar non-native accent to that I heard when I met them. People from their home country (e.g. US, India) can hear the difference but it's still strong to me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is no such thing as being accentless. Even the very first speakers of English, in whatever form you like, had accents. Everyone has an accent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not that objective, accent is a quality determined by the <em>listener's expectation of standard speech</em>. Speech alone has no discernible accent until it is heard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I do impressions, I raise my voice slightly to compensate.  It seems to work when I hear a recording of myself.  I have to do it consciously until it works.  Then I can just go with it.</p>
<p>I'm not a great impressionist, but I'm pretty good.</p>
<p>My Michael Caine is terrible.  It sounds like Michael Caine's Michael Caine impression.</p></div>		</li>
