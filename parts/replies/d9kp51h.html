			<div class="markdown"><p>Pulmonary nurse here; This is called Aspiration. Most people would start coughing very hard and feel very uncomfortable. If food gets low enough, you can't effectively cough it out and it needs to be removed through a Bronchoscopy procedure or in worse case, surgery.</p>
<p>Most people will not have this problem unless they have reduced ability to swallow effectively such as those with neural dysfunction, altered mental status, or people with slowed esophageal motility. </p>
<p>The inner portion of your lungs is sterile by most measures. In the case that a person aspirates saliva or small amounts of water, usually nothing will happen as your body will fight off bacteria entering from your mouth. Occasionally the bacteria can colonize causing an infection which attracts inflammation and fluid build-up, resulting in a pneumonia which can affect the abillity to move air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lungs aren't anywhere close to being sterile, they're exposed to bacteria, viruses and fungi with every single breath you draw. Most of these aren't pathogenic to humans, and beneficial bacteria also thrive in the airways. </p>
<p>The current rule of thumb is that <em>nothing</em> in or on a living being is sterile. We used to think both urine and breast milk were sterile, in reality it's not even close. Turns out that breast milk is even supposed to have bacteria, and over 400 species have been identified.</p>
<p>A couple of regions are as sterile as the body is capable of, referred to as having immune privilege because the immune system doesn't really enter these places. Pathogens have a difficult time passing through the barriers protecting them. Examples include the eyeballs, the testes and inside joints.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If not removed, how dangerous would lump of food resting at the bottom of your lungs be? I mean what if 200, or 5000 years ago it could obviously happen too but there was no means to remove it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Food doesn't really get stuck in your lungs. They're not big empty air sacks, there's a lot of branching and the tubes are small.</p>
<p>If water/fluid gets into your lungs it's also ok. There's moisture in your lungs already. If a lot of water gets in, though, you can get pneumonia (this specific form is called aspiration pneumonia). A lot of college kids get aspiration pneumonia when they drink to excess and vomit in their sleep. The vomit is inhaled and causes infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It gets stuck in the branches if its solid food.  Then we gotta get it.</p>
<p>Most clean liquids are tolerated at some level. </p>
<p>Fats can cause a mess.  </p>
<p>Pneumonias are an old mans friend - old guys who don't have well functioning brains end up with pneumonias due to lack of upper airway control and inability to handle food/secretions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is also why vomiting up feces can be fatal!  (The main cause of vomiting feces is an untreated blockage somewhere in the gut.) </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I realise this is entirely anecdotal, but I once took a daily medication, and weirdly one day, upon throwing it down my throat before drinking water, it just, went down. I started coughing uncontrollably for at least a minute, but, nothing.</p>
<p>Sort of threw it in the &quot;Looming disaster I'll deal with later&quot; folder. I got a chest infection sometime later, and upon looking at the xrays, they thought I had TB, due to a large mass that had coagulated around part of my lung. They took the &quot;antibiotic and wait and see&quot; approach, which apparently you can do with the chest area.</p>
<p>I told them about the tablet, but I was told &quot;That can't happen&quot;. So that was that.</p>
<p>That was just over 10 years ago. So, who knows?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any tablet would dissolve within the lungs due to the moisture. However, any organisms that would thrive in a moist environment might also grow within the lung, the potential to cause infection within the lung space. Nobody would be able to tell you for certain if this is what occurred, and really, doesn't matter. The only time medical providers will care what caused an infection is if it is something that can scale into a pandemic/epidemic scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what they were saying can't happen. You can most definitely aspirate objects into your lung. In fact you are more likely to aspirate into your right lung due to the angle of bronchial tube at the carina. Learned this in X-ray school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A very similar thing happened to me - but instead of coughing it up, I somehow managed to cough the pill into my sinuses.  I was only about 14, so I FREAKED out.  It was very uncomfortable.  I had a burning sensation for a few hours until the pill dissolved, as well as the red/orange powder from the inside of the pill coming out one nostril for half a day.</p>
<p>The body is so weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he means like what happens if you swallow a single pea and it goes into your lungs (is that possible?). What happens to the pea? Does it just sit in your lungs forever? Does it get &quot;digested&quot; like saliva breaks down food? Or what?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can't really go <em>into</em> your lungs. The trachea splits into smaller and smaller tubes, and the lungs don't absorb solids/liquids. If anything is in the trachea, you'll cough until it comes out or you choke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's essentially the same as an infection. White blood cells gather to break down the foreign object and clear it away. The last time I got&quot;sick&quot; was actually because I breathed in a grain of rice and ended up with bronchitis. It was gross. I have also gotten a sinus infection from choking on food and breathing it up into my nose.</p></div>		</li>
