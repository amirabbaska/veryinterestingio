			<p>Pulmonary nurse here; This is called Aspiration. Most people would start coughing very hard and feel very uncomfortable. If food gets low enough, you can't effectively cough it out and it needs to be removed through a Bronchoscopy procedure or in worse case, surgery.<br><br>Most people will not have this problem unless they have reduced ability to swallow effectively such as those with neural dysfunction, altered mental status, or people with slowed esophageal motility. <br><br>The inner portion of your lungs is sterile by most measures. In the case that a person aspirates saliva or small amounts of water, usually nothing will happen as your body will fight off bacteria entering from your mouth. Occasionally the bacteria can colonize causing an infection which attracts inflammation and fluid build-up, resulting in a pneumonia which can affect the abillity to move air.</p>		</li>

			<p>It is not sterile. It has a flora which helps prevent infection with harmful bacteria.</p>		</li>

			<p>A couple years ago my grandma told us she was getting pneumonia and lung infections because she would tip her head back while drinking a beverage and that allowed fluid to go down the wrong pipe. This was from her doctor, and he said to take pills with water by drinking through a straw instead? Sound legit or was she BSing us? She was known for that too.</p>		</li>

			<p>Food doesn't really get stuck in your lungs. They're not big empty air sacks, there's a lot of branching and the tubes are small.<br><br>If water/fluid gets into your lungs it's also ok. There's moisture in your lungs already. If a lot of water gets in, though, you can get pneumonia (this specific form is called aspiration pneumonia). A lot of college kids get aspiration pneumonia when they drink to excess and vomit in their sleep. The vomit is inhaled and causes infection.</p>		</li>

			<p>...I just realized that lungs aren't balloons, like bags of air with one smooth outer layer with no internal ridges and an entrance hole. I feel really dumb.</p>		</li>

			<p>Is that why whenever I go to the doctor they put a stethoscope on back in a couple places and ask me to take a few big depth breaths? Are they checking for possible water in my lungs?</p>		</li>

			<p>I realise this is entirely anecdotal, but I once took a daily medication, and weirdly one day, upon throwing it down my throat before drinking water, it just, went down. I started coughing uncontrollably for at least a minute, but, nothing.<br><br>Sort of threw it in the &quot;Looming disaster I'll deal with later&quot; folder. I got a chest infection sometime later, and upon looking at the xrays, they thought I had TB, due to a large mass that had coagulated around part of my lung. They took the &quot;antibiotic and wait and see&quot; approach, which apparently you can do with the chest area.<br><br>I told them about the tablet, but I was told &quot;That can't happen&quot;. So that was that.<br><br>That was just over 10 years ago. So, who knows?<br><br>Edit: Two folders</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not sure what they were saying can't happen. You can most definitely aspirate objects into your lung. In fact you are more likely to aspirate into your right lung due to the angle of bronchial tube at the carina. Learned this in X-ray school.</p>		</li>

			<p>Any tablet would dissolve within the lungs due to the moisture. However, any organisms that would thrive in a moist environment might also grow within the lung, the potential to cause infection within the lung space. Nobody would be able to tell you for certain if this is what occurred, and really, doesn't matter. The only time medical providers will care what caused an infection is if it is something that can scale into a pandemic/epidemic scenario.</p>		</li>

			<p>So what happened in the end with that mass? Did anything bad happened besides the infection?</p>		</li>
