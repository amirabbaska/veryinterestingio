<p>What about some of the giant sauropods? Amphicocoelias fragilimus, anyone?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amphicoelias have been known to grow longer than blue whales, but at an estimated 122.4 tons, they are smaller than the 150 tons blue whales can grow to.</p>
<p>Plus they didn't live in the oceans so you probably won't catch them while fishing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Might not be the ultimate sauropod that everyone thinks it is.  <a href="http://voluminajurassica.org/fulltxt.php?ICID=1130145" target="_blank">A 2014 study by Woodruff and Foster</a> suggests that the gigantic size attributed to <em>Amphicoelias fragillimus</em> stems from a typographic error.  The type specimen appears to have disintegrated over 100 years ago, so we can't actually measure it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The general consensus is that Megalodon would have reached sizes of at least as large as 16 meters, and estimations to its maximum size varying form 20-25 meters in length.</p>
<p>On the other hand, largest blue whale ever measured reached 33.8 meters in length.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The highest estimates for megalodon sizes are, so far as I'm aware, around 20m long, whereas blue whales are typically closer to 30m in length. The megalodon would certainly be the largest fish, though </p></div>		</li>
