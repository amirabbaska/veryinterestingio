			<p>&gt; Blue Whale that currently swimming happily in current times is thought to be the largest animal ever to live.<br><br>What about some of the giant sauropods? Amphicocoelias fragilimus, anyone?</p>		</li>

			<p>Maybe longer (based on estimations, and because of the very long tail) but nowhere near the same mass</p>		</li>

			<p>Amphicoelias have been known to grow longer than blue whales, but at an estimated 122.4 tons, they are smaller than the 150 tons blue whales can grow to.<br><br>Plus they didn't live in the oceans so you probably won't catch them while fishing.</p>		</li>

			<p>Might not be the ultimate sauropod that everyone thinks it is.  <a href="http://voluminajurassica.org/fulltxt.php?ICID=1130145" target="_blank">A 2014 study by Woodruff and Foster</a> suggests that the gigantic size attributed to <em>Amphicoelias fragillimus</em> stems from a typographic error.  The type specimen appears to have disintegrated over 100 years ago, so we can't actually measure it.  <br></p>		</li>

			<p>What about the megalodon?</p>		</li>

			<p>The general consensus is that Megalodon would have reached sizes of at least as large as 16 meters, and estimations to its maximum size varying form 20-25 meters in length.<br><br>On the other hand, largest blue whale ever measured reached 33.8 meters in length.</p>		</li>

			<p>Titanosaur (while being a land animal) has a greater estimated length, but still lacks the overall size of the Blue Whale. </p>		</li>

			<p>Titanosaur is not a single species, or even a single genus. It's barely even a classification at all. It's a greatly varying group known as Titanosauriformes. Not sure why people throw the word around like it's a single animal.</p>		</li>

			<p>I chalk it up to PopSci making us think we actually <em>understand</em> the subject it teaches. </p>		</li>

			<p>It's probably because we teach children that we use Latin words to refer to specific species of animals. If we just called them large lizards people might be less likely to think it's a particularly technical term.</p>		</li>

			<p>The highest estimates for megalodon sizes are, so far as I'm aware, around 20m long, whereas blue whales are typically closer to 30m in length. The megalodon would certainly be the largest fish, though </p>		</li>

			<p>What about it? Just a big ole shark. Definitely not bigger than a whale. </p>		</li>

			<p>While not specifically your question the Megalodon also wasn't around till about 15ma Which is about 40Ma after the dinosaur's extinction</p>		</li>
