			<div class="markdown"><p>I see what you and wikipedia mean, but is this really negative feedback? I would call it a damper. </p>
<p>In order to identify a feedback loop you have decide on a signal like amount of CO2 or temperature, and you cannot change the signal half way through. So let's see, we release CO2 (use co2 as signal), temp goes up, but not as much due to increased heat release, does that mean less CO2 in the atmosphere? Don't think so.</p>
<p>Now use temp as the signal. Temp goes up due to co2 release. Temp doesn't go up as much, but does it reduce heat trapping ability of CO2? I just can't work it out as a negative feedback loop.</p>
<p>edit: Maybe I see what you mean. It's a negative feedback system for the climate as a whole--nothing to do with CO2 really. Temp goes up due to heat (use heat as signal), radiation goes up by some exponential (remembering we are a gray body), so more heat gets released as temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So blackbody radiation prevents permanent runaway warming from occurring as the planet will eventually reach an equilibrium point where energy in = energy out. It wouldn't be able to reverse a warming trend though, correct?</p>
<p>Volcanic eruptions/meteor impacts certainly make sense as a way to reduce temperature, possibly back to some homeostatic state. </p>
<p>Are there any known negative feedback mechanisms for cooling events? For instance, if oceans froze would there would be a massive release in CO2?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, &quot;permanent runaway&quot; would amount to &quot;eventually becoming hotter than the sun&quot; so in that sense you're right, the laws of physics will prevent that. Eventually you will reach an equilibrium point, which in the case of Venus is 462 degrees C. Not exactly something you want to rely on.</p>

<p>Sure, if the planet was covered in ice it would reflect so much sunlight that it might never warm up.</p>
<p>The basic thing is: the climate is quite complicated and we don't know about all the different things that effect it, but we have pretty good estimates. What we do know is that at the current temperature level we can survive fine and at a different temperature level, who knows? We're going to find out though. (Or rather, our children and grandchildren will).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blackbody radiation is considered part of the primary effect. If that's the only thing that changes with increased temperature, the system is said to have zero gain. It is used in the calculation where they say &quot;a doubling of CO2, disregarding knock-on effects, will cause in increase in temperature of X.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
