<p>And the more interesting question, will it save approx. 50% of the energy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it would appear dimmer to us though. That rough concept is called pulse width modulation and is actually extremely useful and commonly used. It's the reason that some led lights seem to flicker when filmed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may or may not be related, but I was photographing a wedding when I noticed something strange. There were some LED Christmas lights on the bushes. They were turned on, but In my photos they were not illuminated. In one of my breaks I experimented with them. I could not catch a photo of them being illuminated. Even with the shutter as low as 1/250th, the lights were off in the photos, yet they were on to the naked eye. I always assumed they flickered to keep from being annoyingly bright. But it's odd that no matter how many photos I took with them, they were always off. I don't think I caught them on a single time all night long. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually pretty much what a lot of LEDs and digital clock displays do.</p>
<p>To alter brightness, the lights flick on an off at a high rate of speed, but the human eye can't tell. If you look at some dashcam videos you'll see people's taillights, or traffic lights, you'll see them blinking. It's because the light's flicker is of a slightly different frequency than the camera's capturing.</p>
<p>As for digital clocks, at least the <del>8</del>7-segment displays I've played with require you to power a <del>couple of pins</del> digit at a time, <del>which turns on one or two segments,</del> then turn them off and the next ones on. Done quickly enough and it appears that they're all steadily lit at the same time, when in reality only one or two are.</p>
<p>You might be interested in looking up Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), which is used for this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The human eye can definitely tell. The tail lights are an excellent example: when I move my eyes quickly (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade" target="_blank">saccade</a>) the tail lights often <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6891478/?reload=true" target="_blank">leave behind a 'light trail'</a> when it uses flickering LEDs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clocks aren't required to light certain segments at a time. They use the technique called multiplexing to minimize the circuitry needed. Each digit is lit in sequence. The 7 segments and 6 digits need 7+6=13 drive lines. A clock without multiplexing would need 7x6=42 drive lines. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not hard to answer. Pulse width modulation is frequently used to &quot;dim&quot; light for humans even though the light is technical flickering. The human eye averages the light it receives so if the light ON/OFF ratio is changed and is being flickered sufficiently fast then it looks like brightening and dimming of the light. </p>
<p>The equilibrium point comes nearly instantly regarding saving power when you go from 100% on to anything less than that, as there is little power lost in LED switching, relative to the actual draw of the LEDs themselves. </p>
<p>As other comments have said though, don't expect much monetary savings with an alarm clock. For lighting though you might expect some savings. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the circuitry to switch this off and on would be in the nano-micro amp range so the power savings would be present there.</p>
<p>the real question is if an LCD display uses more power during startup than over steady state activity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most types of LCD require each segment/pixel to have the polarity reversed at a fairly high frequency so they don't get damaged. There would still be some power savings from running it at a lower duty cycle, though they would be a lot less than with an LED display.</p></div>		</li>
