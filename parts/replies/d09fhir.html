			<p>In the Devonian, you would have most likely been pretty safe fishing from shore. Most life was relegated to the oceans, until the proliferation of complex land plants (Ie big ferns and trees) which developed through the <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RzRmOx0eOQk/TwEJyXM0R8I/AAAAAAAABNo/mvhINq6GjBg/s1600/rooting-system.jpg" target="_blank">devonian</a>. Now, there is evidence that there were some land animals before land plants developed, but the big stuff didn't come around until big plants were in place. The really big plants didn't come about until the latest Devonian, but there was a huge marine mass extinction at that time (Frasnian-Fammenian), meaning not so great fishing, so going for the early devonian is your best bet!</p>		</li>
