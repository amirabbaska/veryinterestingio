			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference between factory eggs and real free range farm eggs is stark.  Its visible to the naked eye when fresh, and you can even <em>smell</em> the difference cooking.  Some people do not like farm eggs because the flavor is much stronger and they've been raised on commercial eggs.  If you really parce the flavor a real farm eggs has an almost fishy component.</p>
<p>The difference between commercial eggs &quot;labeled&quot; as free range or pastured and not, however, is miniscule.  All commercial eggs are pretty terrible, no natter what the carton says.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you've said is entirely true, but perhaps guilty of deception by omission.</p>
<p>Here in Yorkshire, England, we have quite a lot of allotments, small farms tended by one or two people. Hens are a very popular allotment animal, and we get eggs from these people, very informally. The hens live outdoors, peck at whatever they can find, and usually come to me with patches of mud on them.</p>
<p>There is no difference in egg taste. The eggs I get from the allotments are much, much, much fresher and stand a lot prouder on the skillet. If your eggs taste fishy, you're eating eggs from hens supplemented with fish meal, a byproduct of the fishing industry whereby the heads, tails, guts, etc. of the fish are ground, dehydrated and powdered to be added to livestock feed.</p>
<p>You can always tell when the henkeepers in the allotments have had to use fishmeal (like right now, due to the heat and nothing growing) because of the smell of the eggs when cooking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That Serious Eats article is the bane of my existence. OK, not really, but damn if I don't see it cited ALL the time when someones says &quot;eggs from my own chickens taste better&quot; to 'prove' they're mistaken. I actually e-mailed them when it came out (which was years ago now, iirc) to ask about the free-range chickens' specific diet (i.e. the free-range chickens who laid the eggs used in the taste test) and they confirmed that although the hens were free range, most of their feed was commercial (i.e. most of what they ate was NOT scraps/bugs). This is normal. Many people who raise backyard hens supplement with commercial chicken feed. But what hens eat <em>matters</em> when it comes to egg flavour. a hen that eats 90% commercial feed and 10% bugs/scraps is going to have eggs that taste different to a hen that eats 100% scraps/bugs. </p>
<p>'Free range,' whilst not exactly misleading, can give people incorrect ideas about what hens are consuming. The term only means they can go outside. It doesn't tell you how big of a space they roam, or how many bugs are in it, or if they eat scraps. They can get used to commercial feed, too, so some will still prefer that over foraging if they're offered an unlimited amount.</p>
<p>What I've noticed? Hens who eat almost exclusively scraps/bugs have clearly better tasting eggs. The yolks are noticeably rich and flavourful compared to those from hens eating commercial feed (whether those hens are free-range or not). That's another thing i think that Serious Eats article could have done better - they should have taste-tested the yolks alone (and they should have made sure their free-range hens didn't eat any or much commercial feed).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost everyone uses commercial feed.  I feed my chickens on it in the fall and winter but spring and summer they get nothing, other than whatever dog food they can steal.  All bugs, all the time.  I get fewer eggs but they are amazing.</p></div>		</li>
