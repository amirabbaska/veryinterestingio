			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's important to differentiate between breed and species. Breed is used with domesticated animals so this is controlled by humans where they can choose which types to cross breed. If you hear of a new something in the news, it is usually a new species. This is referring to wild animals. As others pointed out species can be hard to distinguish, but if something is not different enough to be described as a species, scientists will designate it as a subspecies or ecotype. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Animals (life in general really) are classified by analyzing and comparing characteristics. Like means of reproduction, nervous systems, skeletal structures, cell structure, and more recently, genetics. (i.e. chordates are animals with notochords) Organisms more similar are thought to be more closely related. Clades are usually described through relation to other organisms (i.e. dinosaurs are currently defined as the clade consisting of the last common ancestor of Triceratops horridus, Passer domesticus (sparrow), and Diplodocus carnegii and all its descendants). </p>
<p>Organisms get reclassified as more analysis is done. When analyzing characteristics you gotta realize the list is practically infinite, so it's not very easy to analyze everything, but studies that analyze more characteristics are usually thought to be more accurate. Thankfully, computers have made processing a lot of data a lot easier on biologists so hopefully the current tree of life is a bit more accurate, but there are still a LOT of organisms out there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Classification these days are done on genetics, and if they are not they should be. Characteristics can be misleading but full genomes will allow you to accurately determine the relationships between species</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of times it's from genetic studies. This is how we know that there are actually two species of clouded leopards, not one, for example. Their ancestors diverged 1.4 million years ago; however, they look very much alike. Likewise, the hog deer turned out to actually be four separate species, not one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are still A LOT of species just being found though! Especially for invertebrates and even in urban areas, but this is also true for mammals. Usually these are bats and rodents, but there's still a lot to be discovered. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You already got good answers so let me only add that sometimes significant differences and similarities are extremely tiny and just plain easy to mistake.</p>
<p>There's also the fact that life doesn't easily fit inside little boxes and we need not only similarities, not only differences but the very order in which these similarities <em>and</em> differences developed in the species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It must be said that a new breed of domestic animal is not a new species. </p>
<p>I reference the Golden Doodle.  Basically a mix between Golden Retrievers and Poodles.  In the USA and Canada this is seen as a designer dog, a gimmick, a mutt with a fancy sounding name often over priced... but in Australia  this is now recognized as a breed.  They have shows for it and everything.  Either way it is still just a dog, not a new species!  Breeds and species are not the same.  </p></div>		</li>
