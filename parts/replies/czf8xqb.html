<p>In German it exists. I never thought about it, growing up with it, it never sounded strange. But it's a surname, with the first name it doesn't just hang around (i.e. John of Essex)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont agree with this one. Many dutch name containing van/de/van der are not nobility in origin at all, but rather place name derivatives or professions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many or most?  Because the UP became republican so long ago it's not easy for an Anglophone to figure out which names are aristocratic, and whether Dutch follows the same convention as the other countries.  For example, I assume <em>de Groot</em> and <em>van Oldenbarnevelt</em> are aristocratic names, but the Dutch keep the particle; <em>de Oude</em> and <em>van Rijn</em> are probably geographic in origin, but I rarely hear them used at all... but how would I know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same in French. It would be totally acceptable to mention M. de Tocqueville. Actually, most people I know with a &quot;de&quot; in their name would correct you if you missed it...</p></div>		</li>
