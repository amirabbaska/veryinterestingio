			<div class="markdown"><p>Hat was actually a big part of me getting over some self loathing issues. When I have an anxiety attack, I remind myself, I’m not weak or broken, the back of my head is just trying to keep the rest of me safe from something it thinks is there to hurt me. The fact that the something isn’t there isn’t my fault.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a teacher, I get to see toxic stress up close every day. Kids worrying about where their next meal is coming from, kids with unstable home lives, kids who are responsible for taking care of themselves and their siblings bc mom works two jobs to keep a roof over everyone's heads. Then privileged asshats complain about test scores, and how teachers need to work harder with poor kids. Like, wtf am I supposed to do about any of those things? I can make school fun, create a supportive environment, and try to help parents find resources, but I cannot undo intergenerational poverty. Our social policies (like welfare to work) create situations where these kids growing brains are flooded with cortisol, rewiring their neural pathways and making it harder to learn, which then makes it harder for them to succeed when they become the adults. Toxic stress is fucked, and we as a society have to a) acknowledge that it's a real problem and b) do something about it.</p>
<p>Sorry to rant, I can see by your comment that you get just how toxic the toxic stress can be. You're ahead of the curve on that. I wish everyone understood how bad it is for people.</p></div>		</li>
