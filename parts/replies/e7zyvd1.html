			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, Adam Pritchard here. I think the biggest changes have been born of technology in the past 20 years. Paleontologists are now able address questions about bone growth and internal anatomy using microscopy, fine-scale sectioning, and CT scanning technology. I was able to reveal the three-dimensional anatomy of the skull of a tiny Triassic reptile called a drepanosaur for the first time using CT scanning and 3D modeling of skull bones.</p>
<p>If there has been a paradigm shift, it involves thinking of dinosaurs as real and VERY complex animals with a convoluted history. Growth studies have revealed that dinosaurs were incredibly varied in adult body sizes and metabolic rates even within single species. It is very hard to think of the 'average' member of any dinosaur species, as they were likely influenced by all kinds of environmental and geographic factors. Basically, we have totally underestimated the possibilities of dinosaur biology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why it's contested that Dracorex and Stygimoloch are juvenile forms of Pachycephalosaurus?</p>
<p>Could the variation in body sizes and metabolic rates mean there could be dinosaurs out there that are like axolotls? In that they can't reach adulthood unless certain environmental requirements are fulfilled, or they look/function differently based on their environment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the current status of the whole &quot;fossilized dinosaur soft tissue&quot; story?  I've lost track of it, and now I can't tell if it was a complete (but unintentional) hoax, or if there's some legitimate scientific value to be had out of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got to add geochemistry to this. I was amazed at what mass spectroscopy applied to fossils has brought to the table. You can really find out a lot about the environments these animals lived in including seasonality, diet, migration and temperature. A lot of paleontology is about being a good chemist. Part of pressing the envelope is finding new techniques and technologies being applied elsewhere and then applying them to the fossils. There's still a lot left to discover and a lot left to be applied. Unfortunately, funding is always a struggle.</p></div>		</li>
