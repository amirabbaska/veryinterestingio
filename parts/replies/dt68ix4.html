			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok that was awesome!
I think I get it now, it was quite obvious and I feel a bit stupid not to have seen it before ^^</p>
<p>So yes it makes sense : burning radially &quot;rotates&quot; the ellipse on which you orbit. I can quite see the logic: suppose I am on the periapsis, so closest to the body I am orbiting. On the next time tick I will start to gain a little altitude. But if I burn radial in, I &quot;force&quot; myself to stay close to the planet. Then as you said, since I'm burning orthogonal to my path and parallel to gravity, I'm not adding energy, so the ellipse is the same, so the apoapis &quot;rotates&quot; with me to stay exactly opposite the (new) periapsis.</p>
<p>I got it, thanks!</p>
<p>As for rendez-vous. So when I want to rendez-vous with the target, I understand the &quot;jumps&quot; or orbit: I get a bit higher (so slower) for a time so that it catches on me, then I come back at the right time so that I get in phase. That's for coming close to my target, but not close-as-in-I-can-dock-with-it. So we need to manoeuver.</p>
<p>What was not ticking for me is that when I was close enough, as you said I would burn toward my target to come closer. But I did not understand how that would correlate with my orbit. What I was missing (silly of me!) is that this effect would get corrected when I thrust backward to slow down in order to reach 0.0m/s velocity relative to my target.</p>
<p>So thanks for that, I thinks this clears everything I needed!</p>
<p>Is there a way to mark the topic / question as &quot;answered&quot;?</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really like /u/Throw_Away_Humans 's answer: let me add to it by saying that burning radial in/out is almost always a bad idea.  Basically you're burning fuel to push inward or outward, which is the same thing gravity would do for you, if you gave it a little more/less time.</p>
<p>As a general guideline, anything you'd like to do with a radial burn can be achieved with much smaller prograde/retrograde burns, plus a little patience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that sometimes radial is a good idea if you are in a time crunched Hohmann transfer and are wanting to adjust where you want to do orbital insertion (like not entering your burn point while in radio shadow)</p>
<p>In KSP radial is also handy if you lack TWR and need to burn at 45 degrees for a bit to buy enough orbital speed to get a tug into orbit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I agree, aside from niche purposes like averaging an elliptical orbit the radial vector is only really useful on close approach and during orbital transfer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah! That is <em>somewhat</em> the assumption I had in mind: why push / pull along the gravity vector?<br />
But then the idea that the orbit would be &quot;rotating&quot; with me made sense. I don't know if it's useful or not, but at least I can understand what it does.</p>
<p>Lots of other comments in the thread are talking about changing the ecccenticity or altitude, which I do not understand :/</p></div>		</li>
