<p>A few years ago I worked in a company that made stents.</p>
<p>Approx:
15% of the stents we made went to America.
55% of our profits were from America.</p>
<p>Heck even this morning I woke up to this article on my newsfeed <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/health-pharma/irish-based-drugmaker-raises-painkiller-price-to-3-000-in-us-1.3393243" target="_blank">https://www.irishtimes.com/business/health-pharma/irish-based-drugmaker-raises-painkiller-price-to-3-000-in-us-1.3393243</a></p>
<p>Also interesting note was that approx 66% of the stents we sold went into someone who already had a stent.
At the beginning of my time there I thought we were saving peoples lives.
At the end I became more cynical and that morphed into We were prolonging peoples bad lifestyles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, that's the crux of it.  Over here in the US they charge whatever the fuck they want for medication and devices.  Either pay, or go without and in some cases die.  It will never change.  This is the way they want the whole country ran.  Just today I had an amusing thought about our politics over here in the US while I was taking a shower a few minutes ago (and now I'm on here fucking about when I need to keep getting ready for work lol).  A literal shower thought LOL.  But I thought, isn't it amusing how with the two major political parties we have here one side is trying to take away our gun rights and the other side is trying to keep us broke as fuck?  At any given time one of those agendas is being pushed.  Kind of a scary little thought haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason for that is that insurances in the US demand high discounts from their partners (hospitals, ...). But in order to give high discounts, you have to increase prices first. If you're not insured, you pay the bill yourself and it's up to you to negotiate. If you're insured, it's your insurance that already negotiated. :\</p></div>		</li>

Sector 1 is the lowest and sector 2 means the doctor can set his own prices. For a GP, sector 1 is 25€ for a consult. So you get 70% of that 25€ back (the remaining 30% are reimbursed in part or totally depending on the supplemental insurance called mutuelle and if you have one). A specialist doctor (OBGYN for instance) is 30-35€ in sector 1. That’s the lowest price.</p>
<p>Some specialists doctors in sector 2 (OBGYN for instance) can set their prices almost as high as they want. In Paris, it’s not uncommon to see OBGYN have a 100€ consult (which is considered quite expensive for French people). But you still get reimbursed only on the base price, that is to say 70% of 30€, not 70% of 100€. The remaining money that you pay out of your own pocket can be reimbursed in parts or totally depending on the Mutuelle. </p>
<p>Édit: this is also true for surgeons. I got my wisdom teeth taken out 2 years ago and my surgeon had me pay 250€ (150€ actually, I checked) more than the sector 1 based price. I got that money back from my supplemental insurance. </p></div>		</li>

<p>UK dental isn't free, it's subsidised, so I should have had to pay about 100 quid towards it, but I got a trainee assessment so that was waived, and the surgeon doing it was a constant oral surgeon.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have to pay upfront and be reimbursed, is there a sector that that creates a real hardship for? I know it was mentioned elsewhere that low income people are covered 100%, but here there is sometimes a gap where people make too much to qualify for government help but would have real difficulty coming up with $250 that they could spare for a while until the reimbursement comes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on your illness. Both my parents have diabetes and they are covered 100% because it’s considered a longtime illness. It’s called « tiers payant ». They don’t front any money for anything relating to this illness but if they have the flu, then the coverage goes back to normal. </p>
<p>Those 250€ (I checked, it’s actually 150€) I paid were overcharges by my surgeon. I chose to pay it because I could afford to and knew I would be reimbursed later by my supplemental insurance. The surgeon gave me a quote that I accepted. I could have gone to another surgeon who would have charged me less.
If you can’t afford the overcharge, you simply go to a sector 1 doctor/surgeon and there is no problem. You only front the base price and get reimbursed later. And if you can’t, I would assume that you can always &quot;negotiate&quot;. I’ve never heard of someone not getting a surgery (whether elective or vital) because they couldn’t afford to. </p>
<p>Édit: the social security usually reimburses you in 1-2 weeks if you front the money. It can take as little as 3 days and as much as 1 month if there are issues (a lot rarer nowadays with the carte vitale). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doctors don’t have reputation to be better here unless you have a very specific illness or thing that you need to address (cancer, diabetes, Crown’s, etc.). Then there are specialists that are recognized to be specialists in that specific area. And then again, I don’t think it’s a question of better or not. It’s a very subjective issue. What makes a doctor better?</p>
<p>I go to sector 2 doctors because they are the ones that are nearest to me and it’s more practical. Or the ones I like best personality wise. Sector 1 doctors can be hard to find depending on where you live. If you can’t afford sector 2 prices, you can always get a consult at the hospital for sector 1 prices. </p>
<p>My ophthalmologist and dermatologist are 45€ a consult, my OBGYN 65€. They are all sector 2.
And really, it’s not that much more expensive and I get the difference back from my supplemental insurance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't stress enough how the controled price on consultation and medication is important here. It's not only about the 70% paid by the social security.</p>
<p>A medical consultation is 30 % of 23 €.</p>
<p>A routine dental consultation is 23 € too. A tooth decay is 17 to 40 € depending on severity (it may be more expensive if you wait since the decay will ruin your tooth). Dental decalcification is 28 € but free once a year.</p>
<p>30x 0.50 mg of benzodiazepin (eg Xanax) is 2.50 € (3.15 USD): it's ~0.9€ with social security.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You won't be able to retrieve more than 1 month of medication at the drugstore. So it would be quite complicated to come to France each month to grab your 30-day pills if you need a one year treatment for example (I think you can grab up to 3 months at a time for chronic diseases, but I do not know much about these). You totally can go to a medical consultation to get a treatment paying 100% of the cost, it's indeed not expensive even without –70%.</p>
<p>Important note to non-french people who may want to do this:</p>
<p>About doctors, there are several pricing :
– « Secteur 1 », which is the low pricing we are speaking about. Most doctors use this pricing. Ophtalmologists in Secteur 1 are rare if you can't wait ~10+ days before your consultation.
– « Secteur 2 + OPTAM or CAS », average pricing is 2x the regulated price. Most of the times doctors with this pricing allow you to get quickly a consultation.
– « Secteur 2 » (if you do not see « OPTAM » or « CAS ») and « Secteur 3 », pricing is unregulated.</p>
<p>All doctors pricing are available on several websites, eg. <a href="https://www.doctolib.fr/medecin-generaliste/paris" target="_blank">https://www.doctolib.fr/medecin-generaliste/paris</a>
DO CHECK before going to a random doctor! If you do not see any price but see « Secteur 1 », you're safe! You can also check which langages the doctor speak.</p>
<p>About drugstores, there are usually different pricings for the same molecule. It usually does not differ a lot, but if you want the less expensive, ask for « seulement des médicaments génériques s'il vous plait » (« only generic drugs please »). Do not be shy, a lot of people ask that because the –70% only apply on the cheapest version of a drug (on other drugs, you will get the –70% but it won't refund more than what you would get if you bought the cheapest).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth mentioning that French drug prices are lower by far than American, but huge compared to places like the UK and some other places that have bulk buying at a country level.</p>
<p>Paracetamol/acetaminophen is about 4 euro a pack in France and about 50p in the UK, roughly a sixth of the cost.</p>
<p>Even if you have the biggest, shittiest commercial care in the world, is worth having country wide bulk buying.  The cost price of a replacement hip, as in the actual device itself, in the states is 4000 dollars, in France is about 1000 Euro and in the UK about 500gbp.  Same device, same supplier in many cases, but the UK and France etc have amazing bulk buying power.  &quot;We'll take 50000&quot; drops prices pretty quick.</p>
<p>If America did this, and some federal group obtained great prices and sold on at cost to hospitals, your bills would drop notably, although you'd still be charged 29 dollars for a bar of soap</p></div>		</li>
