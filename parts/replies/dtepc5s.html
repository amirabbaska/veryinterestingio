			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point, and it's worth asking what it means for the brain to control something in the first place. The brain undoubtably has a big effect on how you move, but really that's just it sending electrical signals to the muscles. If the muscle's didn't &quot;want&quot; to move, they wouldn't, and actually when we've exercised to the point of exhaustion that's exactly what happens. My brain tells my arms to do another pushup and they just give up instead.</p>
<p>Or we could look at it from a higher level. What keeps a city from tearing itself apart, with every person independently competing for resources?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good way to look at it instead multiple autonomous pieces, is just as 2 autonomous pieces.</p>
<p>Essentially anything controlled by the brain is something that requires an electrical signal to be transmitted through your body, which is the natural process of conscious/subconscious movement and perception.</p>
<p>Cells and surrounding structure don't require a transmittance of these electrical signals, but instead rely on chemical signals to perform their autonomous tasks.</p>
<p>Edit: this is very simplified, but I'm not educated enough on the subject to provide anymore detail without it being speculation. Please anyone with more knowledge correct me if I've made a mistake</p></div>		</li>
