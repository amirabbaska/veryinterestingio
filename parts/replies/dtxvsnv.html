			<div class="markdown"><p>what? you wear a mouthguard. You shouldn't be dangling your mouth open regardless. You would have your mouth mostly shut whether you are inhaling or exhaling to keep your mouthguard in while trading.</p>
<p>You can still breath in through your mouth but its bad form, encourages hyperventilating, and more or less shows lack of conditioning.</p>
<p>I have seen plenty of fighters mouthbreathe when they are gassed. Beginners are conditioned to not do it at all, but just like your form slips when you are gassed, so can your breathing.</p>
<p>I highly doubt inhaling and exhaling through a closed mouth and the small gap in mouthguard increases your chances of getting your teeth knocked out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And you are absolutely right, a closed jaw on the mouth guard is preferable ( if your fighting for sport and have a mouth guard ). But if your getting fucked up or if your tired, there is a tendency to mouth breathe and thats when bad things happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When fighting, if you lack mouth protection, what's the safest way to keep your jaw?</p>
<p>Should it be closed? Clenched tight? Loosely closed? Slightly open with lips closed and jaw relaxed? Tongue pressing the palate? Depressed onto the floor of your mouth? Tightly? Loosely?</p>
<p>Basically what I'm asking is, if I (with zero fighting experience) am ever in a position where I need to defend myself from a physical aggressor(and running is not an option), how would I best protect my teeth and jaw?</p>
<p>Also should my neck be relaxed and ready to move with a hit to the head? Or clench the neck to make it rigid?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yo, take a class thats a lot of questions.  It takes discipline and training to nose breathe 6 rounds in. Focus on cardio for starter. If you absolutely have to mouth breathe make sure your chin is tucked and your rotating your shot so the shoulder is protecting the jaw, keep your opposite hand up. You should never be tense, drains stamina. Dont take shots on the jaw, take them on the top of the head if you are absolutely going to eat a face shot. Head movement, footwork, know YOUR range. If your gonna take a shot clench the jaw, but I doubt youll see if coming if its hitting your jaw. Dont fight max clenched, that will drain but dont clench so loose your jaw will fly off. </p>
<p>If you have no experience, watch JT Van V on YouTube , my favorite is Coach Anthony Boxing.</p></div>		</li>
