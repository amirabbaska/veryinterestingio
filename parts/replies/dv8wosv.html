<p>I wouldn't go that far.  You've pointed out a lack of toxicity, but not that it's healthy.</p>
<p>Namely, <a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/content/189/28/E929" target="_blank">artificial sweeteners are associated with risk of obesity, heart disease, etc</a>, which is probably due to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2892765/" target="_blank">messing with one's neurochemistry</a>.  To abusively summarize a decade of complex science: if your body asks for sugar, and it gets a fake instead, it responds by demanding more next time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No one's body is &quot;asking&quot; for the amount of sugar in a can of soda.  While artificial sweeteners aren't necessarily healthy by themselves, they are certainly a better alternative to over consumption of sugar that isn't needed in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, and for diabetics, sugar is definitely going to mess them up. Healthy lifestyles and moderation are key, but with the way the world works, fake sugar is going to healthier than real sugar for a lot of people.</p>
<p>Now, cutting back on sweeteners altogether and eating more nutritious food? I would imagine everyone agrees on that. That's a better focus than the anti-artificial sweetener kick that people like go off on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I put that in quotes because health is a relative term. If you consume neither natural nor artificial sugar than they can't possibly hurt you. But that's true for just about every food, and it isn't practical to not consume any sugar. It's just too present in our everyday life.</p>
<p>That being said, I stick to my point that the negative effects artificial sweeteners are marginal, and its negative public opinion is due to faulty observational studies and consumer mindset with regards to consuming products that have been heavily engineered (GMO's have been fighting this battle for years.)</p>
<p>If you read the study you linked, it's actually <em>disproving</em> that artificial sweeteners are associated with risk of obesity, heart disease, ect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From 11 774 citations, we included 7 trials (1003 participants; median follow-up 6 mo) and 30 cohort studies (405 907 participants; median follow-up 10 yr). In the included RCTs, nonnutritive sweeteners had no significant effect on BMI (mean difference −0.37 kg/m2; 95% confidence interval [CI] −1.10 to 0.36; I2 9%; 242 participants).</p>
<p>Overall, there was limited evidence for the effect of non-nutritive sweeteners on BMI, with 3 long-term cohort studies suggesting a modest increase in BMI that was not confirmed in 2 RCTs. The limited number of eligible studies precluded subgroup analyses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[This] (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2650084/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2650084/</a>) review article talks about what you're referring to with regards to increased consumption after ingesting artificial sweeteners. The key line I would like to point you to is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are reports from controlled trials in humans of enhanced energy intake after ingestion of a sweetened, non-energy-yielding beverage (54–57). However, the preponderance of evidence indicates that NNS exert no short-term effect on energy intake (28, 35, 58).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your immediate reaction might be hold on, what are the long term effects, and I think that's what you were referring to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Longer-term feeding trials generally indicate that the use of NNS results in no change or a reduction in energy intake. For example, early feeding trials conducted in a metabolic ward indicated that the substitution of NNS for NS during 3-d blocks resulted in incomplete energy compensation, as intake was 14–23% lower than baseline (59).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, there is an &quot;energy compensation&quot; principle involved, but the net amount consumed was still significantly lower overall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's always sounded like the &quot;exercise will make you hungry so you'll eat more&quot; argument to me. Plus, people's bodies don't ask for anything. Your food cravings are completely unrelated to what your body actually needs or wants at the time.</p>
<p>I will grant that the neurochemistry angle could be significant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not necessarily true. For example, people with Addison's disease (which leads to salt deficiency among many other things) will crave salt. Of course then there are food cravings for random stuff in pregnancy which are not as clear-cut.</p></div>		</li>
