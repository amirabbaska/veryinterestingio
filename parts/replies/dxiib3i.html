			<div class="markdown"><p>There was some debate over whether pyriproxyfen, a pesticide used in that general area, or Zika was the cause, but the WHO dismissed it rather quickly with research from the actual pesticide manufacturer, even though the research showed some amount of developmental disruptment in mammals. Not everyone is convinced though, here's a paper from last year investigating the link: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03765.pdf" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03765.pdf</a></p>
<p>The fact that the amount of microcephaly doesn't match up at all with one would expect for the amount of Zika infections seen should raise red flags that Zika is the real cause. The WHO has been wrong many times in the past, and research provided on a substance by the company who makes said substance has a high chance of understating negative findings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly, even the most optimistic estimate for microcephaly probability in infected pregnant women was something like 2%.  I remember reading that and thinking that it seemed like an awfully weak correlation for how much people were flipping out about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's not like it's a 2% chance that you'll have a baby who's left handed. It's a 2% chance that you will have a dependent for the rest of your life and that your child will never be developmentally normal or live a normal life. And 2 out of 100 isnt that insignificant. It's not a risk I would be happy taking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the response I was looking for. I remember when all of this was going on and something didn't seem quite right with the connection between Zika and microcephaly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This initially theory seemed poorly researched but loudly proclaimed and had political implications for the Rio Olympics and world cup. </p>
<p>Current speculation is that dengue or chikungunya fever could be the causal diseases or links, or that zika may have only been a partial contributor to the microcephaly. </p>
<p>The other theory is that more pregnancies were terminated due to the threat- but this dies not seem to have evidence. </p>

<p>It does seem to stand out to some people that pesticides as a cause are not being researched with the same voracity. </p></div>		</li>
