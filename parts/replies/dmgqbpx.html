Honestly, I would choose induced coma over suicide if that were an option, until there was a treatment.</p>
<p>PS not suicidal right now, but have been.  No worries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're half right. </p>
<p>Reaching a state of feeling suicidal takes a long, long time. It's not premediated per se, but its at the end of a long series of progressively loosing all hope, and of pain that builds till it seems completely insurmountable.</p>
<p>The actual suicide attempt (not neccessarily suicidal thoughts) does tend to be something of a &quot;snap&quot; decision. It's not lightly made, but it is somewhat spur of the moment, which is why having &quot;easy&quot; routes to suicide like guns or easy to access poisons lying around increases suicide risk. If you don't kill yourself when the urge (just to be clear i don't mean suicidal ideation or even planning here, I mean an actual short term actionable intent to end your life) first strikes you, many people do not go on to kill themselves in future. Even something as simple as having to find a high place to jump off can seem truly unmanageable for someone in a state of heavy depression, but most anyone can manage to pull a trigger</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually the actual act if suicide is a snap decision. You've got rock bottom of your depression and are ready to not be alive anymore. People don't just get depressed and commit suicide, they live for months/years in a state where they plan it in there head, make preparations, and lead up to the actual suicide. It is preventable, but usually people aren't in mental condition to seek help for themselves until afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Most suicide is a long decision. You have to overcome your natural survival instincts in order to go through with it. Gathering that courage takes time.</p></div>		</li>
