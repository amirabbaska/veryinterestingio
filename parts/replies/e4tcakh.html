<p>The Chromatic Confocal technique uses a white light source (LED) that passes through a series of lenses, called an optical pen, which has a high degree of chromatic aberration. The refractive index of the lenses will vary the focal distance of each wavelength of the white light. In effect, each separate wavelength of the white light will focus at a different distance from the optical pen, creating the measurement range. When a surface of interest is within the measurement range a single wavelength of the white light will be in focus while all others will be out of focus. The white light is then reflected back through the optical pen, then through a pin hole filter that allows only the focused wavelength to pass through to a CCD spectrometer. The CCD will indicate the wavelength in focus, which corresponds to a specific distance for a single point.   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A cheap prime lens will be made mostly of plastic, body and refractive elements, and be quite light. An expensive one will have a metal body and real glass. The latter, with a few exceptions, will have higher image quality and longevity.</p>
<p>EDIT: After reading comments and some research, my memory from 9 years ago wasn't spot-on. DSLR lens elements appear to be all glass, in cheaper ones some are just hybrid aspherical - have an aspherical plastic mold on a spherical glass element.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What &quot;cheap&quot; lenses have you seen with plastic lenses <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/369376-REG/Holga_144120_144_120_120N.html" target="_blank">(besides a holga or other toy camera)</a>?  Obviously the body is usually plastic but every lens built for mirrorless or SLR bodies I've seen use &quot;real glass&quot;, they might just have fewer elements or coatings, or lack autofocus/image stabilization motors.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah as the other commenter suggested primes usually have a much larger aperture, which increases cost because it requires bigger lenses (the individual actual pieces of glass)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Camera lenses also have coatings that give them special properties. To put them on, they put them in a box and pump out all the air. They then heat up the special material that vaporizes it, and it condenses on the lens to form a coating. This process is expensive partially because of the time it takes, the specialized equipment required, and the quality control. However, it helps to increases the amount of light that makes it into the camera and reduce the distortion to the image caused by the lenses. </p>
<p>There are also other metrics I didn't mention - surface smoothness, how true to shape they are, etc. </p></div>		</li>
