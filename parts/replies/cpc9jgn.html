			<div class="markdown"><p>To follow up, according to that Wikipedia link (thank you /u/rat_Ryan ), the Moon's gravity causes a twice-a-day terrestrial tide with a magnitude of about 0.38 meters (1.25 feet).</p>
<p>That means when the moon is directly overhead, you are approximately 1.25 feet further away from the center of the Earth than when the moon is just below the horizon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those tidal forces would affect the entire Earth but it is most noticeable at the surface. The exception is the very center of the earth because it is our point of reference. Everything else would experience some magnitude of deflection away from the center as a result of the moon. Interestingly this generates some heat. This heat has to come from somewhere and that's the gravitational potential energy of the moon and its kinetic energy. After an arbitrarily long period of time (assuming the moon wasn't escaping us which I believe it is) the moon would fall to earth because of this lost energy.</p>
<p>EDIT: I have since been informed that the heat from these strains will cause the moon to get further as it slows until it is tidally locked to us and much higher. See the replies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and it almost certainly plays some role in Vulcan activity. Tidal forces of this nature are responsible for a lot of the volcanic activity on Jupiter/Saturn's moons. That tug and pull on solid matter creates heat which eventually builds up enough to liquify the matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point! It's too bad that this is getting out shined by an answer that doesn't really address the question at hand.  I just want to tack on the comment that the force exerted by the moon is proportional to the mass of the object.  Yes, the moon can shift the ocean (which is extremely heavy) because it exerts a lot of force on heavy things.  No, the moon can't lift a squirrel off the surface of the earth and into orbit because it exerts a little force on little things.  This is because the moon has a gravitational field, and these fields work by apply acceleration.  force is acceleration times mass, thus more massive things will experience more force.  Nowhere on earth will the moon's acceleration be greater than the earth's acceleration, so nothing will ever get sucked off of the earth.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes!  Although by such small amounts that it would be very hard to detect.  As you get further from the center of the Earth, the force of gravity acting on you will decrease.</p></div>		</li>
