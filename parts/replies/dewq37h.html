<p>This is something people often don't understand when they are talking about planned obsolescence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Planned obsolescence is different, and usually involves components that will wear predictably rather than fail stochastically.  Every component is different.  Some properly designed seals will work as long as they can, but if something happens to set off a chain reaction (dust getting into the housing somehow), then they can fail randomly.  Other seals can be designed to wear out a little bit at a time and fail quickly and predictably.  There is some overlap between what is designed to fail after a specific period and what is simply cheap, though.  </p>
<p>In general electronics fail statistically- there is no way to tell how long a particular diode will last, and some can keep working many orders of magnitude longer than others of the same type.  Since satellites are mostly electronics, its very hard to predict when they will fail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note also that S class components are rugged as hell and tested under actual radiation environments. Little temporary satellites (cube sats, etc) are not designed or built to that level. There is a reason that &quot;state of the art &quot; stuff doesn't go into space all that often. It's not rugged enough and needs many months / years of testing first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its like the half life of an element, it is impossible to determine when each individual radioactive atom will decay, but you can take the time a large portion of atoms takes to decay.(Half life is aprroximately the amount of time it takes half of a sample of atoms to decay, if an element has a half life of one year and you have 1 unit of it, after about 1 year you will have half a unit and so on.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use the lightbulb analogy.  Say life expectancy is 10k hours, and replace like say all 10 in the same room at the same time.  Maybe 1 of those will fail on or before that 10k hours.  Some may even last double that. Maybe one or two hit 30k.  But you don't count on that. From a production standpoint with as close to zero unplanned downtime as possible you'd just plan to replace them all again just short of 10k hours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incandescent lamps are a poor example of this. They have such an enormous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb#Light_output_and_lifetime" target="_blank">variation of life versus voltage</a>. The variations in the voltage of your house will be the overwhelming thing affecting life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lifetime is approximately proportional to V^âˆ’16</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A truly enormous variation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, that's fair.  It served for a brief example. I suppose a better example, to continue with the lamp theme, would be fluorescent lamps. Granted, they're longer lived than an incandescent but those essentially have a countdown timer.</p></div>		</li>
