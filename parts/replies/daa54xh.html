			<div class="markdown"><p>I have broken my nose enough times that it doesn't work properly so I breathe through my mouth. Thanks for the nice comment too many people on reddit think mouth breathing is a sign of low intelligence or just generally like making fun of people for it, it's funny if you think about it. Imagine people just casually referred to less intelligent people as &quot;big nosed&quot; or some other physical trait, doubt it would fly as well as &quot;mouth breather&quot; a phrase I see used all the time as an insult on here. It gets frustrating sometimes that a trait about myself I have no control over outside surgery is used as shorthand for low intellect. </p></div>		</li>
