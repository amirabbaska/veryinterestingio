			<p>What about copper? <br><br>Copper has a distinct smell when it gets hot as well as what rubs off on your skin.<br><br>The skin part is explained by oxidation, which makes sense, but what about the heat?<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Is O3(Just discovered reddit has no subscript :( ) abundant enough at sea level to actually have an affect on odors in a significant/meaningful way?</p>		</li>

			<p>Any odors you smell in the breeze can also be oxidized or otherwise react when they come into contact with the metal. </p>		</li>

			<p>Thank you! This question always gets the oils in your skin answer. Some metal smells even if it's never been touched. There are many compounds just floating in the air that also oxidize when they land on the metal. Not to mention impurities in the metal, and in whatever cleaning agents were used on it.</p>		</li>

			<p>To be fair, the most prominent contributor is probably oils from skin if the metal's been handled, but I've tried to keep my responses general.</p>		</li>

			<p>I always noticed a distinct smell when my hobby motors are overheating. Is this the oil, the heat, or both?</p>		</li>

			<p>Not OP, but to me all metals have a distinct smell to them, copper is one of the more distinct and pungent to me.  When all metals are hot I feel like I can smell them easier.  Older dirty metal add a separate smell to the mix as well.<br><br>Are there different processes on the different metals creating different smells?  'It is oils from people' makes me think it would just smell like a persons hands, and different metals would all smell the same.  This is not true though.</p>		</li>

			<p>Acids, like the carboxylic acids often found in sweat, can break down metals and release the carbon and phosphorus compounds contained within, so each metal is somewhat unique. Also they could catalyze different compounds to form. <br><br>It's oils from people which have had metal ions add oxygen to them, making them smelly ketones and aldehydes.</p>		</li>

			<p>So, is that weird metallic taste not the metal itself and just hydrocarbons and maybe other stuff reacting to the metal?</p>		</li>

She was trying to understand why people often complain of a metallic taste in drinking water.<br><br>&gt;Exploring the issue of metallic taste led her to think about metallic smell. That took her to Glindemann, and they cracked the problem together.<br><br>&gt;The researchers captured the vapours emitted from the skin of people who had handled iron objects, and studied their chemical composition. The gases contained several compounds called aldehydes and ketones, which often have strong and distinctive smells. The odour of preserving fluid, or formaldehyde, makes for the characteristic reek of old anatomy labs, for example, while the ketone acetone makes the distinctive solvent whiff of nail-varnish remover.<br><br>&gt;These compounds are produced by rapid reactions between iron or copper and oils on our skin.<br><br>Yes, that taste is part of the inspiration for the research into this.<br><br>&gt;The reactions could also explain Dietrich's question of why drinking water sometimes tastes metallic: organic food particles could be reacting with rust in the water to help form the odour compounds.</p>		</li>
