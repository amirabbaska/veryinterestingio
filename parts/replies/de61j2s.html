			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinetic energy is always measured against a particular inertial frame of reference. It changes if you change the frame of reference you are using. So although there may be zero <em>relative</em> average molecular movement, the entire set of molecules may be moving at a particular velocity. Mixing up thermodynamics and relativity is complex and a field unto itself (relativistic thermodynamics).</p>
<p>Regardless, absolute zero is unattainable anyway due to the uncertainty principle, since measuring absolute zero requires there to be exact certainty in momentum which means that position would be totally uncertain and &quot;smeared out&quot; over spacetime since they are conjugate variables.</p></div>		</li>
