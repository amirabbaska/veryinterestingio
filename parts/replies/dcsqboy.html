			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify. When we talk about electricity, we have to remember that electricity is, by and large, an electromagnetic wave. When electricity moves through a wire it's actually electric potential energy that is transferring down the length with electrons as its medium (just like a sound wave travels through air as its medium). The air particles/electron particles stay in roughly the same spot as the wave transits through the medium. </p>
<p>What you are thinking of is drift velocity, the average movement of electrons (and possibly holes) in a particular direction. In any given cross section of the wire electrons move randomly in every direction, but on average electrons are moving in a particular direction in a wire that has electricity flowing. The most shocking fact is that while electricity moves close to the speed of light, drift velocity of electrons is only on the order of a few metres per minute (aka very slow). </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's easier to track the hole moving from positive to negative than it is to track all the electrons moving from negative to positive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you mean, and why does it have anything to do with the positive to negative or negative to positive current flow definition?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the original question is &quot;Why do we say current flows from positive to negative instead of negative to positive,&quot; then the answer is &quot;We're really tracking electron holes.&quot; Maybe I don't understand your question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm, I guess I interpreted your answer as &quot;we're tracking the movement of electron holes instead of the movement of electrons beacuse holes are easier to track.&quot; I wasn't sure what you meant by &quot;track.&quot; (Measure with an ammeter? Actually measure the position of a hole?)</p>
<p>I think electrical current is defined as the flow of electrical charge, which is usually electrons, but can be ions or holes. In a metal wire, the electrons are what is actually moving. But since the flow of either positively charged particles or negatively charged  particles can constitute a current, we use the positive to negative convention to avoid confusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really correct. We say current flows from positive to negative because that's just the arbitrarily chosen convention. When electrons flow from negative to positive in a DC current, this is just one example of electric current flowing from positive to negative.</p>
<p>Your response is generating a lot of confusion because few people even know what holes are in the context of solid state physics. And anyway, the concept of holes isn't relevant to the question. They're just one example (and a very abstract one, at that) of positive charges moving in the direction from positive to negative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once had to replace some batteries in a UPS,9 car batteries run in series, (shelfs were parallel), and as I was removing a connector from a positive terminal my socket wrench hit the metal enclosure. I was wearing protective gloves but my elbow wasn't shielded and was resting on the enclosure.  The socket wrench was on the positive terminal. If the &quot;charge&quot; comes from the negative side, was it the &quot;electron hole&quot; that propelled me back and caused a momentary loss of bladder control?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Car batteries are by convention negatively grounded, meaning the (-) terminal is at the same potential as the car body. Meaning if you make a connection with the (-) terminal, nothing happens, there's no potential difference (i.e. voltage). So it's actually the (+) terminal that is &quot;lifted&quot; away from the ground potential when the battery is charged. If you make contact with this terminal (as you found out) you will get quite a shock.</p>
<p>Here's the confusing bit. In solid metal, electrons are the charge carriers, and they're negatively charged. Meaning they're actually moving in the <em>opposite direction</em> to the conventionally defined electrical current. Confusing as this is, it technically doesn't really matter what carries the actual charge, because you don't need some &quot;source&quot; of electrons (the battery, the wires, and the car are completely full of them, and they simply all move around the circuit together), what you need is a source of <em>potentia differencel</em>, which is the (+) terminal, lifted from the ground potential by the chemical energy stored in the battery.</p></div>		</li>
