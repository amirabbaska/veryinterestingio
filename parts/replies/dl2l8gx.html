			<div class="markdown"><p>Given sufficient time, skill, and motivation absolutely any man-made system can be compromised (and, generally, as we expand our collective knowledge we tend to have some luck with non-man-made systems as well).  Effective security isn't actually <em>perfectly</em> secure, it simply drives the cost of compromising a given system into the realm of impracticality via those three factors.  Encryption, for example, can always be defeated by brute force but, when implemented properly, should take so long to do so that it's nigh impossible for modern computers to do so in a remotely reasonable time period.  Security practices and standards are continually updated and improved to try to drive the skill barrier out of reach of the VAST majority of would-be adversaries.</p>
<p>As for <em>everyone</em>... humans have been pretty good at manipulating each other since WELL before computers were ever a thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd prefer to stick to the words I already used, that being <strong>Pretty much</strong> anything is hackable. Not that literally everything is hackable. If not by purely technological means, via social engineering.</p>
<p>As far as hacking PEOPLE goes, that depends on your definition of hacking because that's kind of a weird one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fairness, the Diebold voting machine hacking problems were not so much &quot;programmers can find an exploit&quot; as &quot;people can put tab A into slot B and often also type&quot;.</p>
<p>The security of the machines as shown by security researchers across the country during their deployment was deplorable, and that's not even counting the fact that many machines were simply falling apart (being computers more than a decade old that had been plugged, unplugged, handled by tens of thousands and shipped across the country multiple times) and often simply did not work - resulting in substantial disenfranchisement caused by people leaving without having cast a vote at all as more and more stations were lost to the ravages of time.</p>
<p>Here's a couple of links, including one of the most boring explanations of the threat ever</p>
