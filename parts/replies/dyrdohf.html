But the two factors instead are day length (as you mentioned), but also the whether day length is getting longer or shorter. These two factors modulate melatonin which could have a role in adiposity, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adaptation to cold (or hot) temperatures has less to do with annual rhythms and more to do with whether or not you actually get exposed to cold or hot temperatures. I included the physiological response to cold temperatures in my post simply because cold temperatures tend to be associated with seasonal changes, at least on areas that have an actual winter. So while it's not governed by a biological clock type response in humans, it's still very much a &quot;a change in human body affected by the changing seasons&quot;.</p>
<p>Animals that hibernate or torpor over the winter definitely react to diminishing light by building up fat reserves, and probably specific type of fat reserves at that. By the way, hibernation and torpor are two different things - both cause the metabolism of the animal to drop significantly, but hibernation is much more extensive drop in body temperature, while torpor is more akin to deep sleep. A sleeping animal can awaken relatively fast, a hibernating animal cannot. For example, brown bears do not hibernate, instead they torpor (sleep) over the winter. Hedgehogs and bats are examples of warm-blooded animals that hibernate. But I digress...</p>
<p>In humans, we likely don't have that type of response to start preparing for winter just from the changing light alone (might have something to do with evolutionary history as a tropical animal) <em>but</em> cold exposure does still cause direct physical responses, one of which is the increase (or activation, rather) of brown fat tissue in the body through repeated exposure to cold. An example paper here: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3726172/" target="_blank">Cold acclimation recruits human brown fat and increases nonshivering thermogenesis</a></p>
<p>To be pedantic, it's probably incorrect to talk about &quot;increase&quot; rather than &quot;activation&quot;, because the amount of brown adipose tissue cells and white adipose tissue cells doesn't really change, but rather how much fat is stored in each tissue type. When brown fat tissue is activated, more fat is stored in this type of tissue, which happens to be less detrimental to health than having a lot of fat stored in white fat tissue which is metabolically much less active.</p></div>		</li>
