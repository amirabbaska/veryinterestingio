<p>Guess its like that in all aspects of life, not just parking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd venture a guess that they're paranoid of someone door dinging their car and they self-justify the expense of the potential tickets to be less than the time and money to repair the damage from door dings. I've often considered zip tying shopping carts  to their door handles at grocery stores. I doubt the majority of people who would park like that carry around a work knife, wire cutters, or multitool.</p></div>		</li>
