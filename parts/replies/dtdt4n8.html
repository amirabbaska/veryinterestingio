			<div class="markdown"><p>Just try talking into a fan with your friend on the other side. We all did when we were kids. The vibrations travel through the air and if the medium is being affected, so will the vibrations that are carried by it. Also at high wind speeds its a mix of factors that makes the words inaudible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really an explanation to his question. It's just describing the situation more detailed. But the question was, do the sound waves actually literally get blown away and not arrive at the receiver, or is the wind noise simply louder than the sound waves coming from the person saying something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;A perfectly linear wave will propagate the sound as a package inside the greater compression wave.&quot;
&quot;When the current in the wind is chaotic, it causes those compression waves to lose cohesion and phase cancel.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm not trying to bash these guys for being thorough, but this is ELI5 ffs. I barely follow some of these answers and I studied some of these terms in college. There's a lot of showing off and not much answering going on. Feels like r/iamverysmart</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the answer is implicit in that if you get what the poster said, you can answer the question. And the thing is that a direct answer here is not really possible because OP asked &quot;is it A or B?&quot; when really neither A nor B is quite right. </p>
<p>But it would have been helpful to also include an explicit answer like &quot;it's not 100% either of those things&quot; for sure.</p></div>		</li>
