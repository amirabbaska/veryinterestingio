RIF has a built-in browser but you can only browse 1 page at a time, and you cant return to reddit without leaving that page and losing any progress on it. It's actually probably the biggest feature lacking from an otherwise great app </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taekwondo black belt here.  Can confirm first part.  The whole point of the gihab (or kiai for any karate or judo practitioner.  I'll use kiai just to avoid confusion.) is to ensure proper exhalation during a strike, increasing its power significantly.  As far as the element of surprise goes, a loud kiai coupled with good body language or stance is very intimidating!  It will most likely send somebody with little to no training into a panic.  On the other hand, the kiai is not used with every single strike in its vocal form.  Many strikes are accompanied by a &quot;silent&quot; kiai, which is simply a sharp exhalation to mimic the vocal kiai without the noise, and vocal kiai are reserved mainly for your power strikes (reverse elbow strike, #2 roundhouse, jump snapkick, etc.)</p>
<p>TL;DR: Screaming makes you stronger, sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for expanding on this :).  I just thought about it and was about to come back and edit.  Perhaps it is a primitive device to help with difficult tasks.  Perhaps exhaling helps relax important muscles involved in work, providing more power with contraction?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading (And I don't remember where, so admittedly, this could be total bullshit), that it's common &quot;folk knowledge,&quot; in Japan that being aroused raises your blood pressure, so the implication is to take that to cartoonish extremes, and say that the character is so aroused, and their blood pressure so high, that they began to bleed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was born in Japan and had that &quot;arousal = nose bleed&quot; knowledge drilled into my mind long before I started watching any anime.  It's definitely something passed around as a &quot;common knowledge&quot; without real evidence for it.  Another little myth they spread around regarding nose bleed was that if you eat too much chocolate too fast, your nose will bleed.  I remember it being awful because my nose bled often when I was young, and my mom would accuse me of secretly eating chocolate when she saw me bleed through my nose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've heard, japanese people are actually more prone to nose bleed due to thinner capillary walls. </p>
<p>Also the climate in japan can get very dry, especially in the winter which is also supposed to add to the amount of nose bleeds.</p>
<p>And thirdly I read a post from a western person working as a teacher in japan that in her experience nose bleeds are way more common there than where she was originally from.</p>
<p>With all this the increase in blood pressure from being sexually excited = nose bleeds, is not that far off and sort of makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I had you venture a guess (And I do because Reddit), is say it might have something to do with the correlation between both sexual arousal and nose bleeds with increased blood pressure.  While it's totally unlikely that someone had ever gotten a nose bleed from sexual attraction, it's possible that the idea of being so pent up (which is also part of Japanese culture, I believe) that your blood pressure gets so sigh that you &quot;explode&quot; with a nose bleed.  </p>
<p>Kinda similar to western ideas of heat and anger.  Like, yes, body temperature might rise slightly in response to anger, but it's not going to literally make steam come out of your ears.  Yet that's our cultural trope.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have had a nosebleed literally mid-thrust. Can't be <em>that</em> uncommon. And it was in January. Very dry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can only guess that some kind of sign was needed that wasn't overly explicit, so someone came up with the idea of a nosebleed, over I suppose drooling, and implemented it in a cartoon. But even then I'd still like to know who came up with it and when it was first used. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once heard that it b/c people blush when aroused or something and the nose bleed is just a more powerful way of showing it. But I'm not sure and have no way to back this up...</p></div>		</li>
