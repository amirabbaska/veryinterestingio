			<div class="markdown"><p>I went on a tour of the set of CBS This Morning and met Charlie Rose, Gayle King and Norah Odonnell. Man, they were pros, and you could see how proud they were that they weren't stooping to the lowest common denominator and were making a show with, you know, news. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ironically, the original Today show itself had a street-level studio when it first launched back in the early 1950s, but they didn't take it anywhere to the level it is these days; it was still a news show at heart. </p></div>		</li>
