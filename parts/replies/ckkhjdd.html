			<p>Yes. You can cite published research that you've written. The reason this is acceptable is such research has been peer reviewed and printed in a scientific journal. Also usually research is a collaborative effort, so it's not just your scientific findings, but the findings of your coauthors as well and by extension the research institute or group you represent.</p>		</li>

			<p>Wait so what if you are the only one who has a published paper on it? Who do you cite then? Or can just not say it at all?</p>		</li>

			<p>See this comment:  <br><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2glzxl/when_we_lose_fat_where_does_the_fat_really_go/ckkkhxm" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2glzxl/when_we_lose_fat_where_does_the_fat_really_go/ckkkhxm</a><br><br>Even if the research lists someone as the sole author, it has been presumably gone under peer review and has been published in an academic setting. We've had panelists cite their own research before with zero problems. However, preprints, like an ArXiv preprint for instance, isn't a kosher source and is easily open to criticism and often rightfully so, though we don't forbid ArXiv links.</p>		</li>

			<p>Fatty acids are 75-80% carbon by weight, When you burn fat, most of the mass that goes out of your body is carbon.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, on a per-mass basis you are indeed correct, but your body cares much more about the number of moles of hydrogen that come off of a lipid than how much the lipid weighs. For most of the fats, each carbon has two hydrogen atoms attached to it, hence the number of moles of H20 and CO2 for a fat are roughly equal for complete metabolic oxidation and therefore why I said half.</p>		</li>

			<p>Oh, I see what you're saying. But since we're talking about weight loss, really it's losing the carbon that's the main thing. One minute the carbon is sitting there in your fatty acids, next minute it's gone, and with it 86% of the weight it was adding to your body. The other 14% is in those two hydrogens which go out with the water, which is a byproduct of respiration. As far as actually seeing your weight on the bathroom scales diminish, the O2 doesn't matter, it's just a carrier for the carbon and the two hydrogens.</p>		</li>

			<p>Is that carbon expelled via the lungs as CO2, or are you disagreeing with the original comment? If it is expelled via the lungs, wouldn't roughly 2/3s of that weight be Oxygen?</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah that's what's measured if you do a max aerobic capacity test. The mask measures the amount of co2 and o2 being exhaled. The higher the amount of co2, the farther in to anaerobic exercise you are, and the harder your body is working, and the more lactate you're producing.</p>		</li>

			<p>Wait I thought that metabolizing fats REQUIRED water?</p>		</li>

			<p>The initial hydrolysis of lipids does require water. It's just that the terminal stages of metabolism involve reducing atmospheric oxygen into water.</p>		</li>

			<p>Good to know. I've heard that people who area fasting need to drink lots of water to metabolize all the fat that they will need to be using through the day.</p>		</li>

			<p>rupert1920 is correct in his analysis, but with hyper-effective kidneys and different mass-to-volume ratio, organisms can live off of fats just like the kangaroo rats do. Metabolizing fats actually gives a net increase in the number of water molecules in your body, but we humans have some bad central cooling and inefficient kidneys. <br><br>When the human body digests amino acids in proteins, it needs to put all of the nitrogen atoms  somewhere, so it places them on a waste molecule called urea. In order to excrete urea, we need to use lots of water to safely dilute it. Birds have that white stuff in their poop that is actually their form of pee, called uric acid. Fish have an almost infinite dilution of water around them, so they can excrete the very toxic ammonia directly. <br><br>Humans are pretty big, and they can't just be cooled by panting, so we tend to sweat when we heat up. Including digesting and metabolizing fats as one thing that can really crank up the heat in our cells; the chemical reactions that happen inside you give off a net heat outwards, and we need to use water as sweat to keep from overheating if the environment isn't cold enough. Kangaroo rats are quite small and can therefore have a massive heat flux out of their bodies without the aid of sweating. They make little burrows into the cool desert floor and are nocturnal which keeps them at just the right temperature so they aren't too cool or too hot. Of course this high surface area-to-volume ratio comes with the drawback of being wholly intolerant to colder climates.</p>		</li>
