			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to add to that, I was curious last night and found a list of all the executive orders. Only looked at Obama's, but so far Trump is going at about the same rate as him. Obama had 7 in January and 8 in February of his first year. </p>
<p>Was thinking Trump was going nuts with them. Apparently it's just what happens when we get a new president. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obamas used a backdoor known as memorandums which don't need a&quot;citation of authority &quot; which in short is a federal law an EO points to as grounds for the legality of the EO. Nor do memorandums have to be published in the Federal registry, but they have he exact same power as EOs. </p>
<p>Here is a good run down. <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/12/16/obama-presidential-memoranda-executive-orders/20191805/" target="_blank">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/12/16/obama-presidential-memoranda-executive-orders/20191805/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trump promised that what has been signed with an executive order, and be resint with an executive order, so as per his promise he is going to have many in his first days in office. It will be interesting to see if he continues later in his term.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If Congress doesn't like an executive order, they can pass a law overruling it and Congress's law will take priority. The president can veto the law however, so basically to overrule an Executive Order a 2/3 majority is needed in Congress to overrule the executive order. <strong>This is why the Republican controlled congress couldn't stop Obamacare from happening.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bolded it utterly false. Obamacare is not an executive order. It was voted for and passed.</p>
<p>Also, the table of executive orders is intentionally misleading. There are two main vehicles for presidential action: executive orders and presidential memoranda. Both do the same thing, but have different names. Obama intentionally hit a target number of executive orders, but issued the highest number ever of presidential memos. Combined, he took more unilateral actions than any president since Truman.</p></div>		</li>

<p>E.g. Bush Sr. had only one term, but his successors all had two terms.</p></div>		</li>
