			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, and in slightly more nuanced terms they're saying &quot;brain makes what it needs&quot;</p>
<p>It's amazing how far and how late in life the brain can do this, actually. There was one case of a woman with a brain tumor that felt no noticable symptoms despite losing 90% of her squishy gray lobes. Life finds a way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The entire concept of neuroplasticity is also why someone can recover function of their arm after a stroke destroyed the neurons that were originally performing said task. If it's a function that is trained (hence the great importance of physical and occupational therapy) then there will be reprogramming of some existing neurons to take over the function that was lost by the stroke. </p></div>		</li>
