<p>The diamond has an imperfection – a sealed-off inclusion – that contains minerals that became trapped during the diamond’s formation. When the researchers took a closer look at it with infrared microscopy, they saw unmistakable evidence of the presence of hydroxyl ions, which normally come from water. They were everywhere, says Jacobsen</p>

<p>mean that the water isn’t wet? They are talking about diamonds no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is &quot;H2O&quot; present at all?  I read it as OH- and H+ are present, and they both bond to the carbon chain instead of each other.  How does the conditions affect the equilibrium constants of OH^- + H^+ -&gt; H2O.  At STP [H^+ ] in pure water is 10^-7  but that is some gnarly pressure and temperatures.  Entropy would almost entirely force the ions onto the carbon chain with no H2O to be seen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydroxyl= OH-. That is &quot;half&quot; of a water atom. Water can ionize into an OH- and an H+--in fact, water is such an aggressive polar substance that it can do this to itself under normal conditions. The water you drink likely has tiny amounts of these ions.</p>
<p>I don't know anything about what 1000km down conditions do to water, but I do know that other substances ionize when they are really, really hot--this is what drives something called the Bowen Reaction series which is like...one of the most important concepts in geology.</p>
<p>We don't think about it, but water is really a horribly destructive substance. It is incredible what it can do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the original post is asking how far down the ocean water would travel directly from the ocean.</p>
<p>More than likely, the water inclusions found in those diamonds is from melting of minerals with structurally bound/compounded water, or from a water-saturated slab of oceanic crust that was later subducted. </p></div>		</li>
