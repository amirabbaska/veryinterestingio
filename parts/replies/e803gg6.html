			<div class="markdown"><p>It was especially fun because we shut down the cod fishing industry in order for the species to come back. Fishermen put up a huge fight about losing their jobs, but had they been allowed to fish the species into extinction they would have lost their jobs anyway. </p>
<p>Then Spanish and Portuguese boats came in and kept fishing anyway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha. I remember buying a Guinness years ago and it was ALL foam. Said to the bar maid what's this? She said in a condescending tone, &quot;we don't do the slow pour here&quot;. I said, &quot;then don't serve Guinness&quot; and demanded and received my money back. The other bar tender looked at me with sympathy.</p></div>		</li>

<p><del>Parts of the Grand Banks are outside Canadian economic zone.  Unfortunately that was were the remaining fish stocks seemed to be concentrated.</del></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s the same story in New England. The fishermen in Gloucester overfished in the 80s and left stocks on the brink of collapse. The Feds have been trying to manage it sustainably ever since but the fishermen keep complaining the government is trying to put them out of business...which doesn’t even make sense, why would the government want to do that? And if there fishermen were allowed to fish as much as they wanted there would be no more fish and that would be that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like it's a sub category of NIMBY reaction. </p>
<p>&quot;Go regulate someone else to fix this low fish problem, we need to protect our jobs&quot; </p>
<p>Some politicians will even play into this for easy votes, making vague promises of removing old restrictions that &quot;stifle job creation&quot; and either they don't follow through and the workers are left without work, or they do and the workers fish themselves out of business. </p></div>		</li>
