			<div class="markdown"><p>It's subcritical. However, even with a critical mass, you'd be lucky to get even a small fraction to detonate. Most of the mass is wasted in the blast. You can probably get an eyelash amount to slowly release its energy by neutron bombardment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but if I recall correctly, fissionable materials are usually discussed as one of three states:</p>
<p><strong>Sub critical</strong>: Releases energy due to radioactive decay only.<br />
<strong>Critical</strong>: Enough mass to undergo a sustained chain reaction, but not to explode. Nuclear reactors run in this state<br />
<strong>Super Critical</strong>: Undergoes an exponentially increasing chain reaction. Enough mass to explode. Bombs rely on this state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty easy--you just need to start with <em>a lot</em> more. In 1945<a href="https://www.orau.org/PTP/Library/accidents/la-13638.pdf" target="_blank">, a Los Alamos physicist killed himself by putting two 7 lb hemispheres of plutonium too close together.</a> </p>
<p>The reaction probably split less than 1/20th of an &quot;eyelash&quot; worth of plutonium (it produced heat, but no explosion), but it gave off enough radiation to kill him outright.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as a nit-pick: the 1945 criticality accident was a solid core that was fine by itself, but the scientist (Harry Daghlian) was putting neutron-reflecting bricks around it. He had just gotten to the level of it being almost critical, and was going to put one more block on it, realized it was a problem, moved the block away, and then <em>accidentally dropped the block</em>. It made it momentarily critical. Bad times.</p>
<p>In 1946, another scientist with the same core was lowering a neutron reflector over it, holding it in place with a screwdriver, and the screwdriver slipped. Bad times x 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wellerstein/status/671019145916506113" target="_blank">Reconstruction photos of the positions of the experimenters just before the accidents</a>.</p>
<p>The core by itself was subcritical. It was 14 lbs / 6 kg of plutonium, which as a bare sphere is not critical â€” it takes about 24 lbs / 11 kg of plutonium to be critical as a bare sphere. However if you add reflectors, increase the density, or dunk it into water (among other things), it can become a critical system, even though its mass hasn't changed.</p>
<p>They estimate that 10^16 fission reactions took place, which is about the energy equivalent of 77 grams of TNT, which works out to be about 1/10th of an &quot;eyelash.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's something called &quot;critical mass&quot;.</p>
<p>Basically, when a U-235 atom splits, it releases 3 high-energy neutrons. However, if you only have a small mass of U-235, the neutrons are likely to just escape and not continue reacting. Once the mass is big enough (critical mass), there are enough neutrons hitting other atoms to cause a chain reaction. However, even in this case, the explosion blows apart the uranium core before large amounts have split (once it's blown apart it's no longer chain reacting).</p>
<p>In the bomb at Hiroshima, only about 1% of the uranium actually split.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm often astonished by the energy in atoms.</p>
<p>For those who like some perspective:</p>
<p>If you suspend a dead fruit fly with mass 2 <em> 10^-7  kg(according to Wikipedia) in space. And you glue one U235 atom on it.<br />
If the atom splits and all energy 3 </em> 10^-11 J is converted into kinetic energy.   E = mv^2 /2 The fruit fly will move with a speed of about 1.7 cm per second.</p>
<p>It's pretty small, but a fruit fly is macroscopic and 1.7 cm is macroscopic. (faster than the ends on minute hands of most clocks)
All from a single atom.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's more to it than the efficiency. If you look at the mass of a U-235 or PU-239 atom, then calculate up the mass of all the fission products (daughter isotopes, alpha particles, neutrons, electrons). When you add them up, the missing mass is about 0.003 atomic weight units. So the e=mc**2 equation applies not the mass of a uranium atom, but to only a very little bit - as you say, about the mass of dollar bill when starting with about 15 kg of uranium. There is certainly also an efficiency factor at work too - what percent of the uranium actually gets fissioned vs just blown into fallout dust. When you're talking about the energy from single atom fission events, it needs to be calculated based on the missing mass, not the mass of the atom as a whole  </p>

<p>Can I say that I have no intuitive sense for &quot;TNT&quot; as a scale?  Is 1kg a lot?  What about 100g?  How big a hole in the ground is that?  </p>
<p>Maybe back when we were in WWII or when everyone had dynamite in the shed, this was a useful comparison.  But especially on the &quot;a few atoms&quot; scale it doesn't give me any useful point of reference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would lifting give you a better sense of the energy?</p>
<p>When you lift something it gains potential energy equal to</p>
<pre><code>E = m * g * h</code></pre>
<p>where m is the mass of the object you are lifting, g is the gravitational acceleration on earth, which is about 9.82 N/kg and h is the distance you are lifting the object.</p>
<p>Let's say that we lift the object 1 meter up. Then</p>
<pre><code>m = E / (g * h) = 4000000 J / (9.82 N/kg * 1 m) = 407300 kg</code></pre>
<p>The energy released by detonating 1 kg of TNT (and the 5 * 10^-8 kg Uranium) is equivalent to lifting 407300 kg (about the mass of a fully loaded Boeing 747) one meter from the ground. </p></div>		</li>
