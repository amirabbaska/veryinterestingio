			<div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion, it was pretty much entirely because of cursive writing. The line over the top of the a wasn't really necessary since a ended at the bottom of the letter and o ended at the top, so they were easily distinguishable. When I first learned cursive, they encouraged me to draw the line over the a, but within a couple of years, nobody was doing it, including me. It was superfluous and somewhat faster to write without it.</p></div>		</li>
