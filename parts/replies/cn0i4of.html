			<p>In my area, the autoworkers and the union contracts always drove the economy.  Every time they renegotiated they had to fight harder and harder for pay, benefits, pension, etc.  That set the bar for wages/benefits.  Basically if you were a high tech company you have to pay better than the autoworkers were getting paid. Plus the more money they had, the more expendable income was flying around the economy and everything else benefitted.<br><br>Then the car industry crashed (2008ish).  The autoworkers had their share of blame, but it really boiled down to decades of mismanagement and spending.  Everything got pinned on the unions and hourly workers supposedly making outlandish wages and insane benefits.  Everything in this area crashed for a few years when the unions got beat down and it killed wages.  That was a big blow to union strength everywhere when everyone piled on the autoworkers (see 2011 Wisconsin with Scott Walker, though those were public employees so slightly different).</p>		</li>

			<p>I think those could be described more as symptoms.

			<p>Let's not forget, the population of the US in 1945 was only 141 million people, and unemployment was 3.9%.  Oil was &quot;abundant&quot; in the sense that you didn't have to burn very many barrels of the stuff to obtain 100 more barrels.   Purchasing parity was extremely high for imports as well.<br><br>Then we have to take into account the &quot;support ratio&quot; which characterizes the proportion of workers to pensioners.  Retirement is recent invention, and even then, people spend much more time in this period than they did in the past.  <br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensions_crisis" target="_blank">&quot;In 1950, there were 7.2 people aged 20â€“64 for every person of 65 or over in the OECD countries. By 1980, the support ratio dropped to 5.1 and by 2010 it was 4.1. It is projected to reach just 2.1 by 2050. The average ratio for the EU was 3.5 in 2010 and is projected to reach 1.8 by 2050.&quot;</a></p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; War is a huge money maker.<br><br>Only for a few winners, and I don't mean countries. War is terrible disruptive, even the winners lose, but a handful of special interests loot wealth from everyone else. That's enough to <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/02/debunking-the-myth-that-war-is-good-for-the-economy-once-and-for-all.html" target="_blank">keep the myth that war is good for making money</a> alive.<br><br>E.g. if you go to war, and it costs you a hundred billion dollars to make ten billion dollars, that loss gets ignored or forgotten (&quot;it's part of the war&quot;). People don't count the economic loss from people wasting their time in the army when they could be working at something productive, let alone the cost of the dead. The important thing is that you bring back a shitload of valuable treasure from the conquered enemy, a few companies quadruple their profits, you build some big showy monuments, and people fail to notice that they're actually poorer despite having won. It's the broken windows fallacy, writ large over whole countries.<br><br>I will accept that, in the Bad Old Days when you conquered a country and bleed it dry, looting everything you could for as long as you could, war made sense for the victor, <em>if</em> you could win cheaply enough. When the East India Company first took over India for England, India was richer that the UK, and people in cities which today we consider economic hell-holes (Calcutta, Mumbai) were better off than places like London. The East India Company bled India dry, siphoning wealth out of India into the UK.<br><br>And England wasn't anywhere near the worst.<br><br>But note that when first-world economic superpowers try the same thing against each other, you get the First and Second World Wars instead.</p>		</li>

			<p>Fun fact: After everything was destroyed in WWII, they rebuilt the electric infrastructure using underground pipes with wires in them, rather than telephone poles.

			<p>Definitely true if you look globally (and mine is equally simplistic).  Postwar was mainly interested in postwar European countries, so if you look at just those economies, (Western) Germany recovered to a better place than Britain in the aftermath.

			<p>Coming from a US-centric education of post-WW2 history (being educated in the US), Judt's focus on the European postwar experience was refreshing.  It also filled in some deficiencies in my knowledge, especially of European events that happened shortly after my birth (too soon for the history books in school; too young to understand in the media).</p>

			<p>Uhh... No. War <em>boosts</em> economy across the board. It is literally one of the best ways to pull out of a depression. The entire economy shifts over to war production, which creates jobs. For instance, car makers may shift to making army trucks instead. And those army trucks require a lot of new jobs to get resources, manufacture, ship, etc...<br><br>The problem is that this requires <em>large</em> war, like World War 2. It requires <em>everyone</em> to shift to war production. Smaller things like Iraq and Afghanistan didn't help, because it didn't require <em>everything</em> to shift to war production - we simply sent some people over, while the general population didn't really need to change.</p>		</li>

			<p>War production does not create jobs.  Demand does.  The demand to replace destroyed/lost goods increases jobs but that's not really the point.  The question is whether or not people are better off.  Do they have more access to goods and services?<br><br>In addition, the shift of production of one good to another does not mean a net gain if the resources meant for one are simply reappropriated for another.<br><br>The usual examples to show war is good usually involves the countries not actively participating in the war or having the war waged on their territory. US Post war, the North post Civil war etc.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah you can pull ridiculous shit out of nowhere to create jobs - paying people to dig holes and other people to fill them back in boosts the economy and creates jobs, but it's useless work and so is war (to the extent that it is just destruction and we would be better off if we could all get along, even if there are less army related jobs because they are pointless jobs).</p>		</li>

			<p>To elaborate on:<br>&gt;Basically in the post-war era, the USA enjoyed a major economic boom. Baby boomers could get secure, high-paying jobs fresh out of high school to buy a nice house and support a stay-at-home wife and family of 2.5 kids.<br><br>So the country was booming from all the increased activity resulting from war time activities, factories supplying equipment and what not. And other countries were destroyed, all the European ones where fighting actually happened, they had infrastructure bombed to hell and back. But US soil was untouched and it bounced back immediately, while other countries fell behind, making the difference even great. Now while this situation was going on, there were no workers available to work all of these new jobs because a tonne of 18-40 year old males died during the war. <br><br>Supply and demand. Lots of jobs + Not very many workers = High wages to attract workers.<br><br>These people worked very well paying blue collar jobs working with their hands. And they got the American dream mindset in their head that their kids were going to all go to university and use their minds. So they sent them all to school.<br><br>Now its the opposite. Tonnes of university education people hanging around, but there are only so many jobs for university educated people. Supply and demand. High supply, low demand, wages go down.<br><br>Conversly, trade now have a high demand, and have very good wages. Electricians, the ones who use their hands to lay wire in a house, are making better wages then electrical engineers with 8 years of school who designed those wires.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; boomers had parents who destroyed some of the stiffest competition for manufacturing in the world (Germany and Japan)<br><br>There's more to that though, because Europe did recover post-war, as did Japan. The USSR also modernized to the point that people <em>seriously</em> thought maybe there was something to be said about communism. When Khrushchev banged his shoe on the table at the UN and swore that &quot;we will bury you&quot;, he wasn't talking about nuclear weapons, he was talking about consumer goods. And for a decade or so, it looked like they were right. (They weren't.)<br><br>Up until the 1990s, it looked like having failed to conquer the world, Japan would simply buy it. Tom Clancy even wrote a novel about the US going to war against Japan, and he was hardly the only one who thought that the Japanese economic challenge would turn into a military challenge.<br><br>I believe that the real reason for stagnation since the 1970s is that people in positions of power have chosen polices that lead to ENORMOUS rates of growth for the 0.1%, and stagnation for everyone else. There is more production of goods in the world today than ever before, but because Wall Street sets the rules, Wall Street makes all the profits, and not the people making the goods.</p>		</li>

			<p>You're off by about a century.<br><br>Japan kept itself isolated for hundreds of years until 1853, when Commodore Matthew Perry parked a couple of American warships in Tokyo Bay and demanded that Japan trade with us... or else.<br><br>The cultural effects of open borders and free trade with Americans completely re-made the Japanese national culture. Japan prior to Perry had a defined feudal heirarchy, in which Samurai were responsible to Daimyo, Daimyo to Shoguns, and Shoguns sat on a council to rule the country. But under the <em>Meiji Restoration</em>, the power of the Shoguns was consolidated in the Emperor.<br><br>This abolished the Daimyo (their former domains became &quot;prefectures&quot;) and eventually the Samurai. The warrior class thus became the capitalist class, and Japan rapidly industrialized. By 1900, Japan had 800 steamships and 5000 miles of railway track... and those numbers doubled every decade.<br><br>Of course, when you take a society that has always placed an emphasis on loyalty and martial valor, and you take away all their internal conflict points while forcing them to do business with the US, weird things happen.<br><br>So it was that the Japanese Army decided to do for Asia what the Americans had done for Latin America a century earlier. Some of Asia welcomed this development (Indonesia was happy to get out from under Europe's thumb), while others didn't (see: Manchuria). The US, horrified by Japan's expansion, embargoed Japan, and in July 1941 we cut off their supply of oil. A few months later the Japanese conducted a massive strike on the US's primary Hawaiian naval base, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>		</li>

			<p>The problem with your reply is that you make it sound like all this &quot;just happened&quot;, like it was inevitable or a fluke of bad luck. It wasn't. It happened because people decided to make it happen.<br><br>I don't mean that there was some conspiracy in a back room somewhere where thirteen shadowy figures decided what would happen, but the state we are in today is the product of people's actions.<br><br>Governments chose to shift tax revenue from corporations to the working and middle class. They chose to allow the biggest, most profitable companies to pay the least amount of tax. In countries like the UK and Australia, they chose to shift from taxing income to taxing consumption, in the full knowledge that this is a regressive tax that rewards the mega-rich for sitting on their money and punishes the poor for being poor. In the US, the top tax rate used to be 97% during the post-war boom years. Admittedly, there was likely only one person in the US who made enough money to actually pay that rate, Rockefeller, but even so the typical 0.0001-percenters still paid what would be considered an impossibly high tax rate. They paid it, and willingly, because there was still a social contract that applied to everyone. In 1950s it was <em>shameful</em> to avoid paying your taxes, that made you a cheat and a thief. People might have grumbled about tax, but if you had a big tax bill that was also a sign that you had Made It Rich and could afford it. Today, that social contract is gone, thanks to forty years of non-stop propaganda from the Right-wing of politics, to the point where the mega-wealthy almost feel ashamed if they <em>don't</em> avoid paying taxes. Not quite as bad as Greece, but pretty close.<br><br>By the time of Reagan, the top rate was cut to something like 75% (give or take), and since then it's been going down and down. The less the mega-rich pay, the more the middle and working classes have to pay to keep revenue constant. As the mega-rich pay less than their fair share, the working poor pay more than theirs, and the middle class is under attack. Forget social mobility: except for a lucky handful, the only way to go now for 99.9% of us is down.<br><br>In Australia, housing prices have gone insane. We are land-rich and have a low population, so why are our house prices some of the most expensive in the world? (Outside of a handful of cities like London, New York and Tokyo.) Because of choices that our governments have made. They chose to implement policies which would reward buying housing as an investment instead of to live in. They chose to allow foreign investors to flood the housing market and drive prices up, and they chose to lower housing standards so that builders could make more money knocking up dozens of high-density ticky-tack units that will fall apart in 15 years.<br><br>In the UK, the same people who went to university and got their education for free chose to deny free education to the next generation.<br><br>We are in the mess we are in because the Baby Boomers chose to screw us over, big time. The most privileged, lazy, self-indulgent generation since the Regency period got into power and started giving hand-outs to those who don't need it while cutting services and welfare to everyone else.</p>		</li>

			<p>I have to say though that an increased labor supply has had little to do with the current wage crisis. For one the addition of females into the workplace also increased the quality of labor at skilled positions <a href="http://www.oecd.org/g20/topics/employment-and-social-policy/G20-Skills-Strategy.pdf" target="_blank">Source!</a> <br><br>Its just to hard to ignore the difference between CEO and average worker pay. The difference is astronomical in today's world. 331 times larger than the average worker and 774 times as much as minimum wage earners. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathryndill/2014/04/15/report-ceos-earn-331-times-as-much-as-average-workers-774-times-as-much-as-minimum-wage-earners/" target="_blank">Source!</a><br><br>I know there are many other factors in play, your increase labor supply does count, but I really can't see anything being as blatant as income disparity.</p>		</li>

			<p>I would imagine the addition of females into the labor force increased the supply of labor at all skill levels.  It doesn't matter what skill level you're talking about.  An influx of people at that level without an equivalent increase in the demand for those people will cause their &quot;value&quot; for lack of a better term to decrease.<br><br>If you have 10 nuclear physicists, their value is most likely going to be higher than if you have 100 of them, barring an increase in demand along with the increase in number.<br><br>CEO and worker pay differences really don't hold much weight.  For example, take the pay of Walmart's CEO and divide it up amongst the workforce, and it's only increases the average worker pay by a ridiculously low amount(forget the exact amount but it was less than $1.00 per hour).  Do the math in almost any corporation, and you'll realize that especially in large companies, you could elimatinate the CEO salary, as well as the top managers, and you still wouldn't be able to raise the average worker pay by very much.  <br><br>It can work in very small companies, where if you have a small number of employees and the CEO is making some outrageous amount compared to them, reducing their pay can significantly increase the worker's pay but generally that's not applicable to large corporations.</p>		</li>

			<p>If you add in 100 more nuclear physicists than most likely the skill of those new 100 will exceed the existing, thus a rise in productivity. Increased productivity is going to improve the prospect of profits and gains for the company so there should be a gain, perhaps not equal to the now surplus labor, but the effects should be somewhat mitigated. If you want to argue that the best won't necessarily get the jobs then the entire system of capitalism is ineffective which is a whole new problem.<br><br>Now CEO pay alone is not the reason the metric is significant. CEO pay is used as a measuring stick for overall executive and upper management pay. A rise in CEO indicates that the people at the top of the company are generally earning more. Further proof shows us that the pay of all executives grew at a rate of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/02/ceo-pay-worker-pay_n_1471685.html" target="_blank">127 times the average over the last 30 years</a>.<br><br>Now that is quite a bit faster than inflation. Well its a lot faster than inflation to be honest and its completely ludicrous. In fact referring to my first point <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/america-workers-are-more-productive-their-wages-are-flat-some-cases-lower-1393941" target="_blank">workers in the US are now more productive than ever but their wages are not keeping up with the rise in productivity.</a> Hmmm seems that even as we get more productive and produce more we aren't being paid at the same rate. However <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/01/business/lets-stop-rewarding-failed-ceos-common-sense.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0" target="_blank">CEO pay rarely is affected by performance</a> which only furthers my argument that far to much of the current wages are being wasted on CEOs.<br><br>On top of all this we know that a supply based economy (trickle down economics) where we give rich people more money is <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0514-20.htm" target="_blank">less effective than a demand based economy</a>. This means that every dollar given to a rich person does less for the economy than if those same wages were distributed at the dollar for dollar level. Giving every single worker that extra dollar would do more to improve the economy than it would to give it to the CEO. So basically CEO/executives/the rich getting richer has more of an effective than the addition of labor. Also considering the change in lifestyles that started this argument has worsened much more in the last 30 years (you labor argument spans almost 60+ years and we would have better indicators of it earlier).<br><br></p>		</li>

If you have a pool of 10 people with a skill, they will command a higher wage than if you have a pool of 100.  <br><br>As I pointed out in another response, CEO pay is not where the money to pay other employees will come out of.  You could give all of the pay of Walmart's CEO to the rest of the employees and you'd average a tiny increase(was under $.20/hr iirc when I did the math last not the $1 I mentioned).<br><br>I would agree with you that CEO compensation is ridiculous at times.  Ran the company into the ground?  We're letting you go, with a $20 million severance package.  <br><br>However, you're going to need to find something else to move the money from to pay the average worker.  <br><br>In the end, you can cut CEO pay but it won't increase worker pay by any meaningful amount in most companies.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah but you completely ignore the fact that actual wage labor would be higher with an increased supply at any skilled positions. The other 50 might be out of work but the employed ones are the most skilled and most productive meaning they should make more.<br><br>Also you ignore the part about all executive and upper management pay being out of control. Its not just a discussion of CEO that is just the benchmark used to calculate it. Redistributing the top part 10% of the company is the point, thought I made that clear. <br><br>Also you seem to concede my idea on demand side economies being more effective which means that even that 20 cents would still be better spent by those lower in the company. Any extra amount given to them improves the economy as a whole. Also using your example of Walmart, who employs about 1.4 million people, and saying that only half of that amount would receive the 20 cents we find that $140,000 dollars per hour of wage could be spent more efficiently just from correcting one feasible problem. <br><br>Also you seem to concede that the effects of labor surplus should have been realized much earlier than now while my argument of CEO/Executive/Upper management pay has far more recent data do support it.</p>		</li>

			<p>Do other people get raises? My previous boss told me all pissed off that nobody was and my new boss confirmed it yesterday. We are not doing that great. Everyone is being overworked and I've noticed we keep falling short with our clients because of this. The only thing that keeps me there is the fact that I don't work very hard and I'm home all day long with my wife and daughter. I have to be available 40 hrs a week but have only worked on average about 3-4 hours a day. However, that's about to change this year as I think my boss figured out how easy i had it and instead of my usual one project at a time, she's already given me 3 starting on January. If things get ugly, I very likely will leave for another job. I could be making $100-120 with my degree and certification but I also worry I may work tons of hours elsewhere. <br><br>What is it that keeps you in the same job with no raise?</p>		</li>

			<p>Hey. I actually am the age you assumed but I make half as much. Pretty good assumptions. Don't get me wrong, I'm very grateful for the situation I am in. I am incredibly lucky and it took me ages to get to this point. Everyone I work with is 50+ years old and extremely experienced. I got lucky they were desperate with a project and pulled me in and the project was quite a bit in my field where I brought in some great ideas that dazzled the client so they hired me full time. <br><br>At your age, I had just moved from Guatemala and got a job in a video rental store my cousin owned. I was getting paid $7/hr and I hated it, especially the cleaning of toilets and what not. Eventually I got a job in tech support making $13/hr and I hovered below $20/hr for many, many years. I finally got my act together and went to college and studied my ass off. I also got a certification that pretty much tells people you know the principles of project management and I finally broke into the big boy industry. I probably spent $120k in student loans to get here. Man, I wish I had done all of that at your age. I simply didn't know the career path existed. <br><br>Anyway, if you study and eat your frosted flakes every day, you will one day make the big bucks and work from home. Trust me, I fear to lose what I have every day, and it may be possible for me to have a crappy job in the future or things may get bad in my current job, who knows. It's been a lucky run so far. <br><br>My point was inflation. Companies should adjust salaries on a yearly basis for everyone, not just me. They charge the clients higher rates but keep the employees in the same rates. Not cool. </p>		</li>

			<p>There's a few reasons to do this:<br><br>1)  Negotiation is not possible if you are not informed.<br>  <br>What IS your market value?  Maybe you're actually over-paid by industry standards.  Maybe you're under paid.  You can't really know this until you start looking and seeing what kind of money you get offered.<br><br>2)  How good ARE you?  How much is that worth?<br><br>You say your managers are patient with you etc... but the truth is more complex.  You are presumably a junior level employee, being paid junior level wages.  The expectation is not that you put out senior level work.  If you're performing better than other people at a similar career point you are actually a bargain.  This is also hard to determine until you go and try and find work elsewhere.<br><br>3)  Practice.<br><br>You could get fired.  Your company could go out of business.  Anything could happen, interviewing is a skill and keeping yourself sharp here is a major heads up.<br><br>4) (Perhaps most important) You should only be looking out for your own financial (and personal) well being.  <br><br>From a business or societal perspective this is probably not true, however as an individual you should be aiming to maximize your earnings as much as possible.  The higher your pay today (say this year) the more likely it is to be the same level or higher tomorrow (say next year).  </p>		</li>

			<p>Yup.  I just got a job from a headhunter in an accounting related field.  I had received an invoice from said headhunter and opened it up and saw how much my company paid to get me and it was a large sum of money.  From then on out I know I have a little bit of leverage in regards to raises because if they went that route again it'll cost them a lot more money in order to replace me than just give me the raise I requested.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm somewhat split with my boss. Things didn't go well from the getgo, she sees me as a junior PM working around the big boys. She hinted at it. Then when I started to work underneath her directly (in projectized companies you can get loaned out to different bosses), she said that she realized that I'm not very experienced. So I started to panic and I had a chat with my previous boss about how nervous I was. The next day my boss called me and said &quot;look, do you rather work with your old boss or with me?&quot;. I said, &quot;your projects are more difficult but I am learning, in my old projects things were easier; I did say something about it to my old boss (I figured they had talked), but at the same time I am happy to be wherever you guys need me&quot;. Form that point on, my new boss has been extremely encouraging, which feels really weird because at the beginning she was really harsh with me. I'm getting to the conclusion that there is a lack of project managers and that it's tough for them to hire new people. If it were up to her, she would've fired me, but I get this feeling that they want to build me up in the company somehow. I do make the industry average; I am certainly not underpaid, but it would be nice for salaries to go up as inflation goes up.<br><br>I could be making $100-120k but I'm currently at $83k, which in all honesty is not too bad for what I'm doing, but then again, it is not 100-120, which could help me pay off my house in 5 years. You know what I mean? It's a weird situation for me which makes me weigh in different things and I always opt for the easy way which is to make less money but work less. I know I shouldn't and my career isn't advancing, but I've become a conformist in that way. I even have friends high up in Google that have told me they would vouch for me if I wanted a job there but I feel that they will exploit my ass in there.</p>		</li>

			<p>Even when you know more things next year, so do all the other people who started out when you did.  It's a meritocracy in the best case scenario, so you can't grind away like the baby boomer's did.  Your job is your first job, your second is learning more on your own time to be better at it.  <br><br>Unless the benefits of no commute financially outweigh a new job's salary, you have to jump ship. After 18 months (according to an article I read on reddit a few months ago), interview and jump until you find &quot;the one&quot;, if that even exists anymore.<br><br>And for the underachievers, this usually gives the new job less time to figure out that you plateau very quickly.  </p>		</li>

The first projects they gave me were a little too easy and in my comfort zone but now I was just assigned to a data center and a division wide systems/network/helpdesk split. Previous ones were all desktop and printer rollouts. I'm going to learn an assload in the next 2-3 months. Once I feel more comfortable taking on projects that I'm not very familiar with technically, then I will explore that option. I may also look for another job if they start giving me way too much work where I work more than 40 hours a week for at least six to nine months straight. </p>		</li>

			<p>You know, I always hear this, yet I'm not sure I believe this. I'm a software engineer, I've been involved in hiring several people, and in my experience people are actually reducing their earnings growth by switching jobs, unless they happen to be a perfect match for the role in terms of their technical experience (which is rarely the case). Most commonly people are just a decent fit, so they either 1) have to be brought in at a lower pay level than their experience would justify in order to be competitive with their peers, who have less experience, but more relevant experience; or 2) they can't compete with their peers at their starting pay level, so they're stuck there until they gain enough relevant experience.</p>		</li>

			<p>Unfortunately this is another issue with the millennial generation. Our interpretation of &quot;working our way up&quot; happens to be associated with jumping ships. Sometimes it works out great, and other times it's a grass is greener scenario. Being able to rely on job stability, seniority, and investing oneself as a &quot;company (wo)man&quot; has become a less appealing option in the current job market. My opinion is that employers looking to hire &quot;more experience for less money&quot; is the catch 22 of it all. They do not want to invest the training and financial cost (good salary/compensation) because of the trend, but employees don't want to stay either based upon the job climate. </p>		</li>

			<p>I have been with my company for four years (while looking for another job) plus two summers while I was in university. In six years I got one raise of 20%. However, the number of hours of work went down dramatically even as many staff left or were laid off. So I am actually taking home 40% <em>less</em> pay than I did six years ago - and that's not adjusted for inflation - now that I have a lot more responsibilities and a degree. </p>		</li>

			<p>Things will go down the toilet here. No one believes me, but I've been following the news on oil and the economy for years, and it's a matter of when, not if the economy will tank. People assume things will just go along as they always have, but I'm very confident that things are going to tank in a major way in the coming decades, and I think the US is not going to handle the situation well. <br><br>US fracking is expected to peak in 2020 (based on recent studies, including one by the University of Texas), and this is going to have major implications.

			<p>I think one other major factor that occurred both during and after WWI and WWII that no one talks about is the position of women in the workforce. Now I think women should be allowed to have any job they want, jobs should be awarded to the best candidate regardless of gender BUT here's the issue... women entered the work force but men were not allowed to leave it. So instead of having an increase in stay-at-home dads we created the dual-income society where both genders must work. No one can stay at home unless one partner is making the equivalent of a dual-income. So here' s the simple math, there are only so many jobs and let's even say hypothetically that the same amount of jobs exist today as existed in pre-WWI, in the past it was only men competing for the majority of those jobs, now you have women and men competing for that same amount of jobs and both men and women need to have jobs to  have the standard of living they desire. So you have like twice as many people competing for the same amount of jobs and that's just with the hypothetical about the amount of jobs staying the same and also doesn't take into account population increases etc. <br><br>Moral of the story. It's great that women entered the workforce but it's a shame that men weren't allowed to leave it. So now we all work, strangers raise our children, and the competition for jobs has basically doubled. <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>I've thought this as well. At first, it was great because there was a huge increase in disposable income when women became 2nd earners and extended family/grandparents were available to take care of kids.  Then, you have the outsourcing of production to overseas so all that income had extra buying power because of cheap imports.  Over time, pay stagnated and then wasn't keeping up with inflation, prices rose and soon people had to depend on the dual income instead of banking it.  Then, because we outsourced so much, the job pool shrank while the applicant pool continued to grow. I also feel that k-12 education isn't going as far as it used to, and the Bachelor's degree has become the new high school diploma.  It seems like the only way to make a decent wage is to get a masters or PhD these days, unless you're in a particularly in-demand field.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Master's doesn't get you far either in certain industries.  I have an MBA, took lots of finance/accounting courses to get the degree, and work in finance.  I recently moved across the country, looking for a new job, and I'm hearing from employers &quot;the degree is great but can you get your CFA certification and get your Series licenses?&quot;  (I do stock research.  The CFA is for salesmen who need to advise clients on options &amp; investment law; the different series certifications are also for salesmen purposes.  I don't do sales nor have I applied to any positions that have any client interaction.) It feels like now you need the highest degree possible paired with <em>every</em> certification in your field (even if they don't directly relate to your position) plus 5+ years of experience.</p>		</li>

			<p>Health insurance for a family of 4 can easily cost $10,000/year in some parts of the country, even &quot;moderately priced&quot; areas. Daycare, another $6-10,000/year. Rent, $12,000. So you're $32,000 in the hole, right off the bat. The median household income is close to $50k (the number that's always thrown around to make it seem like Americans do just fine), but the median individual income is only around $30k. <br><br>So, doing the math.. it's not really possible for the typical family to get by on a single income, without welfare. The typical professional, sure, if they make $50-60k/year they can get by and support a family of 4. Won't have much left over but it's doable.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think this is partly true, but the 50s were an aberration in terms of women working and standard of living. Before the war, women (and even children) had to work to support a working class or agricultural family. The labor movement and post-war boom changed that for a while, but workers rights have been systematically eroded for decades and the income gap continues to grow, leaving less room in the economy for a large middle class.</p>		</li>

			<p>Lots of people talk about how expensive education has become as the reason why things are now unaffordable but I think you might be closer to the truth. A lot of countries have relatively low education costs and people are still struggling to make both ends meet. I think one of the reason is before women entered the work force, men were paying for everything. Housing prices are set according to what people are willing to pay so now that both people in a couple work, they are able to pay a lot more for a home so the prices skyrocketed. Without any debt, in most markets now it seems like its just about impossible to buy a home for a single person unless you can manage to save for a massive downpayment.<br><br>Also, 2 people working means 2 cars, it means kindergarten, it means a lot more expenses that weren't really there 40 years ago and it doesn't seem like 2 salaries always cover for the extra costs.</p>		</li>

			<p>Here's a related consequence.  I asked an older gentleman, who was a teacher, what he thought of teaching over the years, how it had changed, if the perception that teachers are worse now is true.<br><br>He said the worst thing to happen to education was feminism and the equality movement.  Brilliant women now become doctors, lawyers, engineers, or whatever they want.  Back in the day, society rejected them from these positions.  So, what did you end up with?  Brilliant women working very cheaply for the only vaguely engaging job:  teaching.<br><br>The reality is probably that the lifestyle of the post-WWII era is simply unsustainable, and it only worked for a time thanks to abundant resources, cheap real estate, and entire swaths of the labor pool effectively barred from competition.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>There is a pilot program at my high school attempting to encourage minorities and women to get into STEM jobs. The way the guy explained it, the majority of the engineers are old white guys, and about half of them will be retiring in the near future. The program is going to attempt to fill a bit of that gap with once again, women and minority children. Unfortunately very few people wound up applying.</p>		</li>

			<p>Easily explained by more women joining other workforces leaving the men previously from those to fight for the engineering jobs that few women want. </p>		</li>

			<p>Which sucks for dads who are natural stay-at-home dads. If I had the job skills to earn both our keep, I would have been happy to have my househusband slay on the homefront.</p>		</li>
