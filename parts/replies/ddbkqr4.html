<p>To be fair, we do use indomethacin to prevent H.O. But that may not be the exact same process.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Possible effect on fracture healing â€” A small increased risk of nonunion in patients with bone fractures has been reported with the use of nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective agents. However, a causal relationship has not been proven, and the effect of these drugs on fracture healing in humans is uncertain. In studies in rodents, both nonselective and COX-2 selective NSAIDs can interfere with normal fracture healing, an effect which appears to be mediated by the inhibition of COX-2 [35,36]. At present, we would not avoid the use of these agents in patients with fractures, given the very small absolute risk of nonunion.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NSAIDs are usually inhibitors of two enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2. The <em>peripheral</em> inhibition of these enzymes (especially COX-2) leads to a decrease in prostaglandin synthesis and hence a decrease in inflammation. </p>
<p>While paracetamol is also a COX-2 inhibitor, it doesn't act in peripheral tissues. It only acts centrally via similar pathways, blocking sensitisation of nerves and hence decreasing nociceptive transmission to the brain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Classical teaching is no. Real answer is &quot;not really in a big way but may to some degree&quot;. Hard to say with certainty because the exact mechanism isn't completely understood and may involve multiple pathways. It does, in some cases at least, inhibit the COX enzymes targeted by NSAIDs but is known to be less anti-inflammatory (while still being a good antipyretic and decent pain medication). The reason for that is unclear but there are a few theories. For instance, because it affects COX via reduction rather than inhibition, and inflammatory reactions result in oxidized acetaminophen/paracetamol, it is unable to exert its actions when in the presence of inflammation.  The pain reduction is likely through a different pathway so that can still work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source that supports the second point you made? Medical student here, from what I know, orthos value adherence to physical therapy, which is facilitated by NSAID usage. No patient is going to do physical therapy when in pain, while that pain is insufficiently combatted by paracetamol. This justifies long term post-fracture NSAID usage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, all the freaking orthopods that lose their freaking minds when I put one of my own patients on Toradol for their dozen rib fractures because it might make their femur fracture have an increased incidence of nonunion. The data is poor and mostly in animals but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3259713/" target="_blank">as this article</a> notes &quot;In the absence of robust clinical or scientific evidence, clinicians should treat NSAIDs as a risk factor for bone healing impairment, and their administration should be avoided in high-risk patients.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But, the ortho guys also want the bone to heal. At the very basic level, the thought process was: bone healing is a inflammatory process/requires inflammatory markers, as such NSAIDs or anything that decreases inflammation will slow down bone growth and healing, increasing the risk of non-union. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Student physical therapist here. It sounds like both posters are talking about long term use of nsaids. A post op course of nsaids, even over twelve weeks, is still one discrete utilization of the drug(s) and is relatively short for pts without pre existing renal pathology. On the other hand, I have run into patients who have been told to take nsaids for <em>years</em> without a break. </p>
<p>Also, IMO modalities are overused in a lot of clinics but TENS and a couple others have shown themselves to be great non-pharma interventions for managing musculoskeletal pain. Not very useful for chronic pain that has lingered and is now more of a brain problem than a soft tissue problem but most ortho pts fall in the soft tissue category. </p>
<p>Additionally, some pts are able to function surprisingly well in spite of pain. It's my job to convince people to do things that are sometimes painful, and a lot of patients with high motivation are willing to push through a lot of discomfort if it helps them achieve their goals. </p></div>		</li>
