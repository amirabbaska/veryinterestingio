			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer. A few clarifications:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Current treatment work well enough that only 2-3 medications are required at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cure you're referring to hasn't been tested in robust enough settings in order to label it as such. Current medications on the market offer a &quot;functional&quot; cure (the patient is never free of infection, but they can be free of the terrible things that happen during the infection) which is likely as close to ideal as it's going to get in the near future, because:</p>
</li>
<li>HIV hides (aka viral latency). It is very effective in evading the immune response and can stay in a dormant state for some time without spreading within a body. Nobody really knows exactly where it's hiding (although we're starting to have a better idea), or how to target viral particles that are not actively replicating. In patients who were on medications and had no evidence of infection then stopped medications, infection comes back 10 times out of 10.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually we aim for three solid active agents on an HIV regimen (<a href="https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/html/1/adult-and-adolescent-arv/11/what-to-start" target="_blank">https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/html/1/adult-and-adolescent-arv/11/what-to-start</a>)</p>
<p>We don't really count drugs that are pharmacokinetic boosters (ritonavir and cobicistat) since they don't have any activity towards HIV at the doses that they are used at. </p>
<p>Usually when 5 or 6 active agents are used, a person has a pretty solid amount of mutations on their profile.</p>
<p>I've seen as little as 2 active agents used (dolutegravir based regimens). Dolutegravir has a pretty high barrier to resistance. But the two drug management is pretty new so I'm not sure how many providers are actually using it. It's been studied in clinical trials (Sword-1 and Sword-2 trials), but just not in the guidelines.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate viruses. Viruses are like fucking terrorists. Even when they cannot kill you, they go hide with general population. They come out when you are weak or security is lax and do damage. You will have them in the back of your mind all the time because they are with you your whole life. Bacteria, on the hand, are like North Korea. Although there is a chance you might get nuked, you know who you fighting and you can annihilate them if you catch them in time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So viral latency is in herpes and shingles. Now I've learned it's in HIV.</p>
<p>Do you know other viruses that utilize latency and are we doing any research on it? Seems like figuring this out is a key part of beating these viruses</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's quite a few viruses that have latent activity. Another prominent one is EBV (Epstein Barr virus).</p>
<p>HIV DNA is a provirus, meaning that once its RNA enters the cell, it is transcribed into DNA which is then integrated into the host DNA. As with our endogenous genes, they can be turned off and on (ex. Transcription factors). This is most likely one of the reasons behind HIV latency.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that some viral gene products can inhibit antiviral mechanisms such as apoptosis, or MHC antigen processing / presentation which further extends the life of the cell that's infected, or reduces the chance of them being detected within a cell. However now we're getting a bit complex for the context of this thread... As cells with downregulated MHC are typically detected by NK cells. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All retroviruses have some form of latency. This is because retroviruses insert themselves into the host genome, and make copies from there, unlike other viruses, where the viral DNA/RNA remains separate. It is impossible with current technology to safely remove this DNA. Latency occurs when the host cell deactivates the region of DNA, but the process by which this occurs is poorly understood and can be reversed.</p>
<p>The human genome is littered with a bunch of odd chunks of DNA that are suspected to have once been retroviruses, but went into latency and lost the ability to replicate for various reasons.</p>
<p>Depending on the insertion point, retroviruses can also disrupt tumor suppressor genes and cause cancer, but I don't believe HIV has been linked to any cancers (feel free to prove me wrong on that one)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The herpesviruses in general (which includes the viruses that cause herpes, shingles, chicken pox, mononucleosis, and a bunch other diseases) are  classical examples. HIV latency is a much newer concept, but I'm not familiar with any other viruses that overtly exhibit latency. Considering how massive the world of viruses is, I'd be more surprised if what was just herpesviruses and HIV! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem isnt the procedure, it's the aftermath.. Two people's genomes are never totally identical and no matter how compatible they are, the hosts immune system will always  recognize foreign tissue and try to attack it. That's why transplant recipients always have to take immunosuppressant medication. Best one can do is minimize the possible different recognition patterns by matching them before transplanting, which is what the databases are for. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In bone marrow transplantations you nuke the recepients marrow. That means there's little to no immune system left in him to attack the grafted marrow he recieves.</p>
<p>However, the transplanted marrow can attack the recepient. This is called Graft Versus Host Disease because it's the donated tissue that attacks the rest of the body. And that's why you need a close match. A platoon of US marines are less likely to accidentally fuck up the countryside if they are teleported to rural England as opposed to North Korea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be very interested to know how this goes. I have recently signed up to be a donor, and just sent off my swab kit.</p>
<p>I have had many people tell me how crazy I am for doing this, bc it's 'such a painful procedure'. However, the way I see it, enduring some pain to potentially save someone's life is a no-brainer.</p>
<p>I wish you and the recipient the best of luck! Kudos to you, you are doing a great thing :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it's not painful. Source: I've donated bone marrow in 2012. You collect bone marrow like a blood transfusion nowadays. The only thing that sucks is having to give yourself injections for a week before you donate. But even I could do it and I hate injections. It's really not a big deal. Most people have the wrong idea how this process works. Good on you for signing up to be a donor! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nowadays you get anesthesia, so it should be painless.  I've heard that afterwards it hurts a bit, but it's only comparable to bit of bruising.</p>
<p>Having a bone marrow biopsy is the one that's painful, but even then it's not as bad as you'd think.  Then again, I've only seen it from the outside so maybe the two patients who had it done were just more macho than I would be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Kudos on you for signing up! People who call you crazy are either afraid for your safety or somehow feel bad that they wouldn't do it so it's easier to call you crazy than to question themselves.</p>

<p>For the recipient it's different, they administrator drugs to kill your bone marrow and then inject the donated stuff. It's the fact that you need a few days in the middle without bone marrow that is dangerous, you have no  immune system during that time.</p></div>		</li>
