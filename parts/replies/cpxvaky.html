			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I am worried for Europe with the upcoming TTIP deal coming, I reckon the healthcare costs are going to rocket as American companies gain more power in the European markets and the universal health care so many countries have will eventually become too costly and dissolve into a similar situation America had before Obama care (or what ever its called).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it won't. Europe, unlike America, actually cares for its citizens and has very tight regulations in place. Besides, loads of Europeans are already protesting the shitty parts of TTIP (crappy US hormone meat, your lax regulations on chemicals, etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Health care strategist and economist here. Articles like this are extremely misleading. First of all, this particle article does not account for about 5 variables the most important of which is how and why the IV was used. Was it inpatient hydration, was it during an OP visit?</p>
<p>You have to understand, the hospital or physician does not get paid based on what they charge. You could literally charge one billion dollars for a blood draw, it doesn't matter. If the IV was used during an IP stay, the hospital gets a lump sum payment based on the discharge DRG. The hospital does not keep direct cost records like any other company might do. Nurses do not log time in on particular patients. You get the lump sum of money and distribute the money across multiple cost centers based on percentage of CPT codes billed. The physician accrues what are call wRVUs. For an IV order, we are talking a fraction of an wRVU (for a primary care, that is about 30 bucks). </p>
<p>For an outpatient, the hospital bills a procedure code with a cpt code modifier. That is given a level of visit. You get what is contracted for that level of visit. 90% of clinics lose money, which is why doctors are running to be employed by health care organizations. </p>
<p>Itemized bills are misleading because the hospital charge system is complicated and does not reveal negotiated rates. Even if you have no insurance, you would never pay that much. I just worked an account for a heart transplant. The person was here 28 days. The charges to payment ratio was minimal. Average margin nationwide for that DRG is 12k. 12k margin for a heart transplant....think about that. There is no way anyone is making that much money on an IV saline. </p></div>		</li>
