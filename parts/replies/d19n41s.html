			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest issue to be honest is the religious part-- both Muslims and Jews (and many Christians, as well) believe that they are entitled to the Holy Land. It makes it really difficult to compromise and actually get this &quot;two-state solution&quot;. Both parties will feel that they are being robbed of their holy land, no matter how the pie is sliced.</p>
<p>Although I do think people often forget that it is not really Jews' fault that they live in this land considered the Muslim Holy Land. After WWII, Britain decided (and with good intentions) that Jews needed a homeland. Israel was chosen without regard to all the Arab natives already living there. Now Israel fights for its life against neighboring countries that say they stole their promised land. There is nowhere else for Jews to go. There is nowhere else they can call home, and now that they're there it's unfair to do them the same thing done to Muslims when Israel was created-- an eye for an eye and all that.</p>
<p>This is all not to say Israel is without blame, and nobody in this situation is. I just find it frustrating to think many people have this idea that Jews &quot;stole&quot; the Muslim holy land.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation has explained it best for me. I was wondering if it was a situation where both people wanted the same piece of land for the same reasons. But I really didn't know about the British sort of just setting them there after WWII. Is that the reason America has some this crazy stubborn alliance with Israel? And what does Britain think of it all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They weren't just sent there by Britain!!! Present day Israel was the Jewish homeland thousands of years ago, before the diaspora (exile). In the 1800's there was already the Zionist movement (my Mother-in-law, born in the year of Israel's founding was the 4th generation of her family born in Jerusalem), promoting the idea of Jews moving back to their biblical holy land. That's why Britiain established the state of Israel where it is... but because of the recognition that there were Muslim arabs who also inhabited the area by that time, there was the plan for 2 states. But the day Israel was established, it was attacked by all the arab states surrounding it and has basically been on guard ever since. As a protective measure, it has held onto some lands gained during wars that were always initiated by the arab world. Israel has been willing to negotiate and has turned over some land, like the Sinai peninsula. And it has been willing to turn over Gaza and most of the West bank (keeping West Jerusalem) to become a Palestinian state. But every time they get close to an agreement, the Palestinians increase the demands. Which isn't to say that Israel isn't at fault, too. The continued settlements in the West Bank are antagonistic and counter productive, and Jews should leave the West Bank.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alliance wasn't always there, it's a relatively recent thing. Through the 70s, Israel mostly received aid from European countries and had had to smuggle in a lot of stuff. With how things turned out, Israel became a secular, stable, functioning democracy, meanwhile the neighboring Arab countries have been going through massive social upheavals every few decades, with some exceptions. For better or worse, American values line up better with Israel than any of the other countries in the region. That, and there's lots of Jews living in America, which probably helps tie the two nations together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to point out that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Palestine" target="_blank">in 1920, the British Government's Interim Report on the Civil Administration of Palestine stated that there were hardly 700,000 people living in Palestine</a>. There was plenty of room for everyone, especially since the Jewish pioneers were buying swampland from absentee landlords and irrigating desert. There weren't any serious population density issues at the time...and many of the modern Palestinians are descendants of Arabs from other countries that moved to Palestine seeking opportunity that was arising as a result of population growth. As the Wikipedia article goes on to say, &quot;the Arab population of Palestine doubled during the British Mandate era, from 670,000 in 1922 to over 1.2 million in 1948, and there has been considerable debate over the subject on how much of this growth was due to natural increase, as opposed to immigration. Estimates on the scope of Arab immigration to Palestine during this period vary.</p>
<p>It is known that significant Egyptian migration to Palestine happened at the end of the 18th century due to a severe famine in Egypt, and that several waves of Egyptian immigrants came even earlier due to escape natural disasters such as droughts and plagues, government oppression, taxes, and military conscription.&quot;</p>
<p>So in '48, with less than two million inhabitants, we are still talking about a country &quot;the size of New Jersey&quot; as it's often referred to, having a population less than 1/4 the size of New Jersey's.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The conflict was never about there not being enough room for everyone. Consider that in modern Islamic thought (certainly not historic Islamic thought, which generally ignores Jerusalem!), a non-Muslim living in Arab lands has &quot;stolen&quot; that land, by definition.</p>
<p>This conflict is about religion, xenophobia, and hatred at its core--and not just R/X/H in the region, but in the world as a whole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While religion plays a role, I do not believe the conflict is about religion. It is about land. Religion is merely a tool used for political aims to legitimize ownership of that area. For many years, Jews, Christians, and Muslims (plus others) lived there peacefully. It was not until Britain decided to hand the land over to two groups simultaneously, (if people are interested, I can write more on this) and ideas of nationalism such as Zionism and Arab nationalism, that we have this problem. </p>
<p>Originally, the Jews listed a few potential places to live. It is not that Israel is the Jew's &quot;destined land&quot;, but rather it was what was given to them. In order to legitimize their right to the land, they used their religious faith, and using religion in this aspect has terrible consequences. </p>
<p>That is where the religious extremism comes into play. People forget that Jewish extremists are just as crazy as their Islamic counterparts. They exist because of rhetoric that turned a political dispute over land, into a religious one. The government and those in charge proceeding actual state formation created a group of Jewish extremists, and the government there is now stuck with them. It is so out of control, that when formerly tough on Palestine Prime Minister Rabin decided to sign the Oslo Accords, he was murdered by a Jewish extremist. </p>
<p>This is not to say the Islamic extremists don't exist either. Hamas was in fact funded by the Israeli government. They did so because it was believed to be advantageous to have two groups (one Islamic and one nationalist) amongst the Palestinians. Clearly this backfired. And again, once religion on the Palestinian side was used as justification for ownership of the land, things became violent. </p>
<p>You are incorrect about Jews not stealing their land. They did in fact steal their land, and often in a violent manner. Jewish settlers literally forced Palestinians out of their homes. There is much written on this if anyone wants to know more. </p>
<p>One last thing people should remember is that while Israel has done a lot of horrible things, the Israeli's themselves do not condone a lot of the behavior. Obviously some do, but not all. Personally, I blame Israel a lot for what has occurred. This does not mean I condemn the Israelis. Many of them have protested, and started groups looking for peace and to stop insane Jewish extremist settlers. These Israelis deserve recognition for their actions and aid, despite all of the rhetoric surrounding this issue.</p>
<p>I can write much more on this topic if someone wants to have a friendly discussion, or learn more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antisemitism plays a big role in the murder that Palestinians have been perpetrating against Israel from more than a century.</p>
<p>Only the Jews defined Israel as a nation state. Don't believe me? Show me one other country that defined it that way before Arafat came around in 1964. And no one defined Jerusalem as a capital except the Jews. </p>
<p>When Britian got the mandate for Palestine, instead of honoring the mandate and giving it to the Jews, they carved off 80% and gave Arab Palestine to the Hashemites, the Jordanians now. The Jews were left with 20% of Palestine. Keep in mind that Jews have been declaring Israel as a state since King David declared Jerusalem its capital over 3000 years ago.</p>
<p>The other thing no one mentions is that 800,000 Jews were kicked out of Arab states, a little more than the Pal population that decided to leave during the war of independence. They werent stuck in refugee camps. They came, penniless to Israel and were absorbed. The Pals have been kept in refugee camps and not allowed to become citizens of any country because the arabs want the crisis to continue.</p>
<p>Additionally, no other people has been considered refugees for so long becuase UNRWA, the UN service for pales. doesn't want to integrate them back into society, they just keep on adding refugees to their lists so the UN sevice wil stay in service and the Pals will be a crisis for Israel. Few Refugees are repatriated. Mostly they try to fit in to current society. The arabs have made this a sticking point demanding that all pals be returned to Israel which can't happen. So now you have alot of hateful people unhelped by their arab neighbors looking to kill the indigenous people of Israel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the awkward fact that the Palestinian leadership is deeply violent. Hamas, who controls the Gaza strip, has the stated goal of destroying Israel and killing lots of Jews. That's their official policy, they got voted in on that platform. </p>
<p>It <em>might</em> have changed in the last year or two, maybe. So you can see how negotiations might be difficult when your starting position is &quot;this is really uncomfortable, so we'd like it if you just stayed over there&quot; and theirs is &quot;please stand still so we can murder you more easily.&quot;</p>
<p>Isreal has not done a good job of keeping the moral high ground in this conflict. But the fact is, their &quot;negotiating&quot; partner is explicitly more interested in revenge than any sort of reasonable compromise. They set agreements, Hamas (or someone) attacks anyhow, the agreement falls apart, someone tries to create a new agreement years later and Hamas says &quot;sure, we'll totally stick to it this time!&quot; :D</p>
<p>Rinse, repeat, Isrealis have gotten kinda dickish because they're sick of that pattern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this captures it pretty well. It's a constant back and forth over who's being shittier to the other one. A lot of times it works out that Palestinians commit acts of terrorism, which causes Israel to ramp up its security, which is often heavy-handed and results in a lot of dead Palestinians, and that only further incites acts of terrorism. People want Israel to stop illegally settling the West Bank, but Israelis don't want another Gaza Strip type scenario where they pulled out and left behind a hotbed of more terrorism. People see the wall in east Jerusalem as a draconian measure to keep &quot;them&quot; out, but the wall was built during the Second Intifada when suicide bombings were constantly happening all over the city. (The wall drastically reduced suicide bombings, by the way.) This constant exchange has churned on and on for decades, and now it's to the point that normal everyday Palestinians hate normal everyday Israelis, and vice versa. This is a true crisis, because unlike many conflicts that are government vs. government, this is also citizen vs. citizen. Unless a new generation can recognize the humanity on the other side, I see no end in sight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've nailed it.  I just visited Israel and the West Bank on a public policy trip and we met with Israeli community leaders and politicians as well as Palestinian community leaders and politicians. It was my first time in the region, and what blew me away the most was the inherent hatred between the two sides.  It's honestly heartbreaking.  These people live side by side, but so many Jews have never known a Palestinian and so many Palestinians have never known a Jew.  Yet, they are raised to hate one another and believe they are hated in return.  We also met some amazing people who are working to bring an end to this, but there is so much work to be done in that regard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Israeli here.
We are not raised to hate arabs. On the contrary. But this debate is way more complex than being shittier to one another. The first comment captures it very well. Although missing some historical details.
In the past there was active negotiation between Ehud Barak the priminister of israel and Yaser Arafat the head of the palestenian authority (prior to hamas reign). Ehud Barak basically gave him everything he wanted except the &quot;return right&quot; which means every family prior and descendants who lived in israel prior to 1948 and were forced by jewish and arab conflicts and wars to run can return to israel and live here. That would mean millions of arabs that would overwhelm (spelling?) israel. Yaser arafat declined the offer mainly out of greed (support money was delivered to him personally and was not used for supporting the palestenians). This is all from testemonies of clercks and officials in the palestenian authority (also from the book &quot;son of hammas&quot;). There are many problems but i fear the main one is the leadership of both nations, which is driven from greed.
There are many many many opinions in israel to this conflict but you only see the hatred because it broadcasts better and gains viewers.
Im currently on my cell but feel free to pm me to ask any more questions. I will gladly answer them according to my knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I agree with most of what you said, but I would disagree on this. <a href="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lr8oefi1Cs1qjd0x5.jpg" target="_blank">The wall isn't in Jerusalem, but right through the West Bank</a>. The main objection isn't that it 'keeps Palestinians out' of Israel, but that it's built right through the middle of Palestinian land.</p>
<p>It's also pretty debatable to what extent the wall was responsible for the fall in bombings – certainly, Operation Defensive Shield and the severe crackdown on the West Bank and the arrests or killings of a lot of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, etc. members also played a very large role. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this to be true and accurate. I spent a month in Palestine - Beit Jala, Bethlehem to be exact. I stayed with a local family.  From this experience I tend to be Pro Palestine... But I do realize that if I was staying in Jerusalem my feelings would probably be different.</p>
<p>The family was very nice and hospitable - much like the culture itself. They would share of hardships they have due to Israel but also the wall.</p>
<p>At the time (2010) Palestinians were allowed a certain amount of passes through the wall ( I imagine they had to get cleared for that) . But the problem was.. This family had a family farm that they worked and harvested, they would bring in fruits and vegetables and sell them in town. But due to the wall, it stopped them from being able to go there.</p>
<p>It was a weird feeling walking around Bethlehem as an American. At the time the wall had a big graffiti picture saying &quot;this wall is brought to you by USA AID&quot;. I felt like people had the right to hate me just as an American, but they didn't. They treated me as their own. </p>
<p>While I was there I made a really good Palestinian friend. When he introduced himself.. He said his name was Osama Bin Laden, which was both a little scary but Hilarious at the same time. He had a pass and could go into Jerusalem. So he volunteered to take me and show me the sights. Whenever I travel overseas I always carry a mini Gerber pocket knife.  </p>
<p>We were going through security at the wailing wall and I took my knife out - no biggie. So I thought . Apparently having that was illegal and since I was with a Palestinian friend, they pulled me into a separate room and asked me if my Palestinian friend told me to bring the knife in for him.. So he could kill Jews. I was pretty shocked: told them the truth, they kept the knife and we were on our way.</p>
<p>There were a few more instances of that throughout my trip. Sucks that they have been at war like this for so long. It is such a beautiful part of the world with such a rich history. Sad to see it be like this.</p>
<p>No one will probably read this! But there ya go! </p></div>		</li>

The wall has clearly made suicide bombings much harder to execute and there are failed attempts at checkpoints which would result in successful attacks otherwise.</p>
<p>Also, the fence is built AROUND Jerusalem and was built there in one of its first stages in order to prevent attacks in Jerusalem coming from outside of the city, which was easily executed before the fence was built there. </p></div>		</li>
