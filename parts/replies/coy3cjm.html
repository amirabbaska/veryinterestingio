<p>&quot;I can sell crappy pizzas and good pizzas for more money, why should it be illegal to sell good pizzas?&quot;</p>

<p>For this analogy to match, it would be more like:</p>
<p>You sell pizza. Visa contacts you and says it needs to charge you an extra free so your customers who pay with Visa can have a &quot;premium pizza lane&quot;. If you pay, everything goes on as normal. If you don't, you are forced to give customers who pay with Visa pizza that has American Singles instead of Mozzarella.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps a better analogy is...</p>
<p>...You sell pizza, but share the only delivery guy in town with the Chinese takeout down the street. The delivery guy turns around and says that unless you pay an extra $2/pizza he delivers that he's going to make sure your Pizza delivery is slower that the Chinese takeout. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's like a company sells a million pizzas, but thinks the delivery guy should have to deliver it for the same price as if they sold a single pizza. And on top of that, such a large load of pizzas means the delivery guy is going to have to incur extra expenses over what the normal pizza delivery process incurs because it's such a large amount. The delivery guy is going to have to buy extra trucks and hire additional staff to get that many pizzas delivered to all of those customers. And the pizza place that is selling those pizzas doesn't think it should have to pay for the cost of all those extra trucks and staff for the delivery and that the delivery guy should bear all of those costs. Right now the delivery guy lets the pizza place get the pizzas directly to the customers which costs money for the pizza place, but not as much for the delivery guy. Without this method, the delivery guy will have to charge the end customers more in order to cover the cost of delivering that enormous amount of pizzas. Again, we're talking about one delivery guy who is working for many pizza places where all of them maybe sell 100 pizzas a night, but one pizza place is selling a million a night.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically nothing. And that's good.</p>

<p>Actually, over 1/3 of all Internet traffic handled by Comcast sent to customers at peak times was being <a href="http://knowmore.washingtonpost.com/2014/04/25/this-hilarious-graph-of-netflix-speeds-shows-the-importance-of-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">dramatically throttled</a> by Comcast in order to extort the sender of that traffic by threatening their business.</p>
<p>Comcast claimed this was just a result of their network not being able to handle the load ... but as soon as Netflix ponied up, traffic levels were immediately restored to the levels Comcast had no trouble handling before they rolled out their throttling policy. So, not only did it happen, it happened to a huge proportion of Internet traffic for a sustained period of time, and on top of that, if Comcast had been even slightly cunning in their cover up of the facts we may not have known the real reason why.</p>
<p>For those of you that think this might be just one case, keep in mind that <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/technology/article10441850.html" target="_blank">AT&amp;T seems to have very little trouble stepping up their service</a> whenever Google Fiber rolls into town...but, golly, it just can't be done anywhere else.</p>
<p>One of the chief objections to net neutrality is that government should not be involved in &quot;regulating the Internet&quot;. These companies certainly don't seem to mind their government-granted inorganic monopolies, and they don't seem willing to give those back and be forced to compete in a free and open market without benefit of the huge advantage of the infrastructure they now enjoy as a result. The point of the intervention the FCC is making at this point is not to &quot;regulate the Internet,&quot; but rather to prevent the inorganic monopolies the government has already created by its own hand from using that superior market position to abuse its customers.</p>
<p>In a more general sense, I don't like being embarrassed to be from the US. We're squandering our resources here and stupidly limiting the next wave of technological innovation ... and for what? So a few companies can continue to plunder their customers? For that prize, we're willing to watch the next Silicon Valley spring up in some other country instead of building an even stronger tech presence here? Then we'll wonder: Why are all the tech jobs moving overseas, how did this happen?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Okay, I agree in everything except the idea that these monopolies are inorganic. Yes, they're government-facilitated. But they're almost the textbook definition of &quot;natural monopolies&quot;--we will never have a dozen competing broadband networks in a single place (even if government granted licenses to just anyone), and any fewer will tend toward oligopoly and then monopoly.</p>
<p>Unless you're talking about the bans on municipal broadband, which were totally inorganic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am talking about those examples, but not solely. Is there any reason to think that with some basic regulation of infrastructure there couldn't be vibrant natural competition in a market that works on 97% margin on every dollar? Obviously it's worth getting into for Google, at least.</p>
<p>It seems like this could be similar to competitors with US mail. Once the network effect is present and everyone has access to it equally, maybe further govt intervention is unnecessary?</p>
<p>(Asking honestly, I don't claim to know for certain.)</p></div>		</li>
