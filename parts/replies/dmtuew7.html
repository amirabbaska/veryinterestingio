			<div class="markdown"><p>Btu that's just a case of announcing it early, allowing a gradual crossover (states would never accept a big bang, they're all special) and replacing signage over its service life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I had to guess, states would install all new signs, (covered and behind existing signs) then remove the old and uncover the new within a month or two at most. Reduce liability and all that because people are dumb.</p>
<p>And it'd be around $150-200 per new sign/removal of old. Not cheap.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, strictly speaking you don't need new signs. You need new faces for the signs. There are very strong films that can be used as a reasonably long-term cover for the old sign (with all the required reflective features) which would cost a few bucks per sign. And when the time comes to replace it with something permanent, you still don't need to replace the whole sign, only the sign's plate, which costs perhaps $20-40 (most of the cost of a sign is the post and its installation). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not? That's what we did in the UK.</p>
<p>Speed is still in MPH and large distances in miles but heights, distance to junctions etc are different.
The old signs were left in yds and when they were replaced they had both on (yds/M) over time when they were replaced again they just went with Metres. This took quite a few years and so you didn't really notice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm pretty sure all cars in the US show the speed in both mph and km/h. All you need to do is put up the new signs with km/h, you don't even need to have both because the cars already show both. </p></div>		</li>

Even this was a major issue that caused heaps of problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's something to that. Britain switched to metric except for road signs. There's also a safety issue. Signs posting 70mph would be changed to 110km/h and you can be sure somebody won't get the memo, or pretend they didn't.</p></div>		</li>
