<p>White Phosphorus is a specific allotrope of the element Phosphorus. It's a nasty little thing that is highly toxic to humans and really loves fire.  Like really, really loves fire.  It actually self ignites in the presence of oxygen with no extra help, and it burns at 5000 degrees.  Water does nothing to put it out, and even worse it is incredibly sticky stuff, whatever it lands on it tends to stay on until it burns itself out or is deprived of oxygen.</p>
<p>It has a long use in warfare, dating back to at least World War 1, and it is more than a bit controversial in use.  It's great at killing people, but often in very slow, horrifically painful ways, though if you are lucky then the raging inferno will kill you quickly.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it's also perfect for smoke bombs because it generates COPIOUS amounts of smoke and there isn't much you can do to stop it beyond heavy ventilation.  This use in combat isn't controversial at all, it's perfectly legitimate.  You definitely don't want to be exposed to too much of it or for too long though since, as mentioned earlier, it's very toxic.  It's only when it's use as an incendiary weapon or chemical weapon that it becomes a problem.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, using it to destroy chemical weapons is a legitimate purpose of it, it just isn't ideal.  It's hard to control and can be indiscriminate in what it destroys.  Not many people are gonna weep for those involved in the production of chemical weapons, but it's incredibly easy for innocents to suffer or die from, say, a fire spreading or a toxic cloud of smoke rolling through.  Basically if there is any alternative to white phosphorus, you want to use it. </p></div>		</li>

Dont really know of any stockpiles themselves</p></div>		</li>
