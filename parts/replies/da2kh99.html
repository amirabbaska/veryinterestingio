<p>I mean, if we were talking classical physics and throwing a stone at the sun, it's impossible to have it go around and hit you in the face, the parabolic/hyperbolic orbits don't hit you at all, and an elliptic orbit would result in the stone falling on you from behind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're referring to light, the only possible &quot;orbit&quot; is the one circular one around a black hole.  Elliptical orbits are not possible for light.  Kepler's second law says that, for an elliptical orbit, an object will move faster when it's closer to the object it's orbiting.  Well, light won't slow down, so it can't form an elliptical orbit.</p>
<p>I'm getting a lotta questions, so here is an edit to clarify and specify a few things.</p>
<p>For some imaginary ideal black hole with no angular momentum or charge, a photon could orbit around it in any direction.  They will all be circular orbits at the same distance; if you ignore symmetry, they're the same orbit).  If the black hole is rotating, then only two orbits exist: they are circular orbits around the equator, in opposite directions.  If you have a configuration involving more than one black hole, one with electric charge, or something weird, I have no idea what would happen.</p>
<p>Kepler's laws do not really work in this case, but the requirements for a non-circular orbit do.  One of them is that the particle can change speed, which photons can not.  This is just a simplification to help understand why they can't create elliptical orbits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do Kepler's laws still work when we're talking about near black hole levels of warping of space time? I feel like there's some synthetic arrangement of super-massive black holes that could result in a semi elliptical geodesic path for the photon when embedded in R^3. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An important distinction is that light and matter follow different paths. We call them timelike and lightlike (or null) paths.  A black hole can redirect light back to you from any distance from the black hole, but the light will come very close to the photon sphere and so it will just look like a ring near the black hole and you can't see much. In fact as you approach the black hole shining light at it you will see&quot;rings&quot; of yourself spreading out. The brightest and largest will be the light that rotated the black hole once, but the light that rotated an arbitrary number of times will comprise the remainder of the rings, each closer to the photon sphere.  As you approach the photon sphere you find yourself at the centre of all the rings that is because light takes a circular orbit here. As you descend further the rings start to move away from the black hole, finally as you are near the horizon the rings are converging to a point that is opposite to the black hole. </p>
<p>I don't have any visual aids for you but light travels like this.  And it has no stable orbits, light either goes into or deflects away from the black hole. Matter will have stable orbits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a matter of &quot;heavy enough,&quot; so much as <em>compact enough.</em>  For any quantity of mass, you can plot escape velocity as a function of distance, and the distance at which escape velocity becomes luminal is called that mass' Schwarzchild Radius.  A black hole is a body which is compact enough to fit inside its own Schwarzschild Radius, and we guess in theory it might be any mass.</p>
<p>Our star has plenty enough mass to turn a laser beam around, but not enough compactness to do it.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok that's what I was thinking. Since gravity decreases with distance from the center of mass, its just a matter of having the mass in a small enough size.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can however do this with something heavier, a black hole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just a bit of pedantry, but you mean denser, rather than heavier. If the sun was compressed into a black hole, it too would certainly be able to deflect light 180ยบ.</p></div>		</li>
