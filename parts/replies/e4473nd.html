			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the larger mass of a nuclear pile when compared to the mass of a bomb, there's also a significant difference between an airburst like Hiroshima and Nagasaki were, and a ground detonation.  There's a <em>vast</em> difference in the level of contamination between them.  Ground detonations are much more messy in terms of fallout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know much about nuclear weapons, so I have a question about that difference. From my understanding, a nuclear weapon's blast ideally consumes as much of the nuclear material as possible to increase the force of the blast. Would an ideal nuclear weapon have no radioactive fallout (or close to zero, as &quot;ideal&quot; would be impossible)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Big emphasis on the slower release. A bomb is designed to consume most of its radioactive material all at once, leading to a huge release of energy, but once it's gone all that's left is &quot;daughter products&quot; which decay relatively quickly or are less dangerous. The Chernobyl pile still has MOST of its radioactive material hanging around and releases a slow, steady stream of radiation (still more than enough to kill you), which is why it's still dangerous and will be for something like a thousand years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hiroshima and Nagasaki were airburst weapons. This means the bombs were detonated well above the ground level. The primary goal is to increase the over pressure damage and maximize the blast radius by doing so. A side effect is <em>very</em> little material becomes irradiated in the process, because of the distance from the ground. What is there is dispersed by the atmospheric winds rather quickly. </p>
<p>Chernobyl was a reactor meltdown that resulted in a steam explosion. Reactors contain far more nuclear fuel than a nuclear weapon, they're surrounded by a lot more material, and they're at ground level. In the meltdown and following explosion, a lot of material was irradiated and kicked up into the atmosphere and surrounding area, filling it with dangerously radioactive dirt/dust/metal/you name it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>So what you're saying is that we need to invest in building airborne/floating nuclear reactors.  For safety!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chernobyl is not uninhabited.  There are some people living there.   I visited the region near Pripyat and was a bit surprised by how many people live nearby.   The photos make it look like the whole area is a gigantic wasteland but the reality is that there are just a lot fewer people than previously but there are still people living and working nearby.   </p>

<p>Today Chernobyl is mostly a ghost town, but a small number of people still reside in houses marked with signs stating: &quot;Owner of this house lives here&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, a portion of reactor remained in use for four years after the accident continuing to produce power with workers going to work there every day.  They finally turned it off in 2000.</p>

<p>Beyond the few people living there, and the few people working there, there's also a bit of a tourist trade of people wanting to visit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pripyat and Chernobyl are also two different places which a lot of people dont realize.  Confusingly, Pripyat is the town where the reactor is, and Chernobyl is a different town like 10 miles south of it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a portion of the reactor. The reactor was completely destroyed that night. But it was only one of 4 operational reactors at the power plant, with 2 more in construction.
The remaining reactors continued for many years after. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also just want to latch onto this and say that the way radiation works in the Fallout universe is sort of a caricature of how radiation was viewed in 50s America, like the rest of the game's mythology.

<p>To add on to this in the Fallout universe radiation lasts for ever and it causes bugs to get massive and mutate, like it was portrayed in the 1950s media: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Them!_(1954_film" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Them!_(1954_film</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked for a health care company that treated these type of individuals specifically. A large number are Native Americans from the New Mexico region. Along with this program the US government also provides compensation and healthcare for the former workers across the country that handled these weapons. That total is around $15 billion. These are issues that are not going to go away a time soon either. Residual contamination and birth defects are astonishing and an issue that is largely unnoticed. Check out The Atomic Homefront on HBO. Wonderful documentary that follows residential contamination in St.Louis. MO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The original post, those exposed are referred to as down winders. Where aerial contamination was the main source of exposure. Of the workers there is a percenatage that did the mining of uranium, but also milling and processing. And not just uranium, but also metals like beryllium.</p>
<p>Once the programs were established the issue of clean up was apparent, so the EPA designates Super Fund sites. These were deemed to be the areas of highest concentration of radiation in the country. This started several decades ago, I forget the date. But there are a lot of areas that have not been cleaned yet. Mainly due to the high cost. They have to remove soil and debris to a point where the next 12 inches of material contain safe levels of background radiation. Which in most cases is millions of pounds of soil and building material.</p></div>		</li>
