			<div class="markdown"><p>If I close one eye, I'm able to see the banding even with my fingers &gt;30cm away from my eye (with separation &lt;1mm). I was also able to see them even when focused on my fingers, but when I tried with two cards, focusing at the same plane as the card would eliminate the banding. My guess is that the difference in the focal plane of the front of my fingers to the point where they were meeting was still enough to cause the banding.</p>
<p>I'm pretty convinced that it's some sort of artifact of our vision related to focus. The high contrast probably contributes to it as well. Perhaps it's some sort of bokeh effect?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Point number one is very salient here I think, in pointing towards being vision artifact and not a physical phenomenon. A physical phenomenon should persist as I move my fingers away from my face. However, it seems that the lines are only visible if my fingers are close enough that I cannot focus on them clearly. The moment I can clearly see my fingers, the lines disappear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what you think the line between a &quot;vision artifact&quot; and &quot;physical phenomenon&quot; is for optical effects. Clearly there are not actual solid objects being created between your fingers.</p>
<p>Changing your eye's focus changes the physical shape of the lens and the path light takes through it, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vision is a <em>lot</em> more than just the optics of the eye. It encompasses the entirety of the eye, retina, and optical processing of the brain. Visual artifacts that do not physically exist can be introduced in any of these areas.</p>
<p>Physical: &quot;This object has fuzzy edges.&quot;</p>
<p>Visual: &quot;This object has solid edges, but some part of my visual system, including the physical optics and neurological processing, is causing me to see fuzzy edges.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it even matter whether the detection area if curved as you say? To me, the main cause is that the iris has width and a shape (circular). As a result, when objects are close, distortions appear that are specifically due to the presence of a focal plane (or circle, really) instead of a focal point. In addition to the things you mention, it would imply that looking at a small circle or circular hole should produce symmetric patterns in all directions, while shapes that aren't radially symmetric would produce different distortions. Also, there may be a noticeable impact on the distortions due to the current dilation of the iris.</p></div>		</li>
