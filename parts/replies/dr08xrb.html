<p>Can you provide any anthropological evidence that modern humans and early humans had any difference in average intelligence? I'm not aware of any studies that support that conclusion.</p>
<p>Also bear in mind that evolution does not imply a single direction of movement. In theory it's perfectly possible for us to have evolved from hominids that were <strong>more</strong> intelligent than us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>H. sapiens definitely weren't around 500,000 years ago. The oldest evidence we have is from Jebel Irhoud, Morocco dating to about 300,000 years ago. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>By definition all members of homo sapiens in the last half a million years have had the same capacity for intelligent thought and reasoning that we do</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By whose definition? Not only is the first part of that statement factually untrue, but there's no way to quantify capacity for intelligent thought and reasoning for sure. Half a million years ago we had H. erectus and H. heidelbergensis, who certainly had larger brain sizes than early Homo and had to some degree gained control over their environment through fire. But this doesn't mean that they had the same capacity for intelligent thought and reasoning that we do at all.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the degree of evidence you want, do I have a set of skulls with preserved brain imprints, no,  just behavioral changes and differences in ability. E.g. Michael Arbib' s theory on human language development with a key period around 80kya. This coincides with Ramachandran's work on the same topic</p>
<p>Completely agreed on evolution not being progressive and linear, it just goes with what works</p>
<p>Also it's unreasonable to talk about intelligence that way. I would say I have evidence that the capabilities of an anatomically modern human circa 150kya were probably quite different than 50kya, 8kya, 1600ce etc. Feedback loops of tool use, language, writing etc  have changed how our brains develop as we grow and age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's unlikely knowing that intelligence definitely develops and doesn't just happen to he there when a child is born. It develops through play and observation is later enhanced by the vast knowledge humans have collected by now through teaching.</p>
<p>There are definitely studies that show kids can under develop if they aren't growing up in good conditions. You can imagine ancient humans didn't have the best conditions. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely correct.</p>
<p>However we have no direct evidence about the levels of intelligence of early homo sapiens (as opposed to that of other hominids, who do appear to have all been less intelligent than us with the possible exception of h. neanderthalenis).</p>
<p>Therefore all three of the following possibilities are equally likely:</p>
<ul>
<li>early humans had the same level of intelligence as modern humans</li>
<li>early humans had a higher level of intelligence than modern humans</li>
<li>early humans had a lower level of intelligence than modern humans</li>
</ul>
<p>However given that any radical departure from the norm in intelligence would likely have resulted in some kind of cultural record in found artifacts, the most likely conclusion is that average human intelligence has not significantly altered in the evolutionary lifetime of our species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean i go ask though. How much of a problem was not having a consistent written way of communicating/record keeping. I mean even if you developed the best spear ever in 50,000 BC how long would it survive in a small tribe. One bad winter or even a natural disaster and your tribe and all its advancements are gone.  </p>
<p>People seem to ignore this when they decide that our ancestors where dumb. Say my father can strip a car in about 2 hours but i haven't bothered to learn, when he passes unless i read up on it i will not know how.</p></div>		</li>
