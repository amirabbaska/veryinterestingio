			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear the Type O thing a lot (in South America they called it &quot;sweet blood&quot;), but, while I've read a lot of articles talking about I've never come across any <em>peer reviewed</em> articles confirming it.</p>
<p>Mind you, I haven't looked very hard for those either.</p>
<p>The CO2, temperature, pheromones, etc is all pretty well and reliably documented though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has to do with one type of mosquito from Southwest Asia and I didn't look further, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15311477/" target="_blank">a 2004 study</a> found a significant difference in mosquito preference between blood types A and O, but not so much for type B (it looks like a small sample size of a few hundred at  most). Please also correct my misinterpretations. From the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mean relative percent landing on blood group O secretors (83.3%) was significantly higher than on group A secretors (46.5%). We also compared the attraction to subjects according to blood groups using forearm skin treated with ABH antigens. Blood group O disaccharide (H antigen) attracted significantly more Ae. albopictus than did blood group A trisaccharide (A antigen), and subjects treated with blood group A disaccharide attracted significantly more Ae. albopictus than did subjects treated with blood group B trisaccharide (B antigen), but ABH antigens did not, in general, influence the landing preference of mosquitoes among ABO blood groups.</p>
