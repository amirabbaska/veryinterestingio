			<div class="markdown"><p>In certain cases like extreme epilepsy or seizures it's preferable that the brain isn't too active or else it will cause damage.  It's also used during severe head trauma (barbiturates reduce blood flow to the brain which reduces intracranial pressure), certain types of stroke, and various other conditions.  Basically with these conditions the person being awake causes even more damage to the brain, so it's best to keep them from waking up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't heal faster necessarily. In the case of burn victims, it just keeps them from writhing in pain while they start healing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume it allows your body to put all energy that's not directly requnited to keep you alove, into healing. Also, in the case of a serious, large area burn, it would keep you from moving (a difficult thing when you're constantly in horrible, agonizing pain), which almost certainly hinders the healing process</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my friends was in a medically induced coma after brain surgery because he had a very severe skull fracture and brain damage from an accident. After the docs took him off the coma drugs, he was in a coma for about a month afterwards, although he should have been awake within a few days. So, sometimes they don't always just &quot;wake up&quot; when the medical staff want them to, even if the coma is medically induced. I'm assuming that his life-threatening injury had something to do with that, though, so I'm not sure how often this type of thing happens. For a while, I thought he was never going to wake up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, sounds like the reason he stayed under for so long was because of brain damage and not from the drugs they used; it always depends on the situation, and some people never fully recover.</p></div>		</li>
