<p>&quot;For a knuckleball, the ball moves around as it approaches the <strong>catcher</strong> because it isn't spinning.&quot; Yea? Just want to make sure Jack and I have it clear in our heads.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fair, also a note to jack...the more wind, the more the knuckleball moves when in flight, towards the catcher. The more turbulence, the better for the pitcher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth considering the humidity and air temperature, which have a pretty serious effect on air density.</p>
<p>the higher either of those are, the higher the air density will be, and the larger the effect will be on the ball in flight.</p>
<p>So there will be a big difference in ball movement between someone pitching in cold, dry weather than that same person pitching in hot, humid weather.</p>
<p>I'm not from the US, but at a guess I'd say you'd see a lot more ball movement in Florida than you would in Colorado.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As air accelerates, the pressure drops, and as it slows, the pressure rises (this is how planes fly)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a widely held misconception of how planes &quot;fly.&quot; The majority of lift generated by an airfoil occurs due to deflection of the air as the airfoil passes through it. The air is deflected at an angle relative to the angle of attack (and shape) of the airfoil, resulting in an opposite force being exerted on the airfoil.</p>
<p>While it is true that pressure differences are required for this to happen, and that the pressure differences lead to vortices which also contribute to lift, these are minor points and don't elucidate the true mechanism that generates lift. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only forces a gas can transmit to a solid are pressure forces and viscous forces. Lift comes almost entirely from pressure. It's simpler than pressure differences lead to vortices which also contribute to lift. Pressure differences are lift. This also leads to a momentum change / deflection of the air. You can't have one without the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The only forces a gas can transmit to a solid are pressure forces and viscous forces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's quite simply not true. I can think of all sorts of other forces a gas can exert on a solid, starting with gravity. If we're being technical, there's not even such a thing as &quot;pressure forces&quot; and &quot;viscous forces.&quot; Those are convenient simplifications to describe the behavior of gasses and fluids.</p>
<p>As I indicated in my first post, it's not technically wrong that pressure differences are a major aspect of the system and can be used to calculate the lift force, however that explanation has a serious cause and effect problem. Pressure differences are primarily due to deflection of the air, and to a lesser extent the airfoil shape. </p>
<p>Consider a submarine, whose rudder is used to steer the ship. I think everyone agrees that this is primarily a deflection based process, yet those exact same pressure differences are present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently studying aerospace engineering at a university and I've actually barely gone over the whole deflection theory. Most of what I've been taught is what is right under the flow deflection part in your wikipedia link (bernoulli's equation) and that is the same as the pressure differences caused by differing velocities, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not formatted very well in the article but that's a separate sub heading. There's a reason those are presented as basic explanations. Deflection as presented sounds nice but doesn't produce enough lift and the same goes for a basic Bernoulli application. There's really nothing like looking at some well done CFD around a wing. You'll see that air is deflected for a huuuuge distance above the foil and the flow is super weird underneath. Neither of the simple explanations work because neither of them account for fluid flow properly.</p></div>		</li>
