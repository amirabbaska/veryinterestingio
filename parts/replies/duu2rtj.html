<p>I may have possibly misunderstood what you meant by &quot;altering these chemicals&quot;. It looks like you didn't mean altering the hormones chemically. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are certainly correct. The reabsorption blocking I thought was the component that most literature is more confident about. How increasing serotonin availability in the synapse directly leads to mood altering effects over weeks was the more debated part. The seratonin reuptake inhibition by binding of relevant proteins could be considered a chemical alteration I suppose. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Many people suffer from this condition to some degree but it can be minimized by â€¦ adopting a diet that provides more of the amino acid precursors that allow your brain to produce these neurotransmitters. Tyrosine is the amino acid precursor to dopamine and is found in foods like bananas and walnuts. Tryptophan is the precursor to serotonin and can be found in foods like eggs and fish. </p>
