			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to not readily remembering smells, they are also not something i can ever recall dreaming about, and i feel that many people have a similar experience to this. They are difficult to imagine and they don't really show up in dreams (or at least not frequently), when imagination is on overdrive... it seems that projecting smell is more difficult than projecting visual stuff.</p></div>		</li>
