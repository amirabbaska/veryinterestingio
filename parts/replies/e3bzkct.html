			<div class="markdown"><p>you mean to tell me that theoretically the big bang could have just been a state of the universe where time and space were essentially just the same thing and then split apart into the universe we know now? that's mind blowing, perhaps even more so than the &quot;everything just suddenly originated from nothing for some reason&quot; explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because otherwise, there's no real reason that time has to have a beginning. Even in spacetimes which originate from a point, you can usually extrapolate backwards and show that it could easily have come from a universe collapsing to a point (big crunch/big bang universes). But with the Hartle-Hawking state, it forces a beginning of time, because you can't extrapolate past a certain time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, you still get a big bang. Here's a good picture of what it actually is:</p>

<p>The part labeled &quot;Lorentzian dS&quot; is where the universe would be like we know it and the part labeled &quot;Euclidean dS&quot; is the part with imaginary time. It still all collapses to a point in the Euclidean region, but it just kind of gives a mathematical way of representing a beginning of time.</p></div>		</li>
