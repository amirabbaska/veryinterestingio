			<div class="markdown"><p>That was a great response, but there's one more often neglected fact to mention. Soluble fiber is also usually fermentable fiber, which means that the organisms in your large intestine (bacteria, fungi/yeast) can digest it, even though you can't. This is generally considered healthy, as it can cause good bacteria to proliferate. Some soluble fibers like inulin (found in yucca, onions, garlic, asparagus, etc), will encourage the growth of specific bacteria that we want, while not encouraging the growth of pathogenic (bad) bacteria.</p>
<p>Insoluble fiber isn't generally digestible by the bacteria in your GI system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And they give off lots of gasses as they do.  Causing the human to also give off lots of gas.</p>
<p>Many people become gassy or feel bloated after eating foods with lots of soluble fiber. Beans, onions, whole grains. Good for nutrition and probiotics, not good for social situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fiber is considered a prebiotic whereas yogurt is considered probiotic.<br />
Part of having healthy intestinal gut flora is that the fiber will also be converted into short chain fatty acids which your body really needs.  So while you don't directly digest fiber, you need the byproduct created by healthy gut flora desperately.<br />
Interestingly there are more bacteria in your gut than cells in your body.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, soluble fibre <a href="https://health.howstuffworks.com/diseases-conditions/cardiovascular/cholesterol/foods-that-lower-cholesterol2.htm" target="_blank">reduces the amount of bile</a> (digestive fluid) reabsorbed in the intestines. Your body then has to make more bile, and since it uses cholesterol to make bile, this decreases your cholesterol levels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how your body has been dealing with the rest of your diet. I need soluble fiber due to a malabsorption issue. Other people need insoluble fiber due to less GI activity. There's no single right answer for everyone.</p></div>		</li>
