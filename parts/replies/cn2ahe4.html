			<div class="markdown"><p>Referring to Warren Buffett as a market manipulator is intellectually dishonest. From the SEC website: &quot;Manipulation is intentional conduct designed to deceive investors by controlling or artificially affecting the market for a security.&quot; As you pointed out, he doesn't trade in and out of positions and is in fact known for investing behind the maxim, &quot;my favorite holding period is forever,&quot; so he certainly isn't intentionally manipulating prices in the near term. </p>
<p>While he does have a great deal of influence in the financial world, suggesting that he can affect the market for extremely liquid, global assets and commodities like &quot;oil&quot; and &quot;food&quot; over 10+ year time horizons is ignorant and implausible. For instance, the value of Exxon Mobil, a ~$400B market cap company (and a top Buffett holding) is unlikely to be materially affected by Buffett's ~1% stake in the company over the course of his long-term holding period, regardless of how much his &quot;minions&quot; revere him and his opinions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's intellectually dishonest to claim I said he looks for direct returns on broad global markets over the long term.  I clearly said big investors look for the side-effects of their trades.</p>
<p>It is ignorant and implausible to think that big investors do not use their market power to influence ancillary trades on highly profitable stocks.</p>
<p>He may like to buy and hold, because he can.  He can also use that as a stake, with surplus funds, to buy into long term stocks he knows he can influence with directed, seemingly non-connected trades over the course of years.  I know this because that's precisely what he claims to do.  That's why people buy BH, and that's why it performs.</p>
<p>When Buffet claims in an interview to buy and hold railroads, a good portion of investors look to buy railroads.  Another good portion of wiser investors look at what Buffet invests in alongside railroads, and look for changes there.</p>
<p>If Warren Buffet buys into cheesecake, at least 1000 people buy stock in fork companies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read his full biography and learn about the history of value investing philosophy in the style of Benjamin Graham. I recommend The Snowball by Alice Schroeder or The Making of an American Capitalist by Roger Lowenstein. Also look at the investment letters of the early Buffett Partnerships and the letters of Berkshire Hathaway, posted on the company's website. </p>
<p>If you don't think Warren Buffett's returns are extraordinary outside the context of his upbringing, you don't know anything about finance. </p></div>		</li>

<p>No, it doesn't. To be insanely profitable, sure. But as long as productivity rises in some sense, the stock market will always outperform inflation over the long-term. And market makers take the spread for themselves, that is profit as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I'll agree that productive firms will outperform inflation if everything was equal due to perfect information entropy.</p>
<p>That margin would be much lower than index gains and it would still be known to all, immediately.  There would be nothing to trade.</p>
<p>If inflation is 4 and S&amp;P is 9, if you take out information holding and timing, S&amp;P would drop to 5 or 6, or inflation would fall.  Likely both, but in effect indexes would be much closer to inflation in a mature economy.</p>
<p>Because the economy grows on wealth creation, without timing, privilege (buying 'seats' or placeholders to program trade), and information just shy of insider information, everyone would be gaining on actual productivity gains.</p>
<p>This would go so far as to eliminate the cachet of premium items and make them compete against other like items of identical function and form.  So that perfect iPhone knockoff is no longer worth 1/5th an actual iPhone with the same capabilities.  Now they're worht the same and Apple is worth as much as somewhere between Nokia and Samsung at it's height.</p>
<p>So even if there is wealth-creation, without the factors I named, every trader would just be a retail salesman, and every quant would be a warehouse worker.</p>
<p>Exactly what I said in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This probably needs an ELI5 in itself, but where does the following situation go wrong?</p>
<p>I read the financial papers, watch the news, keep up with technology. Based on that information, I expect that a company or an industry sector will soon do very well and be in high demand, so I buy shares in that. When price rises, I sell my stock for profit.</p>
<p>I do that several times and, because I am meticulous and stay informed, I am successful more often than not. Other people take notice and soon the fact that I am buying shares becomes a signal for others to buy the same shares. When price rises, I sell my stock for profit.</p>
<p>Am I doing anything wrong in this scenario?</p>
<p>So far, what I am buying is based on my estimates for the near future. I will buy into a company that I reasonably expect to be successful. </p>
<p>If other people have started following my moves, is it illegal to buy into a company that I don't expect to do well, solely expecting to profit by seling my shares to those who buy after me?</p>
<p>At what point does &quot;buy low - sell high&quot; become market manipulation and at what point does market manipulation become illegal?</p>
<p>What is outside the scope of my post: When you are powerful enough to actually (and deliberately) influence how a company or an entire industy perform irrespectively of your presence in the stock market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not illegal.  Nor is it really wrong.  I do not pay attention closely anymore.</p>
<p>There is the surface charm of Warren Buffet.  He's savvy, quiet, humble.  His friends choose his wife, and he's been married for a long time.  He buys and holds.  He doesn't rape companies for profits.  He's made good friends and he's given a vast fortune to the idea that human beings deserve a productive, healthy life.</p>
<p>On another level, of course Warren does this.  What he doesn't do is conduct himself with rapine avarice.  He's deliberate, considered, ethical (perhaps not according to perfect rules written somewhere.)  He's not buying Congress to make it profitable in a tax situation to sell American jobs overseas.</p>
<p>I personally like the guy.  People know he's got power and that he uses the influence he has gained <em>with them</em>, for profitable and ethical purposes.</p>
<p>So is it a negative criticism to write what I did about Warren?  I don't think so.</p>
<p>I'm merely stating that what every single starup company tries to do, what every VC rep tries to do, wishes they could do on that scale, Warren does.</p>
<p>It's not the MM that I stated about Soros, who is pretty flat out about his methods.  Soros also has 'I'll say what I want money', and that's a lot of damned money in his business.  So he says &quot;Yeah, they came to me with a prediction about CDO's and I backed off because it didn't feel right.  Now those guys are poor and I made out like a bandit.  Probably shouldn't have been able to short all that, but I did and it was legal, and ethical for myself and my investors.&quot;</p>
<p>Warren doesn't do that so people say it for him, and should.  Adds to the savvy aroma.</p></div>		</li>
