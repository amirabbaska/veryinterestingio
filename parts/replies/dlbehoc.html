			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in a thermal power plant and the fact that your condensate is not returned is blowing my mind on costs.  Chemistry and well just the charge of supplying fresh water to the boiler must have cost a fortune, or you had a sweet sweet deal with the water department of.... Manhattan i can only imagine was the location.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was actually in Baltimore.  The reason it was not sent back was because that would double our pipes that would need to be care for routinely.  Yes, water treatment and also heating up the water from supply versus condensate does cost more money.  However, piping costs are tremendous and I guess they made this decision way back when upon installation.  At this point, it would cost a small fortune to add the condensate return piping.</p>
<p>Manhattan does have  steam system as well (ConEd) and I have worked on many energy engineering projects over the years and have been in buildings that use the district steam.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We design and commission NYC buildings using ConEd steam and they don't return the condensate either.  </p>
<p>Steam condensate is a good source to pre-heat domestic hot water - we have done some designs to install heat exchangers for this!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So as someone who is in the process of buying a large boiler for a relief valve test facility, its due to the chemicals required to make the water safe for boilers. Water used in boiler tubes has to have a very specific injection of chemicals and water softeners to make it so it doesn't clog the boiler tubes. This stuff is in the steam you make unless you use a very expensive reverse osmosis system which the return on investment isn't really worth doing. When doing a blow down, which is essentially blowing &quot;low quality&quot; steam and condensate into a big tank and mixing cold water to bring its temp making it safe as gray water.</p>
<p>I am not an expert by any means but this is from what I understand why you can't just drink steam off of the condensate lines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine the hardier ones that survive would potentially be more dangerous because of their resilience, just as food for thought. But lots and lots of bacteria you don't want that is in grey water. Every agricultural course I've ever taken has taken a huge no-no stance on utilizing for agricultural. It's just far, far too dangerous. </p>
<p>Edit: Huh, TIL some people on reddit prefer tapeworms. Look, grey water is better than no water if you're going to starve if you have no other recourse than to use it for crops- feel free. Personally, I use mainly water that I harvest from the air... so... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the steam.  It's what might be alive in the system pipes that could be a concern. Also, by the time it becomes condensate, you are only talking 140-160 degF.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still quite common in older buildings. The replacement business has remained steady for the past 20 years so whoever has steam in the building is pretty happy with it.</p>
<p>Nowadays the only time you really see new building steam systems installed down here in the South are either in college campus buildings, to tap into an existing central steam system, or in hospitals for humidification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.   We had multiple plants and 13 miles of steam pipelines running through the downtown streets.  </p>
<p>Some buildings used the steam directly in their HVAC systems, but others converted it to heating hot water with a heat exchanger.  It was also used via a heat exchanger for domestic hot water.</p></div>		</li>
