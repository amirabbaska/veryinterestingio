			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry guys but this isn't exactly true. For instance when you have a subcutaneous TB (tuberculosis) test done this isn't exactly &quot;in&quot; your blood stream. Yet the whole reason someone can say you have TB is because there was some antigenic reaction that gives you a wheal and flare reaction. Your body absolutely tries to attack and break down these parasites (not a doubt). The problem is that parasites have developed mechanisms for evading our body's defenses; this is called natural selection. Those parasites that have survived the test of time are around because they are simply better at evading host mechanisms of destruction. Organs however come from our bodies, and while they can attack the host in which they are put in are typically not doing that but instead are being attacked. This is why organs are affected so greatly by being put in foreign bodies without having been previously typed for antigens. If the antigens aren't what the body recognizes as normal it will be destroyed and because it is an organ it CAN NOT evade these host mechanisms. </p>
<p>Just because something isn't &quot;in&quot; your bloodstream does not mean it goes unnoticed by your immune system. The body has many immune mediators that are designed to be able to diffuse into tissue and get rid of foreign bodies present there and maybe not in circulation. </p>
<p>Hope I could help! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>which leads me to the question that an adapter,like you have with electronics of all kind could be a solution.</p>
<p>but this would be hard to do. either you make 2 separate bloodstreams,one for the organ and one for the organism separted by a membrane that lets only proteins etc you need through,like the way babies are connected to their mothers.</p>
<p>Or you can keep the white bloodcells and NK cells etc away from the tissue  and filter bacteria out which could harm the organ,but that would lead to massive problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is more of the correct answer. Technically, your GI system is considered the outside of your body. Think of your body like a big tube. Your I immune system doesn't act the same way with things directly inside your body compared to things outside your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im gonna chime in since nobody has mentioned the Major Histocompatibility Complex or MHC. The MHC-I &amp; MHC-II are surface protein complexes present on the surface of certain immune cells. There are also Antigen Presenting Cells or APCs of the immune system, they recognize antigens as self and non self and then present them to the other cells in the immune system which either attack them or nor (if they are recognized as self). If an organ is transplanted from a person with different antigens as the receiving patient then the MHC will bind the antigens of the receiving patient and then the APC comes in contact with the antigen-MHC complex and recognizes it as non self indicating the tissue is foreign and recruits macrofages to digest them and starts the inflammation cascade. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Wish me luck on my immunology test Thursday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you're pretty much on point (guess that immunology test is going to be ok!). Thing is, as refered on the top comment, parasites have developed ways to avoid our immune system. For example, some parasites have a capsule that covers their bodies and that way our immune system can't recognize the Antigens, since they're hidden underneath that capsule.</p>
<p>I can't remember the specifics, since it's been a while since I last studied this, but I hope that you can get the general idea.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1513/85" target="_blank">http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1513/85</a> this arcticle is pretty good in case you want a review about parasite evasion of the immune system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of corrections, hopefully it's helpful on your test:</p>
<p>APC's such as dendritic cells or macrophages, will recognize pathogens generally with pattern-recognition receptors (PRR's) that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP's). This is still an innate immune response because receptors for PAMP's are just generally recognizing common themes in microbial structural components. Once an APC has recognized a PAMP, it will phagocytize (eat) the offending pathogen. Inside the phagocyte, the pathogen will be broken apart and some protein segments of it will be processed and be loaded onto MHC-II protein complexes. Then that loaded MHC-II will be presented on the surface for a T cell to connect to with its CD4 receptor complex. That connection will lead to T cell activation and bring in the adaptive immune system through various other processes (B cells have to be activated too).</p>
<p>Also, the inflammatory cascade is often (though not always) started by mast cells in tissues. These will recognize a PAMP, be activated by crosslinking of membrane-bound IgE, or will be physically damaged (such as if you cut yourself) and that will prompt them to &quot;degranulate.&quot; They'll release granules containing quite a few different chemicals including histamine and chemotactic cytokines, which will make it easier for white blood cells to cross into the tissue from the bloodstream and recruit WBC's to the site of inflammation, respectively.</p>
<p>Macrophages can also promote inflammatory response simply by phagocytizing a pathogen they've recognized via a pattern-recognition receptor like a TLR (Toll-like receptor). They'll then release proinflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>In tissue rejection, the MHC on the transplanted tissue itself acts as an antigen (rather than just holding the antigenic substance). Mostly this is going to be MHC-I, since MHC-II is usually only present on professional APC's. MHC-I is on all nucleated cells. Often it is antibodies that are directed against the MHC which will be involved in the anti-transplant immune response.</p>
<p>Let me know if anything's unclear. Good luck on the test!</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think you've got that quite right. It's been a couple years since I took immunology, but aside from Toll-like-receptors, antigen presenting cells don't really have the capacity to recognize antigens as self vs not self. APCs pick up antigen from various sources and present them on MHC-II to helper T cells which are capable of recognizing self from non-self due to previous selection in the thymus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MHC will bind the antigens of the receiving patient and then the APC comes in contact with the antigen-MHC complex</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The APC is part of the antigen MHC complex in this case-it holds the MHC class II molecule on its surface; with bound antigen it is then capable of presenting to a T helper cell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We choose the organs carefully, to make sure their antigens are as close to the recipient's as possible. The more similar they are, the longer it takes for the immune system to recognize them as foreign.</p>
<p>After the transplant, the recipient takes medications to partly suppress the immune system. This further extends the time before the foreign organ is &quot;noticed.&quot;</p>
<p>Even that doesn't necessarily stave off rejection forever. Eventually the organs tend to degrade and fail. But in exceptional cases the transplant can go unnoticed by the immune system for decades. One man is living with a transplanted kidney that he got forty years ago, and he hasn't experienced rejection yet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before transplants are done people are usually &quot;matched&quot; with their HLAs. You can think of these simply as lock and key mechanisms. In identical twins all keys fit all locks. In siblings most do. In cousins some do and so forth. </p>
<p>This is one of the many many reasons transplants survive or die. Other factors are what happens to the blood supply over time, other antigens besides HLAs, infections etc. </p>
<p>Some transplants are also very &quot;immunogenic&quot; (ie. Prone to attack by the immune system) which is why some transplants may survive the process.</p>
<p>Its obviously a lot more complicated than this.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/raiders4sho" target="_blank">raiders4sho</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of reasons actually. There are important factors that affect most notably HLA or human leukocyte antigens. Basically if the body sees something foreign in an organ it pushes it to the surface of the organ. On the surface of the organ are different types of peptides that can be identified by the immune system. The foreign object is then recognized because it doesn't match the peptides. Now there are only so many types of peptides made in the population so often the best matches to HLA factors are found but if the new organ has different peptides than the the ones the body is familiar with it will attack. There are also other factors and defense mechanisms but basically the more similar the original organ is from an HLA standpoint the better the chances are that it will be a successful transplant.</p></div>		</li>
