			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this is called neuroplasticity. Also explains why people experience phantom limbs to go off your armless example. People will often feel like an itch on their missing arm and they found that in one example that the pathway for touch on the arm had been absorbed by the pathway for touch in his cheek (? I read this a few years ago so the details are a little hazy) so he could scratch his cheek and it would satisfy the itch he was feeling in his missing arm. Neuroplasticity is fascinating.</p></div>		</li>
