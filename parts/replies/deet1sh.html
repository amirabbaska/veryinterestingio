			<div class="markdown"><p>The only real difference between kill shelters and no kill shelters is the no kill shelters have the luxury of taking animals until they are full. The county animal shelter has two options if they are full: try to find a rescue or put the animal down. There are plenty of puppies and kittens that get put down every year because there just isn't any room or funding to care for them all. So anyone who wants to support no kill shelters should donate money to keep the funds going and spay and neuter their pets. Because that part is a huge reason we have so many unwanted animals in the first place.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>except the idea of not euthanizing isnt a rational idea and supporting shelters that deny way animals leave more people with unwanted animals that they may just let go. if not fixed you just created more dogs that cant be sustained and are killed. so one option isnt 100% equal even though it may be only a rare scenario making the difference</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not euthanizing is perfectly rational when supply meets demand. Adopting from nokill shelters ensures that demand and support for such shelters exist while kill shelters take up excess demand. In the current environment kill shelters become the pressure reduction button to a messed up situation. I don't support their existing but understand the reason why. </p>
<p>Ideally the situation will arise where kill shelters aren't necessary because demand for what they provide is eliminated. The only way that occurs of course is though responsible owners and breeders. People gotta stop buying animals as presents and creating demand for puppy/kitten mills. </p>
<p>As long as the animal continues to be viewed as an object (viewing kill shelters as rational in and of themselves) rather than a sentient creature, the necessary steps to prevent needless deaths in the future won't occur. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about nation-wide or world-wide, but in my area, any animal that is even moderately cute is adopted. It is the ugly ones or dangerous ones that have trouble finding homes. </p>
<p>So....if your area is like my area, to actually be able to call a shelter animal a 'rescue' animal, it has to be butt ugly.</p></div>		</li>
