			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the other comments, it's like you're always late for everything, even if that thing is hours or days away, you feel like you should be doing <em>something</em> about it.</p>
<p>I read recently something that makes perfect sense as to how my anxiety works: it's like constantly hearing the boss/hurry up song in a videogame, but never seeing the threat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And then you just sort of freeze, because you're overwhelmed with all the things you know you <em>should</em> be doing. But any time you start a task, or even start <em>thinking</em> about doing one of the tasks, your heart starts racing and you sweat, and your digestive system starts going whack, so you say &quot;I can't work like this, I've got to calm down first&quot;, so you do something you like to do instead (or maybe just browse the internet to distract yourself). But now you're rewarding yourself for not doing something, and you slip into this avoidance cycle. And the avoidance cycle starts taking over other things that weren't even related to the stuff that was making you anxious in the first place, but now EVERY task gives you anxiety. That's when the depression starts taking over and you end up staying in bed with your laptop because you can't even face how messy your house has become and you've stopped going to class because you can't face the teacher because you didn't do the homework or any of the reading you were supposed to do and you think &quot;there's probably something wrong with me, I should probably go see someone about this&quot; but then you think &quot;no, they are just going to judge me and think I'm being lazy (cause you're afraid that's all that this really is) and tell me to suck it up or that I don't belong in college and <em>oh my god I'm going to get kicked out what am I going to do I'm going to end up working for some fast food joint and my parents will be so disappointed and everyone will know what a failure I am and I'll still have all the debt from the student loans and I won't ever be able to pay them off so I'll be living with my folks forever and everyone will think I'm a loser and they must already think I'm a loser because no one wants to spend time with me (gee, I wonder why? maybe it's because I've been avoiding them and all social activities) and maybe it would be better if I just died right now and avoided all this misery...</em></p>
<p>And then you go to therapy and you learn how to get out of the hole. And better yet, you learn how to not get in the hole in the first place. And it's not easy, but you keep going because you <em>want</em> to get better and it really does help to have a neutral third party tell you that Yes, these thoughts are not healthy and No, not everyone has to face this, but Hey, we can fix this. And you learn healthier coping strategies.</p>
<p>And you realize the most important thing, and that is that all those things you were so afraid of, they aren't the End. </p>
<p>Failure is not the End.</p>
<p>Being looked down on as weak or stupid is not the End.</p>
<p>Working at a fastfood joint is not the End.</p>
<p>Living with your parents as an adult is not the End. </p>
<p>Debt is not the End. Not even close.</p>
<p>There is only one End, and that is death. </p>
<p>I don't want to die. I do not want to hasten the arrival of the End.</p>
<p>I will not force the End to come on my terms (unless I am terminally ill and in a lot of pain). </p>
<p>I will LIVE. I will DO THINGS. I will IMPROVE MYSELF. I will STOP CARING SO MUCH WHAT OTHERS THINK OF ME.</p>
<p>And I did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree with everything. It becomes particularly harrowing when panic attacks become a symptom. An example: I tell a small story about my childhood and my SO is curious and starts asking me questions. My mind begins to feel like it's being interrogated, even over something so innocuous, and I become defensive in my responses. She gets angry and suspicious of how defensive I'm being and as I feel like I'm losing control of the situation my heart starts to race, breathing becomes shallow and muscles in my legs and arms start tensing sporadically. I'll start sweating and eventually crying as I spiral further out of control. This episode will last between 30 minutes to an hour and by the end I'll be so exhausted I'll pass out (sleepwise) shortly afterwards. Medication has changed my life, mostly for the better but it is a double-edged sword. About 50% of my days I feel pretty even-keeled and the other 50% I feel cold, callous or robotic even. However, double-dipping (as my psych puts it) with depression as well these demeanors are far better than what I had going on before. Sorry about the long comment it's not enough people ask direct questions about anxiety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're interested in some tools for approaching anxiety, check out <em>DARE</em> by Barry McDonagh. Best book I've read on the topic and really helped me come a long way in my recovery. A short (15m) meditation practice every morning has been a godsend as well.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was diagnosed with GAD in high school. I used to get raging panic attacks that would leave me trembling and shivering like I had a fever. I'm kind of a hypochondriac and, one of the last times I got the flu, it was a rough one. I freaked myself out so badly that when I ran to get my mom just so I could calm down a bit, I nearly blacked out, slammed into the couch, and dropped to the floor. I'm assuming it's because I was already weak from the flu, and the overexertion of a panic attack was just too much for me to handle. But I honestly thought I was dying, watching everything pinhole to black like that.
Nowadays, I'm more depressed than anxious. I usually just don't let myself feel much at all, which at least suppresses my more anxious thoughts. They still come and go, but not nearly as bad. Still, I think they pop up subconsciously anyway. At night, they get infinitely worse and it's hard for me to shut off my brain and focus on sleep. The few times I try to get on a good sleep schedule and go to bed early without my boyfriend, I always wake up from some sort of panic attack that happens while I'm sleeping-if that's even possible? I don't really dream or anything, but I'll randomly shoot awake in the throes of a panic attack. I only sleep all through the night of someone is with me. It sucks.
I don't think I ever want to try meds, and I have yet to visit a therapist as an adult so I don't know if that will help me any, but yeah. GAD and depression suck. I'm always the mom of the group, worrying about the dangers in every situation rather than just having fun. I'm also very bad in social situations and am pretty awkward. Luckily, most people find it endearing, but I hate it. I just want to be normal and be able to hold a conversation with new people without my brain racing and freezing up through every second of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way it was explained to me by my therapist was this:</p>
<p>Imagine everybody's anxiety levels on a scale of 1-10. Imagine that anything in a 3-5 is a fairly manageable range, 6-8 is where you are freaking out, and 9-10 is catastrophic. In general, those without anxiety live in the 0-2 range of anxiety on a daily level. When an event occurs, their anxiety levels jump 1-3 points, so it is manageable. If the event is a major event, their anxiety levels can jump to maybe a 5, <em>possibly</em> a 6 or 7 on the scale. </p>
<p>Someone with anxiety, on the other hand, lives at a 3-4 range daily. If an event occurs, their anxiety levels can jump 1-3 points which can put them anywhere between manageable into the freakout range. If the event is major, their anxiety jumps more points, which can put them in a generally higher range on this scale. </p>
<p>Anxiety medication can help people who live in the 3-4 daily be instead, in a 1-3 range on average. It doesn't sound too major, but can make all the world of difference to someone who is living in a constant freak-out range every day of their life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife has severe anxiety and depression. At any given time in a day her range would sit at a 6-8. It got so bad at one point when she was still working that her brain would just shut off and she would pass out and fall face first into the floor.</p>
<p>That was a few years ago and we still can’t find an anxiety therapist or anyone that can really seem to help her.  It is slowly destroying her life and our marriage. Anxiety is a real bitch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on even further (because sometimes it can be difficult for people without an anxiety order to understand):</p>
<p>These are random things that can send me into full on panic mode with crying, rapid breathing, and panic:</p>
<ul>
<li>having to repeat a task more than ~3 times because it was either done incorrectly or outside forces prevented me from being able to correctly complete the task (MyMathLab in college almost made me throw my comp through a window)</li>
<li>someone criticizes my first attempt at something rather than help</li>
<li>bugs. I've never liked them, but in my overtly anxiety induced state, it can bring on phobia levels of panic.</li>
<li>not being unable to remove my shoes because I can't get the double knot undone</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few examples. Writing them out, I <em>know</em> it's stupid of me to get so over worked about these things, but they can literally just bring me from, using your scale, a 3 to a 10 real fast. These anxieties are irrational, but they still affect me negativity. And really, that's how I feel anxiety affects a lot of people.</p>
<p>And different events trigger different reactions for everyone. What I experience will not be the same as what someone else experiences. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>can confirm what you said. Even though i never took medication, &quot;parts&quot; of my anxiety got way less. For example:
I had a decent social anxiety years back in school, whenever i stayed home because i was &quot;sick&quot; and went back too school i was fuckin afraid and if some schoolmates talked about me i was really close to panic attacks, hower this changed over the years due to therapy, growing up and &quot;taking back control&quot; over the anxiety bettered my social anxiety to a daily level of 2-3 from 4-7. And it makes a giant difference in school and work life, i feel so much better now to a point where my life changed pretty much, from a drop out to a nearly done apprenticeship and going to study while working.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another good analogy is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of the feeling you get when you get called to the principal’s office or are stopped on the street at night by a stranger.  It’s scary because things could be bad or it could be nothing and you don’t know yet.</p>
<p>Now imagine feeling like that every time you get a phone call, order food at a restaurant, or have a chat with someone you don’t know very well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And to anybody reading this with an anxiety disorder:  get help, because there are so many ways to feel better.  I tried 5 different medications; four didn’t work or made things worse, but the fifth saved my life.  You never know what will work until you find it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, but as a corollary I would also do your due diligence as a patient by researching the treatment or medication your doctor is recommending. Been to plenty of lousy psychs who don't listen and only push the new SSRI that the GlaxoSmithKline rep just dropped off at their office. If you don't think your doctor is genuine or don't like the direction of the treatment, try somebody new. Everybody is unique. Medication works for some and not for others. Same goes for counseling, meditation, and other alternatives. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your explanation. I have anxiety and panic disorder...well it got worse after I was a first responder and was diagnosed with PTSD. So the PTSD just made my foot push down more on the &quot;accelerator&quot;. SSRIs never worked for me and I was considered treatment resistant because typical medication wasn't working.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I've found that the only way out of a lot of situations is through; you have to embrace the chaos of the adrenaline... realize you're having an episode by the experience (the flush, maybe you have ear popping from the increased breathing, and there's other things that happen when you're really surfing the PTSD experience / episode).</p>
<p>Fighting it sometimes makes it worse, because your body is still looking for the threat... which you're trying to deal with... instead of you either realizing that there is no threat, or that the threat is not of the amount / category that you first realized.</p>
<p>If it's a 7 instead of a 9, take care of that business.</p>
<p>If it's a 5 instead of a 7, you can do that too.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think I'm dealing with a 5 situation, but then it's a 2... and I just walk away and someone else deals with it.</p>
<p>Downgrade as you can, but it's hard to fight the ocean (the waves of reaction to an event).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a close friend who suffers from panic attacks relatively often and from our experience the best way to handle it is to play the senses game.</p>
<p>Tell me something you can see, something you can feel, something you can smell, something you can taste, and something you can hear.</p>
<p>Getting them to focus on something other than the situation they're in and re-route that energy to something like the senses seems to help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean this is great advice for people who panic and surge, but anxiety on a high level is pretty much my life. It's constant, the only thing that waves is when I'm actually in an anxiety provoking situation and then I'm extra shaky sweaty and panicky and can barely breathe, instead of my normal level of tense and shaky and sweaty and constant racing rumination. It's getting worse as I get older too. </p></div>		</li>

I'm pretty much the same and am super sensitive to medication side effects because of fibromyalgia and so I've not found anything that helps, other than propranolol which is limited in efficacy.
