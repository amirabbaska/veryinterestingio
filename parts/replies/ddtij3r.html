			<div class="markdown"><p>It's maybe not the biggest mystery in the field, but a mystery that drives me is the origin of a group of predominantly African mammals called Afrotheria. The group consists of Elephants, sea cows, hyraxes, aardvarks, elephant shrews, terecs, and golden moles. Until molecular systematic work was performed using the mammal family tree, it was thought these animals were from different lineages. Now we're on a quest to see if there are skeletal features we missed that might clue us into what unites these animals so we can turn to the fossil record and find the common ancestor of an Elephant and a tenrec (a shew or hedgehog like animal). - Matt</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. And some hyraxes converged with horses in the Miocene, and others converged with rhinos. Theirs is an incredible story, but they're too grumpy to tell you about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Late Cambrian.  Echinoderms seems to have missed the memo that they should leave a Late Cambrian fossil record and there are only an handful of such fossils known globally.  This also is the time when echinoderms diversified from a few groups to the peak of their diversity in the Early to Mid Ordovician.  -Colin</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're getting closer to figuring out where turtles fit into the tree of life with discoveries like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappochelys" target="_blank">Pappochelys</a>, but they're still debated.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you elaborate on this? Is there not a good fossil record of turtles? Naively I would expect them to leave a lot of fossils, being hard-shelled and living in environments where they could be covered in sediment pretty easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fossil record of turtles is quite good. The shells are durable and preserve comparatively well. However, by the time they have full-blown shells, a lot of other off physical features were also in place.
Transitional fossils like Pappochelys are starting to fill in the gaps, but it's a pretty recent discovery. Plus, they seem to have secondarily fused up extra openings in their skulls, which traditionally had been used to classify major reptile groups. Basically, turtles are weird, and we're still working on finding transitional fossils to fill in how they got so weird.</p></div>		</li>
