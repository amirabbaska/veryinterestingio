			<p>Don't forget about the hydrogen.  The hydrogen bonds contain most of the energy in fats in the first place.  They get combined with oxygen to form water. </p>		</li>

			<p>What about ketones in breath, urine, excrement?  Isn't that another possible way fat exits the body?</p>		</li>

			<p>Can i ask where the carbon comes from in the ETC ?    <br>I thought CO2 was only released during the Krebs cycle. <br>   <br>Since O2 is the final electron acceptor in the ETC, it is given an extra electron which turns it into superoxide (radical). Then through several enzymatic steps is detoxified into water which is then exhaled. </p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah he's technically wrong, the carbons do leave during the TCA cycle, and the oxygen at the end is never combined with them to form CO2, the oxygen was already attached to the carbon before they were cleaved off, and before that, they came from water. <br><br></p>		</li>
