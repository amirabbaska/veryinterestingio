<p>Without people who work their asses off like yourself, I would have been dead last feb.</p>
<p>Sudden resp failure, and now stage 4 copd.</p>
<p>3 weeks in ICU. Damn near did die.</p>
<p>the insurance didnt want to pay for home oxygen, my hospital doc adjusted the walking results to get me to qualify anyway.</p>
<p>had that not happened I would be dead now.</p>
<p>stupid insurance company.  lol</p>
<p>got it here at home now, and I did go into failure again since that. The only thing that kept me out of the hospital was stay home, take it easy and huff O2 at way over the prescribed rate.</p>
<p>got over that setback on my own and at home.</p>
<p>if not for the doc adjusting the resuilts in the hospital, I would have no oxygen supply, and would have to suddenly call 911 again.</p>
<p>I like how some doctors know that insurance is a scam, and will prefer to work with the patient.</p>
<p>insurance says if you are at 88 percent or less, then you qualify for oxygen.  lol</p>
<p>in the real world, anything at 92 percent or less means your in trouble. This lung problem gets worse with time. If not for this doctor fudging the results, I would be seriously screwed. I do have to have that oxygen every day, somedays less, somedays more. I was not using it at all for months after discharge, but after that last failure, now gotta use it every day.</p>
<p>I thank god for that doctor.</p>
<p>Im still doing horrible, but at least im alive and no more sudden visits to ER just to get oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's gotta be miserable though. Here in my city, one of our cardiologists killed himself for exactly your first point. We're like, the fourth largest city in the state or something, but we don't seem to have a lot of good doctors. ( And most of them that we do have, usually move, or quit working as one type to go back to school to learn another medical discipline. )</p>
<p>Anyway, my point is, this guy was the only one working in the ER. He didn't commit suicide; he just accidentally overdosed on some medication. He had some he'd take to help him stay ssss. Rinse, repeat, until he had too much in his system and that was it.</p>
<p>It's a terrifying thought, but I admire every last one of you, especially those of you who do emergency surgeries, for the things you do. For the risks you're willing to take for people you don't know. Thank you for the work you do, friend. You and every other doctor in this thread, really.</p></div>		</li>
