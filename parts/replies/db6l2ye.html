			<div class="markdown"><p>Re hair transplants...</p>
<p>You begin with a small bald patch, and they fill this in with new follicles. I get that.</p>
<p>Surely the original bald patch would increase with age? So you'd have a small island with the new follicles and then a ring of new baldness around them. Like a moat.</p>
<p>Do you just have to get it &quot;topped up&quot; forever?</p>
<p>At 31 it looks like I'm hanging on, which is lucky because being English with a shaved head has certain historical, and now Brexity, connotations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why they do transplants when you're bald. Meaning you lost all of the center part of the head worth of hair. They refill it completely and then the follicles are the strong ones. </p>
<p>You described the kind of baldness that starts with the circle in the back side of the head and then gets larger and larger; there is also mine, which is a slow progressing loss on the whole area instead. There is also other forms, people losing hair only in random spots around the head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I just used an example. I guess I thought that hair loss is progressive right up to the day you die, so any transplant would need redoing... but you're saying it gets to a peak and only then will they bother to do a transplant?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read an AMA for the &quot;best&quot; hair doctor in North America. He said that he will sprinkle in the transplanted hair(which is resistant to the hormone) around the spots where you will lost hair in the future in order to combat future balding as well. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Elon Musk has had a transplant, if you're interested on how much successful it can be. He's a much more handsome man now</p>

<p>And if you want an example of how bad it can look depending on your head shape, look at Wayne Rooney</p></div>		</li>

<p>eh... doesn't look that bad anymore. he's just an ugly cunt in general, but even with his shit looking hair at the moment it's still better than when he was balding.</p>
<p>it's actually amazing how &quot;great&quot; it looks now compared to then. I just googled pics, I forgot how old he looked at fucking 19. poor guy </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My SO has just turned 26. Going bald for about the past...at least two years, but I think longer from when I've known him. It just doesn't matter - as long as they're comfortable, they can do what you want to their head. </p>
<p>Sidenote: He's going from the forehead - hasn't yet hit the mid head</p>
<p>Additional sidenote: I don't care in the slightest. But I know he does. </p></div>		</li>
