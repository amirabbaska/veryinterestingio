			<div class="markdown"><p>It is, but they need to be powered by an external source.  Even when not creating sound there is some power on the line while it is plugged into a source to drive it.  There may be some type of difference amplifier in there as well.  They are really good at pulling out small signals when there is a lot of noise or other garbage on the signal.</p>
<p>A difference amplifier is different than a normal amplifier.  It subtracts 2 signals then amplifies what is different between the two.  This is how you can talk to someone while on a headset in little Cesna or a helicopter and not have your voice drowned out by the sound of the blades spinning.  Since both you and your friends mic is picking up the blade sound, they subtract to silence.  But since you are speaking, you friend is not, that is the difference which gets amplified that you both can hear.  In the end, you are not talking louder than the noise around you in the least.</p>
<p>This may be what is occurring that is allowing you to hear such a weak signal when powered.  A difference amp needs a power source to drive it, the noise is canceling each other out and then this faint AM signal is getting through and amplified.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Check out Captain Dan and the Scurvy Crew some time. Sounds great over a bottle of grog.</p></div>		</li>
