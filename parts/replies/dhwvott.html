			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer. World class conductors are able to teach the finest detail and nuance of the music while high school conductors (myself being one) mainly have to focus on the nuts and bolts of technique. And discipline.</p>
<p>My favorite saying to get my students to play more expressively is &quot;Don't just play the notes, play the music.&quot; There's so much more there than what's printed; a great conductor focuses on this more than anything. When I was a student some of the best conductors I played for had spent hours and hours studying the music and researching past performances. They knew EVERY nuance of EVERY part and how to get the most excessive performance out of EVERY performer. </p>
<p>High school conductors spend most of their time just getting kids to play the right notes. No joke. (Of course that depends on the ability of the group) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What s/he said. Same with choir directors.</p>
<p>I sing in a community choir (auditioned, though not paid), and our director has a doctorate in Conducting. In the years I've known him, I've seen him direct everything from elementary and middle-school kids, to festival choirs, to university choirs - which is his day job - and also some orchestras. Who he's working with makes a huge difference in how he directs.</p>
<p>Incidentally, he's the most into nuance when directing the university choir. We grownups singing for fun don't practice as much and aren't nearly as disciplined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this makes you look at the OP's questions differently. When I read it, I only thought about during performances, when the conductor is standing up front waiving his/her arms keeping the beat etc. I didn't consider the whole part about practice and teaching, my expectation were, by the time you're playing in front of a grand conductor, you have little more to learn. Of course that is untrue.</p>
<p>Really, it is the same as anything else. The same things that separate a pro football coach from a high school football coach.</p></div>		</li>
