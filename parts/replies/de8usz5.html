			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to disagree with the above, but there's also good reason for certain kinds of businesses to hold the opposite consideration:</p>
<p>If that business's <em>customers</em> are chiefly the beneficiaries of this progressive tax-funded program(say, a fast-food or consumer electronics company), then those customers have more disposable income and that's an opportunity the business can capitalize on.</p>
<p>For businesses which serve the public, there's &quot;Hey, we're paying out more per employee&quot; on the one hand, but &quot;Hey, more people can afford our products/services&quot; on the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless that corporation makes more per person than the average person makes it would pay the same. Also, they still pay for everyone. When a jobless person uses healthcare and can't pay, the hospital just charges everyone who has insurance more. Then businesses pay a bit more for insurance. Everyone is still getting care and everyone who can pay is still paying for everyone either way. </p></div>		</li>
