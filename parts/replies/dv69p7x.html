<p>Doesn't that depend on whether or not there is a resonance effect? Knowing what I know about harmonic oscillators, we could introduce instability if we disturb the system too much.... won't change orbits of anything but could make for interesting, i.e., devastating, tidal effects. No?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I think you are right, but only if there are places with tidal-period resonant effects. Those would be places where tidal surges effectively bounce from one coast to another. I don't know of any, and I haven't looked into it, but it's not impossible. If such a phenomenon exists somewhere, it would store up extra energy locally, and harvesting that extra energy would reduce the harmonic energy with maybe unknown effects. But if places like that exist, I imagine they would be very localized and rare. It's a pretty special set of circumstances that would be necessary to set up tidal harmonics. Being localized probably means localized consequences, which probably doesn't mean any dramatic devastation, and most likely would just mean lower tides.
(If we get really nitpicky, having a resonant system somewhere might contribute to a greater tidal energy transfer, and shutting that resonance down could effect that. But that's really too many maybes to consider. Technically speaking, filling a bathtub also affects the transfer.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a while since I studied it - mechanical engineer in my research group in grad school was curious and asked my professional opinion why the tides worked like they did - but IIRC I concluded it's likely a global harmonic effect given that the tide doesn't perfectly follow the moon. Thoughts?</p></div>		</li>
