			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw an interesting interview with Ashton Kutcher who now often invests in startups but was also one of the early adopters of Twitter. He realised he had &quot;left a lot of value on the table&quot; by helping in promoting Twitter without having a stake in the company. He realised afterwards how much his &quot;brand&quot; could help build other brands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think Twitter was much more based on word of mouth than celebrities, at least initially. It was just a cool, unique technology that people got excited about. It was super narrowly focused at first too.</p>
<p>Another big factor was that Twitter offered APIs for third party developers to build apps on. A lot of them filled gaps in the product, and it meant the feature set wasn't gated on what Twitter Engineering could build. As time went on they pivoted and wanted to control everything. They killed some of the third party apps by building featured to do the same things. Now it sounds like they want more third party developers again, but good luck getting them with their history.</p>
<p>Now I think companies just want The Rock to sign on and bring over his bajillion followers, but that's only going to work if you have a compelling product. The problem with trying to beat Facebook or Twitter is they're so ingrained, with large user bases. I think you need to offer something they don't already to be successful. I've seen a few apps show up that were basically Instagram clones, and they've flamed out. People also keep trying the model where the content providers get paid by the users somehow, but that's hard to do when there's so much free content around.</p>
<p>Tinder is another great example of simplicity and offering something unique.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Facebook also only overcame MySpace in 2008 when smart phones were fairly new. So I imagine their mobile site helped, though I didn't use it at the time.</p>

<p>I just got a modern smartphone with an on-screen keyboard and now I understand both the appeal of mobile interfaces and their detractors. I am not using a mobile interface to enter this reply but for some time I have been complaining about the lack of use of Markdown Format in social media, even when it is available, as it is on Reddit, but not on Facebook. It is clear that both the browser-based and mobile interface to Facebook have a bias towards the mobile medium.  Maybe the engineers at Facebook should adopt the grid standard for CSS and allow for the browser interface to &quot;flow&quot;. Right now the newsfeed on Facebook is like sucking data through a narrow straw, and that sucks. It frustrates too, looking down that narrow zone is tedious. I recommend people to stop using Facebook.</p></div>		</li>
