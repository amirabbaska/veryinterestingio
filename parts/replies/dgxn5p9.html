			<div class="markdown"><p>Even the best camera sensors need to absorb a few photons per pixel, so we need to receive thousands to millions of photons to resolve a picture.  Luckily, celestial bodies don't move very fast (in terms of angular velocity, anyway), so we can use very long exposure times to boost the signal.</p></div>		</li>
