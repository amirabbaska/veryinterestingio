<p>varying the glass material on a silvered mirror still produced dominant reflective wavelengths in the green region of the spectrum.  it seems that the backing metal substrate has a larger effect on the color than the material of the glass.  for example, aluminium mirrors tended toward shorter wavelengths as it has a blueish reflectance spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fully agree.  My mirror is obviously silver, except when it's reflecting something.  I don't see any green!  That's the problem with the internet today.  There are too many facts masquerading as truth.  Tide goes in, tide goes out. Never a miscommunication. You can’t explain that. You can’t explain why the tide goes in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is right.</p>
<p>Also, at least part of that is the glass the mirror is made of, not the reflective &quot;mirror&quot; part itself, as most mirrors are back silvered, so the light actually goes through the glass twice to bounce back.</p>
<p>If the glass is high quality low iron glass, it will produce a much more white reflection, but that glass is quite expensive, so it isn't used except in very rare cases.</p></div>		</li>
