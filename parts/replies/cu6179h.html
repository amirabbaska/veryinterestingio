			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't precisely agree here. They may be equally &quot;valid&quot; in some definition of the word, but within science, the one that makes the fewest assumptions (axiomatic statements) about reality is the &quot;scientific&quot; theory. They may both be, in a philosophical sense &quot;equal&quot; since they're both up to explaining phenomena, but we define science to be the subset of explanations requiring the fewest axioms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point, I suppose I was overgeneralizing. But supposing the number of axioms assumed to be equal, you can't say one is more &quot;correct&quot; than the other, unless one can be disproven somehow.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If there is more than one valid hypothesis still standing then none of the hypotheses are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory" target="_blank">scientific theory</a>. <em>A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is acquired through the scientific method and repeatedly tested and confirmed through observation and experimentation.</em> If there is more than one different possibly valid explanation then none of those possible explanations can be said to be <strong>well-substantiated</strong> or <strong>repeatedly tested and confirmed</strong>. Hence none of them are theories, they remain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis" target="_blank">hypotheses</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We &quot;know&quot; that the speed of light is invariant only because all of our hypotheses about variable light speeds don't pan out in observations. Based on what we see here in our patch of the universe, there's no reason to believe that the speed of light is any different in any other patch of the universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, it is based on what we see of the whole universe, not just our patch of it. Via the thecniques of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy" target="_blank">astronomical spectroscopy</a> we observe that the light from distant stars and galaxies, across the entire visible universe, was produced by the exact same physics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis#Hydrogen_burning" target="_blank">hydrogen burning</a> as happens in our own sun locally.</p>
<p>Note also that when we observe the light from distant stars and galaxies we are literally <a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/cosmology/lightspeed.html" target="_blank">looking back in time</a>.</p>
<p>Because the speed of light is a fundamental constant and the process of stellar hydrogen burning could not occur if it had a different value, we can directly infer from our observations that the speed of light has had the same value throughout time and space as it has locally now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True true, I guess in a way nothing is really absolute. What I thought was really interesting was the idea that as we answer more questions in science, newer questions pop up faster than we can answer them. A famous scientist said something along the lines of &quot;the amount of questions answered is like the radius of a circle but the amount of questions unanswered is like the circumference.&quot; So the more you know, the more you find out how little you actually understand everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is quite interesting. Currently I am reading a book with a similar idea -  infinite hypotheses for a single scientific problem or question, each of which generate more questions. The book is Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M. Pirsig. Great read, and here's the link: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry/dp/0060589469" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry/dp/0060589469</a></p></div>		</li>
