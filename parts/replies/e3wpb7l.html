			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Iâ€™d like to also add that most (cough, all) upstart distilleries generally  also buy already aged products from existing distilleries and re-brand it as their own to condense their timeline for getting out their aged spirits into the market. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Some places will take existing products and literally just re-brand them and some places will put a little spin on it (age it in rum casks) and then put a big markup on it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The can also source spirits from other, older distilleries and sell it as their own brand while they wait for their own spirits to age. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a tour of a brand new distillery last year. Basically all they sold was vodka and white whiskey.  They showed us the first batch of barrels that they had just bought and filled.  They were tiny 5 gallon barrels, it was such a small place. I should take that tour again, see if their brown whiskey turned out any good! </p></div>		</li>
