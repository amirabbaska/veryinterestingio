<p>A younger generation in Japan started wearing the masks as a fashion statement and means of achieving some privacy in public as well, though. This trend was called da-te masuku. Some girls wear the masks so they don't have to put makeup on or if they have a blemish they don't want others to see.</p>

<p>I was in Japan last year and went on a small, English speaking tour of a park in Tokyo. Near the end of the tour, our tour guide, an older middle-aged Japanese woman, told our group that Japanese people wore face masks to prevent themselves and others from getting sick, but then she went on to say that she has noticed that in the past few years more and more younger Japanese girls/women are wearing them more often. She said she didn't know why and she seemed genuinely confused by the phenomenon. I chimed in and told her the reason OP stated above (I read it on the internet prior to the trip) and I could see her making the realization on her face.</p>
<p>I felt a little like a weeb, but honestly, it makes perfect sense. American girls wear big sunglasses to hide bad/no eye makeup. They wear long pants to hide the fact that they haven't shaved their legs. Women who are culturally Muslim, but may nor may not be strict followers of the religion, decide to wear headscarves because they don't feel like doing their hair. Heck, guys wear hats when they're lazy and don't want to do their hair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also done when someone eats a smelly lunch and wants to hide their breath, especially when they work in customer service. This is why you'll see the mask below their nose and just covering your mouth sometimes. I moved to Japan a couple months ago and I asked a younger in-law about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wore it because it's easier than having to take out a tissue before sneezing when I was in Japan. Also not nice to spread my germs in a crowded train. At work here in the US, I sometimes use it because it makes people less likely to talk to me. I work in healthcare so I just say I have a little cold or cough.   </p>
<p>Edit: lol obviously I won't sneeze into it if my nose is stuffy but I'm glad I made some redditors imagine that wonderful warm sensation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but have you ever tried to race a sneeze to get a tissue out of your pocket?</p>
<p>Just start getting the tissue out - if you make it in time, great. If not, use the tissue to clean your face and throw the mask away. In bulk, they're only 15-20Â¢ each, Google tells me.</p>
<p>I was sick recently, and kept a box of tissues right next to me in the car all week. Still sneezed into the windshield a couple of times, when the sun caught me just right and I wasn't fast enough.</p></div>		</li>
