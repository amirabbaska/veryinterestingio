			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to piggyback off your comment to also point out that Queen Victoria didn't do that much ruling.  The Victorian era was one of the most important eras in the transition to constitutional monarchy, although Parliament's supremacy over the Crown and the role of the Prime Minister was well established before her ascent.  </p>
<p>The Prime Minister and the Cabinet exercise political authority in the United Kingdom (and by extension the British Empire), and although I don't know much about the governance of the colonies I assume there would have been local governors and government structures to manage their day-to-day affairs.  The Queen, whilst an exceptionally important figurehead for the Empire and still playing her part in the political structure, would have very little direct decision making roles in the running of the Empire, or even the home kingdom.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did consider mentioning Elizabeth, but I was under the impression that the time of her ruling was also a time where people were firm believers that the monarch was basically an instrument of God. I believed that Victoria ruled (for a long time) in an era where this idea was generally less believed - is this correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking that as I read this question. Is it safe to say she did more actual ruling  than Victoria did?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the things that most people internationally don't quite understand about the British parliamentary democracy.</p>
<p>The Monarch doesn't have any real power.  All the power is in influence alone.</p>
<p>We've been basically a simple representative democracy for hundreds of years, with the monarchy just doing their thing on the side.</p>
<p>Deciding upon who can vote has been a more recent thing, but that's been a more recent thing for most nations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also worth remembering that while the monarchy under Victoria gained massively in prestige it lost almost all of its real power to parliament over the course or her reign. When she first succeeded to the throne she was able to prevent the leader of the majority party from forming a government. At the end of her reign such a thing would have been unimaginable and any attempt at it would have sparked a constitutional crisis. Although I should point out that this had little or nothing to do with her sex. One might argue that the wheels were really set in motion by the Reform Act that was passed during the reign of her uncle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point. I'm far from an expert on the topic, but it seems to me like she prioritized the image of the monarchy and symbolic power over actual political power (which may have been inevitably lost to the monarchy regardless).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was rather more the fact that parliament decided to enforce its constitutional prerogative. She did not give power away - it was taken from her.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was it the reign of Victoria or the reign of Edward VII where power transitioned more fully? I thought that Victoria still took an active role in politics, while Edward VII didn't because Victoria kept the affairs of state and politics from him when he was Prince of Wales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As previously mentioned, the transition to a fully functioning constitutional monarchy with the monarch as figurehead was largely accomplished over her reign though it continued afterwards - along with the declawing of the House of Lords by the Liberal government - during Edward's reign.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A lot of men were fighting on the front and women filled in for their jobs at home. As a result, women became seen as more capable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To expand on that, the war led to tangible political influence coming to ordinary women for the first time. The need to mobilize women within the wartime economy moved women's labour into more industries than ever before, and made women primarily responsible for paying rent.</p>
<p>When organized, this translates into effective political power; many women became active leaders in radical labour movements and used the state's sudden dependence on their labour to campaign for better conditions. Such figures included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Barbour" target="_blank">Mary Barbour</a> in Glasgow, who organized strikes against rent hikes in 1915.</p>
<p>This was also a time of tremendous political unrest, when seriously dissatisfied popular movements posed a real threat to established systems of power. The 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland, the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the German Revolution of 1918 are prominent examples of the sort of thing the government was deeply, deeply concerned might happen (so much so that Winston Churchill deployed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_George_Square" target="_blank">tanks in the heart of Glasgow during the Forty Hours strike of 1919</a>); women were now an active and major element of the Socialist movement in Britain and that particular Genie was not going to go back into the bottle at anything less than gunpoint, and perhaps not even then.</p></div>		</li>
