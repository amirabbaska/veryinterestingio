			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there - this is truly fascinating and certainly makes intuitive sense, although I know quantum mechanics often breaks with intuition. I actually put together a few slides for fun a year ago on the possibility that particles were just the peak expression of an underlying waveform that was not always detectable (<a href="http://imgur.com/a/DNbVC" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/DNbVC</a>). Could this be a possible explanation for why we cannot always detect a pilot wave, while it could still exist and affect the motion of quantum particles?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an impressive level of reasoning and carrying things through for a self proclaimed novice. Unfortunately, I don't think any of your predictions would hold up in the real world (the math wouldn't hold up), and the sort of theory you present isn't really needed right now, but some of what you said has interesting correspondences with quantum field theory (which covers a lot of the items you discuss). In QFT, we do often deal with excitations that are described in momentum-space or in terms of energy, rather than in position-space or time, as it often makes the math more tractable. There are systems where particles move in such a way that they can be described as phonons, or spinons, or magnons, which are momentum-space excitations relating to sound, spin, and magnetic moment (if I remember all that right). You can always transform back to position-space and time, though (via Fourier transform), so it's really just a different way of writing and working with the fields and excitations, rather than a new physical entity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi Andrew K., I'm also a physics layman like you, and from the way experts have been responding to your slides, it shows that you've got a long way to go to understand this field, and so have I. I would just like to tell you that I greatly enjoyed your slides and its tongue-in-cheek illustrations. Keep it up! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, is it easy enough to explain to a person who doesn't understand this very well:  How could it be seen as time reversal when in fact time is continuing in it's natural motion, as opposed to just being perhaps frequencies of energy waves that simply hit some sort of harmonic resonance (not sure if that is a correct application of the term) and just follows the energy wave back the way it came after hitting a specific wave pattern that bounces it back?</p>
<p>Also, are there ways to measure the force of the impacts and such to ensure that the reversal process maintains the same force exerted on the initial path?  Would it not require exact reversal of the forces to be even considered to be in the realm of time reversal?</p>
<p>I am sorry if any of these questions don't make proper sense. I know very very little on this subject, and just kind of stumbled in here, but that idea struck me as curious.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The phrase &quot;time reversal&quot; is a shorthand for &quot;time reversal symmetry in the laws of physics governing the thing.&quot; You've probably never heard of this symmetry, but let me give you some examples of what &quot;symmetry&quot; means here. A typical non-ornamented dinner plate or bowl, we'd say, has continuous rotational symmetry about one axis. What we mean by that is that you can rotate it any amount around that axis and the total mass distribution in space stays the same. A typical picket fence in many ways behaves like a discrete translational symmetry along one axis: there is some distance L which, if you move the fence a distance L side-to-side, you get the same mass distribution in space. (The actual fence of course needs to be infinite otherwise the mass distribution at the corners changes when you translate all of its mass to the left by L, but in physics we're pretty comfortable saying &quot;in the center of the fence the edges are far away and it 'effectively' has this symmetry.&quot;) So there's different <em>kinds</em> of symmetries (translation/rotation), and different, I don't even know what to call them, let's say <em>aspects</em> (discrete/continuous, what axis/axes it's about, etc.). One kind of symmetry which can be very helpful is a <em>space reversal symmetry</em> where things look the same as their mirror image. This is probably the &quot;symmetry&quot; that you're most familiar with, and it's fundamentally discrete.</p>
<p>So the idea of symmetry, in other words, is &quot;do this operation and the thing doesn't change.&quot; Therefore we can also talk about symmetries in the laws of physics that govern a thing. Usually these laws are presented in the form of a <em>Lagrangian</em>, a function which takes every possible way that the system could be configured, and provides a number for that. The usual interpretation of this number is &quot;kinetic minus potential energy.&quot; We do this because the Newtonian interpretation of physics (force-laws acting on particles) requires you to invent complicated models for constraints, while the Lagrangian interpretation of physics (this function telling you the
kinetic-minus-potential energies of each possible configuration) is provably agnostic about what coordinates you use to describe the configurations. So for example when dealing with a double pendulum (a rigid pendulum hinged at the end of another rigid pendulum hinged at some fixed point in the sky), Newton requires you to use two points in a 2D space with an infinite force keeping those two points a constant distance away from each other, and another infinite force keeping the one point a constant distance away from the fixed point in the sky. The constraints are complicated. But Lagrange says &quot;I don't care, just describe it with the two angles that the hinges make, and then I can tell you the equations of motion.&quot; Easy peasy.</p>
<p>So then, symmetries in the Lagrangian function that describes the entire physics of the system are very important. Actually it turns out that every continuous symmetry of the Lagrangian has an interpretation as a conserved quantity (Noether's theorem, which has made her a lot of physicists' favorite female mathematician of all time), and occasionally there are similar interpretations for discrete symmetries, though I don't think there's a general rule for that. For example, <em>continuous time-translation symmetry</em> (the laws of physics are the same for this system now as one second from now, or one half-second, or one quarter second, or for that matter one year) turns out to be the same as <em>conservation of energy</em>. A continuous space-translation symmetry in any direction turns out to be the same as <em>conservation of linear momentum</em> in that direction. A continuous rotational symmetry about any axis is the same as <em>conservation of angular momentum</em> about that axis. So we can then answer &quot;why is energy conserved?&quot; with the simple answer &quot;because the laws of physics that apply to the system aren't changing from moment to moment,&quot;  end of story.</p>
<p>Now <em>time reversal symmetry</em> is a really interesting special case. The really interesting thing about it is that most of our microscopic laws of physics are time-reversal symmetric. You can therefore get eerie videos when you just time-reverse existing videos, exploited to interesting effects in videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6jprOZ29wY" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlvSpPuWdo" target="_blank">2</a>, and some Daft Punk(?) video, I don't remember what it was, where people were jumping to great heights by playing videos backwards where they fell from those great heights into a crouching position.</p>
<p>In fact, if the particle is indeed producing these &quot;echoes&quot; of where it's been in the wave-height pattern on the surface of the fluid, and there exists some way to reverse it so that it emits an anti-echo into the fluid compared to what the original echo looks like (which might be as simple as getting it to stay aloft while the phase of the standing wave changes underneath it!) then there is a natural interpretation as &quot;the same laws of physics with a time-reversed initial condition&quot; which, if the laws have time-reversal symmetry, should lead to an exact reversal of the path that the particle takes. So <em>the very thing you're talking about</em> is indeed a way to see it (I might use a different vocabulary but whatever), but <em>that has a second interpretation</em> as showing you one of these reversed-videos, what would happen if the laws are reversed.</p>
<p>If it helps it's the precise way that you might look at the second phase of the rotation in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p08_KlTKP50" target="_blank">this video</a> being a &quot;time reversal&quot; of the first phase of the rotation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I feel like Noether doesn't get enough credit from mathematicians tbh. She formulated the isomorphism theorems which are used <em>everywhere</em> in abstract algebra. I had been using them for 2 years before I discovered that they came from Noether.</p></div>		</li>
