<p>Try to stick as closely as possible to your routine on weekends to avoid a Monday morning sleep hangover. </p>

<p>That sounds like in the context of needing to  be awake and function at a certain time due to work or other obligations. How does this change when there is no other obligation to be awake? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I know people who wake with no alarm at the same time every day essentially. I'd say this is a perfect example of a &quot;well oiled&quot; sleep pattern </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is typically in the context of having trained themselves to keep to the sleep pattern of a modern work/school schedule though. The question is, if you took infants and raised the to adulthood without them ever having any time based obligations, what would the ideal sleep pattern be. If they could sleep 23 hours or 2 hours a day, all at once or in small blocks, all at night or all in the day or a combination of both. What is the best sleep schedule for the body itself, rather than the best sleep schedule for functioning in a society with set work and school and business hours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This discusses sleep problems, not the impact on overall health and wellness, which is OP's question. If you can sleep and wake whenever you want, insomnia and sleep schedule are irrelevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be chronic insomnia if it occurs every night without fail which typically has an underlying medical cause. Periodic insomnia (ie one or two days a week I can't fall asleep when I think I'm tired) is typically caused by environmental factors (stress, anxiety, diet, light exposure, ambient sounds, whole hosts of thing) and technically only a problem because they have to wake up and be productive the next day. Otherwise their sleep needs would even out eventually. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I do this too. Pick up some snacks/treats and stuff the night before and wake up early Saturday, take the dog out, do some washing and then I've got plenty of time to binge a series or play video games without the nagging guilt of having done nothing all day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's best for you can often feel counterintuitive.  Playing games now gives you instant gratification.  Going to sleep at the same time every night so that you can feel better rested when you game in the morning is delayed gratification.  We as humans seem to be more wired for instant gratification and have to make a conscious effort to do otherwise.  Something that's helped me tremendously with such good habits is the Habitica app, which turns habits into a game.  I go to bed on time, floss, clean regularly, eat out less, meal prep, etc. all because of that app.  Try to get friends involved for added accountability. </p></div>		</li>
