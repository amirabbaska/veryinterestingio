<p>The nerves in my skin that detect heat go to one physical place in my brain, and the nerves in my skin that detect pain go to a different physical place in my brain?</p>
<p>And these networks presumably can't overlap, otherwise it would be impossible for the brain to determine which exact nerve a signal came from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can try this yourself!
Take a small needle and pick your finger just a tiny bit on various places near each other! Sometimes you'll feel a &quot;cold&quot; pain and sometimes you'll feel a &quot;hot&quot; pain, and sometimes you'll only feel... pain. That's because the tip of the needle is so thin it only activates a small amount of nerves, and if you're &quot;lucky&quot; you'll activate heat nerves instead of pain nerves. Sort of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a cool trick. But that doesn't get me any closer to answering my question.</p>
<p>So I've activated a heat nerve. Or a pain nerve. Or both. OK cool.......</p>
<p>But how does my brain know which one I've activated?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes..... </p>
<p>And how does the brain know the difference between the signals coming from the receptors?</p>
<p><em>That</em> is the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are different types of sensors for different sensations: light touch, deep touch, pain, temperature. And there are different pathways they take in the spinal cord to the brain. One pathway, the spinothalamic tract carries crude touch as well as pain sensations.
They will typically all travel through the thalamus, which you can think of the train station to the brain. A signal goes to the thalamus and it tells it where to go in the brain. </p></div>		</li>
