			<div class="markdown"><p>However, if I remember correctly, once the myocardial muscle becomes necrotic, then re-introduced to blood, a hemorrhagic transformation happens. For instance, I'm an ER nurse, and we had a 30F come in having a STEMI.  Once we gave nitro, the coronary arteries re-introduced blood to the necrotic tissue and the patient went into VF.  Additionally, the patient had tall, tented T waves from the K+ leaking out of the cells.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! What you're describing is a reperfusion injury, it's caused by the formation of reactive oxydative species after reinfusion of Oxygen (O2- is very toxic to cells). I think a lot of people don't know how dangerous reperfusion can be after MI's, it's a super interesting cause of death...  Sp most MI's post 5 minutes will have this occur and can lead to VF within the first few days post reperfusion, or ventricular rupture after those few days due to actual necrosis.
What I was explaining earlier isn't due to an MI, but transient ischemia over weeks/months/years commonly seen in angina patients. The myocardium survives, but shuts down a large amount of activity/synthesis of proteins etc. </p></div>		</li>
