			<div class="markdown"><p>The Iraq War had an enormous influence on Turkey. A book was written, &quot;Metal Storm,&quot; I believe, which was a bestseller. It involved the US invading Turkey for its uranium and Turkey heroically resisting.</p>
<p>The Iraq War did enormous damage across the Muslim World. It defined the line between &quot;Us and Them&quot; as &quot;Islam and the West.&quot; Turks had previously seen &quot;Us and Them&quot; as &quot;Secularist Turks v. Islamist Arabs&quot; and this flipped the script and caused Turks to see themselves as having more in common with Arab nations than European ones. Not that all Turks shifted, of course, but enough to tip the balance in a democracy (if 5% of Americans shifted from Democrats to Republicans or vice-versa it would be enough to radically change the government into a dominant one-party system, for instance). </p>
<p>This in the backdrop of a radicalization going on across the Islamic World. That's a simplified answer, as I don't know as much about Turkey as I do about other major Islamic countries. But from what I have read, I get the sense that the Iraq War helped tip the balance of the Islamists. It makes me sick to see what's happening to the country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Turkish people have always been deeply conservative - <em>much</em> more so than their Arab counterparts. The military and some certain leaders went way too extreme in their secularism, going as far as to ban simple headscarves in public. You go that extreme, expect a backlash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very great post! I think you are dead on, and it's so sad that people think that the answer to the problems brought about by ignorance (and religious ignorance specifically) can be solved with MORE religion. This goes hand-in-hand with the fallacy of the &quot;Good Ole Days&quot; which are almost without exception not any better than modern times, but seem better in retrospect because of nostalgia and the selective remembrance of the good parts and forgetting of the bad.</p>
<p>If Saudi hadn't got the Oil, we would be living in a far more peaceful and less religious world today.</p></div>		</li>
