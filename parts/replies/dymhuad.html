			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically when I see the word &quot;slough&quot; in a medical reference, it has to do with the skin slippage of the deceased or severe burn victims.  You've imprinted even more gross and disturbing imagery for my brain to conjure up than I thought was possible.  Thanks, I think. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first time I read the word slough it was in &quot;The Hot Zone&quot;, an old book with a brief history of ebola centred around the Reston animal quarantine case.</p>
