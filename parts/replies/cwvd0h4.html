			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's one thing to think about: sympathetic vibration. In barbershop music, there are &quot;quartets&quot; of 4 people who can potentially make a &quot;ring tone&quot; which sounds like a 5th person singing. How is that possible?  </p>
<p>Consider another example: if you play a C note on the piano and hold your finger on another C above that, you will feel it vibrating even though you've never touched that other C. How is that possible?  </p>
<p>This is because musical notes are mathematically based. The &quot;A&quot; above middle C is 440 Hz, that's the mathematical description of the frequency of the sound wave. So, if you get the notes just right in a barbershop quartet, you can all vibrate together and create beautiful overtones/ring tones. Similarly, pianos with the pedal down sound &quot;rich&quot; because there are so many overtones.  </p>
<p>So, speakers can capture that richness across the spectrum of sounds all at once. It's really just a spectrum of loudness at all different frequencies, your brain interprets that as drums/guitar because you LEARNED that it's drums and guitar. Drums DO have a frequency, guitars obviously do, and the characteristic &quot;sound&quot; of those instruments is based on the MIXTURE of their overtones. If you ever hear a computer make a &quot;pure&quot; sound, with only one frequency, it sounds like a weird and piercing note that is un-musical. That is because all musical instruments are rich and have a range of frequencies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what this has to do with the topic at hand. This is an example of how you can approximate periodic waves using sums of harmonics. It looks cool though!</p>
<p>If you like this kind of thing look for &quot;VERBOS HARMONIC OSCILLATOR&quot; to see an instrument which is based around this principle of summing sines: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R92yLdlmkQY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R92yLdlmkQY</a></p>
<p>If you want to know more about &quot;mixing multiple sounds into a single vibration&quot;, another way to go about it is to study the ear canal and what it can do. Or check out how a WAV file (audio encoding) might work.</p>
<p>Also note that summing isn't the only way to get groovy sounds ... you can also multiply waves together and get RING MODULATION <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhwj-rqo_B8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhwj-rqo_B8</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right that makes sense but what if you had accidently chosen 2 waves that completely or partially cancel each other out? In the speaker example you would essentially be losing parts of the song right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. </p>
<p>But that's extremely rare to happen by accident. Certainly to any noticeable extent. </p>
<p>Musical sound sources are made up extremely complex, ever changing blends of thousands of frequencies. So any cancellation is extremely short. </p>
<p>The only scenario that this occurs where it's noticeable is when you've got two similar instruments playing the exact same note. </p>
<p>(Edit: This was actually a problem in one real world situation I know of. On one of Michael Jackson's final recording sessions, he sang so perfectly in tune that his sound engineer found his voice partially  cancelled out when he tried to play two recorded takes at the same time.) </p>
<p>Edit 2: good comments by all. My intent was to say it was exceedingly rare to get significant cancellation between different real instruments. When a single sound source is recorded with multiple mics, or multiple synthetic sounds are combined, it becomes so common as to be a royal pain in the ass, as pointed out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a musician, but not very well versed in the science behind this phenomenon. </p>
<p>When I hit the same note on two different strings of an electric guitar, the sound coming out of the amplififer (one speaker then) feels like it is oscillating in volume. Is this a direct consequence of this cancellation effect and it feels like it is oscillating because the strings will not produce a constant perfect pitch?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(to build on the concept for the OP): while it's rare for it to happen naturally by accident, it's done very deliberately to achieve &quot;noise cancelling&quot; effects in such headphones. A microphone outside the headpohones senses the frequency of the background noise, and then produces a the same frequency precisely 180 degrees out of phase, there by creating opposite pressure wave which (mostly) cancels the vibration in your ear.  </p>
<p>Of course that only works when the background noise is stable and without sharp transients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that rare. When you set up multiple microphones for a drumkit, for example, you can run into the situation where MicA is juuuust the right (actually wrong) distance from MicB that the drum MicA is set up to record sound will be out of phase when it hits MicB. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Excellent</em> question. I have a rambling disjointed answer.</p>
<p>The thing about <strong>recorded</strong> music is that there is finite space on the medium of recording. CDs, different file types, the wax cylinder, all of these have limits on how much they can capture, thus, will never have the same sound as being in a room hearing live instruments; even your ears are limited in how much sound information they can gather, eg, we can't hear those high frequencies of dog whistles. But let's ignore the limits of our own anatomy for now.</p>
<p>There are a great many factors contributing to one sound besides just frequency. The timbre and pitch of a trumpet are different from that of a trombone, and if each instrument were to play the same pitch at the same frequency, we would still be able to make out the difference. There would be some overlapping of their tones but our ears are quite good at distinguishing two separate instruments even playing the same note.</p>
<p>This is why orchestras have sections of instruments and why the parts for different sections are often similar, but never verbatim. For example, violins and violas are near each others range, and can often be heard playing lines that are supportive of one another. The violins could be playing the main melody with more notes and figures, while the violas play a more subdued part, yet still similar to the melody line. It may be hard to notice exactly the difference when both sections are playing, but if the violas drop out then suddenly the melody played solo by the violins sounds thin.</p>
<p>Back to recorded music. Because the medium of recording isn't as &quot;spacious&quot; as an open room with live instruments, many producers/bands/engineers have developed techniques for minimizing overlapping frequencies. Think of some heavy metal songs. Often in heavy metal, the bass guitar is difficult to hear. Why? Because the guitars and the drums are played low, deep, and heavy, which is kinda bass guitar's bread and butter. When the whole band inhabits the same octaves there will be overlap and something will be drowned out. Mediocre live recordings have this problem, there are many extra instruments, the singer's voice is a little lower than when they can rest between takes, etc. Sometimes the &quot;power&quot; of the studio recording makes a live band sound wimpy, so extra players are brought in just to beef up the sound.</p>
<p>One last thing: for <strong>excellent</strong> examples of songs/tracks/recordings that have really good separation of low-medium-medium high-high voices, check out Timbaland produced beats. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9-sOrJk3T8" target="_blank">Ginuwine's <em>Pony</em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mhwlCS3hi4" target="_blank">Timberlake's <em>Cry Me A River</em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf2VI3eu8oM" target="_blank">Missy Elliot's <em>Beep Me 911</em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tig66BdhBZA" target="_blank">Aaaliyah's <em>Are You That Somebody</em></a>, so many more. I've gone through a lot of his stuff and while his beats are full and busy, they are hardly ever cluttered. There's no song I can think of where, even for half a second, some instrument line is overlapped by another. Dude's a fuckin' alien, check him out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. But you wouldn't notice it. You can use editing software to find it though. That's one reason why you can't just extract a single track from a sound file and have it be 100% accurate to the original. More complex software can fill in cancelled sections based on an algorithm but entry level software would do a really poor job of track extraction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes more sense, but it still doesn't really make any sense to me. </p>
<p>My mind is still trying to think of it as if it's a music score. Each instrument has it's own line which represents its own pitches, timbre, accents, etc. Combining 20 of these into one wave form is mind boggling. It sounds much easier in a digital format. But what about pressing that into an LP?? (yes, I know it's the same wave form, but it sounds sooooooo much more complex)</p>
<p>It's still black magic to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, think of your eardrums. How can your eardrums hear 20 instruments at once? You only have two of them. All those vibrations come into your ear, but your ear has only one eardrum that gets vibrated.  but it's picking up lots of waveforms overlapping. You can detect it all at once.</p>
<p>A speaker is literally the opposite of that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I still have a hard time grasping is how two speakers can create a 3 dimensional soundscape where you can actually pick out where an instrument is.  If you listen to a good hifi, the sound has height and depth.  How is this possible with two speakers emitting one waveform from a single plane?</p></div>		</li>
