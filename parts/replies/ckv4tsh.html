			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but from the question it is clear that he did not mean on a linear scale, but in terms of ratio (ie logarithmic) - because as you point out, in linear terms the answer is plainly obvious and would make the question redundant.  If a question can be interpreted in multiple ways, I think it makes sense to assume the OP intended it the way that doesn't make him out to be a fool.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Did you notice the last time you lost a hydrogen atom from your body?  No, of course not, it makes up only ~<a href="http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=volume+of+hydrogen+atom%2Favg+volume+of+human&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank">1x10^-30 th</a> of your body.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out if you compare the volume of the earth to the volume of the known universe it's about <a href="http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=volume+of+earth%2Fvolum+of+universe&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank">3x10^-60 th</a> of the volume.  If we imagined the universe as a person then the disappearance of the earth would be like the disappearance of a particle which is like an atom <em>to an atom</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true in terms of volume, but in terms of mass it's very different.  The ratios are 3x10^-29 vs 2x10^-30, pretty close to each other.</p></div>		</li>
