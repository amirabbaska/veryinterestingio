			<div class="markdown"><p>The hump <em>is the surge</em>.</p>
<p>The winds don't cause the majority of the surge, the surge occurs because the fluid of the ocean water 'desires' to fill the low pressure area of the storm (which is above the normal ocean water level) and in this sense, the ocean water rises as a lump. Winds make the swell above the surge that acts as violent waves on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Mind you, the storm forms as function of the water rising as vapour under certain conditions and becomes a vortex as the different heat and pressure systems interact. Naturally, the ocean is rising in the middle of a hurricane/typhoon/cyclone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the water level of the entire Caribbean is affected? Or the hurricane is sucking water up faster than it can be replaced by water coming in from the rest of the ocean?</p>
<p>I get the low pressure system, what I don't really get is what appears to be the extreme localization of the effect when its in the middle of a much larger body of water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The entire Caribbean is affected (not sure if equally) but it's most noticeable in areas of already shallow water. In some areas there are shelves that are just a few feet deep for hundreds of feet out to sea, so combine the hurricane with a low tide and the affect can be very pronounced. </p>
<p>Side note, the hurricane's storm surge that you hear about is the equal but opposite result of the hurricane's low pressure. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I believe when it comes to areas of such great surface area, it changes like a wave across the water. The water can only &quot;lower&quot; so fast in a given area and it is being &quot;pulled&quot; from a location far away.</p>
<p>Then as the water returns, the same applies. The water will come back slowly, but it has to travel a distance. It wont be like bathtub that appears to rise equally across the surface. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may be wrong, but I don't believe open ocean is going to be affected noticeably.  I suspect any place with a significant change like the picture is going to be a large bay or inlet of some type while the eye of the storm (and thus the storm surge) is near the opening to the ocean.  The water in the inlet cannot be replaced when it's sucked out, so the levels go down.</p>
<p>Edit - the top comment has an edited twitter link that I think confirms that. <a href="https://twitter.com/wxbrad/status/906719579099070465/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/wxbrad/status/906719579099070465/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not entirely sure that the air pressure affects the water that much. What it does affect is the wind direction. Water flows from high to low. Same with with. It goes from high pressure (relative) to the low pressure area. The storm gives a very strong low pressure area for a long stretch of time. So you get an almost permanent wind direction. This affects the water, to some effect, and changes the flow direction on the surface. Add a low tide in the same direction, and there you go. Water flows away and gives land. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it's the wind.</p>
