			<div class="markdown"><p>Had a rather choleric father who would sometimes just be in a bad mood and release it upon wife and us children randomly. He was okay most of the time, but the few times he snapped made it feel like I was a member of a bomb squad who has to be very careful not to cut the wrong wire. Constant walking on eggshells.</p>
<p>I got a stomach drop whenever I heard the little clicking sound that the fuse box near my room made when the motion detector in our driveway made the light go on.
The sound of someone pulling in our driveway.
The sound meant, that my dad was home.</p>
<p>I do not live in this house anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand this feeling.  Before the internet, I had to sneak down to the tv where we had a &quot;payperview&quot; box that showed porn at night.  I developed my ninja skills; stepping without making a sound, memorizing where to step in the dark, heightened auditory senses.  </p></div>		</li>
