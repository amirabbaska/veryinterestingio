			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very true. I kind of hate Taco Bell. I know it's garbage. I know that every time I eat it, I feel bad. But damn if those new commercials don't make their new gimmick food look amazing. So there is am, eating thoroughly mediocre &quot;chicken chips&quot; as my stomach begins to grumble. And I say again &quot;I won't be fooled next time!&quot;. But I know I will, because their advertisements target my lizard brain.</p></div>		</li>
