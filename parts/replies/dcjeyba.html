			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has lower back pain from arthritis and disc issues this is totally true. The best position to lay in is on your back, with a pillow under your legs. It alleviates your back from arching and lays it flat comfortably.
The fetal position helps because it is elongating your spine, allowing your discs room to breath and let the spinal fluid flow openly.
For when you're not sleeping and need a quick relief, &quot;child's pose&quot; is a great yoga position to help with pain momentarily. Also stretching the hamstrings of your legs helps as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I side sleep with a pillow between the knees and another one to spoon.  That takes pressure off the shoulder and keeps the upper back from rounding inward.  I'm really tall so my body is always at acute angles compared to most people, so it just doesn't feel right to sleep without these pillows.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also found these two things beneficial during my current bout of what the doctors think is lumbago. Did not sleep in what's suggested by point two, but did all my tv watching that way :)</p></div>		</li>
