			<div class="markdown"><p>Burbank, CA is where it was developed. Along with other Skunk Works and Lockheed projects (U-2, SR-71, etc.). The whole town relied on aircraft development from Lockheed to flourish during the Cold War. Modern Burbank has a post war nostalgic feel to it. The Empire Center in Burbank  was built on Lockheed's old playing grounds and it even has a flightline theme to it with each parking lot marked with different Lockheed birds as a parking reminder.</p></div>		</li>
