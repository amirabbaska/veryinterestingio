<p>One doesn't often think about concrete being able to cure underwater, but it works perfectly fine, albeit it takes a lot longer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep!  It's worth noting that concrete doesn't dry out when it cures.  A chemical process happens that sets it.  In fact, once its first cured it's still relatively weak and continues to cure and strengthen in the weeks and months following.   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete#Curing" target="_blank">Wikipedia section</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes a common method of pouring concrete pilings is through a pipe submerged in water (or more likely drilling fluid). The concrete flowing to the bottom of the hole displaces the fluid and when it's all finished you just remove a thin layer of diluted/ruined concrete from the top and the rest is fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to pour concrete for smoke stacks at power plants. Basically I was working on crews making the freshly new ones from the ground up. We would sometimes use slip forms (which scared me the most in terms of stress) sometimes and they were basically the type of pours where the form would gradually go up about 1 foot an hour. The forms were no bigger than 5 feet high (constantly going up off a hydraulic system) in a big circle, if you can imagine that. Reading what you just said scares me man. In fact once we were building on an old native american burial ground and we had nothing but problems the whole way through. Set concrete tearing, cables on the cranes snapping, rebar inside the concrete bending ferociously. I never gave it much thought but after your comment I feel veey scared for people who still use slip forms. Usually whats used is a jump form that you fill the form for the day, let it set over night and come in the morning, and pour another 5-6 feet (which just felt safer to me).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was better than stuff that was used before and at beginning of usage of portland cement, but it is not true anymore (unless really low quality) for modern cements and agregates.</p>
<p>Currently there are numerous cements, best known is portland, but industries use many, many types. One of them uses waste slag from metallurgical plants as one of primary components.</p>
<p>Yes, it still is decent material, much could be done with it, but we have much better cements/concretes today.</p>
<p>It would be same as someone saying that steel from 2000 years ago is better than current steel. It is not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any surviving Roman cement is presumably high quality and probably better then the average cement being used today. You always get this disparity between high quality ancient products (the ones which have high enough quality to survive till modern times) and average modern products - which are mostly designed for a specific lifespan.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I see this one all the time with Damascus steel. Yes it was good. No, it's not better than the steel we can make now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The above comments are half right, the other primary reason their concrete was so good is that it lacked reinforcing steel, steel rusts inside modern concrete and flexes and contracts with temperature, those fluxuations become more extreme as the metal deteriorates over long periods of time causing the concrete to crack and break. The steel is neccessary, however for concrete to span basically anything, Roman concrete could never span out the way ours does, but in its own applications the recipe with better ingredients and larger masses under virtually no tension caused them to last insurmountably longer than modern concrete. It's also worth noting we ARE able to use and make the concrete the Romans used, however, like building a house out of carved marble, it's so cost innefficient that you'll likely never see it done. (Because it isn't neccessary anymore, I wish it were)</p></div>		</li>
