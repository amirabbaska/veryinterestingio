			<div class="markdown"><p>Engines combust all the various hydrocarbon molecules that make up gasoline, not just octane. Also, since the molecules that make up gasoline are miscible, once they thawed there would be no real need to mix them up; that would happen on it's own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking about the ambient humidity depositing water into the cold block of gasoline. The water would cause issues with using it effectively.</p>
<p>Though who knows. I do work on other petroleum products and typically leave gasoline alone. When I do freezing point tests, it isn't a reuse scenario. It is a &quot;is this product contaminated in a manner that will allow it to freeze at Arctic conditions.&quot; So I do a qualitative test that is considered a destructive test since the product is not reused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The bigger question is WHY would we want to? What value would there be? What could we learn from it? Hydrocarbon bonds are pretty boring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean I'd love to stick it into an EPR Spectrometer at low temp to take a look. No doubt it'd be neat. My lab has been working on coal samples and they're super cool, no pun intended.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These ultra low temp machines use a cascade refrigeration system. Essentially one refrigeration system is used to super cool a second system. If used in just a freezer type setting there is no additional heat transfer systems, merely the evaporator of the second stage. Most systems now use a mixture of R290 (chemically pure propane) and R508B, this is just in the second stage. Additionally, this super cold refrigerant can be used to chill a low temp liquid which is then pumped through shelves. A popular liquid used is called Syltherm XLT manufactured by DuPont. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The style I am referring to is the one sold by Stirling Ultra Cold. It uses Helium. There are other styles, but this is the one I use in my lab and thus the one I have experience with recently. I know the older freezers use a different tech. But I am not wrong here.</p></div>		</li>
