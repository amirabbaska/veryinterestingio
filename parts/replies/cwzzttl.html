			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting that the desert eagle has a fairly unique action as far as pistols go, it uses a similar gas <del>blowback</del> <em>operated</em> design as a rifle and as far as I know is the only pistol to do so. This could be why the ring shows so clearly with this gun in particular but maybe not with other pistols.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the desert eagle action is gas-<em>operated</em>. <em>Blowback</em> implies that the rearward force of the casing causes the action to cycle, which is not the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cartridges are designed for &quot;average&quot; barrel lengths. Too long or too short are going to be non-optimal.</p>
<p>For a short barrel, a quicker burning powder is optimal (assuming you keep it within pressure parameters), long barrels are better with a slower burning powder.</p>
<p>If you load your own you can tweak it to get the best compromise. If you don't you just have whatever is on the market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because if you've burned all your propellant before the bullet reaches the end of the barrel, then the pressure curve is going to normalize and the bullet won't be accelerating as much towards the end of the barrel. Plus if you put less propellant in, the primer will burn through it more rapidly and the initial pressure curve will be steeper.<br />
Ideally, you want an amount of powder in your cartridge relative to the space it's packed in and the size of your primer that the powder will deflagrate rather than detonate. If you put less in there, it's like a car running with too much air and not enough fuel in it's cylinders, except instead of engine knock or pre-exhaust backfiring potentially throwing a piston through your hood, you get pressure spikes potentially destroying your gun in your hand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the link to &quot;Physics Girl&quot; - that's an awesome video (and series!)  She is asking questions, testing processes, looking for reasons behind results.
She's got the Scientific Method included:  observation, question, hypothesis, experiment, conclusion!</p>
<p>When I was in school, there just weren't girls interested in physics... I'm so happy to see this example presented and perhaps it will encourage more young women to seek out courses in science.</p></div>		</li>
