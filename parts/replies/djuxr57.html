			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, a lot of LEDs that plug into AC (like a bulb) are constantly flickering on/off. Record a video of the light and you can see this effect. They're simply flickering fast enough for you not to notice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The good ones are filtered the eliminate this effect.  The bad ones (see: Christmas lights) are almost unbearable to look at with their 60-130Hz flicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but from I've googled, AM radio is either: Longwave in the 148.5 to 283.5 kHz range, Medium Wave in the 526.5 to 1606.5 kHz range, or Shortwave in the 2.3 to 26.1 MHz range.</p>
<p>WiFi is either in the 2.4 GHz or 5Ghz range.  WiFi, especially the 2.4GHz range is usually more interfered with by microwaves, some home phones, baby monitors, and the like.  Especially the 2.4GHz range ( wireless b/g and some n devices ). </p></div>		</li>
