			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be curious as to the audiology readout of this scenario. Have you seen an audiologist to measure? If you are dampening middle frequencies or pushing overall sound inputs to a lower frequency, then it's possible. Though causing &quot;chronic&quot; sympathetic/fight-flight would depend on the individual, if you feel this way only post blockage, I'd presume that it is a factor at play. Is it a new issue post-blockage?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have a chronic Eustachian tube dysfunction for 2 years (autophony/pressure) and recently some hearing loss due to an unknown cause (tube install briefly improved the issue, but it somehow caused some damage/scarring after 1.5 years, then fell out and the ETD was back)</p>
<p>I don't want to ramble and bore you with the story; but I've felt ever since this started that I'm more on edge because my spacial awareness is weird now, sounds coming in louder or at a different pitch from the other ear. It made me wonder if having a blocked ear can make it feel like a predator is closing in on your from one side, or something like that. </p></div>		</li>
