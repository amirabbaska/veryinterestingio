			<div class="markdown"><p>I was doing a transport for shelter animals once, and one of the cats had had an identical brother whom he hadn't seen in months. Just by chance, this completely-depressed cat had a cage that was half next to a mirror overnight. </p>
<p>Completely different cat in the morning. So much more social and outgoing and had a much healthier appetite too. We'd noticed him playing with the mirror, but were distracted with our other transports (one of whom was, erm, requiring a lot of attention.) Took us a few hours to put it together that he'd seen &quot;his brother&quot; in the mirror and that would explain his behavioral changes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So her sister arrived and to stop the confusion we put the other dogs to my mums so it would be just her and her sister. Yes it was lovely as they played and ran but no broken hearts because whatever she had with her sister she must value what she has here as she was not happy when I made a fuss of her sister or her sister went near her toys. Suppose it's like us with our childhood best friends - we aren't children any more and the memories are much sweeter because we can't go back. She definitely recognised her though and was excited but they'd both changed and weren't pups anymore. It's nice to have closure for her though. </p></div>		</li>
