<p>The $100,000 Salt and Pepper Shaker</p>
<p>Over 35 years ago, when Randy was 12 and his sister 14, their parents took them on a vacation to Disney World.  Towards the end of the vacation, their parents allowed Randy and his sister 90 minutes to explore the park by themselves without being monitored.  They all agreed on a spot to meet.  Randy and his sister wanted to show their appreciation to their parents for the trip and especially allowing them 90 minutes to explore by themselves.  They pooled their allowance money and headed for the nearest Disney gift shop.  They soon found the perfect gift, a ten dollar ceramic Disney salt and pepper shaker featuring two bears hanging off a tree, each one holding a shaker.  Randy and his sister were giddy when they left the store, excited to see their parents faces when they opened the gift.</p>
<p>Minutes later, tragedy struck when Randy accidentally dropped the shaker and it broke on impact. Randy and his sister were in tears.  An adult guest in the park saw what happened and suggested they should take it back to the store. Randy knew it was his fault but he decided to go back to the store not expecting a positive outcome.  After Randy had told the clerk what happened, both Randy and his sister were surprised and delighted when they were told they could get a new shaker.  The Disney employee even apologized to them for not wrapping the shaker appropriately and gave them a new one…no questions asked.</p>
<p>So Why is the Salt &amp; Pepper Shaker worth $100,000?</p>
<p>When Randy’s parents learned of the incident, it really increased their appreciation of Disney World. In fact, that one customer service decision over a ten dollar salt and pepper shaker would end up earning Disney more than $100,000.   That small act of kindness made an indelible mark on Randy’s parents that they would take to a whole other level.</p>
<p>Randy’s parents made visits to Disney World an integral part of their volunteer work.  They had a twenty-two passenger bus they would drive English-as-a-second-language students from Maryland down to see the park.  For more the 20 years, Randy’s dad bought tickets for dozens of kids to see Disney World.  All in all, since that day, Randy’s family has spent more than $100,000 at Disney World on tickets, food and souvenirs! That’s a pretty large return on investment…wouldn’t you say!</p>
<p>Later in his career as a consultant for Disney, Randy would often ask Disney executives this question:</p>
<p>“If I sent a child into one of your stores with a broken salt and pepper shaker today, would your policies allow your workers to be kind enough to replace it?”</p>
<p>Randy stated that “the executives squirm at the question.  They know the answer: Probably not.”</p>
<p>It’s been almost two years since Randy’s death, but I’m sure his family still has that salt and pepper shaker and the memorable story that goes with it!</p>
<p>In the economic environment we find ourselves in…it’s worth noting…the little things really do matter…sometimes more than we know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From Randy Pausch’s book, The Last Lecture. It’s an amazing guide of how to live one’s life written by somebody who was dying of pancreatic cancer.  There are many fascinating stories in the book, (...) to highlight one that struck me with its simplistic message of how interactions, no matter how seemingly small, can have a huge impact on your bottom line.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not a &quot;the customer is always right&quot; policy though. If Randy had gone back into the store shouting about how shitty their salt shakers were, he shouldn't have gotten anything. </p>
<p>I will bend over backwards to ensure that polite customers are satisfied, but the second somebody starts being rude and hostile, I will fight them on any little thing. </p>
<p>It might be bad for business, but rewarding people for being assholes is bad for society. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'll go do whatever I can, to satisfy the customer if they are polite and well mannered, but those that are rude and feel entitled to put you down, I'll just not give a fuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a young'un my parents sent me to the shops to buy a bottle of tomato sauce, because sausages for dinner are nothing without a fair dollop of &quot;dead horse&quot;. Because dinner was already cooking I was in a hurry so I rode my bike the several blocks to the shops.  </p>
<p>After I came out of the grocery store, I realized I had no way of carrying the bottle on my bike, so I slipped it down inside my t-shirt. Except its weight untucked my t-shirt, and the bottle fell straight through and smashed onto the footpath at my feet, coating my feet &amp; legs in tomato sauce and broken glass. Adding to my humiliation was the laughter that erupted from the group of older kids sitting nearby.  </p>
<p>I went back inside the store and was met by an unsympathetic clerk, who may have even been upset that she now had a mess of sauce &amp; broken glass outside her shop to clean up. I had to pay for a second bottle of sauce, then had to explain to my parents why there was so little change left over.  </p>
<p>That was an expensive bottle of sauce.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a front desk agent, I'm faced with this four days a week. I love making customers happy and fulfilling small requests. I get upset if I can't. I truly love giving awesome guests upgrades and discounts.</p>
<p>That being said, 'the customer is always right' model is only used by entitled assholes who enjoy scamming businesses out of their money. It is used to verbally and physically abuse workers in the customer service industry. Because of this problematic creed, people think that it is okay to threaten someones potential livelihood over hair in food: especially if they don't get their way. Why? Because the customer is always right.</p>
<p>I've been in the customer service industry for over two years and have yet to see it used for any other purpose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, and is amplified in today's world of online reviews.  All you need is one &quot;Yelp elite&quot; person to leave a scathing review, and you can lose a significant amount of business, especially if you're in the type of industry where people aren't naturally inclined to leave reviews.  Your average A/C repair place in this town, for example, will have maybe 5 reviews on Yelp.  If one of them is left by an Elite, and is one star with a detailed (and very slanted, obviously) account of how horrible your business is, that can really hurt you.  For a restaurant with hundreds of reviews, the impact may not be as bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yesterday my parents were looking for a place to order in delivery for dinner and they said they were considering a local place but a couple of their reviews were bad, saying the food was of poor quality and that the staff were rude, slow, and unhelpful.</p>
<p>I recalled that I had been in there before and that in my experience, none of those things were true, and convinced them to give the shop a chance. If I didn't happen to be there, those reviews would have dissuaded them, hell if I hadn't been in there before I probably would've been like &quot;oh, okay then.&quot;</p>
<p>The result? The staff were really nice people, the food was great, and it got here pretty damn quick. I don't know what this poor, small business, local restaurant did to piss these couple of people off, but it nearly cost them our patronage for no reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to mention that statistics point toward the abusive customer being a rarity, overall and doing that nice thing for each customer leads to far more in sales and profit than lost revenue.</p>
<p>This was part of customer service training I had at a previous job, where they were trying to break the mindset of thinking that every customer was trying to scam the company (it was Comcast, ICYWW) so I don't have references for the claim, but I do know loyalty can be very strong for customers shown a small act of benevolence </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly right. The vast majority of people in the vast majority of instances are not trying to scam a company out of something, and for those who are it's a difficult to impossible job for line level employees to make that call. This is why most managers and owners have a policy of appeasement. Make them happy because the chances that it's going to be a long run money loser are extremely low. </p>
<p>All that said, if a customer is being verbally abusive, especially repeatedly, any boss worth his salt should step in and assess the situation and consider asking the customer not to return. Low  employee morale also costs money. </p></div>		</li>

<p>In my experience, nothing turns morale sour like feeling the company is hanging you out to dry. Especially if you feel the &quot;right&quot; solution might get you fired.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only comments that actually mattered to the managers were the negative ones, because the negative ones on us made their quarterly bonus go down. The positive comments got them nothing, so they didn't care about those. </p></div>		</li>
