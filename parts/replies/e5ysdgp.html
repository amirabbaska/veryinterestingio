			<div class="markdown"><p>i have some more questions, it would be awesome if you could anwer and give your opinion on some of them!</p>
<p>1) what do submarines actually <em>do</em> most of the time? other from subs with nuclear warheads, what other kinds are there and what do those do?</p>
<p>2) what are the normal depths for various activities, or mission profiles? venting for air is obvious, but what is the &quot;normal&quot; cruising depth, or loitering depth when they are just staying in place, or maximum diving depth?</p>
<p>3) are actual sub vs sub battles a thing, or at least a possibility today?</p>
<p>4) how many people are on the average or the bigger subs? i have the feeling there are quite a lot on each sub, so i'm asking myself, why do you need all those people, steering and navigation, comms and battle stations don't sound like you would need a hundred people for it, no?</p>
<p>5) what is the bandwidth of the ULF comms described in another post? and is it possible to somehow relay transmission from one surfaced sub to another submerged one some distance away?<br />
on the other hand, it should be relatively simple to have buoy with powerful satellite transmission equipment on a line some hundred meters long, so each sub can have good comms capabilities (at least when not cruising too fast).</p>
<p>6) regarding the human factor and keeping the crew sane: i imagine virtual reality devices like the oculus rift and playstation VR could be huge for poeple staying in a tin can for months at a time. do you know if there are any intentions to implement such things? of course the crew can always bring their own equipment. especially with one of those head mounted devices that use you phone as a display.</p>
<p>thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the other person, a lot of these can't be answered precise, but you can Google submarine specs to get what is publicly know.</p>
<p>What do submarines do? Mostly they either watch (or listen) for other things, recon and observations.</p>
<p>For the depths, submarines have a few of them. Actually numbers are classified, but your generally talking hundreds of feet. A sub experiences 14psi of pressure every 30 ft it descends, so 300 ft would be 144psi. The furthest a human has ever gone down bare skined is 1000 ft, at 465 psi. The strongest Bones break at 1700 psi, so a human sinking that far down turns to mush. Design depth, test depth, and crush depth are different classifications of depths for the subs. Design depth is how deep a sub can go based on how it was made, this is the most secret of numbers. Test depth is normally 2/3 of design, and is considered the safest to go down. Crush depth is obviously when a submarine will die. These numbers are usually calculated and rarely tested. WW2 German u boats had a crush depth or 700-900 ft, so you can imagine that newer boats have better numbers.</p>
<p>Subs can fight each other, weapons have gotten smarter and so have the technologies. This isn't really a thing that's done, most subs will normally find and track down each other in war games, but torpedoes are bad enough to kill anything, from a sub to an aircraft carrier. The adcap torpedo is the most commonly used weapon in the western world. You can Google it to find out more.</p>
<p>For the number of ships, a standard deployment is about 120 people. The reason for so many is due to the need of having constant, 24/7 watch rotations. The submarine is always operating, so someone always has to be awake to watch it. Submarines operate on an 6 hour schedule, so every 6 hours someone new is coming onto a watch station. I believe going to 8 hour rotations is a new thing. But the point is, at any given time some 20 odd people have to be on constant watch, with everyone else doing other things at the same time.</p>
<p>I can't really talk to ulf. There's some new research in underwater comms that some college just released, might be worth a good read.</p>
<p>As for vr, I don't know of any plans to implement those kinds of things. Sailors do get off hours, and in those times they can play games or ready books. Space would be the biggest issue to implmenting true vr, a heads up display might be the closet anyone could get. Entertainment is usually up to personal preference. The boat will generally supply a movie system and a library of movies to watch, maybe some gaming consoles and a library of books, but specific entertainment is up to the individual. A lot of game boys are often brought on board.</p>
<p>Anything else I can generally answer, let me know. Most everything I Googled up before writing, so it's definately out there, just gotta know where to look. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thank you! somehow i didn't quite realize that subs are &quot;on mission&quot; all the time. i thought that in times of peace they're just doing... sub-stuff? so thank you for clearing everything up!</p>
<p>i did a bit of research though, and there are a load of interesting things about the whole topic. for example that the water cavitation at the propellers are/were such a problem because of noise, or how early pressurized air powered torpedos left a trail of bubbles that let the target know it's location.</p>
<p>or that nuclear subs leave a trail of rising warm water because of the waste heat from the reactor.</p>
<p>really cool stuff, apart from all the nuclear war stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're asking a lot of top secret questions that a former submariner is definitely not allowed to answer. Most of this is Googleable but still can't be answered by a submariner. I am not in the Navy but know a little from lots of reading. </p>
<p>Today's submarine missions (speaking of the US) is as follow: boomers, attack, and multipurpose. These also use different submarine designs and armament. All US subs are strictly nuclear powered and referred to as nuclear submarines (citation needed). The &quot;boomers&quot; are the primary deterrent to WWIII and are armed with either 12 or 24 (I think) Trident III SLBMs (submarine launched ballistic missile). Each SLBM contains 8(?) 300 kilton nuclear warheads that can attack a target within 12 minutes. Boomers are typically tracked by an &quot;attack&quot; sub from the opposing side (Russian/US/China). The attack sub's sole mission is to track and destroy the boomer sub as soon as possible in the event of that the boomer begins to launch SLBMs with the hope of minimizing friendly deaths. They are <em>always</em> tracking the boomer sub from the other nation and generally pretty close by. Attack subs carry SLBMs, cruise missiles anti ship missiles, and torpedos.  The multi-purpose subs are used to support ground troops and defend carrier groups. They are similar to a destroyer in terms of role but can also be used in an attack mission. </p>
<p>There's certainly more to the story and I definitely have got some wrong information. A couple of important things though: 1) nuclear powered and armed submarines are absolutely necessary to prevent WWIII and likely played a role in the fact that WWIII hasn't yet happened and 2) many of the current submarine capabilities and mission details are kept top secret in order to keep them safe and maintain the nuclear deterrent. </p>
<p>Edit: Heavy disclaimer: I am not a submariner nor have I been in the Navy. I'm just a US citizen fascinated by the subject. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>haha, yeah, i'm gonna jump in my speedos and go sink a couple nuclear subs real quick! :D</p>
<p>thank you for the answers!</p>
<p>i find it so interesting, or even paradoxical seeming, that all that nuclear bomb stuff which everyone is so bloody afraid of is actually what keeps us from actually killing each other.</p>
<p>more and more i come to the conclusion that nuclear power in general is one of the most widely misunderstood technologies, at least as far as i can perceive it right now.</p>
<p>nuclear subs and the concept of mutual assured destruction is keeping us from starting WWIII and killing each other in the millions.</p>
<p>the atom bombs dropped in japan prevented the land invasion opertion downfall and probably millions more of people on both sides.</p>
<p>nuclear power could have provided us with co2-neutral electricity for the last 50 years, making climate change <em>substantially</em> less severe...</p>
<p>humans are weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Common claim as a response to stress changes.</p>
<p>Often, beginning military training is a bit of a culture shock, which leads to stress at first. Stressful situations make everything unsexy. When you're fresh out of high school and hopped up on hormones and suddenly your dick doesn't get as hard and you don't know why, it's a lot easier to blame being slipped something in the food.</p></div>		</li>
