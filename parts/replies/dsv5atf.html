			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean the , if I take amino acid intraworkout drinks, my immune response will be better?

<p>Please someone answer I am very curious about this.</p></div>		</li>

I know that pro hockey players can lose 10 lbs just from getting a flu and are usually out for recovery for longer than you would expect from the disease.</p></div>		</li>
