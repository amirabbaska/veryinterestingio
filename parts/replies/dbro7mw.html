			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely a real theory with much academic backing and research behind it. If you ever hear it getting flack it's because the theory hasn't produced any experimentally verifiable predictions yet. Those tend to come more from experimental physics, naturally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that one of the issues with string theory is that no one has even conceptually designed (the design not being limited to current hardware) a test for the theory?  The person who told me that said since it is untestable, he didn't believe it was science. Is the lack of tests true or false?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, no. The main complaint about it, at least from experimentalists, is that there is <em>nothing that can be tested</em> about ST. Experimenatlists want to test something about the theory to test validity, but they can't because there's no real starting point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the people rushing to complain about it don't understand what quantum gravity is about in the first place, or have an alternative proposal they want to sell you on. The entire <em>question</em> of quantum gravity is only theoretically motivated, and generically expected to be relevant far from current measurements. Dropping string theory as the particular solution doesn't get rid of this problem, so it's unfair to blame it on the theory. Loop quantum gravity and everything else &quot;suffer&quot; in the same way. The difficulty of falsification is a feature of the question, not the answer.</p>
<p>String theory is the most commonly researched theory of quantum gravity by far, though quantum gravity as a whole is a <em>much</em> smaller section of modern physics than pop-sci would suggest. The controversy you're referring to (about the inherent legitimacy of string theory as a scientific pursuit, rather than the obviously unsolved question of its correctness) is largely manufactured and almost <em>solely</em> exists in the popular press. Many of the arguments being made either don't correctly describe how string theory works, or claim that particular features are problematic in string theory but not in their own preferred proposal for vague and unpersuasive reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very well stated. I've always had the same reaction to controversies about the inherent legitimacy of string theory as a scientific pursuit - it  really seems like a ridiculous argument for the non-legitimacy of anything, IMO - but I could never articulate that as well as you did.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think that's true at all. QG is very much empirically motivated as well, although theorists have even more motivation for it than experimentalists because it would help resolve some interesting questions (e.g. black holes, how <em>do</em> they work?). So I think it's more fair to say that theorists just have a bigger stake in QG.</p>
<p>Theorists are also interested in QG because they pretty much have to be. That's just been the general trend in fundamental physics. If you don't have a good fundamental theory you're working off of then it becomes almost impossible to know what to even look for. That's why things like the standard model, GR/SR, and so on were all the playground of theoretical physicists for a good while before experimentalists could really go and play with it.</p>

<p>Again, I don't really think this is true. If anything, the press <em>massively</em> understates the divide and makes it seem like <em>everyone</em> and their mother thinks that ST is the be-all, end-all of physics when that's not nearly the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a bit hard to answer that question precisely, because the opinion of string theory varies <em>drastically</em> depending on who you ask, even within the physics community (hell, even within the theoretical physics community). For example, my senior project advisor in college was a theoretical physicists (theoretical physics is best physics!) did a lot of work in string theory and he thought that it was the future of physics. Conversely, a lot of the experimentalists in the physics department (read: most of the physics department) saw it more as an interesting oddity. Some experimentalists don't like it because they are...well, experimentalists, and they want experimental confirmation, and ST simply isn't at a a point where that's possible so they look at it with very . And then you have people like quantum loopers, the biggest competitors of STers in the quantum gravity field...yeah, never put a QLer and an STer in a room, there <em>will</em> be blood.</p>
<p>A big problem for ST is that even within the physics community, rather few people understand or even know much about ST. It's a hyper specialized field, and even then, it's a hyper specialized field within an already specialized field (theoretical physics). Hell, there might be more mathematicians who work on ST than physicists (and, in fact, this is a criticism I've heard of it from physicists, especially experimentalists, that ST is more mathematics than it is physics).</p>
<p>As a whole, I would say that ST is seen by the physics community as being a very interesting, very useful, very powerful set of tools but also one that needs a <em>lot</em> more work put into it. And this isn't really that surprising to be perfectly honest. This is the way it's been since Ed Witten (the most brilliant man you've never heard of) near single-handedly brought ST back from the dead in the 80s (I think it was the 80s, at least). Even Brian Green, probably the most vocal and popular of string theorists  concedes this.</p>
<p>Thing is, it's not really as much of a problem as a lot of people, especially those outside of physics, prop it up as being. String theory is <em>still</em> a model in development. It's nowhere near done, and pretty much no one in the field has ever suggested that it was anywhere near done.</p>
<p>tl;dr: The physics community is rather divided about ST, but one could make a good argument that a good chunk of the community sees it as interesting and potentially true, but that a <em>lot</em> of work still needs to be put into it to really make it worthwhile and testable and useful.</p></div>		</li>
