			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a friend who is freakishly photogenic. All her pictures turn out great. It's a bit sad because it winds up looking like her more attractive sister in all those prints. I joke to her that the pictures are showing her inner beauty. She's a sweet girl, just cursed with photogenics that make her photos look little like her. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that's true, I suppose. But that wasn't really my intention. These tips are generally applicable, and I know there are photo comparisons of these principles applied to skinny models.</p>
<p>Actually, to be a bit pedantic about it, these are generally more for portraits, as they require a bit wider frame of view than selfies typically provide. Also, I left out the commonly employed downward angle trick.</p></div>		</li>
