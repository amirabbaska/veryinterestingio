			<div class="markdown"><p>In more detail, I think the Jurassic World movies have missed one thing in particular that made the original Jurassic Park valuable for science communication and science fiction: wonder. The two films are basically monster movies that happen to have dinosaurs in them, without any of the quiet moments that remind you that the dinosaurs are ANIMALS.</p>
<p>I gotta admit, the ending to Fallen Kingdom sets up what could be the best movie yet. There is so much potential for an engaging ecological story with dinosaurs representing out-of-control invasive species. If they go with the action+intelligent science commentary that made the original so special, they could finally recapture the magic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jennifer Nestler: My favorite part of this critique is that it's not at all about scientific inaccuracies! It's more about what science fiction could do (inspire people, make them think, create a sense of wonder) and what happens when you're essentially watching an action movie with (non-avian) dinosaurs. To that end, it's kind of a bummer that the Jurassic World movies are seriously lacking in paleontologists!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jennifer Nestler: The Jurassic Park movies are what they are. They're science fiction, and they're meant to be fun. I'm perfectly willing to suspend disbelief and enjoy a silly movie.</p>
<p>I love that the movies can make people more interested in paleontology, with the caveat that I want to see them interested in the science, too. If science fiction or fantasy can be a gateway to get people interested in science, I'm here for it.</p>
<p>On a related note, several of us here play the Jurassic World Alive game. There are aspects of it that actually really remind me of real-world science. Collecting coins and all that is... not unlike having to write grants to fund research. Frustrated that you can't level up that creature? Time to secure funding! Spending time looking for specimens is kinda similar to fieldwork and collecting data. It's also clear that someone put a ton of effort into researching different taxa. There are some pseudosuchians that I really enjoy seeing. :) The only thing that I don't love are the hybrids. I think it's too easy to confuse them with the actual, super cool taxa in the game. But I recognize that it's just that: a game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Matt here: I will say that I am more annoyed at the genetic questions raised by the Jurassic World movies than I am at the paleo ones. Jurassic Park introduced a massive audience to the concept of DNA and genetic engineering. I don't know how much people would care about genetically modified food and designer babies without Jurassic Park giving us all a primer. Genetic research has accelerated at an incredible pace, and Jurassic World did nothing to explore the implications of genetic manipulation given the new tools - like CRISPR - that have been discovered. We need a larger dialogue about the ethics of deexctinciton and gene therapy. Jurassic World cold have entertained, and started some of that discussion...but it totally whiffed and they decided to make a Godzilla movie followed by a haunted house flick. Bummer.</p></div>		</li>
