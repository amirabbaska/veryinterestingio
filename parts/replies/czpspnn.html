			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd chock that up to the nature of your taste palette. Certain foods compliment other foods and mix well, others can clash and provide horrible results, while still others can negate certain flavors entirely, or dull them. You may find certain documentaries about food science and the nature of taste interesting, although I don't remember any specific names off the top of my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But compliment is when the flavor says, &quot;Hello, you're looking fine today! May I join you?&quot; and they tip their hats amicably, and hold hands and frolic down into your stomach, where they're burned horrifically by acids and eventually buried in a standing pool of water.</p>
<p>I don't fuss over English much. I try to remember how exactly some words are spelled, but it isn't my first language and I may forget that the bailer and the baler who talked to the bailor, who talked to the bailee outside of the bailey were beaten badly by a bailie, but who I meant was the bailor was the baler, and the baler was actually the bailer, because English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know some wines go good with meat because tannin in the wine that normally binds to your saliva, which causes a dry sensation, will then bind to meat proteins that are still left in your mouth. </p>
