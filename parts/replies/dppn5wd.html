			<div class="markdown"><p>My father mentioned that he loved FM in the early days because he could get a clear signal. After the frequency band was moved to the current range he said his reception sucked even though he could step out of his house and see the transmitter's antenna a few miles away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's when the transmission is between two specific fixed points (as opposed to something like your car radio that is mobile).</p>
<p>It's significant because when the stations are fixed you can have multiple systems using the same frequency with no risk of them interfering with each other since they will always be in different locations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its very static (no pun intendid), as in only one broadcast can be in each slot. so it does genuinely need to be ordered, and this is done by regulations. regulations in the UK back in 2012 decided I can't use my old wireless radio mics in the 860ish range, but now we got 4G signal or DTV in that spectrum. If you try and talk on those old frequencies then phones could get drowned out by the microphones and stop working.</p>
<p>But because its all managed, everyone knows whats up, wifi router manufacturers know to use 2.4ghz and 5, i know to buy 660ish wireless radios in the future and BBC Radio 2 is (sings) <em>Eighty-eight to ninety-on FM, BeeBEECEEE RADIO TWOOOO.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the 1920s, basically yes. The set up of the FCC set rules and stricter licensing. </p>
<p>Other countries set up their own radio regulation agencies. Many through their Post Office, because they had a monopoly on communication, and they didn't want anything to diminsih their  business.</p></div>		</li>
