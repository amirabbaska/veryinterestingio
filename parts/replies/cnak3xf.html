			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of the opposite. The CMB is distributed everywhere in the Universe,so it is the local rest frame in which we are all moving. So when we measure the velocity at which distant galaxies are receding away from us, we are really measuring the expansion rate of <em>their</em> local spacetime away from us. The individual motion of that distant galaxy relative to the CMB rest frame is a small correction added to that dominant expansion velocity. For example, I said our galaxy is moving at 15,000,000,000 km per yearrelative to the CMB. That is .002 ly per year of velocity. So a distant galaxy would see us moving away from it at the expansion rate of the universe plus or minus .002 ly per year, which is a very small correction on the overall expansion.</p></div>		</li>
