			<div class="markdown"><p>The fastest spacecraft we have right now leaving the solar system is Voyager 1 at around 17 km/second. That speed translated to light years per year is around 5X10^-5 ly/year, or 1 light year in around 20,000 years. Based off the planet frequencies from Kepler we think that the closest habitable-zone planet is probably within around 15 light years of us. That'll take around 300,000 years, and we need to find that planet first.</p>
<p>For the planets that Kepler is actually finding, the closest of these are still tens of light years away, and most are more like a few hundred light years away, so now we're talking millions of years or more with current technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to ask which would happen first: exoplanetary exploration, or (near) light speed travel. I suppose your previous reply answers that one. </p>
<p>Is there any sort of estimate as to when we could depart? Like a break even point at which the early start would overcome any subsequent technological advances in space travel?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A big part of advancing space travel will probably be tied to our extraterrestrial (hehe) industrial capacity. Launching stuff from Earth requires plenty of energy expenditure to counteract both Earth's gravity and its atmosphere. Being able to launch spacecraft from orbit would be a huge step forward. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, that requires the ability to at least be able to assemble large craft in space, as well as store things such as fuel and life support supplies. Launching things into space is still expensive, which makes it tough to envision sending heavy manufacturing machinery in space. Geopolitically, it will be hard to convince other superpowers to let whoever plans this to have an orbital launch facility due to the military implications. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was recently a widely-publicized proposal to build space probes to visit Alpha Centauri within ~40 years (~20 years to build, ~20 years to fly). If you take that seriously, visiting a planet 15 light years from here might be &quot;only&quot; ~100 years away.</p>
<p>But what are the prospects for finding that planet, given only ~.5% of planets have their orbits aligned well enough for transit photometry? Is there some way to do a complete survey of nearby systems?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For nearby stars, you can also look for planets by direct imaging, potentially (actually imaging the planet directly, if it's far enough from the star that it's not hidden in glare entirely), or by monitoring the star to see if it either wobbles towards us and away from us as the planet orbits it (Radial velocity method) or if it wobbles back and forth in the sky (astrometry)</p></div>		</li>
