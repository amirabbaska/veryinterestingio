			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, obviously we would shimmy back down the ladder and hook a small 2&quot; duct as long as the cord to the back of the dryer and just have that motor pull air up from down here. </p>
<p>C'mon man. There's problem finders and problem solvers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>would that actually just suck all the air off earth surface into the vacuum (around) the moon? <del>If so.. probably don't need the hairdryer and power cord...</del> [Edit: heat. But question re vacuum (without dryer) serious if anyone knows..]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect it would not. If you imagine that the atmosphere in the tube would get thinner and thinner at the same rate as the earths atmosphere, it would be a vacuum by the point it reaches the hairdryer. The fan would just spin and move nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, gravity would pull the air down. If you stick a straw in a milkshake it doesn't spontaneously suck the milkshake up right? Same principle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect no more than the vacuum of space pulling away the earths atmosphere. But using a tube may change things - like a siphon maybe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eye level should be sufficient right? i mean, its 0,8 gravities, and no air to slow it down...</p>
<p>Edit: you also need a hard floor/rock.</p></div>		</li>
