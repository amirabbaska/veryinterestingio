			<div class="markdown"><p>I added this to another comment, but I'm adding it here too because this is the best base comment:</p>
<p>I want to clarify that popularity alone doesn't fully explain the phenomenon. Physically, there's plenty of room (both horizontal and vertical) for more homes to be built. San Francisco and the entire peninsula have a housing shortage because the cities consistently vote against allowing more housing to be built.</p>
<p>This happens for a few reasons. There's a large number of people who moved to the peninsula in the 70's and earlier who find Silicon Valley's success very inconvenient -- the pitchforks come out any time anyone proposes building an apartment complex. They're the only ones who show up at town hall meetings and they're practically the only ones who vote on local issues. They constrain supply such that only tech workers and people who bought homes a long time ago can afford to live here.</p>
<p>By contrast, tech workers don't vote in local elections. They mostly didn't grow up here and have bonded more with their companies than with their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Palo Alto hasn't built <del>a new apartment complex since the 70's</del> many apartment complexes, and it's not for lack of demand. They're not allowed. Huge swaths of homes now aren't even allowed to build a second story.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, they've attempted to address affordability with rent control and low-income housing. This solves a short-term problem for some people (people who have been around a long time, and low-income people who win a 1-in-1000 lottery, respectively), but it's also added to the coalition of people who come out against every proposed development. Were those people paying market-rate rents, they'd be interested in increasing housing supply. As it stands, they're shielded from market reality and vote down anything that might change their neighborhood.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Housing supply is artificially constrained by politics.</p>
<p>Edit: I was wrong about there not being any new apartment complexes. Still, there are fairly few.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Houston TX (where I live) is a perfect counterexample from the opposite end of the spectrum. There is no, repeat no, zoning whatsoever in this city of 4M people. Endless development in all directions as far as the eye can see. (And, for what it's worth, Houston is also a &quot;cluster city&quot; for the petroleum industry.)</p>
<p>End result... you can buy a brand new 3500 sqft house here for around $300k. 2 bedroom starter homes easily can be found in the 100k-150k range. I bought my first home at age 23 and made it a 4 bedroom just in case I wanted to expand the family later on.</p>
<p>Note: Dont get me wrong, all things being equal I'd rather live in Cali, but Houston has all the amenities of a major metro, and many people love it.</p>
<p>EDIT: My 4M number was mistaken, Per Wikipedia, the population of Houston is 2.2M; the metro area is 6.5M.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Calgary, Alberta which is Canada's cluster city for the oil and gas industry.  Zoning is tightly regulated here, as one doesn't want a factory built next to a suburban area.  Is that an issue in Houston?  City council is also very strict when it comes to building new communities as the main concern here is urban sprawl.  The further out that you build communities, the more infrastructure needs to be built.  Think roads, sewage, waste disposal, transit, all of which increase property taxes for everyone.  Not to mention the further out that you build, the more people that you have driving into the city, and congesting existing roads that were never meant to handle that level of traffic.  Now because of city council's reluctance to build new communities too quickly, this has (in the past now) caused housing prices here to soar relatively speaking when compared to the rest of the country.  A typical home with 3-4 bedrooms here, and 1400 sq-ft will run you $450-500k.  With the price of oil going down now however, that is changing, and quite rapidly I might add.  Within the next couple of years, we may see prices come down $150k I'm hoping.  I do plan to buy a house in the near future when the prices are right, and if I still have a job in this city! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Palo Alto has been less than welcoming to any notion of &quot;affordable&quot; housing as well. At one point a local ordinance was specifically aimed at a particular population of homeless who were living in cars and campers, and there have been some horrifyingly callous attitudes expressed toward the residents of a local mobile home park who are losing their homes. I guess that's one result when a typical 50's 3/2 ranch house goes for close to $2 million.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reasons businesses cluster is the subject of a whole field of study called agglomeration economics.</p>
<p>Why there are advantages to agglomerating is a subject of hot dispute - is it access to workers, access to other companies' secrets, access to shared service industries, all of the above in equal measure?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration</a></p>
<p>It's a super fascinating area because governments often try to create &quot;clusters&quot; of certain kinds of industries in certain places, but it is rarely successful. If we could work out how agglomeration economics really work, communities might be better able to shape the economies of their local areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a tech worker, the largest factor that I find relevant is heavy competition. Where opportunity is rife, people compete for positions at the same companies.

<p>to elaborate: stanford pivoted themselves to get a lot of DoD research $ in early electronics. a lot of the early hardware came out of stanford-affiliated labs, and that's how this particular business cluster started. The silicon valley has been around for 50+ years, and facebook is just the most recent iteration of the hardware/software companies that settle here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To put it in example. </p>
<p>Suppose you are selling mangoes on the beach. Now there are two sellers of mangoes on the entire beach. So if you decide to equally space and put 100 meters between each other, what happens. ? If the other guy decides to sell his mangoes for $1 less than you, word will go round and everyone will go to buy his mangoes be sure they are cheaper. Or, 1000 customers could come from his direction and he will sell all his mangoes before they get to you, or vis versa.</p>
<p>Now if you do the same, he might decide to sell his at $1.50 even cheaper. his mangoes might be bigger and juicier. So gradually you will both be attracted closer and closer to each other so that you can keep an eye out for each other's quality, price and standards eventually realizing that it is better for both businesses if you sell both your mangoes at the same spot. Then the oranges guy will also be attracted to where the mangoes are because there might be someone who wants mangoes AND oranges or a mango intolerant one who is allergic to mangoes. Eventually you get a market. That is why at the mall or you need businesses of the same kind clustered in the same area. A centralized area where all players can sell mangoes oranges or bananas and enjoy the benefits that a single business would not</p></div>		</li>
