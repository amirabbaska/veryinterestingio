			<div class="markdown"><p>Chlick
The short, sharp clicking “Chk” sound that one makes out of the side of one’s mouth by rapidly sucking air into the space between the teeth and the side wall of the mouth. Usually accompanied by something of a wink and (less often, but significantly) by a thumb/index finger mock-pistol engaged in firing. The Chlick is most commonly used to emphasize an odd point that the Chlicker just made.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a beautiful place and I'd love to go back (Kona coffee ftw), but damn I can't imagine paying that much for food.  I totally get why it's that way, I just don't think I could deal with it lol</p></div>		</li>
