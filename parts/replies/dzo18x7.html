<p>Likewise some Christian denominations do not believe in swearing or oath-taking and aslo affirm/attest rather than swear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus was pretty clear on it if you take the gospels as... well... gospel.  If you're a Christian you don't swear oaths or you're &quot;the evil one&quot;.</p>
<p>Matthew 5:34-37:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne; nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.  Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.  But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’ For whatever is more than these is from the evil one.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't say that you're the evil one if you do so, instead I'd interpret it as saying that the impulse to add more than 'Yes' or 'No' and to swear is what's said to be from the evil one.</p></div>		</li>
