			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you in the US, perhaps? I've only ever seen 99.9% for sale in the UK. It's ridiculously cheap and easily available, so why pay similar money for a less pure product? You can dilute 99.9% down to whatever you want, but you can't 'un-dilute' 70%. Hence my automatic suggestion to dilute 2 parts to 1. I love how I got downvoted for a perfectly valid solution (pun intended). :p</p></div>		</li>
