			<div class="markdown"><p>This is way late but to add to your other replies yes quantum mechanics is what you are missing. And quantum mechanics demonstrates that particles can have wave-like aspects. One can think of an electron as being in a kind of standing wave around the proton instead of orbiting/accelerating around it. </p>

<p>That has some good graphics and explanation. Importantly a standing wave does not lose energy as long as there is no friction and there is perfect reflection at end nodes. This is the case for the standing wave picture of the electron. It also explains why there are energy levels: they are just the discrete higher harmonics of the wave!</p></div>		</li>
