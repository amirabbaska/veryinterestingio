<p>Related: it's the same reason why can we see through fog at near distance, as if it almost isn't even there, but the longer the distance, the &quot;thicker&quot; the fog becomes, and the less you can see through it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same for the sky.</p>
<p>&quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Because air is blue.&quot;</p>
<p>Just like a single plastic bag is clear but a roll is silver, air is just a little bit blue. It takes a lot of air to see it. </p>
<p>If you're talking to a young kid, there's no need for rayleigh scattering etc. If you've got a roll of sandwich bags nearby you can even use it as an example!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, except when the sun sets.  At which point, you do need a scattering explanation since the angle of the sun means light is diffused through a thicker cross section of the atmosphere, reddening the hue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty deceptive compared to what is actually happening though... Rayleigh scattering isn’t the same as “being” that color...</p>
<p>In the atmosphere, if you look through more and more of it directly (like the plastic bags), it actually looks <em>red</em> (like the sunset which has its light passing through more atmosphere), since the blue portion of the spectrum has been scattered out along the way. The blue that is scattered out from the light passing though the atmosphere “up” above you during the day is why the “sky” looks blue from that perspective.</p>
<p>Its not that air itself is blue or red, air separates the colors so that you see preferentially different colors depending on how you are observing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The modern day orange carrot wasn’t cultivated until Dutch growers in the late 16th century took mutant strains of the purple carrot and gradually developed them into the sweet, plump, orange variety we have today.  Before this, pretty much all carrots were purple with mutated versions occasionally popping up including yellow and white carrots.  These were rarely cultivated and lacked the purple pigment anthocyanin.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

Its also a man invented fruit,(we mixed weird  green grape fruit things with tangerines.. which are orange but the resultant fruit was green) it only turns orange, because its too cold in florida. And really orange color is only from cold damage.(yeah florida isnt cold but oranges are subtropical and think florida is a bit chily)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It totally depends on the pigmentation. </p>
<p>Looking at ground up ultramarine blue under the microscope, or iron oxide red (hematite), the colour will still be extremely vibrant, as the inorganic minerals produce visible colour due to energy transitions inside the dense individual molecules/crystals/unit. If you look at it without a microscope, the colour can vary or look pale due to what is called the streak property. </p>
<p>Looking at a slice of an organic material with an organic colorant or dye, the colour is much more dilute most of the time, since the material has a lot less of the elements creating the energy transitions. A carrot has a lot more in there than molecules producing energy transitions which make us register the orange colour. </p>
<p>There are other properties which affect colour power as well...the elements which are creating the transition, as mentioned above  the thickness of what you are looking at, the power of the microscope, etc. </p></div>		</li>
