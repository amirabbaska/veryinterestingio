			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'm not even sure that &quot;cliché&quot; is the word I would use, so much as &quot;symbol&quot;.  Cinema, like any form of theatre, is largely symbolic.  We have a vocabulary of these symbols and use them to tell a story.  </p>
<p>Some other examples of such symbols, that are not so much attached to the sound <em>per se</em> would be things like the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlowClap" target="_blank">slow clap</a> or the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" target="_blank">rousing speech</a>, things that don't happen, at least not often, in that form in real life, but are great for making a story more engaging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These symbols are called <em>tropes</em> and there’s <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomePage" target="_blank">a whole wiki dedicated to tropes in TV, movies, literature, video games, comics and much more</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. A trope is just a recurring theme or technique. He's saying that over-the-top sound effects are kind of shorthand cues that tell the viewer something. They may also be tropes, but they aren't <em>called</em> tropes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Slow Clap has be proven to be truth in TV.  It's based on the psychology of people not wanting to be the ONLY one clapping, but as more people join it, it becomes less socially awkward to join in.  So that first slow-clap sets the precedence, paving the way for a steady increase in accepting clapping as an appropriate response. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's about conveying a feeling, not a real life scenario.  The goal is for the audience to <strong>feel</strong> like they are in the fight, not for it to simply sound like they are there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% with you on that.  A good story helps, of course, and if you are able to successfully induce a suspension of disbelief in the audience, then they won't notice that the sound effects are fiction, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I daresay some of that would be the sound of the puncher's knuckles breaking.</p>
<p>But yeah, bone on bone would make a crack. That &quot;doosh&quot; sound, though... less likely.</p></div>		</li>
