			<p>I think its a case of them thinking the audience is expecting it.<br><br>Me for myself am always annoyed and bored by the obviously fake and similar sound effects used in so many movies</p>		</li>

			<p>I think a movie that did sound effects REALLY well was Jack Reacher. The gunshots had such impact, as there was only silence, a shot, and then an echo. <br><br>Even his fight scene seemed to have realistic punch sounds, that is, it was a dull &quot;thud&quot;.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, I'm not even sure that &quot;cliché&quot; is the word I would use, so much as &quot;symbol&quot;.  Cinema, like any form of theatre, is largely symbolic.  We have a vocabulary of these symbols and use them to tell a story.  <br><br>Some other examples of such symbols, that are not so much attached to the sound <em>per se</em> would be things like the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlowClap" target="_blank">slow clap</a> or the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" target="_blank">rousing speech</a>, things that don't happen, at least not often, in that form in real life, but are great for making a story more engaging.</p>		</li>

			<p>These symbols are called <em>tropes</em> and there’s <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomePage" target="_blank">a whole wiki dedicated to tropes in TV, movies, literature, video games, comics and much more</a>.</p>		</li>

			<p>Not really. A trope is just a recurring theme or technique. He's saying that over-the-top sound effects are kind of shorthand cues that tell the viewer something. They may also be tropes, but they aren't <em>called</em> tropes.</p>		</li>

			<p>As with Cinema Sins, criticizing or recognizing the tropes and failings of a work does not mean you don't like or enjoy it.  In many ways, recognition and study of tropes is a way of enjoying creative works on more than just the superficial level.  Sometimes it's a way of defining and identifying aspects of a medium you REALLY like, or REALLY DON'T like.  Tropes like the &quot;Power Trio/Knight, Knave and Squire/Big, Thin, and Short&quot; which is a phenomenon caused by a combination of limited attention span of the audience and the amount of time it takes to tell a story.  For works with more than 5 important people, you'll often have groups broken up into five or less distinct groups.  Example from Lord of the Rings:<br><br>Group 1: Frodo and Sam, later Gollum (spoilers).  <br><br>Group 2: Merry and Pippin,<br><br>Group 3: Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas.<br><br>When they were in a group together (with Boromir), Frodo and Sam essentially comprise a single character (Squire), Merry and Pippin are a second (The Knave) until the groups split (possibly after).  Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas form the third (The Knight).  When the group splits, Aragorn is Big, Legolas is Thin, and Gimli is a Dwarf (they also work for a male form of Brains, Beauty, and Brawn).<br><br>As stated on the TV Tropes website, &quot;On the whole, tropes are not clichés. The word clichéd means 'stereotyped and trite.' In other words, dull and uninteresting. We are not looking for dull and uninteresting entries. We are here to recognize tropes and play with them, not to make fun of them.&quot;<br><br>If you create, you play with tropes, whether consciously or not.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah even reading that was terrible. It's attempting to shoehorn every possible thing into tiny little categories and create an infinite number of those categories so nothing is left out. It's <em>really</em> kind of sad and terrible. <br><br>It's like finding spreadsheets fun because you gave each column an interesting name. </p>		</li>

			<p>It's a bit more than a spreadsheet with interesting column names.<br><br>Some people like swimming, and learn how to swim better, and eventually take fun from mastering both the technical side of swimming as well as the practical(/physical) side of it.  Such people may become Olympic athletes, swimwear designers, or swim instructors, or may simply continue with their casual swimming.  The same goes for someone with a love of Lego that grows to encompass engineering, architecture, or design.  Playdoh to sculpture, clay-work, or (by learning to make their OWN Playdoh) chemistry.<br><br>You can happily watch movies and enjoy them on the basic level of an audience member, without ever learning about tropes beyond the most obvious clichés.  That's not everybody.  Some people see the something behind the movies and into the design.  Maybe seeing a bad movie made them start to wonder about the choice of cameras, leading to a love of cinematography.  Perhaps poor editing of a book made them wonder about certain plot choices.  It's possible that a childish attempt to ape their favorite comics fell flat even in their own mind, and they're interested about the why's and how's.  Some people are naturally curious all on their own.<br><br>Tropes aren't always used consciously, or intentionally; sometimes use of tropes forms organically.  This doesn't disqualify them, as they can still be used as a key to observe, study, and learn from works of art (i.e. the Hero's Journey, intended for comparison, not as a road map).  If you don't like it, fine.  Some people like their spreadsheets and play Eve Online, or take up accounting, or whatever.  Some people don't.  It doesn't make them or their activities terrible, it merely makes them different, and unpalatable to you.</p>		</li>

			<p>that's way, way too many words to defend the most egregiously spreadsheet-y of nerd culture, dudebro. <br><br>Every time I ever call something nerdy or man childish on reddit someone way too into it thinks the appropriate response to convince me otherwise is a thousand word essay explaining the nuances that fundamentally strengthens my convictions.<br><br>TV Tropes is dumb as shit. </p>		</li>

			<p>I can address that.<br><br>You don't understand TV Tropes.  It's not your thing.  Rather than saying &quot;Not me, bro,&quot; and casually moving on, you make a beef of it unnecessarily.  You attack it because, on some level, you feel threatened by it.  It's not dumb, it's just something you don't understand or care for.  <br><br>The classy move is to move along and focus on things you like.  Try to stay classy in the future; it gets you farther socially and psychologically, and attracts a better grade of people around you who hold similar interests to you.</p>		</li>

			<p>The Slow Clap has be proven to be truth in TV.  It's based on the psychology of people not wanting to be the ONLY one clapping, but as more people join it, it becomes less socially awkward to join in.  So that first slow-clap sets the precedence, paving the way for a steady increase in accepting clapping as an appropriate response. </p>		</li>

			<p>It's about conveying a feeling, not a real life scenario.  The goal is for the audience to <strong>feel</strong> like they are in the fight, not for it to simply sound like they are there. </p>		</li>

			<p>100% with you on that.  A good story helps, of course, and if you are able to successfully induce a suspension of disbelief in the audience, then they won't notice that the sound effects are fiction, too.</p>		</li>
