			<div class="markdown"><p>You say that but I bet I could get 99.9% compliance within 6 months with these three simple changes, number 2 will shock you:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Have every government agency that does inspections of businesses check for this.  The workplace safety people, the IRS, the food safety inspectors, any time a government employee goes into a business they want a log of all employees and proof of entitlement to work, and they spot check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a bounty for reporting employers that violate the rules (10% of fines levied for example).  Any disgruntled ex employee, ex-wife, pissed off contractor or supplier, now has a financial incentive to report you.</p>
</li>
<li>Give illegals an incentive to self report.  For example if you were being paid less than minimum wage and are moving back to Mexico, or you just naturalized, you report the employer and get back wages due you to top up your salary.  </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue here isn't that vetting every employee is difficult but rather there's only so much you can actually vet.  </p>
<p>I'm a business owner who checks that a SS# is valid and the potential employee looks like the picture in his or her government issued ID but that's about all I can do.  It's not like I can ask people to pee into a cup and determine definitively that they're in the country legally.  </p></div>		</li>
