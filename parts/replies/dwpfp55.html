			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on this excellent post: </p>
<p>Maintenance procedures are then put in place based on part lifetime and life cycles. At certain hour or cycle milestones parts will be replaced, inspections will be conducted, etc. Different levels of maintenance are more in depth and some essentially equate to rebuilding part of the plane. </p>
<p>We are very good at this, which is why something like structural failure of a passenger airliner is essentially unheard of in modern aviation. Pilot error, computer problems, icing, fires, etc are all much more likely to ever cause an issue than some turbulence. </p></div>		</li>

Agreed it’s not an airframe structural failure, still a significant failure to reach the designed lifespan. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are reeaallly good in calculating mechanical failures and different influences on mechanical failure like surface roughness or scratches during assembly and whatnot, but chemical attacks like hot corrosion is one of the few attacks we cannot model that well, or at least not as good as mechanical failure. Luckily airframes don't experience that much agressive corrosive environments.  </p>
<p>Where our modelling fail us is more conservative approaches and more experience is needed.<br />
Edit: Some grammar</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except for pilot error. Turns out people are the most significant part of the risk equation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s very accurate. To add to this, most parts that can be inspected are designed with a very accurate knowledge of fracture mechanics, rather than the fatigue life paradigm:</p>
<ul>
<li>you assume you have undetectable cracks (so small your inspections can’t find them)</li>
<li>you know a crack’s <em>critical length</em> on a specific part (when the crack becomes too big for the part to be safe, or when the crack becomes unstable and just keeps growing until no material is left)</li>
<li>based on load spectra (from tests, measurements and statistics) and fracture mechanics data (da/dN curves and the like), you have an estimate of the rate of growth of a crack for a typical flight cycle/flight time</li>
<li>you then set an <strong>inspection interval</strong> so that a small crack (not detectable) will not grow above the <em>critical length</em> in between two inspections</li>
<li>adjust for safety (e.g. probability of non detection during inspection) </li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With regards to the Aloha Flight 243 failure, my understanding is that a passenger actually SAW the crack with her bare eyes before the flight but had not told anyone, assuming that the airline was aware.</p>
<p>If you can visually see a crack on the external fuselage near where the passengers board, how should one handle that?  I assume tell the crew, but would one expect ANY visible crack to be seen at boarding level?  Would there ever be an acceptable visual crack at that location?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell no. A crack isn't that visible unless the structure is loaded, and even then you can barely see them unless you know very well what you are looking for. Or you use specialist tools and techniques, which is what happens during maintenance.</p>
<p>If a crack was visible by a passenger and what the passenger saw was a crack, it must have been huge.</p></div>		</li>
