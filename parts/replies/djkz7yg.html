<p>So, what happens when a glow stick no longer glows? Has the chemical reaction just finished?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the reaction has reached equilibrium and there is no more light produced. You can actually drive the reaction backwards by sticking it in the freezer and it will glow again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did see a tritium-based watch a few years ago. It made the arms of the clock light up just enough to be visible in the dark. So I guess this is not completely abandoned yet.</p></div>		</li>
