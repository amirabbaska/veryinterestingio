			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a large misunderstanding of the suns gravity.  In my mind, the sun should pull an object toward it and going to Pluto the object would be fighting that gravity.  Like the funnel thing but the sun is the bottom?  Can you tackle that one?  Analogies are great if you have more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Sun is pulling everything in the solar system towards it, but because every planet is moving at such a high speed (the Earth is orbiting the sun at 107.000 km/h), instead of falling into it, we are &quot;missing&quot; the planet and constantly &quot;falling&quot; around it. The same is the case with Earth's moon and the International Space Station constantly &quot;falling&quot; around the Earth. </p>
<p>If we were to mount some absolutely gigantomaniac rocket engines to the Earth and fire in the opposite direction of the way we are orbiting to bring ourselves to a stop, we would immediately start falling into the Sun and burn up (so let's not do that, even if such rockets existed). If we fired those same engines just a little bit, but in the same direction as we are heading, we would simply be going a bit faster, and place ourselves in a slightly larger orbit around the Sun. If we were to do that enough (and calculate quite a bit, as Pluto is in kind of a weird orbit compared to the rest of the planets), we would expand our orbit to be able to rendezvous with Pluto (although we would certainly be dead by that point, if not from our newly aquired planet-rockets destroying the atmosphere, the distance to the Sun would kill us off quite effectively).</p>
<p>I don't know if this makes it any clearer, good analogies in orbital mechanics are difficult to come by, but it's a fascinating world!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And speaking of falling around the planet, that's why astronauts orbiting Earth are weightless. They still experience a significant portion of Earth's gravitational pull, but they are in a constant state of free fall which is the same as being weightless. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That sounds like a comically convoluted super villain plan. Like</p>
<p>&quot;Behold, HEROES. I have attached my mecha doomsday rockets in the opposite direction of Earth's orbit! Soon they will decay the velocity and cause every living being to come crashing into the Sun!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth and everything else is in orbit at a considerable radial velocity.   Suppose you just thrust toward the sun, now you've just changed you orbit to an ellipse.  You fall close but as you do you turn around it faster.  You don't do into a closer orbit, as long as you miss it you pop out, in an orbit that moves along a more exaggerated elliptical than you started with.  The more you thrust strait down, the farther away you will eventually be.  It's like angling a coin down the funnel.</p>
<p>For the gravity to pull you closer in a stable orbit, you have to dump velocity.    That Change in Velocity (Delta V) requires fuel.  And when you carry more fuel, some of that fuel's energy is needed to changed the velocity of the fuel you have aboard.  </p>
<p>Suppose you are on a boat can only move yourself by throwing rocks.  The first rock moves you so much, but it moves you a little less if you have a second rock on board.  Both because the you tare pushing more weight and the boat is deeper in the water.  A little less of if you have a third.  You might need 10,000 rocks to get where you want to before you starve, in which case that first rock is going to move you a very, vert little bit. </p>
<p>This works against you in a second way imagine now you are in an eddy current  The more your boat weighs, the stronger the grab the current has on you.  The more weight in fuel you use, the less you weigh.  So as you plunk rocks ahead of you yo kill your velocity, the pull of the eddy on your boat gets weaker.  Going out would be easy. Because you then getting lighter works for you, not against you.</p>
<p>Gravity is proportional to the square of the distance better the objects' centers, so if you get twice as close there is four times as much gravity.   The closer to the sun you are, the higher the gradient of curves space you have to muscle around in.  And the more precise guidance you have to hit the right trajectory.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probes heading to the outer solar system do get pulled by the Sun. However, the the gravitational force experienced by an object is a factor of mass and distance to the center of the gravitational mass. As the probe gets further out, the Sun's gravitational force diminishes. Probes make up for the loss in velocity by using gravity assists to get a big boost in speed. It's a maneuver where the probe steals angular momentum from the planet by swinging around it and accelerating. But since planets are so much more massive than a probe, the effect on the planet is infinitesimally small.   </p>
<p>This is also why probes can only launch on certain dates called launch windows. The planets have to be in a certain alignment in order for the orbits to line up such that a probe can get a gravity assist in the direction it needs to go. Probes often swing by the Earth a few times on the way to the outer solar system in order to get a boost in speed. This has the benefit of reducing the amount of fuel needed for the trip and getting the probe to a destination much faster.</p>
<p>I recommend looking up the maneuvers used to get New Horizons to Pluto. You can also see the effect the Sun had on its velocity by looking at a table of velocity over time. Because New Horizons needed a Solar System escape velocity to reach Pluto, it's launch speed reached 36,373MPH (58,536 km/h) or 10.1 <em>miles per second!</em> That speed diminished as it travelled further out, but was boosted by swinging by Earth and Jupiter.   </p>
<p>Here is a gif which shows New Horizons trajectory and speed as a function of time:  </p>
