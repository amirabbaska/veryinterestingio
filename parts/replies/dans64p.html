			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey Destin! Huge fan of your work (loved the Obama interview, and your channel generally)</p>
<p>Basically - the <strong>short answer</strong> is it the charge will eventually get to the ground, but bolts can only be a certain size, and will have a certain direction.</p>
<p>The <strong>longer answer</strong> I've broken into parts:</p>
<p>a) What are the bolts? The bolts are caused due to something called air discharge. The Tesla coil is acting like a capacitor that is discharging.</p>
<p>b) Why do the bolts go in a certain direction? The coil has a point sticking out of it (which is shaped like the end of a pin, but acts like end of a gun), and this causes charge to build up and current to come out of this point. Like charges repel and the most stable surfaces for charge build up are things like domes that are nice and smooth and allow like charges to spread out. The pointy end causes electric current to go out at that end and crucially with a <em>certain direction</em>, roughly along with the line of the point. With the gun this is <em>parallel to</em> the ground rather than at it, so it will start off going in this direction</p>
<p>c) Why is the bolt of a certain length? Electricity can only travel over air a certain distance with given conditions, and this is known as the &quot;spark gap&quot;. Paschen's law gives the conditions for current to flow in air, and essentially with the condition described with a Tesla Coil the greater the voltage the greater the distance. But crucially this distance is <em>limited</em>, it is not infinite, and so there is a limit to how far the current can go as a bolt.</p>
<p>d) What happens to the electrons then? The electric current appears to have a definite length, but we may naturally ask what happens to the electrons. The electrons don't disappear, but they do interact with gases in the air. They likely ionize atoms in air positively by knocking off electrons or they get captured by atoms forming negative ions. These ionized atoms will continue to obey the same laws of EM the rest of the universe does, and will be attracted to like charges, and some, in fact probably the majority would end up in the ground.</p>
<p>So one could argue that the current <em>does</em> eventually meet the ground.</p>
<p>Hope this is useful, and I'm sure people will correct errors of mine. </p>
<p>If this is helpful, I have a small request.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does ionization have to occur in order for the electrons to flow?</p>
<p>Yes that was helpful, but I will manage your expectations by saying I probably cannot agree to your request for several reasons.  The main one being &quot;hey agree to this without knowing what I want&quot;. The second one being that my time is very limited (typing this on lunch break).  My apologies.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes and no. Electrons can flow in a vacuum - for example the solar wind consists partly of electrons (among many other charged particles). </p>
<p>But for a <em>lighting-style bolt</em> of the type under discussion here, then yes we do need to have ionization. This is because ionization creates a small plasma which allows charge to move more freely  - it is more conductive - and thus it allows more electrons to flow. And it is the electron flow through the ionized plasma that creates the light. There's further discussion of air ionization <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/nature/natural-disasters/lightning2.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>My request was literally going to be to say &quot;Hey to Mike&quot; and any other people who helped answer questions at the end of your next video. Don't worry if that isn't such a good idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a welding enthusiast, this speaks to me a little bit. In modern TIG welding machines, typically what you have is something called High Frequency startup. In essence, the machine uses a tesla style circuit to strike a high voltage, high frequency arc which ionizes the immediate surrounding shielding gas (Typically Ar, Ar+CO2, He or Ar+He), which in turn allows the high amperage welding arc to occur. </p>
<p>Without the HF start, you'd have to make contact between the electrode and material, which is what was, and in some cases still is, in use as either Lift Arc or Scratch Start (dated). The world of HV and/or HF electricity is... well.. electrifying!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi chicken man!  /u/pseudonym1066 has a large part of the answer to your question, but not all of it.  He's absolutely correct about electricity and sharp points, but not quite right about the effect of ground.</p>
<p>One reason Tesla coils don't arc to ground is because if they did, they wouldn't work.  The voltage in the secondary circuit is purely AC, so if it can get to ground in any significant way the circuit shorts out very quickly.  If the coil is close enough that arcs go into the ground rather than the air, the resistance to ground must be lower and that pulls up the current and drops the voltage.</p>
<p>Instead, the current just oscillates between the air and the secondary coil!  The air is not permanently ionized, and generally doesn't have to steal electrons from somewhere else.  Ions don't float around on their own like that, and additionally only noble gases are monatomic.  In nitrogen, a single N atom that loses an electron will already be part of an NN molecule.  This molecule as a whole will be an electron short, so it'll have a slightly positive charge and will be attracted to the electrons of other molecules around it, floating a little closer to them.  In a gas I don't think it would form a real bond, but the charge difference is still spread out into the gas as a whole.  The ion doesn't exist on its own, cruising around for an electron to steal.  </p>
<p>When the primary circuit is opened and a spark begins, the secondary circuit continues to resonate for a while.  The sudden loss of mutual inductance in the coils changes the resonant frequency in the secondary coil, but the excess energy is not perfectly damped and it gets sucked into and out of the air in many cycles.  The electricity travels up and down the ionized spark since it has the lowest resistance (more importantly: the lowest inductance).  As proof: your camera is running at 28,000 fps- so if the energy in the secondary coil discharged all at once, the tesla coil's resonant frequency would have to be in the hundreds of hertz for a single spark to be visible moving so slowly.  Instead, the single arc is actually hundreds or thousands of oscillations in the secondary circuit, likely far too fast for your camera to capture. </p>
<p>The air itself is acting like a capacitor!  Thousands of times during a single spark, the air surrounding the coil is becoming charged positively and negatively and charging and discharging into and from the Tesla coil.  Each cycle, some energy gets converted into light and heat (see note) until it the air loses its ionization and all of the electrons get sucked back to where they belong.  Then the resistance of the air increases very suddenly, and the electrons have a much harder time getting out.</p>
<p>This is also why the resonant frequency can affect the shape of sparks!  At higher frequencies, the spark can't go out as far and it has a tendency to fan out and get fuzzier, because there are more electrons rushing to get out but they can't get as far.  DC, since it is at zero frequency, will just take a straight line to ground.  (edit: in air.  In a linear conductor [doesn't ionize/break down], DC will spread out proportionally with resistance.  To make it even more complicated, in linear conductors AC only takes one path, whichever happens to be the first one it takes.  It actually does that.  I love electricity!)</p>
<p>Note: The process by which the electrons lose energy to the air is generally very similar to normal resistive heating after the ionization is established.  Electrons smack into particles in the air, and impart momentum, leading to heat, which can create light through blackbody radiation.  Although &quot;smack&quot; is also not really accurate.  The individual electrons lose momentum, so their voltage drops and on average the voltage is lower the farther into the conductor.  Since none of the electrons disappear, the current stays the same throughout the conductor.  Ohms law!</p>
<p>Hope that makes sense!  I can probably explain some things better, it's 1am and I'm very sleepy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The majority of the bolt will follow the path of least resistance so if you put a metal rod or something at the end it will arc to it. In this example, the metal + air path is less resistance than the pure air path. </p>
<p>Take this an an example:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, when you say <em>eventually</em> get to the ground, does that mean if he was able to hold the trigger for a long time, at one point the bolt would get to the ground? Or is it still limited by the spark gap?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bolt will not get to the ground. The charge will be transferred from the coil, through the bolt, to the air. The ionized air will then be attracted to and neutralized by the ground</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've played a bit with high voltage AC and I firmly believe it has an IQ between 140 and 160. It doesn't go where you think it will. It causes things to happen over large distances. It interferes with control circuitry. It will conduct through insulators and burn them. It will pass several amps over your body without killing you, or kill you because it doesn't like what you're wearing. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel remorse, or pity, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.</p></div>		</li>
