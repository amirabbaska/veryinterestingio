			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something important to keep in mind. </p>
<p>It gets harder and harder to solve poverty as it grows smaller and smaller in the US (by percent of the population). But it is easier to help a country who has a large portion of the country in <a href="http://richmondvale.org/absolute-poverty/" target="_blank">Absolute Poverity</a></p>
<p>It does not mean we should stop trying to solve it domestically, but deciding to help other countries only after solving it domestically 100% is functionally the same as deciding NOT to help other countries. </p>
<p>Edit: <strong>Definition for Absolute Poverty</strong> &quot;As defined in the Declaration of Copenhagen: “absolute poverty is a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education, and information. It depends not only on income but also on access to social services”</p>
<p>The World Bank also defines <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview" target="_blank">Extreme Poverty as $1.90 US a day</a> </p>
<p>I am NOT referencing the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-FPL/" target="_blank">US Federal Poverty Line</a> as it is simply a measurement stick at this point completely divorced from meaning. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/2017/demo/poverty_measure-how.pdf" target="_blank">&quot;The official measure [of the poverty line] is three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963 in today's prices [aka, adjusted for inflation]&quot;</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Homeless people in America have access to clean water, and even a warm meal at least once a day. That's paradise compared to what the poverty stricken gave in ither countries. For example, they have generational homeless in India. Also, to call them homeless is a misnomier, as it implies they use to have a home. Some people are born in the street and really live with a roof over their head. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That really depends. Sure you can't solve all issues but if you pump billions per year into homeless prevention you sure as hell could make a lot Americans happier.</p>
<p>But I hate to be that guy that says America first etc... Because people are people regardless of where they were born and deserve the same treatment as everyone else. </p>
<p>As long as the money is helping people and not going to corrupt governments  I'm OK with it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And we do spend a good chunk of our budget on programs that target the poor or are means tested, like Medicaid, SNAP (aka food stamps), TANF, WIC, and a whole alphabet soup of smaller programs. Many also lump the Earned Income Tax Credit as a form of assistance, as the working poor can end up with extra cash in the form of a large tax &quot;refund.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
