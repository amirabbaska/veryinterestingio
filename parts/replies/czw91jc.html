			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright, /u/cplr described it as a &quot;giant tin can telephone&quot;, and someone working on the project said, &quot;yesterday we had eyes, but today we developed ears&quot;. I read the article and watched the short video, and it did provide an audio-clip. So am I taking this too literally, or are they just saying they can physically see the previously invisible waves of gravity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see some people that look like they are explaining it wrong. What that sound is, is the gravity wave turned into a sound wave. You would not be able to hear it with an ear. It's just like an electrical wave that we turn into sound waves every day, you'd never be able to 'hear' the electricity, but it has a frequency that can be translated into sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity waves are not something you can &quot;see&quot;, per se. The space(-time) around us gets squished together ever so slightly. Things get longer and shorter by a thousandth millionth of a millionth of a millionth of their total length. We found out how to detect that.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Tstyqz2g7o" target="_blank">Here</a> is a video that explains it if you know somewhat what an interferometer (or destructive interference) is.</p>
<p>The &quot;senses&quot; analogy is made because this measures a fundamentally new signal. So far, all we've done is look at &quot;light&quot; in the widest sense of the word (EM radiation): Light, infrared light, gamma rays, radio waves, all are fundamentally the same thing, and we've so far been &quot;seeing&quot; those. Now we can pick up something totally different - likened to &quot;hearing&quot; in addition to &quot;seeing&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically, this doesn't tell us anything that we didn't already suspect, but gives us more evidence that our suspicions were right?</p>
<p>So, it's sort of like DNA evidence demonstrating the link between humans and apes - it doesn't necessarily prove that our understanding of evolution is 100% accurate*, but makes us much more certain that whatever is going on at least closely involves the system we know of as evolution? And therefore we can narrow down our search for &quot;truth&quot; into this area with confidence that we aren't on completely the wrong track?</p>
<p>*There could still be a bunch of stuff going on in the background that we have no idea about whatsoever, I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aww well shoot. I'm really glad we were able to support a long standing theory, but I was sort of hoping there was a more direct advancement to space travel. Today's announcement is sort of like we built an MRI and proved it can work, but but its not a new procedure that we can physically use to help people. I guess that's what comes next.</p></div>		</li>
