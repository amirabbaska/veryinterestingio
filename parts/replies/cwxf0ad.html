<p>I'll also add that this past July, Economist ran an excellent article that makes for an entry-point/refresher on what academic research has to say (though the title is somewhat misleading at first glance): <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21659714-large-increases-minimum-wage-could-have-severe-long-term-effects-destination" target="_blank">Destination Unknown: Large increases in the minimum wage could have severe long-term effects</a></p></div>		</li>
