			<div class="markdown"><p>You never know. I was so excited before my first dive that by the time I got in the plane I was so worn out that I fell asleep on the way up. My wife said that the guy who was strapped to me was just &quot;what the fuck?&quot; when he realised I was asleep. Then he woke me up, we moved to the door and when my entire body was literally hanging outside the plane all I could think about was the fact that the harness was squeezing one of my balls.</p>
<p>On everyone else's videos you could hear them freaking out when they got to the door. On my video you can just hear me screaming &quot;it's squeezing my fucking ball!&quot;</p>
<p>I was actually more nervous the first time I bungee jumped. Was cool as a cucumber on the way up, helping one friend who was literally climbing up on all fours and another who started dry heaving as soon as he got to the top. I was never nervous until I got to the edge and looked down. Looked at one of the guys working there and said - </p>
<p>&quot;That's actually a long fucking way down isn't it?&quot; To which he replied -</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you have to jump now.&quot;</p>
<p>So I jumped. And promptly went straight back up for a second jump.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That skydiving story is awesome haha. I'd be more nervous for skydiving tho, the fact that you fall down super fast sounds freaky but it's surely a thing I want to do one day </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a similar strange experience. I was doing a tandem jump, and my &quot;instructor&quot;/guy-I-was-going-to-be-attached-to was nowhere to be found. The only other student was a cute Thai chick. Her instructor made it a point to explain all the details to her. My guy? Missing. </p>
<p>Anyways: the plane starts up, and the chick and her instructor make their way to the plane. A couple of other guys are jumping (solo) and they tell me: come on; if your instructor is not here by the time we takeoff, you can just come back down.  I say what the heck, and climb into the plane.</p>
<p>The plane starts taxiing, and I settle down for a free jaunt in the air. All of a sudden, one of the guys says &quot;wait! Joe is coming!&quot;, and we see Joe (my instructor: a blonde, long-haired stereotypical Californian) hop off a motorbike and climb in. </p>
<p>He apologizes, says he overslept after a long night drinking. And I'm thinking: oh shit. What if he screws up in his hungover state?</p>
<p>So as the plane climbs, he puts the harness on me, and gives me &quot;instructions&quot; which are somewhat scattered and peppered with &quot;dude&quot;s. </p>
<p>As we reach the height, the solo guys hop off. Then the Thai chick and her instructor waddle out. Next is my turn. My biggest fear is that Joe didn't attach me properly to his harness. I worry that when he pulls the chute, he'll pull up and I'll just keep going. </p>
<p>So when we jump out, my mind is only on one thing: trying to make sure I don't become un-attached. So I did the only thing I could think of: I reached behind and grabbed his shorts. Tight. With both my hands. Because if I was going to detach, his shorts were coming with me, dammit!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Did he still jump? I feel like that would be me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wanted to skydive but I'm too afraid of my parachute failing. I've read many stories of parachutes failing to open or some other mechanism failure. I've also seen many skydiving related deaths at r/watchpeopledie. Feels like it's one of the riskiest activities out there. How do I get over the fear of my parachute not deploying properly? Does it really happen that often? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.
Can you add more?
I'm wondering why bungee jumping ended the temptation to jump BUT also got you addicted to bungee jumping. I might do it if you say what I think you'll say</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was more the initial sky dive that ended the temptation. I just find bungee a hell of a lot of fun. And I'd say that the reasoning for it was that I'd finally jumped off the edge. It didn't matter that it was a plane and not the top of a cliff/building. I think it had always been the attraction of the weightless freefall that gave me the desire. I've had that now and while I found the feeling addictive, or maybe because of it, I don't get the urge anymore. I do find myself really wishing that there was a rope I could tie to my ankles when I'm up on a big cliff or building though. And if I look up into the sky on a nice clear day and see a plane I really want to be up there jumping out of it.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I always used to be scared shitless of jumping off high rocks into water. I'd eventually get myself to jump but the fall would always generate a degree of fear as opposed to excitement. Now I don't feel any hesitation and the jump gives me excitement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice this was one of the best illustrations of &quot;conquering fears&quot; I've read. Thanks for breaking it down! Not really a fear I know but for typings sake
I can't wait to sky dive or bungee jump and I hope it gives me the same thing. I can't stand ledges making me afraid of myself</p></div>		</li>
