			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really fascinating how quickly Deep Learning has been growing recently. I went to a talk last week given by Mike Houston on the different applications of deep learning (fantastic talk). He works at NVIDIA and does machine learning on GPU I believe. The sheer variety of uses was really impressive, and many of those problems where we struggled to get an algorithmic solutions are now getting solved with machine learning.</p>
<p><a href="http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/siggraph/2015/presentation/SIG1507-Michael-Houston.pdf" target="_blank">Here are the slides</a>, it's definitely nowhere as complete as the actual talk but it gives a good overview.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oooh, found the recording of the talk!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably not a very good way of putting it. It's more like they are adding Neural Network Deep learning projects to the suite of Machine Learning/AI tools they have. They'll undoubtedly continue to use HMMs for the tasks that HMMs excel at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read an article a while ago that the brains behind Nuance work on a very advanced AI system that seem one step beyond Deep Learning. Where Deep Learning works on a given solution to a problem, they are working on a system that finds the solution to a problem by itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this very amusing (having worked in speech recognition and machine learning over the past couple of decades). It wasn't that long ago if you mentioned neural networks in your abstract you would have a hard time getting it published because they were out of fashion (SVMs were the thing in the noughties).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. One of the things I like about deep learning is it appears to be getting simpler over time (sigmoids vs ReLUs, conv/maxpools to fully convolutional). A lot of cutting edge stuff can be written with half of the code of the older stuff.</p>
<p>Wouldn't suprise me if the key to AI ends up being something simple and not a super complicated to understand model.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what you're disagreeing with... That DL is nicer or less intuitive.</p>
<p>If the latter, I'm not sure of anything you said counters that. Note that DL can be simpler and less code but still less intuitive. You can explain the general idea of an HMM to a novice or at least what the model learns whereas that's not really possible with DL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes it less intuitive? From what I've seen pretty much everyone has gone to RNNs over HMMs for speech at this point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people don't like the idea that RNNs for speech recognition and other NLP applications seem to ignore a lot of traditional work in linguistic theory. It can be scary to just throw out a lot of structure that we think works well and hope that the RNN figures out either that structure or a better structure. Traditional AI researchers think that RNNs are either too much like black boxes or they remember the brick wall that they hit in the 80s and are worried that it will happen again.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, it turns out that RNNs are <em>really fucking useful</em> so everybody is getting as much use out of them as possible.</p></div>		</li>
