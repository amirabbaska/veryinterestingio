			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that the carbon constituting the diamonds went very deep into the earth's crust (hence the high pressure) and then came closer to the surface thanks to complex movements of said crust, allowing humans to dig for them. </p>
<p>It's very simplified as conditions required to make diamonds are much more specific than just high pressure but that's the idea :) </p></div>		</li>

<p>But they're too deep for us to get at.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>MUCH deeper than the floor of the ocean, and under materials more dense than water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the surface of the earth, we are riding on tectonic plates. These plates are thick -- so thick that we have never even managed to drill all the way through one. When the plates run into one another, often one of them is pushed down into the mantle below the plates. In that way, organic matter (made of carbon + other stuff) is brought down into the mantle. At the same time, deep seated fluids at the base of the mantle are circulating near the core-mantle boundary, including some carbon bearing fluids. </p>
<p>When any of that carbon comes to the correct stability field, meaning sufficient but not too much pressure, temperature, pH, redox conditions, and source content (carbon), then it is possible for diamonds to form. This generally happens where there is very old, dense crust that pushes down a bit into the mantle, allowing an uncommon situation where all of the necessary conditions are met. </p>
<p>That is where and how diamonds form, but not how we find them at the surface. </p>
<p>To get to the surface, the diamonds need to hitch a ride on what we call a mantle plume. A plume of hot material rises from deep in the mantle, passing through the zone where diamonds form. As it does so, bits of rock are caught in the plume, which then travels explosively to be surface. A volcano forms, with the rock type called kimberlite, named for Kimberley, South Africa, where it was first described. The mine removes material from the volcanic pipe and crushes it. When they do, they find diamonds!</p></div>		</li>
