			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really interesting article, and it agrees with our theories about states of matter, but it overlooks some key points.  First, it points out that this phenomenon is shared by other solids they tested.  If we tried to skate on their solid lead... well it wouldn't be that fun.  Second, and perhaps more important, it doesn't say why ice is different.  </p>
<p>For the answer to why water ice, it's going to be the same as all other &quot;why water ice&quot; questions.  Hydrogen Bonding.  Hydrogen bonding is very likely creating a novel surface on ice.  It's also responsible for the novelty of expansion on freezing.  </p></div>		</li>
