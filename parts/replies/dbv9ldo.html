			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent analysis.   </p>
<p>To kind of piggyback,  creating your own morality, while indeed what nietzsche was a proponent of can be a slippery slope.  He was also a proponent of overcoming his own Humanity.   &quot;The human being is a rope strung between a beast and the overman&quot;  as he put it in Thus Spoke Zarathustra.  His idea of &quot;the will to power&quot; is directly related to the overman.  He claimed to live his life &quot;moraine free&quot;  or without intoxicants.  Dude never drank coffee or smoked.  His belief in the overman was partly overcoming some of the basic human urges that we have that sets us on the same level as beasts, like lust and gluttony.  By overcoming these small every day battles with the self, you can feel your will power growing &quot;What is good? All that heightens the feeling of power in man, the will to power, power itself. What is bad? All that is born of weakness. What is happiness? The feeling that power is growing, that resistance is overcome&quot; as he put it in the Antichrist.  </p>
<p>I like to think of Nietzsche as a series of thought excercises.  Between the eternal recurrance, will to power, and the overman, one can create their own interpretation of morality and their definition of &quot;the good life&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>This seems to me a certain path to global feudalism, possibly even a never ending class struggle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An Ubermensch, to Nietzche, was meant to be someone who made their morals and took responsibility for their actions and life. He didn't want us to go back to only powerful people ruling the world, but powerful people leading each other to make the world better. He was against objective morality because he seen that morals were a creation of men, not gods, and that we should treat them as such. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not? If all other laws and ethical systems were lifted, following Nietzche's philosophy, the richest and mightiest will easily subjugate almost everyone else. </p></div>		</li>

<p>So which system of morality is better? Nietzche says, &quot;Neither.&quot; It is better to invent your own system of morality without caring what other people think. Nietzche's Ubermensch is a person who is completely liberated and lives exactly as they please without being controlled by other people's expectations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, If I get to invent my own morality, what's to stop me from saying that it's morally acceptable to commit genocide in the name of creating a master race of super humans?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that society will put you on trial and shoot in the head for this. Now, a different question would be &quot;what if the whole society thinks this way&quot;, and we know the answer. But the real question here is whether something as flimsy and inherently human-made as morality can stop society from starting a genocide. After all, there is nothing in the Bible about hating jews (it's a jewish invented religion ffs) or killing people of other faiths, yet the Crusades happened and antisemitism exists.</p></div>		</li>
