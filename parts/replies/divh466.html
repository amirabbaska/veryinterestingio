First off, if there is a plane crash, the baggage compartments would be the first to unclasp and go (if you're talking about forces that would cause a phone to become a deadly projectile). Also, terrorists aren't that smart and don't like to spend money, which is why you haven't seen a drone with an IED on it hit an airplane yet..</p></div>		</li>
