<p>And unlike 2-in-1 shampoo, you can find high quality jeggings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to hate jeggings because I thought they were either leggings with a jeans print on them or leggings made out of denim. But now I buy them exclusively for my pants needs, because they really have the same construction as regular pants just with a more comfortable fabric. It's so nice wearing them to work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on hair type. </p>
<p>Check out this hair type chart:<br />
<a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/38/97/29/389729d8ef7e28442f0174b74a7c9f7f.jpg" target="_blank">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/38/97/29/389729d8ef7e28442f0174b74a7c9f7f.jpg</a></p>
<p>We have type 2a through 4c in our family. Those of us who are type 2 wash with shampoo about twice a week and wash out most of the conditioner. Those with type 4 never shampoo wash unless something gets splattered on their head or something, wash only with conditioner, leave a whole handful of conditioner in, usually have hair in braids or twists with a thick conditioner in it. In type 4 hair the conditioner gets absorbed, because this hair needs a ton of moisture. It looks dry and will break without a ton of oil and moisture added. I'm type 2c, and if I put this much in mine, it would be visible and it would look greasy and odd. </p>
<p>The 2-in-1 conditioner makes us with wavy, curly, or kinky hair kind of laugh, because why on earth would we wash the conditioner out? But of course it works for people with really straight hair (and fairly short, I assume), whose hair would be weighed down if they left conditioner in it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally off topic...but my Walmart jeggings are the most durable and comfortable jeggings I've found around. They're thick enough to not show anything under (panties) and flexible like a standard leggings. I have one pair that has lasted for almost a year with almost no show of wear. It's a weird thing.</p></div>		</li>
