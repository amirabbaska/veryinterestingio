			<div class="markdown"><p>It's for dramatic effect and the flow of the album. You put those in so if you're listening to the album front to back you get those nice little fades from a sinking outro to a nice building intro or the appropriate amount of silence between tracks, but if you're just skipping to a certain track, you go straight to the beginning of the song. No odd pause to make you think you're not at the right spot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also sometimes a gap at the beginning of tracks (specifically the first track) to allow time for amplifier gate (not a physical gate but in electrical terms it stops that annoying hiss of static, and can also stop unwanted noise (e.g. from a drum kit) from other microphones not currently being sung into etc spilling into the mix) to open fully so you don't get an unintended fade/blast of music or have music cut off.</p>
<p>When I was doing my Sound Production course at College one of the Lecturers said to always leave a slight gap between true &quot;0:00&quot; and the start of the actual audio for exactly this reason. He had a car with a CD Changer at one point where lots of CDs had the first second or two of audio cut off from the beginning because the gate was taking longer to open up and allow audio through than there was a gap between 0:00 and the start of the audio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya! I knew somebody who actually knows what they're talking about would explain it for me eventually, haha. I never really questioned the engineer too much during studio time. I just assumed he was telling us we'd do things a certain way because it made it easier for him to touch it up in post or whatever black magic happens between recording and finished tracks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that really a thing?  I've seen gates on the front of things like guitar amps, but are there regular hi-fi systems with gates on them?  I can't find any evidence for it with google.  Would be interested in an example ..!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The worst is when you have that gap, but the two songs are supposed to merge seamlessly. Like the first three songs on Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and also the last half of Abbey Road.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hated that. That would happen to me when I burned CDs and either the files didn't flow perfectly or worse I'd leave on a default setting to include like 2 seconds between tracks.</p>
<p>I had the actual Sgt Peppers CD though and it flowed correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I distinctly remember being relieved when Apple fixed that with the iPods. I want to say pre 2007 or so, even if you ripped it straight from the CD and had all the settings correct, there'd still be a maddening split-second gap between every track.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bonus fact: because pregap is just a number of seconds to wait, rather than actual dead silence data, you can create CDs with play times well over the 74min max, and confuse the hell out of people who notice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a blink 182 cd that has an entire intro in the negatives. If you go straight to the song it won’t play. If you just play it in order, you’ll get that lady reading that letter and it’s like “where the fuck is the song and how come the numbers are counting down from negatives...?” </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember that! It was their self titled album. I remember you could go to the track and rewind into the negative gap that contained the hidden part. This is one thing I've actually wondered about with streaming being a thing- there's no such thing as a truly hidden track only available to the person who listens all the way through. As far as I understand at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Songs For The Deaf</em> by Queens of the Stone Age has an entire song in the pregap, but you have to rewind back to hear it. When you put the cd in newer players, either you can't do pregap rewinding and so it isn't there, or it just starts the album with that song.</p></div>		</li>
