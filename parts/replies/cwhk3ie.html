			<div class="markdown"><p>My father has the largest Peugeot collection in North America and has dedicated his entire life to the cars. He's a poor Canadian mechanic who is obsessed with Peugeot, over his shop instead of an auto repair shop sign is PEUGEOT in huge bold letters. He lives out in the country, no one knows what Peugeot is. I'm pretty sure it's some sort of mental illness. He also wears his mechanic's blues every single day of the year, unless it's some sort of special occasion, then he'll wear double denim.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you may have the Canadian version of my father. He is a former farmer living in the suburbs. Largest collection of John Deere that could possibly be used. He will occasionally wear a t-shirt to family gatherings... the same one. &quot;Traveling 33rpm in an iPod world&quot;. Other than that he wears blue uniform pants and shirts from a used uniform place. So his shirts always say things like &quot;Hector&quot; &quot;Abdul&quot; &quot;Martin&quot; none of which are his name. </p>
<p>We just call him by his shirt name. </p></div>		</li>

<p>John Deere dad also enjoys racial profiling when he is stopped for a traffic citation or when boarding an airplane. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the decision to enter or stay in the american market is the requirement to provide parts and service for a decade (that's what it was years ago; not sure if it's changed).  I was in Lyon this summer and my cab driver - retired Peugeot employee - swore they were planning a re-entry into the US.</p>
<p>When I was in high school my dad's company car (briefly) was a 505 turbo.  I snuck it out several times, it was great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I owned a Crossfire SRT6. I learned the limit is 5 years when Chrysler attempted to bail on maintaining parts for the car (I needed a replacement front bumper for it). Of course, once 5 years was up, that was it. Fortunately, Mercedes actually maintains a reasonable parts inventory and the SRT6 is just a reskinned SLK32 AMG.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that's a culture shock right here. I thought it came from Pepe le pew for a second... Simply because it was the only place where I could see &quot;le + english word&quot; when I was young. (even if it's feminine in french and in that case it should be &quot;la&quot;)&quot; And this is a perfect exemple of it because we say &quot;la voiture&quot;. (another funny thing, Pepe le pew is italian in the french version).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad bought one of these brand spanking new in '89. Gave him nothing but trouble. Hairline crack in the head gasket (less than 70k on the clock), radiator problems,  coolant pissing out of it faster than could be put back in, overheating constantly. The final straw was the front passenger side sub-frame cracked, could hear a thumping metal sound every time it was put into a full lock in reverse.  We jacked it up one day and there was roughly 1/8 th of an inch thick left holding the bottom of the sub-frame together.  The wheel the more we raised the car,  proceeded tuck itself in underneath the body. Like they did on the DMC in back to the future. We never drove it after that discovery. It sat outside the house for months til one of those cars for cash guys called in and took it for 500 quid. Don't know what happened it after that. No great cars in late 80's early 90's. Although I'm lead to believe the 205 GTI &amp; 309 GTI were great. I don't know though we never had one of either. </p></div>		</li>
