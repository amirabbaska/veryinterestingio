			<div class="markdown"><p>Although quite degraded, they do have a circulatory system. They have a dorsal tube along the upper side of the body that runs longitudinally. This tube breaks up into sections around the abdomen and is called the heart. Blood or hemolymph for the most part is expelled around the front end of the tube (the head of insect) and runs down the body towards the anus back into tube. This works just like a shower. As for the divided pieces, there are muscles that pump hemolymph from those chambers.</p>
<p>The reason this system is of low priority in insects is because they already have oxygen directly available to organs via tracheal tubes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do have circulatory systems. I study insect hearts. </p>
<p>But their &quot;open&quot; circulatory system is made up of numerous small pumps that aren't interconnected by veins or arteries. Insects are basically bags of blood -- their organs are just kind of bathed in it, rather than perfused by it like in mammals and other animals with &quot;closed&quot; circulatory systems. </p>
<p>The largest pump is a long tube that runs front to back along the dorsal surface (top) of the insect, and moves blood back and forth.  We call that the heart. </p></div>		</li>
