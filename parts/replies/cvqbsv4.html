			<div class="markdown"><p>As I pointed out elsewhere, if you do the math, copper at room temperature has a vapor pressure of about 6E-53 atmospheres. In other words, it doesn't evaporate until it gets hot. So saying it &quot;has a vapor pressure&quot; at room temperature, while technically accurate, is probably going to give people a bad intuition for what actually happens. At that pressure, a single atom leaving is an exceedingly rare event!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would one go about calculating the probability of an atom leaving the solid, given the vapor pressure (and knowing atmospheric pressure)? I don't even know which equation to start to look at.</p></div>		</li>
