			<div class="markdown"><p>You should read a short story called &quot;A Pail of Air&quot; by Fritz Lieber. In this story, the earth is knocked out of its orbit and sent on a course out of the solar system. In the story, it gets so cold that the gases in the atmosphere condense or freeze onto the earth's surface in layers. The story follows a family of survivors in a makeshift dwelling who have to collect buckets full of oxygen and melt them over a fire to supply themselves with breathable air. No idea how scientifically accurate it is, but an interesting read.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we are sufficiently organised to live in societies in underwater cities or deep benath Iceland, we might. However it will be very difficult to mine for resources and to set up launching sites. After all, everything on the surface will be frozen solid. Also the atmosphere will have frozen, so nothing protects us from some serious space radiation.</p></div>		</li>
