			<div class="markdown"><p>Can kinda vouch for that- in veterinary school we're taught that carnivores are about on par with humans and kidney function- slightly better because of diet. Birds and other uricotelic animals are fantastic at concentrating &quot;urine&quot; because they are able to excrete uric acid and small amounts of urea. Humans however excrete urea (along with carnivores and many other mammals) which requires water to be able to excrete it from the body. There's a decent amount of water that's lost this way in humans. </p></div>		</li>
