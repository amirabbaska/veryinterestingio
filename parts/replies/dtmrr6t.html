<p>The idea of the company is not to do profit now. It is to do profit in 5-7 or more years. So they are betting that in X Years there will be so much people using Netflix and then ROI hits. </p>
<p>When they talk to investors, they present that kind of plan, telling them: we are going to do negativ profit for the first X years. </p>
<p>This is actually a very good investment returning a good amount of % in return. But it takes time and is very risky. </p>
<p>This is also the reason Netflix only true competitor is YouTube. </p></div>		</li>
