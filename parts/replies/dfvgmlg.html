<p>I do like the school sport culture in the US though. Until you hit the big time the only people in the crowd will be parents of the players. Must be nice to run out in front of hundreds or even thousands of kids supporting you at that age. </p>

<p>The best part is attending the games as a college student especially if you go to a school like Alabama.  Saturdays in the Fall when there is a home revolve around that and it is such a fun and amazing experience. </p></div>		</li>

<p>After watching that video I'm trying not to cry because there's like 140 days until kickoff, if that's any indication of the importance we place on sports.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a student at the University of Alabama, there is no better day than the Iron Bowl, which is the cross-state rivalry game that he is at between two of the most well know teams in all levels of football in the US. It is as exciting as New Years and virtually as sacred as Christmas in the state. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surprised how long it took to find this answer. This is by far the #1 difference between the US and EU. it's not just high school either, colleges in the US are HUGE on sports while in Europe it's   clubs or entities separate from academic institutions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's talk about making a minor league of sorts for football- creating farm teams for the NFL outside of college sports. Players get paid and healthcare instead of bullshit credits as well as a better shot towards making a certain team instead of going into the combine. </p>
<p>Almost definitely not going to happen, and it would take away from so much that I love about college football. The thing is, most of what I enjoy about college football comes from the absurdity of it all. Student athletes throw themselves at one another in plays that could very well end their career because of allegiance to their coach, their team, and their school with a minute chance of making it in the pros. </p>
<p>And then we can see so many of those that once boasted and bragged on the field playing arena football or AAA baseball. And we can all joke about how although we'd've loved the pussy, we're glad we didn't go down that road. </p>
<p>It's... weird. Go Noles.  </p></div>		</li>

Colleges shouldn't exist for entertainment venues ever especially for American Football (bitter college grad that went to a third rate massive Texas college known for it's band program and shit football team whose games everyone left after halftime)</p></div>		</li>
