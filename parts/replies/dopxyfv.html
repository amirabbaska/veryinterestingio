<blockquote>
<p>Com­pared to straight quotes, curly quotes are more leg­i­ble on the page and match the other char­ac­ters bet­ter. There­fore, straight quotes should never, ever ap­pear in your documents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because when you copy/paste something into a code editor, you then need to swap all the quotes back to straight quotes. If you have a technical document of any kind, where people might copy/paste parts of it, please never use curly quotes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That often doesn't happen and they use curly quotes on the whole site. Or maybe you're copying an equation, or something else, I can't think of a great example right now, but I know it's happened to me a bunch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of a bug I had to deal with in our software. A customer was copy pasting an equation from a word document into our dynamic equation evaluator. The equation had a strange minus sign that looked visably proper, only slightly longer than a standard minus sign, and had a different ascii code when inspected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew a professor who was also an editor for a technical journal and he was pushing for the journal to switch to the two columns format.  His argument was that there was research showing that shorter sentences are easier to read because it's easier to find the start of the next line if you don't start from the other side of the page. </p>
<p>As an aside I read somewhere that we can read much faster by having the letters sequentially flash inside a fixed box instead of moving your eyes around when reading normal text.  They could make cellphones much smaller since they would only have to show one letter at a time. :-)</p>
<p>I honestly have never done any experiment on either one vs two columns, or with the flash box.  I don't know how much they might make a difference.</p></div>		</li>
