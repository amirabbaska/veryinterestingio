			<div class="markdown"><p>Even without plans or designs evolution is quite capable of explaining why getting hit in the balls is so painful.</p>
<p>Experiencing this pain has been a useful mutation, as it has made males with that particular mutation more conscious of protecting their balls, thereby making them more successful at procreation.</p></div>		</li>
