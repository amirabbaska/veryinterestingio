			<div class="markdown"><p>i was under the impression that americans don't actually fly to other countries for most healthcare.  i've heard people fly overseas to do elective and controversial ops like sex changes, but for the most part, regular healthcare for americans is done here in the states, and supposedly, more people engage in healthcare tourism in the US than most other countries on the planet.  many countries with highly rated universal healthcare systems won't even treat foreigners beyond emergency stabilization.  </p>
<p>in fact, last time i was in europe, one of the people in our group got extremely sick.  she was allowed minimal treatment in spain, but germany, switzerland and france all declined to treat her.  after they stabilized her enough for her to get her on a plane, spain sent her back to the US.</p></div>		</li>
