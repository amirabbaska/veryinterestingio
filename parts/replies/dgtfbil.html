			<div class="markdown"><p>Nevertheless, almost everyone on the planet lives under governments that use physical stamps, seals, or stickers to authenticate documents. They self-authenticate to the degree you recognize and trust the stamp, and do so without requiring any special technology, which may not always be available or functioning properly. The best option is a document with a physical stamp (etc.) on it that can <em>also</em> be electronically authenticated if available, which is exactly how modern passports work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a digital database where they compile people's exit/entry out of/into any country and date of entry... you know the standard travel information... so I think it's a combination of both stamps being used in conjunction with a database to cross-check for any anomalies and to verify the information!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would you want to forge a passport marking? I ask this because I've entered and left the EU several times, and have never been stamped on the trip back in. I've had the police check my passport and ask where the stamp was, then ask when I entered the country, but it never went further than that.</p></div>		</li>
