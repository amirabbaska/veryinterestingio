			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yea? &quot;Pretty open about colluding to keep RAM prices higher&quot; Cite a source.  You are talking out of your ass here.  DRAM prices are high because the big three DRAM makers can sell their product, which is in incredibly short supply and INSANELY high demand, to large enterprise companies for data servers, instead of jackass retail gamers, and make more money off it.  Welcome to capitalism bud.  </p></div>		</li>
