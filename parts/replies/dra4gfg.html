			<div class="markdown"><p>It is more complex than that but serotonin is involved, that separates it from its day to day behaviours, makes it leave the forage line to wander about on its own.
There is more to the mechanism, but it gets very complex and way outside my knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yeah but it may involve other hormones and neurotransmitters than serotonin, depending on what the parasite is trying to achieve. Just lowering the serotonin level will probably make the host less animated, which may be good for the parasite if it wants it's host to get eaten, thus putting the parasite into the digestive tract of a bigger host where it can lay it's eggs.</p>
<p>By the way, serotonin is not a hormone, it's a neurotransmitter. Neurotransmitters signal between neurons, whereas hormones may perform chemical signaling to body cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cheers, I saw a great documentary about this some years ago, can't remember the details and can't find the vid either.</p>
<p>It is way outside what I do, but I was trying to get a across that it doesn't control or program the ant, more it makes it behave in a different way.</p></div>		</li>
