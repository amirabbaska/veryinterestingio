			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most important answer in the thread, OP. While everybody else is correct about sediment transport, that process happens over a framework of bedrock. That bedrock has been eroded unevenly due to a combination of variations in its composition (say, soft shale vs resistant sandstone), and due to variations in geomorpholoical process (e.g., a river cutting it's own channel, vs the higher headlands around it). So a spit of sand can be where it is because it is anchored at one or more points with exposed bedrock. The shape of that spit, and features on it, is determined by wave energy, wind, and erosion on land near by, providing new sediment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, this ones the right answer.  All parts of the coast will erode if the seas hitting it, but variations in the rocks resistance to erosion results in your coves and clifs</p></div>		</li>
