			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Beating&quot; is what you call the sound when you have two near, but different pitches &quot;pulsing&quot; against each other. Like when you're tuning a guitar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn’t describe it as “pulsing against each other”. It’s amplitude differences in a regular pattern due to constructive and destructive interference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'beating' doesn't necessarily refer to the music as a whole, but if the tones are really close in pitch many people perceive a 'beat' like a heartbeat as they go in and out of phase with each other</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not something depending on an individual’s perception. Beating due to intonation differences is simply due to constructive and destructive interference. It’s measurable and perceptual to anybody. </p>
<p>Physics demo:
<a href="https://youtu.be/yia8spG8OmA" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/yia8spG8OmA</a></p>
<p>In fact any two tones with pitches at any pitch interval is experiencing beats. A fifth, octave, etc. In these cases the “beating” is perceived in the brain as a continuous thing since the beats are extremely fast. When the tone’s pitches are nearly identical the beating frequency reduces to the order of a few hertz (beats per second).</p>
<p>The interesting thing about “binaural” beats is that, even though the tones are fed to each ear independently and isolated from each other, people still hear “beating”.  It is as if the tones were constructively and destructively interfering when clearly they aren’t doing that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm interprerting it correctly, the difference is that the different frequencies are combined in the brain rather than before they are received by the ears. In other words, if it were a singular tone, the two frequencies would be put together into one sound. Instead, a binaural beat is two different frequencies delivered to each ear. The supposed benefits come from the way our brains work to put the two frequencies tougher and synthesize a singular tone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The modulating of the sound you get when combining two slightly detuned tones is also called beating. This is a way to tune for example a guitar by ear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I.E the beats are produced by electrical energy (brainwaves), rather than kinetic energy (air waves). Pretty crazy stuff. </p></div>		</li>
