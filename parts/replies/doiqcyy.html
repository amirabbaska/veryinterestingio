			<div class="markdown"><p>Not now a days, but not too long ago they did. They could use a myriad of sums like Midpoint and Trapezoid.
Another process you learn about in Calc is called Simpson's rule which can get even closer to the real answer with enough 'i' to 'n' values in the sum!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you kidding? Numerical integration is pretty much the topic of my PhD. Frankly, most modern interesting physics and engineering questions involve integrals that cannot be solved symbolically. Not by a human or any computer. Numerical integration is absolutely essential to the modern world. I might even argue that it's more important than symbolic algorithms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a procedure called &quot;stochastic integration&quot; where you just generate a bunch of random points, and then check if they are under the curve or not (so if you are integrating y=f(x), you check if y&lt;=f(x), which is computationally fairly simple) and then the fraction of points that are under the curve is the integral. This is very inefficient in most cases however, and is mainly used in theoretical physics where you get 10- or 11-dimensional integrals, for which stochastic integration can be as good, or even better (!) than actually trying to compute the integral.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not exactly what you're asking, but some programs have different &quot;integration&quot; calls, where one will just jump straight to numerical answering, and the other will try it explicitly. Depending on what you're doing, one may be more ideal (or even the only possible one) relative to the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may do this if you specifically request a definite integral, or try to integrate a function with no antiderivative.</p></div>		</li>
