			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. A friend of mine was a contestant on one of the “Beauty and the Geek” shows (he and all the other men were “Geeks”). He said a lot of things got edited out of context, or for heightened drama (which, of course) and was a bit upset at how some of the “Beauties” came off as full-blown Bitches, when they were in fact really nice people. </p>
<p>He got <em>a lot</em> of public attention after the show, which was laughable to us, his friends, but it made me feel sorry for these women that probably got a lot of negative attention because of the way they were framed in the show. </p></div>		</li>
