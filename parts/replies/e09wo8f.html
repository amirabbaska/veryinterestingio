			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because it's a maddeningly simple design. You basically just have a small uranium cylinder that fits into a larger uranium cylinder, and you shoot the large one at the small one really really fast, which causes a nuclear reaction. In the case of the Little Boy, there was a casing of tungsten carbide around it (really strong material that held the explosion for a few extra microseconds), as well as a neutron emitter IIRC. The main issue with it was that most of the uranium didn't even go critical. I think it was only a couple grams in total that went critical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They were not certain either one would work, but the little boy was at its design limit, and only useful with u235. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For any interested in the history of the development of the US nuclear bombs, I found The Manhattan Project by Stephane Groueff a fantastic read. The book describes the entire development from Oppenheimerâ€™s letter to Truman, the nuclear pile, the methods of obtaining and enriching nuclear materials (including vaporizing uranium, which apparently is highly caustic), creating an entire city (Oak Ridge), and developing the actual detonation mechanisms. This book really made me understand the scale of time, materials, and lives that went into the project. </p></div>		</li>
