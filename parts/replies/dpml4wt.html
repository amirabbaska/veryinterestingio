<p>Proton conduction is motion of existing ionized hydrogen (H+) nuclei in solution of liquid or gas.  Car batteries' reaction does move atoms around like that:</p>
<p>PbO2 + 4H+ + SO4-- + 2e- -&gt; PbSO4 + 2H2O and
Pb + SO4-- -&gt; PbSO4 + 2e-</p>
<p>But it's not done in solid conductors.  Actually electromigration does mean some metals' atoms (and thus their protons) creep along with electron flow, but it's a very minor, incidental effect.</p></div>		</li>
