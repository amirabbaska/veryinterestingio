<p>Although I guess that doesn't explain throwing up at the sight of blood. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THATS EXACTLY WHY. It is an evolutionary survival tactic because back in the day when we use to live in tribes, we generally all ate the same thing, so if we saw someone else vomitting, our mind would register that as &quot;well, fuck, i better get rid of this shit too... <em>vomits</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: im on mobile at school on the pooper, so ill post my source when i get home in a few hours.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Yeah sorry guys I have not been able to find my source for this. My bad :( However you guys can do more digging into the subject. It is called sympathetic vomiting and the consensus seems to be that we aren't exactly sure why we sympathetically vomit (evolutionarily speaking). I'M SORRY.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So as a follow up question to the person's scenario--the people that didn't throw up, are they maybe less group-oriented from an evolutionary perspective than the ones that empathized with the vomiter by vomiting themselves? </p>
<p>That sounds like a weird question. I guess I'm asking if the people who did throw up had more of an old evolutionary habit &quot;residue&quot; than the ones that didn't throw up, and if the ones that didn't throw up lost that survival tactic for some reason, like less group-oriented instincts? </p>
<p><em>Similar to how wolves and dogs look similar, but dogs have had YEARS of domestication to weed out certain characteristics. Did the ones that didn't throw up maybe have certain tribe characteristics &quot;weeded out&quot; of themselves?</em></p>
<p>^ attempt at an analogy to hopefully better explain my question because I know it probably doesn't sound coherent but I'm having trouble with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly why; it's an evolved response. So is an aversion to bad smells to protect from spoiled food, and an aversion to bitter tasting food to avoid poisonous plants/venomous animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the &quot;sight of blood&quot; vomit may just be a severe reaction to anxiety about one's mortality?  Or a reaction to the adrenaline kick.  I imagine it's linked to the fainting response also.  But I'm no doctor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also wonder what's happening when you're nervous or anxious and that makes you <em>feel</em> sick (but you don't always get sick). Or any time you feel sick and don't throw up, really</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're anxious - particularly if you're anxious very often - then the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4aytf9/eli5_what_is_happening_inside_the_stomach_when/d14p4on" target="_blank">answer here applies</a>. When you're anxious you produce a lot of various hormones to reduce the stress (almost all of your organs produce significant excess hormones, as your brain is typically too busy to work out <em>what's wrong</em> just that <em>something is up somewhere</em>, and at any moment you may need the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response). If you're frequently anxious, or even very suddenly intensely anxious the one time, you're apt to have an abnormal amount of these hormones in your bloodstream, and then inevitably in your stomach. </p>
<p>Your body then attempts to eject these excess hormones. Usually it just excretes them using the standard biological mechanisms (you'll notice you also start sweating/breathing heavily, or needing to pee when very anxious, muscles tend to tense up to facilitate the sweating)... If you've got too much in your system though, the body just says &quot;screw it, we need to deal with this now!&quot;, and the feeling of sickness starts. Sometimes that'll just sedate your homeostasis enough that you don't need to throw up, other times you're just blindingly overwhelmed by the anxiety and eject it as vomit.</p>
<p>Usually you feel better from anxiety after vomiting, because it's an activity that ejects a lot of hormones. It's also physically strenuous, so counter-intuitively, it'll also release a lot of dopamine which makes you feel OK again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explains it... I always have to pee like 90 times when I'm anxious or upset and often if it's bad I have to shit too. I get nauseous but my phobia has made me too good at suppressing pukes, so I guess my body tries the other routes first. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard somewhere that we evolved &quot;empathy-puking&quot; because if you picture a group of hunter gathers and one eats something bad, the rest of them probably ate the same thing.  I think there's specific chemicals in the puke itself that your brain pays attention to.</p></div>		</li>
