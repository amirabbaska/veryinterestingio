			<div class="markdown"><p>I bought a chainsaw from amazon once on ambien. Realized the next day with the order confirmation email.  I live in a row house in the city with no use for a chainsaw but I kept it.  </p>
<p>Edit : Some were asking for proof.   Here’s an Instagram post I made about it in 2014 after I discovered the order </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost 20 years ago, or whenever ambien was first introduced my mom was given them. She went boringly through the whole bottle except the last pill. Last pill, hadnt eaten much, hadnt slept well, bunch of stress in life. I was watching TV on the foot of her bed, I hear her crash and continue watching my show. She starts talking in her sleep which is unusual. I wake her up because it was freaking 12 year old me out. She wakes up absolutely tripping balls, Mexican lady in a purple dress in the ceiling, accused me of staring her hands, because her hands were too old, purple bunny rabbits running next to car on the way to hospital, purple pyramids off in the distance in the middle of South Texas. Turns out she was #3 in the USA to trip out on ambien. Good stuff, freaked me out. </p>
<p>Tldr: my mom took the last pill in a bottle of ambien and was #3 in the US to have the strange reaction to which r/ambien gets it's fun from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YMMV but I normally only take ambien when I travel internationally but I took one on accident one morning.  I had it sitting next to a normal med I take and they look very similar.  I was tired, grabbed the pill took it.  About 10 minutes later I realized the pill was the wrong color.  I was working from home that day but I basically got extremely tired.  Over the course of the next 1-2 hours if I recall correctly.  I couldn't concentrate on my computer screen and it was hard to read.  I kept dozing in and out until I finally succumbed to the inevitable fact that was sleep.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer right here. It varies from what you take, how much you take and how your body reacts to it. Even taking an antihistamine like Benadryl can knock you back out. We give this at bedtime sometimes or a stronger antihistamine like Vistaril. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, it entirely depends. What are your normal sleeping habits? Did you have tiring day after the sleep? Did you stare at your phone until 3am? Are you taking any other medication that may effect your sleep?</p>
<p>There is no ‘one’ answer for every person and their lifestyle. Being in healthcare you see all types of people and sleeping habits. Some take two strong sleeping tablets and it does nothing. Some take one, sleep for 14 hours and are drowsy for the next 10. This is especially different when a person is in hospital verses in their own home. To really determine how it would effect OP, more details about the circumstances would be required.</p>
<p>It kind of like asking how drunk will “a person” get from a six pack of beer? The circumstances of the situation determine everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your reply. Just an example: I sleep 7 hours daily, wake up and take a sleeping pill just to test this theory. I don't have any history of taking sleeping pills and my diet is normal staple food. Will this keep me awake for another 2 days once I wake up again since I slept twice my daily quota. </p></div>		</li>
