			<div class="markdown"><p>The news is like this too. You always see filler news segments on TV about how &quot;a new discovery might be the key to curing some deadly cancers&quot; or something. Then you never hear about it again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed but these limitations of studies are NOT the cause of such headlines on reddit.</p>
<p>The cause of what OP is asking is sensationalism or flat out lies hidden through multiple layers covering the actual study. Whether it's the article's company, article's author, poster linking to the article, the journey of a scientific study to reddit front page is riddled with opportunities for exaggeration or misinterpretation.</p>
<p>Such posts are the result of these things, not the limitations of discoveries. </p></div>		</li>
