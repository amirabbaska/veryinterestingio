			<div class="markdown"><p>But do you actually need 20 nuggets? If I'm hungry for 10 nuggets, and I go into McDonald's and see the price, I'll pay 50 cents more for 20 nuggets even though I don't need the extra 10. By marking up the price for 10 nuggets, McDonald's gets to sell 20 nuggets to more people. </p></div>		</li>
