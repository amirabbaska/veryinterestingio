			<div class="markdown"><p>Proper detection also involves impedance. We still need to detect between regular headphones and line inputs. All that the third stripe says is that it probably has mic, it has nothing to do with output impedance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this is the right answer. It has nothing to do with impedance. I've tested this before and any TRRS cable will have the same volume as any other TRRS. TRS cables use another volume setting. At least on my last 2 phones, s7 and s8.</p></div>		</li>
