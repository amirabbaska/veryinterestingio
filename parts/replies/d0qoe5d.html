			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of fusion research money is spent on simulating warheads and not on power.  </p>
<p>For example the major fusion lab in the USA is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ignition_Facility" target="_blank">NIF</a> which is a bomb lab.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NIF's mission is to achieve fusion ignition with high energy gain, and to support nuclear weapon maintenance and design by studying the behavior of matter under the conditions found within nuclear weapons</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also the largest facility of its type in the world, which says something about how the fusion budget is allocated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.</p>
<p>This is worth emphasising: it doesn’t make sense to think of fusion (or any scientific goal) as being a certain number of years away, but rather a certain investment, perhaps a number of nerd-hours, away from fruition. In many cases, fusion included, more money means that more routes can be explored in parallel more quickly.</p>
<p>We think that fusion will cost somewhere in the region of $100bn to get from the experimental reactors we have now to putting power on the grid. There are 1.1bn people living in the so-called ‘high-income’ countries—basically the rich world. That's less than $100 per person.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It absolutely would, unfortunately gov't funding for research is abysmal next to what it would be if they were serious about alternative energy. Certain private companies like Lockheed are doing their own research, so hopefully they'll be less beholden to big oil and gas going forward on their variation of the project. </p>
<p>There's a massive international collaboration happening right now in Europe called the ITER project, which aims to engineer a viable reactor twice the size of any experimental model in the States, publicly or privately funded. Honestly, the pooling of resources in this fashion seems like the only way to really come up with the right amount of brain power and money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth a note: Current estimate for the first plasma is 2025. In June this year they'll announce an updated schedule leading to the 2025 goal, while last December they delivered components for the cryostat. Milestones are reached every year and a number of employees working on a construction site increases. </p>
<p>So while being badly behind the schedule, they are progressing, and building something that's a bleeding-edge piece of scientific equipment, in fact some of the components couldn't be built when originally planned because the technology required for construction did not mature enough to accomplish the goal. </p>
<p>It's anything but going smoothly, though at the same time - one must be knowledge just how complicated the whole project is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best case scenario is it gets buried by ever cheaper solar panels and batteries,  and 10 kW solar plants on every new house become mandatory.  A massive overbuild of solar becomes so cheap, and obvious that fusion becomes an interesting science project better suited to spaceships than terrestrial commercial deployment.</p>
<p>The grid is stabilized by hydro power and wind farms, and geologically stored hydrogen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Energy production is only one part of the problem.  We also need to solve energy storage.  Not just low density energy storage (so you can keep your lights on at night), but high density energy storage so we can fly commercial jets, etc.</p>
<p>A big potential advantage of nuclear is that the reaction is hot enough that we could thermally split hydrogen off of water.  Hydrogen is has a high energy density/weight.   We do not have batteries with high enough energy to accomplish many tasks, so more innovation is needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think people are underestimating what will happen once anyone can produce a so-called &quot;burning plasma&quot; (meaning a plasma that produces more energy through fusion power than it consumes). Remember what the Wright Brothers' flying machine did? It flew for 12 seconds on a beach in North Carolina, and that was it. That's nothing but a proof of concept, but it sparked a flurry of investment that changed the world forever because private companies and governments saw how valuable it could be. That's what a burning plasma would be: a proof of concept that shows that it's worth further investment. </p>
<p>The promise of fusion energy isn't just that it's an answer to global warming: it's <em>unlimited energy</em>. Energy not limited by time, geography, fuel, or political instability. It's moving us from being energy &quot;hunter-gatherers&quot; to actually making our own energy on Earth, and it's going to be a seminal point in the development of humanity. Fusion energy is the first step into the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuels:
The type of fuel used is important as well. The most common fuels are deuterium, tritium, and helium-3. Deuterium is relatively common (0.0156% of all the hydrogen in seawater is deuterium) and can be separated from seawater. Tritium is produced by neutron activation of lithium. Helium-3 is obtained as a natural decay product of tritium. To use helium-3 as a fuel we would need to be able to store and produce a lot of tritium to collect the helium-3 from. It is no simple task to produce the large amounts of these reactants needed for large scale fusion power, so this also needs to me considered for the economics of fusion power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one is really seriously considering using He-3 for fusion, at least not for the first generation of fusion reactors. </p>
<p>I think you're also over-estimating how much fuel you actually need to run a fusion plant (hint: it's really tiny). 1 kg of fuel is enough to produce about 8 MW of fusion power for an entire year with D-T fusion, and you could power the entire world with fusion using about 3% of current world lithium production. The cost of building the plant and having to replace components will be a much larger part than the fuel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is really tiny, but really expensive. It might be a small part of the big picture but it can't be ignored.</p>
<p>For example, I read that generally 1 tonne of coal can generate 2MWh of electricity. For an 8MW plant running at full capacity for 1 year that is 35040 tonnes of coal. At about $40/tonne that would cost $1,401,600 (please correct me if I'm wrong).</p>
<p>If 1kg of tritium can run an 8MW fusion plant at full capacity for a year, at $30,000/gram that costs $30,000,000. I'm not sure if the 1kg of fuel you quoted includes the deuterium or not.</p>
<p>A fusion power plant is also going to cost much more to build than a coal plant. Granted, if tritium production were to scale up to meet the needs of fusion power plants the cost would likely go down as well, but at current fuel prices, it is not economically viable to run a fusion plant when the same amount of power could be generated with coal for over 20X less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the core questions Iter aims to answer is how to build a breeding wall, that is, using the reactor's processes themselves to speed the process of creating tritium. It then becomes relatively easy to breed tritium in one reactor, use that to start a second reactor, and let it breed the continued tritium needs. </p>
