			<div class="markdown"><p>I just found <a href="https://liquifun.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/how-fast-does-a-bubble-burst/" target="_blank">this article</a>, that also links to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_film#Bursting_of_a_soap_film" target="_blank">this Wiki article</a> - both of which state that the velocity of the propagating edge is a function of surface tension (and density and thickness). Surface tension is directly related to the pressure gradient, where a higher gradient will result in a higher surface tension.</p>
<p>The author guesses at some values and comes up with 10m/s, but that seems slow to me. To the naked eye, a bursting bubble is all but instantaneous. 10m/s isn't <em>slow</em>, but it's slow enough that you'd be able to discern some motion in a bursting bubble, especially larger bubbles. Someone else mentioned 100m/s, but then deleted their comment. I could see it being somewhere around there, but by all accounts it seems to be much lower than the speed of sound of the medium.</p>
<p>I wonder, for <em>all</em> bubbles with identical surfaces (i.e. the same soap/water mixture), in identical environments, would the pressure gradient and surface tension always be the same? It seems that the bubble would grow/shrink until the surface surface tension and pressure gradient were in an equilibrium unique to that particular surface. Different types of bubbles would reach their own equilibrium, but all bubbles of the same type would have identical gradients and tensions - and thus identical velocities of propagation of the breaking edge.</p>
<p>For example, it would be like inflating a party balloon and a hot water bottle with the same amount of air. The party balloon would have a much larger volume at equilibrium, and all party balloons would reach the same equilibrium volume as one another (assuming identical physical properties).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think pressure gradient is a red herring in this case. Surface tension on a spherical bubble would cause a pressure inside the bubble, but pressure doesn't influence the tension in a significant way. </p>
<p>An example would be a thin film of soapy water inside a ring. Popping the center will still cause the surface to collapse like a bubble pops, however there is no pressure difference.</p>
<p>I see no reason to doubt the derivation made by your first link. By all accounts it's a simple energy balance between work done by the surface and kinetic energy. Unless you have experimental data to contradict the 10 m/s ballpark, your intuition is likely wrong. Anyway, this isn't a case I would rely on intuition for, because how 10 m/s is extremely fast for a small object like a bubble. If it's 5 cm across, it would take about 0.0075s to pop if you consider that the break has to travel half the circumference in any direction.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The causation is the other way around: Higher surface tension means that a bubble (at equilibrium) needs a higher pressure differential (given the same volume). You can actually <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/surten2.html" target="_blank">calculate it</a> quite easily, which probably answers the remainder of those questions.</p>
<p>Without anything to back it up, I would expect the following quantities to be the primary factors in the speed of collapse:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The pressure differential, which provides the energy for breaking the surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The stiffness and yield limit of the material, or how much work is needed to tear up the surface. Note that higher pressure differentials mean that you are closer to the yield limit already (up to the point where e.g. a balloon bursts) and thus less work is needed.</p>
</li>
<li>Maybe surface tension is involved (in another way than dictating the pressure differential), but I wouldn't have a hypothesis for whether it increases or decreases the speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think if you look into crack propagation mechanics you might find an approach that works here too, although I'm not 100% confident that those theories are applicable to fluids. In any case, I agree that the speed of sound (in the material where it's higher) should be the upper limit for how fast the bursting can propagate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well 10m/s is about 36 km/h so for a bubble a little bigger than a pool ball that would be pretty much instant for something so small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first thought was the speed of sound too. But then I remembered that I have taken photos of kids playing with bubbles and caught prettycrisp images of partially popped bubbles 1-3 feet across. At ~5000 feet/sec (SoS in water), even with a 1/4000 shutter, the edge of the break would be blurred more than a foot, and very unlikely to luck into timing right. Since the edges of the pop are unblurred in my photos shot at 1/1000, the biggest speed must be three of orders of magnitude slower than the speed of sound.</p></div>		</li>
