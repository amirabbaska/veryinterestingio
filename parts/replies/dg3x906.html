			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if our ability to create more compact storage will exceed our ability to produce video, in the long run. As long as the videos aren't taking up more physical space, there shouldn't too much of an issue keeping videos for years and years and years. </p>
<p>I'm sure YouTube will eventually delete videos that are 10+ years without any views. There's gotta be a lot of shit on YouTube that no one would noticed if it was gone. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Aw, I've been using YouTube for some personal storage baackuo of my home videos.  I'd hate for those to get deleted.  Hopefully they'd post notices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah usually when companies do this kind of stuff they allow you to opt out. They'd probably have a simple checkbox to save your videos from automatic deletion. </p>
<p>But who knows, they don't make any money as a video backup service. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tech will get better, cheaper, and smaller. We can store a terabyte of information on something the size of a fingernail. Twenty years ago that would have taken a massive stack of hard drives or CDs. Twenty years from now, they'll be able to store the entirety of human knowledge in a drop of water or some shit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For example, <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/134672-harvard-cracks-dna-storage-crams-700-terabytes-of-data-into-a-single-gram" target="_blank">Harvard was able to store 700TB of data in a gram of DNA.</a> but theoretically, 1 gram of DNA could hold 455 EB of data, which is likely larger than all of YouTube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's already a problem in advanced data storage and processing technologies. Unfortunately there likely isn't an easy solution unless an entirely new technology is developed. But error checking is good at catching most mistakes. Also, for something like video, there is a high likelihood that an error wouldn't even be noticed by the user as it would result in a single pixel being incorrect for a few milliseconds. This is also the case for audio storage, image storage is a little more problematic with visible errors, and text/number storage can be very badly affected by a single error. But these last two have the advantage of needing less space, so it is viable to use less space efficient methods to store them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few people already mentioned it. Most likely scenario is that at least archiving storage tech could emerge where you might have a block/brick of some material that can store billions of tb indefinitely. Retrieval is slow but one brick replaces hundreds of server farms. Or there might be some other tech like gooey tray of dna that stores info. </p></div>		</li>
