This is acheived by raising the temperature of your alcohol/water mixture to above the boiling temperature of alcohol,  but below the boiling temperature of water. The alcohol turns into vapor then is &quot;caught&quot; on a cool surface and run into a collection container. For example, ethanol boils at 173 F and water at 212. So to get the ethanol out you bring the mixture to 173 F and most of the vapor that comes off is ethanol.</p>
<p>Here is the catch-- besides ethanol (the good stuff), there are a bunch of trace alcohols and other compounds in your  batch natural to the fermentation process . When you are distilling, your still will dive off each compound as it approaches its respecive boiling temperature. The first  to come off is Methanol at 149 F (mostly Methanol, you will have trace removal of a wide range of compounds at all temperatures). This is poisonous and must be separated and discarded. Your process will not want to pass 149 F until most of the Methanol is driven off. </p>
<p>Around 160 F you will get mostly light compounds like aldehydes and acetone, with some smaller percent of ethanol (distillers call the the HEADS). Next ethanol (mostly) will strip off around 173 F. These are the purest &quot;cuts&quot; of the distillation-- distillers call this the HEARTs. As you creep towards 195 F, you get heavier alcohols and other compounds-- distillers call this TAILS. The HEADS and TAILS can be redistlled to try and further separate the non-ethanol compounds and get more HEARTS.</p>
<p>All of these  cuts will have ethanol. While you can drink the HEADS (roughly 40% ethanol), HEARTS (95ish% ethanol), and TAILS (60ish % ethanol) they are not all equivlent. Usually the HEADS is reguarded as the worst part and will have an &quot;off flavor&quot; and give you a nasty hangover. The TAILS can be used to blend to get a more complex flavor that is sometimes desired for barrel aged spirits, however it is reguarded to give you more a hang over. </p>
<p>So good vodka is almost pure ethanol and will contain all HEARTS (and distilled water to make it 40% ethanol). </p>
<p>Cheap vodka will have HEADS, HEARTS, and TAILS because the producer is trying to maximize profits by not discarding distillate-- and also this gives you a wicked hangover. This is true for most cheap alcohols. The off flavors can be covered with sugar or flavoring, but as others have mentioned, these also may contribute towards a hangover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for taking the time to type that all out! I was getting mad over the top comment (edit: no longer top comment) and was going to chime in but I couldn’t have said it better than you.
To add a little, all alcohol (ethanol) will give you a hangover to some degree. As the ethanol is metabolized the metabolites (mainly acetaldehyde) can make you feel pretty bad in high enough quantities.
Drinking more water can help with dehydration which also contributes to hangovers and may slightly speed up the elimination process, although, your metabolism of the ethanol just has to run its course and will mostly go at its own pace.
The MAIN reason why hangovers from CHEAP spirits are worse are because of what you said, which is what the main question was asking, not “what causes hangovers in general” as most people here seem to have read.
And filtering vodka thru a filter will not filter out methanol. You’re more likely to strip off all kinds of shit that the filter might have in it that are soluble in alcohol but not in water. That’s a fucking stupid idea. If there is any acetone in your cheap vodka that will also remain in the filtered alcohol and will bring along with it anything it can dissolve from the filter along the way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a professional distiller. This is true. The only discrepancy I have is your ethanol numbers during the three stages of cuts. That’s a variable that can be controlled by temperature, and depending on the base spirit, has to be regulated and controlled according to TTB. Hearts cuts can be anywhere from 140 proof to 195, they will never be 80 proof until the end of the run, that’s just basic efficiency.</p>
<p>Usually the 80 proof is also the rails and will be redistilled. Drinkable 80 proof spirit is cut back down with water after being distilled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. Looking at other responses it appears I was off with the methanol, I was remembering an article I read 17 years ago and just pulled a random, harmful alcohol out of nowhere.</p></div>		</li>
