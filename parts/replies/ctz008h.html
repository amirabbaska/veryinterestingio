<p>That's a better average speed estimate. Now we could do the same for seconds.... milliseconds.... and as we approach the smallest time value (aproaching zero) you get a very good average speed estimate. </p>
<p>That's a fairly roughshod intro to integral calculus. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And when you say you're approaching zero it means that you repeated the step of choosing a smaller time slice over and over. In fact, if you did it manually you'll never actually reach zero. Calculus gives you a formula to simulate breaking the time slice down an infinite amount of times, to an infinitely small period of time, and then adding up an infinite number of data points. </p>
<p>When you understand it and stare at what you've calculated you realize you captured infinity in a little formula... Three times over! </p>
<p>You've done three impossible things and distilled it into a little formula. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation of this. At first in calculus I was confused about the fact that it was the sum of an infinite amount of infinitely small pieces. I was confused how you could get a finite number from that. Looking back it still kind of blows my mind. Calculus is cool.</p></div>		</li>
