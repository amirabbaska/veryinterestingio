			<div class="markdown"><p>its not one circulatory system. its the full circulatory systems of both mice. still full double volume for full double pumping power. they are just connected</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>gravedig, but i recently heard TWC, the one who did the aging study at stanford, at a seminar. some things to add:</p>
<p>TWC only just create a wound and sutured animals together. There was no deviating nerves or redirecting vasculature. the vasculature naturally anastomosed and iirc, it was capillary connections, so that would be my guess as to why blood pressure wasn't as big a deal as you would imagine. </p>
<p>anyways, following the procedure and recovery, TWC's mice were surprisingly fine. they built nests (so presumably, they weren't too distressed) and lived up to a year. In mice time, that's actually pretty old. they were like, &quot;transfusions? yeah whatever.&quot;</p>
<p>Pretty cool stuff. TWC's now got a company that's doing something with transfusions. And evidently because transfusions are such a routine procedure in medicine, the fda didn't even bother looking over his stuff. By the way, he is totally aware of the fact that his shit sounds creepy. i thought that was pretty funny for some reason. i was almost expecting him to completely ignore the fact that he sewed two mice together like frankenstein haha. fun guy.</p></div>		</li>
