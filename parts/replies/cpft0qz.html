			<p>Fortunately, only about 59% of the moon is actually visible to Earth, due to tidal locking and librations, so you could achieve the desired results at about 2/3 the cost.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking#The_Moon" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking#The_Moon</a></p>		</li>

			<p>A question occurs to me. If we were to do this how much additional radiation pressure would we add and how greatly would we perturb the moon's orbit?</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't know enough physics to calculate an answer, but the moon is heavy and radiation pressure is weak so I'm going to go with something on the atomic scale i.e. negligible.</p>		</li>

			<p>Oh most definitely small but never the less it would be interesting. I may take a shot at figuring it out later.</p>		</li>

			<p>There has to be some aluminium on the moon, let's send robot refineries up there instead, we'll save a ton on fuel !</p>		</li>

			<p>Or haul an asteroid that has al, then start melting it with a solar mirror and spray it onto the moon's surface like paint. </p>		</li>

			<p>Would a neon orange moon reflect more light than a tin foil moon? </p>		</li>

			<p>No, reflective foil would be reflecting vary nearly all light that shines on it. Neon orange would reflect only/mostly orange light while all other wavelengths are absorbed. </p>		</li>

			<p>He's got a point, though. Neon paint works by turning UV radiation into visible light. So we might use special white paint doing the same.</p>		</li>

			<p>It all depends on the albedo of the two materials. Aluminium/Aluminum has an albedo of 0.8, meaning it reflects roughly 8 out of every 10 photons hitting the surface (The other 2 are absorbed)<br><br>I'm not sure of the albedo of a neon orange material as it depends on what the material is, whether it has a clear coat, what kind of paint it is, the shade of orange, etc. If the albedo is lower than 0.8, it would reflect less light back.<br><br>Expanding on that, only orange light would be reflected back as the rest would be absorbed.</p>		</li>

			<p>The aluminium foil box I have lying around contains a 30cm x 30m sheet, that's 9m^2 . You'd need 4.22*10^12 (4.22 Trillion) of those.</p>		</li>

			<p>30 cm by 30 cm is not 9 m. More like .09 m^2. We'd need about 460 trillion. </p>		</li>

			<p>You are right and wrong.  30cm by 30 cm is indeed 0.09m^2, however the parent said 30m not 30cm.  A 30 metre roll of 30 cm wide foil is 9 square metres.</p>		</li>
