			<div class="markdown"><p>Biological clocks work in the way I described, to most people. In case of late night workers, for example, you will initially have what is called a Shift Worker Sleep Disorder... You will have to work at night but your BRAIN feels it is time to sleep. That is when many workers fall a sleep in the workplace. When they get home ti finally get some sleep, they cant because they have insomnia during daytime (like most people). As your brain adapts to your New routine, you will have a Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder. Your brain will start to  produce less melatonin at night.  You will usually feel insomnia at night and you can only sleep during the morning. That makes you suitable to  work late at night, but if you ever start working during daytime again, you will find it Hard to adapt yourself to this New routine. </p></div>		</li>
