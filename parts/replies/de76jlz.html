<p>So, you have an exact definition there. This allows derived units to be exact as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>right, and those transitions are governed by quantum mechanics. And one can't precisely tell how may transitions will actually occur in a tau of 1 second. Let alone 1/299792458 of a second. One can accurately measure how may transitions occur with a tau of 6 months to a year. Here is a rub, if you take two different Cs and run them for a year. they will still count a different number. So which clock is right? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconds used to be measured this way but then they moved to regular and predictable electrical pulses from squeezing a crystal (piezoelectric) and many watches still keep time in this way. You can also use math and the period of a pendulum to measure seconds. </p>
<p>But today our second is defined by the atomic clock. We use the accurate and predictable emissions of radioactive isotopes, notably a Cesium isotope. These clocks can be accurate to the order of one second of runout over 30 million years. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It has nothing to do with radioactivity. We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium" target="_blank">Cesium 133</a>, which is <em>not</em> radioactive. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium_standard" target="_blank">frequency standard</a> is based on microwave radiation (about 9.2 GHz) that is produced by &quot;electronic transitions between the two hyperfine ground states of caesium-133 atoms&quot;. Again, this radiation has to do with <em>electronic</em> states and not nuclear states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The meter used to be defined differently, and under that definition, the speed of light was measured to be about 299792458 m/s. Then, to update the definition, they just swapped it round, defining the speed of light as 299792458 m/s, and deriving the meter from there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of these answers are at least a little bit wrong. A meter was originally a fraction of the curvature of the earth, one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the north pole. Not arbitrary but not perfect either.</p>
<p>As others have said, a metal bar prototype meter was created to standardize the unit in the 1800s. This, as it sounds, is a tiny bit goofy and archaic so the unit was eventually locked to a universal constant.</p>
<p>I would also prefer the 1/300,000,000 or better yet 1/1,000,000,000 light seconds (~1ft). I figure if you're gonna reform, do it all the way. 1/299792458 light seconds is almost as silly as locking your unit to the size of some random person's foot at defined by a chunk of metal kept in a temperature controlled vault. </p></div>		</li>
