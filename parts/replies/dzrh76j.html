			<div class="markdown"><p>Those aren't usually used by firefighters, simply because we don't know the condition of the hose, it may be dry rotted, subjected to vandalism, etc. Building codes typically require them simply because it's grandfathered in, or in the event a resident/occupant of the building feels they can use it quickly to stop a fire. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve seen quite a few places where the hoses have been removed the past few years from these boxes. Is there a reason for this in the fire code. Someone said it had to do with preventing residents from trying to fight a fire that is too large for the untrained person to knock down.</p></div>		</li>
