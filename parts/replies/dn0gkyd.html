			<div class="markdown"><p>The term emotional response can also be a bit misleading. Modern pain science certainly addresses non purely physiological processes, but rather than just emotional, it's more the brain weighing a whole lot of factors (previous experience, underlying knowledge, current context and yes, individual emotional response to pain). Because it's all happening at the pre-conscious level, it's very difficult to consciously change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense. Personally I'd say I have a higher pain tolerance. I work in construction so I've definitely had my share of accidental pain tests. But I also have something called vasovagal syncope that has happened several times when I've had deep cuts. Basically certain things can trigger the vagus nerve to react in the body and for me, has slowed down blood flow and I pass out. It's happened about 5 times, typically when I've cut myself deep enough to need stitches. I don't remember the pain bothering me, but I've never been able to control the lightheaded feeling and blurred vision that follows. All I can do is lay down and try to keep blood going to my brain so I don't pass out haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This vasovagal syncope happens to me when I get IV's/blood drawn. I have a major irrational fear of needles. I also break out in like a full body sweat and when it's bad I get nauseous. But have never actually thrown up from it. Very strange bodily reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not the only one! I've never had an episode from a cut, but when I was younger, I'd pass out if I got hit a certain way on the elbow or upper arm. I also would consider my pain tolerance to be fairly high, but vasovagal syncope is a very automatic thing. Even if it didn't hurt badly, I'd get dizzy within seconds and have to lay down voluntarily, or else my body would do it for me. Thankfully I seem to have grown out of it mostly.</p>
<p>The nervous system is insanely complicated, and at times, pretty weird. </p>
<p>EDIT: Something else kind of funny is that I'm a redhead - we're supposed to be genetically predisposed to have a lower pain threshold for certain kinds of pain responses. But that definitely hasn't been my personal experience. I barely notice things that other people seem to feel strongly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also consider myself to have a high pain tolerance, and I <em>used</em> to have a high resistance to that vasovagal response. when I was younger I've watched large needles going into my arm without an issue, I've watched stitches being applied and removed, I've had really deep cuts that went half way through my finger bones and it didn't bother me a bit to clean the wound and drive myself to the E.R, I watched marrow-covered pins being pulled out the end of my fingers from that same injury even though the doctor tried to hide my view so I wouldn't pass out, and that didn't bother me... </p>
<p>But that was all when I was younger, for some reason lately that response has gotten super strong. I tried giving blood recently and had to stop partway through because just thinking about the needle while it was in my arm made me nearly pass out. Another time recently I had a fairly small cut that only required a bandaid, but just looking at it in the mirror made me almost pass out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought I had a high pain tolerance until about a week ago. I had inflammation and fluid in my shoulder, and I literally couldn't move it because it was so painful. Dr had to aspirate it to get the fluid out and verify if it was infected or not. I swear that needle had to be 6 inches. I ask him if it's going to hurt like a shot or more or what? He says, yea it's gonna hurt a little more than that, and your already sore so it's going to hurt. I ask if there's a way to numb it and he tells me, he'd have to stick a needle in to numb it, then another needle to pull the fluid and it works out better if he doesn't. </p>
<p>Initial poke, not so bad more than a shot.....Then I could feel it sliding through the tissues and getting closer to the inflammation and it really fucking hurt. As its going in he says ok I'm about to the fluid, you may wanna grab something or prepare for this. Me: &quot;Uh what the fuck&quot;. Then I could feel that fucking needle break through into the pocket of fluid. Worst pain Ive ever had in life. I literally yelled &quot;FUCK&quot;, he was like &quot;let it out homie, it will be over in a few seconds.&quot; Then I could feel the fluid being sucked out of my shoulder, and while it was a relief, it was still oh so painful.</p>
<p>I asked to look at the fluid, it just looked like cloudy/dirty gray water.... Thanks Dr. Price, I'll never forget that pain as long as I live.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think part of it is conditioning.  Some people grow getting hurt all the time so when they do get hurt later in life they are conditioned to tolerate the experience better than others.  For example I grew up doing physical activities, sports, climbing trees, doing stupid stuff.  Broke my back riding my dirt bike when I was 15.  By the time I broke my wrist when I was 21 I actually thought I was fine till the doctor told me I broke my wrist, not just a fracture, snapped the bone in half.  Told the doctor he was wrong, it didn't hurt that bad.  Two days later I had a surgery to bolt a metal plate on to my wrist to hold it together.  The post surgery was fucking painful but the break itself felt ok.</p>
<p>Just my own 2 cents based on my own experience.</p></div>		</li>
