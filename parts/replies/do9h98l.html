			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same thought. Mathematically, if you were to regularly replenish say 5% of the volume with outside air, you would eventually fluctuate around a 95%+ nitrogen environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well this is probably a solvable math problem.  At least, a problem that's very, very close to this one is solvable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What would the gas inside a tire look like if we were continually refilling it with air from the atmosphere to replace the gas that permeates the rubber?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's do some math.  Let's say the atmosphere's 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen.  The permeability of rubber to oxygen and nitrogen, relative to hydrogen, is given <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ScientificPapers/nbsscientificpaper387vol16p327_A2b.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and appears to be 0.445 and 0.16, respectively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the paper gives the rates at which <em>both gases</em> permeate rubber when in a mixture - that mixture just so happens to be the garden-variety atmosphere - where these two ratios hold up.  So we can assume the rate at which the gas permeates the rubber depends only upon it's partial pressure in the tire and it's permeability (0.445 or 0.16) and nothing else.</p>
<p>So: since we're <em>postulating</em> that we're refilling the tire at precisely the same <em>aggregate rate</em> as it's allowing these two gasses to permeate the rubber at their respective rates, we just have to set the rate (<strong>R</strong>) at which nitrogen permeates the rubber at four times (due to the 80/20 ratio of N to O) that of oxygen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>R<em><em>N2</em></em> = 0.160 <em> PP</em><em>N2</em>*</p>
<p>R<em><em>O2</em></em> =  0.445 <em> PP</em><em>O2</em>*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But note, those partial pressures are related.  PP<em><em>O2</em></em> = 1 - PP<em><em>N2</em></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>R<em><em>N2</em></em> = 0.160 <em> PP</em><em>N2</em>*</p>
<p>R<em><em>O2</em></em> = 0.445 <em> (1 - PP</em><em>N2</em>*)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now set the rates to a 4:1 ratio to match the incoming gas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>R<em><em>N2</em></em> = 4 <em> R</em><em>O2</em>*</p>
<p>0.160 <em> PP</em><em>N2</em><em> = 4 </em> (0.445 <em> (1 - PP</em><em>N2</em><em>)) = 1.78 </em> ( 1 - PP<em><em>N2</em></em> )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these subscripts are getting tiresome.  x = PP<em><em>N2</em></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>0.160x = 1.78 ( 1 - x ) = 1.78 - 1.78x</p>
<p>0.16x + 1.78x = 1.78</p>
<p>1.94x = 1.78</p>
<p>x = 0.9175</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it looks like the final ratio of nitrogen to oxygen, at equilibrium, will be 91.75% to 8.25%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean 1%?</p>
<p>Regularly adding an 80:20 mix to a volume always tending to 100:0 and adding 5% volume gives something like an addition of 1% of oxygen to the total system. </p>
<p>I probably misunderstood you; it's the most common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's mathematically but not necessarily the reality in physics. There are, for example, azeotropix mixtures that let liquids boil at lower temperatures than their actual boiling point.
Perhaps oxygen leaking out would &quot;drag&quot; the nitrogen out too in a similar way.
Don't know if there is something similar in play or not. Just saying that it's a possibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, eventually the partial pressures will be equal on both sides and no more mass transfer will occur.  Since the outside oxygen pressure is nonzero, the inside will be nonzero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually used to have to test some of these systems as part of my job. Most of those exact same nitrogen fill systems are a complete scam. Baseline for air we breath is 78.09%. The average nitrogen compressor used in tire shops only puts a 85-90% nitrogen rate in the tires. Not to mention tires are no longer simply rubber. The amount of chemical compounds and components such as silica have changed the permeation rates dramatically. Realistically speaking, the UTQG rating on the tire is the best indicator of how the tire will perform. A tire with a high temperature, speed and load rating will always hold air longer than one with lower ratings. Simply because the compounds used to make the tire are so different than the budget tire. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a minor scandal in the UK last year after a scuba instructor used his test equipment to check his nitrogen-filled tyres and discovered it was just normal air.  He contacted a consumer TV programme who took up the case, performed more tests, and discovered that many garages were charging customers extra for nitrogen fills (often without their knowledge) and then just using air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, because it’s dry and inert, nitrogen expands/contracts more evenly with changing temperatures(dry)  and doesn’t cause corrosion(dry &amp;inert). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogen is used in high pressure (120psi+) tyres like aircraft and huge off-road mining trucks. This is because at 120+ psi the oxygen partial pressure in air can combust with the rubber. Also the huge temperature changes aircraft tyres are subject to in short times is a problem with moisture and corrosion.
None of this applies to car tyres. It's a marketing toy to take money from you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Marketing nitrogen as something that's used in airplanes and nascar and such is the marketing ploy. The benefits of nitrogen in your every day car are pretty much exclusive to not needing to air them up as often since they don't lose pressure as quickly. That part is still very much a real benefit. There is a very small benefit of aiding in more even tire wear but that is minuscule in comparison to just simply rotating your tires frequently and having your alignment checked every 12k miles or so.</p>
<p>Now is it worth what some shops charge? That's debatable. If they give it to you for free when you purchase the car (PLT: it's not free) then they most likely will refill for free. There's no reason not to continue using it as long as you can get back to get topped off. Of course, there's a good chance they're probably just throwing air in your tires and letting your sit for 15-20mins while they pretend to nitro the tires. </p>
<p>I've worked in a handful of dealership shops and have visited many others. Most techs/mechanics don't want to waste their time putting nitrogen in your tires since it doesn't pay them anything and takes too much time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well and the fact that the atmosphere is 80% nitrogen already. I believe tire places nitrogen is in the 90-95% range. So, really if you aren't getting it for free it's a marketing ploy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe he is referring to 100% nitrogen as opposed to air. Air will have water vapor in addition to other fractions that are not as fun for the inside of a tire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dry in this case means there is no water vapor in the nitrogen gas. Water vapor would be able to condense inside the tire under the right conditions and liquid water can cause damage to unprotected wheels or the valve. This same thing happens in air compressor tanks which is why you see water spraying out when the bottom air dump valve is opened after the compressor has run for a while, especially in humid climates. That spray may appear rusty if the water is rusting (corroding) the tank from the inside. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, nitrogen has no water vapor, unlike air. Air from an air compressor will be at near 100% humidity, unless there's a refrigerated dryer on it. Now, the tire pressure is less than the shop air supply pressure, so the humidity in your tires will be similarly reduced. (If you fill a tire to 35 psi from a 120 psi 100% humidity supply, you'll have 37% humidity in the tire or so, which is probably dry enough.)</p>
<p>But commercial nitrogen is made by cryogenic distillation of air. All the water condenses and freezes out during that process, so the result is exceedingly dry gas. It has a dew point down around the boiling point of nitrogen (or less, I don't think the water is soluble in the liquid nitrogen) when in the 3000 psi supply tank, and lower than that when brought down to near atmospheric pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, dry nitrogen contains no/little water vapor.  Water vapor tends to cause more pressure fluctuation with temperature than any of the other air constituants, due to condensation.</p></div>		</li>
