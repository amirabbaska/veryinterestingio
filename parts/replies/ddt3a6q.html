			<div class="markdown"><p>So why does Tropicana orange juice always taste the same? It's not from concentrate, so wouldn't it be using different oranges at different points in the year? The bottle says it's made from Florida oranges, sometimes with South American oranges too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because their orange juice is highly oxidized to preserve it which kills the natural flavors.  What you taste is 100% additive flavors.
Edit:  correction - the juice has oxygen removed </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would oxidation reactions preserve the product? </p>
<p>That is also not how orange juice flavor packs work--they are not &quot;additives&quot;, but are recollected flavor volatiles released when juice is heated (to reduce the microbial load and keep the consumer safe, this is the preservation step). They add those compounds that were naturally present in fresh juice back at a level the formulator has decided is comparable to what occurs in nature, likely via some pretty intense analytical and sensory testing. </p>
<p>Thermal processing is what makes normal orange juice taste like death compared to fresh, but it just wouldn't make it to your table if they didn't thermally process. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Is there a better brand that is widely available? I love orange juice, but I hate concentrate stuff. Tropicana tastes better than most of the stuff in stores.</p>
<p>Obviously fresh squeezed is going to be better, but that isn't always practical or available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it say it has any &quot;natural flavoring&quot;? A lot of times OJ IS DEOXYGENATED in holding tanks which allow it to be stored for a year, which means they can still mix juices without making concentrate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done a little research, and Tropicana doesn't need to list any other ingredients on it's label. They use flavoring that is derived from natural ingredients apparently (I don't know what they are though), so they don't even need to list them. Thus, they can claim &quot;100% orange juice&quot;.</p>
<p>Apparently they got sued over this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, the main reason that company's make concentrate orange juice is that it is much cheaper to remove 70% of the volume and then transport it.
After the oranges have been processed and the juice collected, thermal treatment is applied, following this around 70% of the water is boiled from the orange juice, then it is pumped into tankers and transported to the final bottling location or storage silo's. Once it gets to the final packaging and bottling location, water is added to create the orange juice you drink.
Cheap non branded stuff will dilute the orange juice much more than other reputable company's which is why some brands taste like shit.</p>
<p>Sauce: Dad worked as director of tanker operations for transit of ingredients (e.g. Liquid chocolate, orange juice and milk)for companies such as Cadbury's and Innocent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another part is shipping costs, concentrates are cheaper to ship; reduced weight and bulk. Water for reconstitution is available anywhere you want to ship the concentrate.</p></div>		</li>
