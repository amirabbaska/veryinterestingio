			<div class="markdown"><p>It is the same or at least a very similar phenomenon.  </p>
<p>Your brain sees words, not letters.  If you look at a word too long, it decomposes into letters, and if you look at letters too long, they become squiggles.  The meaning of a letter has nothing to do with the shape of the squiggle, and the meaning of the word has nothing to do with the individual letters, so you have two disconnects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a graphic designer and when I'm quickly scrolling through typefaces on a certain word, after seeing that word in 20+ different styles the word looks wrong and I start doubting if I've spelled it. Must be the same thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And of course one can always reduce any one squiggle into sub-squiggles. Or see it as a subordinate squiggle in a bigger squiggle, but there's no fixed rule about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a play that I have performed more than four hundred times and at this point the whole thing feels like it's been broken down into the many thousands of sounds that make it up. Sometimes when the curtain comes down,I don't know if I even said words at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More specifically, the idea is that the neurons associated with the semantic (meaning) part of your perception of the word become fatigued, so there only thing left is the syntactic (sound) component. A sound without an associated meaning is gibberish, therefore you perceive the sound as gibberish.</p></div>		</li>
