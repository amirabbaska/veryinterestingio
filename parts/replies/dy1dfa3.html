<p>It wasn't popular, it just was the only stuff available.  You literally could not find weed without seeds and stems when I started smoking weed in the early 90s.  By the early 2000s better weed was around and coming down in price.  Now I haven't seen a marijuana seed in a decade.  The industry is putting out a more refined product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was always a matter of who you know; the fact that unfertilized plants were more potent has been known for decades. There were songs in the 1970s that mentioned it and even one of George Washington's letters to his slaves instructed them to remove the males from the crop after they had collected the seeds of several generations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah i started mid 90s and would still frequently get bags of shake and stems. We'd still hand over $10 because what choice was there. I remember around 95 or 6 Northern Lights came around and it was a total game changer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually suspect that several species of cannabis plant seeds have been collected for storage in doomsday seed vaults for several decades.</p>
<p>Despite the governments of the world declaring cannabis a 'bad plant',  preserving genetic diversity is one of the prime mandates of seed vaults as for every plant species lost, the world loses the impact its genetic potential might have in safeguarding global food supplies and potential medical benefits.</p></div>		</li>
