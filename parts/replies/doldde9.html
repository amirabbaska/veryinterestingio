			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall a story (take it with a grain of salt) that there were Miners or steelworkers who, and the end of a shift, would come home and crave salt sandwiches - literally just a sandwich, butter and liberal amounts of salt - due to the constant heat and physical effort causing more or less constant heavy sweating throughout the day and their body craving salt to replenish it.</p>
<p>I know I've also craved salt after doing a long bike ride on a hot night, and feeling like I was about to collapse unless I ate something really salty. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Years ago my treeplanting crew and I used to go jogging in Florida in extreme heat at the end of the day. We would take salt pills and drink a lot of water first. Kept us from getting crampy and nauseated. Salt pills stopped being used at some point for athletes but they worked well. I'd run 6 miles, some of the guys ran farther.
We would sometimes also buy half gallons of ice cream on the way home and split one between each two people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that's true. I figured OP didn't specify any heavy activity, and the average diet isn't vaguely short in carbs or salt.  </p>
<p>Love the pun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeh salt is USD to make your muscles worn in essence (huge simplification) and salt is also lost in your sweat.</p>
<p>I make a point to eat something relatively salty if I know I'll need it (such as post gym after a hard session was when I'm in work later at a restaurant).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well interestingly enough there's research being done that suggests the gut talks directly to the brain to dictate what the bacteria require/crave. This doesn't necessarily mean they need sugar, more that they've developed to want it so request more.</p>
<p>I've wondered for years if this was the case ever since watching some documentary years ago that told the story of a man stranded at sea on a lifeboat and survived by eating fish. After a while he didn't want to eat the flesh and instead opted to eat the eyes, skin and other organs, quite possibly due to their nutritional value his body required.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably true, but the effects are likely more subtle than a drive for base nutrients like sugar, carbs and fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's probably a good point for this whole thread. Your body needs nutrition, we're just conditioned by a shitty diet to crave really unhealthy foods</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, after a workout my body roughly signals:</p>
<p><em>I need something cold and liquid, now.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes it's easy to grab the first thing I see but I have to make the decision on what's best for my body at that moment. Soda is definitely not a good response to this urge, for my body anyway.</p></div>		</li>
