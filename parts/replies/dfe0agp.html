			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny you should say that. Makes me think of those signs you get in the UK that say 'heavy plant crossing'. When I was a kid I used to see that sign and think that big heavy flowers were crossing the road there, and it allowed for some hilarious imagery</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you heat up a piece of metal and sit it next to a strong magnet. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. This only works with certain types of metals (ones that are ferromagnetic, like iron/steel, nickel, cobalt, maybe a few others). It does not work with things like aluminum, copper, titanium, zinc, brass, lead, and nearly every other metal.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That's not what's happening at all. In ferromagnetic materials, it realigns the [magnetic domains], not the electrons.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>You can magnetize a piece of steel even without heating it just by putting it near a strong magnet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also do that by simply lining the shaft of the screwdriver up North/South and tapping on a hard surface. No heat or magnet required. The shock of tapping 'loosens up' some of the atoms in the driver, and the magnetic field of the earth lines them up for you. Very weak, but works in a pinch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What he said; eddy currents.</p>
<p>You've got to move the conductor (aluminium in this context) relative to a fixed magnetic field (permanent magnet, DC electro-magnet) to induce a current in the conductor,</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>you have to use an AC electro-magnet (magnetic field constantly increasing or decaying).</p>
<p>The latter method is what allows transformers to work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdycXbVWF9A" target="_blank">This is relevant</a> and fun.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eddy current magnetism is repelling. A/C or fixed field doesn't change that. The aluminum has eddies that oppose whatever change in the field around it. </p>
<p>Recyclers use the eddy effect to slow down or speed up the aluminum pieces during a fall. They then go into a different bin than non metallic bits. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually in most plants that are more than a decade old we just put a big-ass magnet or DC electromagnet on a motor and spin it really fast.</p>
<p>This is due to the high cost of the high frequency driver electronics that would be needed to induce Eddy currents from a stationary coil</p></div>		</li>
