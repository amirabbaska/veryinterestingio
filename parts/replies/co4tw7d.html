			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer your question directly but maybe add something of interest. There are indeed no frames (still composite images) as such in the visual system; the brain doesn't see things frame-by-frame. Actually what happens is that the visual information is separated into lots of different features, such as edges of a given orientation, colour or movement. The information is divided into all these features and processed further and further. Then at the end all this feature information is somehow merged into representations of objects etc. How this &quot;binding&quot; of features happens is as far as I know still very poorly understood, if at all. As for movement, in the relatively late stages of processing there happens a split between information on &quot;what&quot; and object is and &quot;where&quot; it is in space (presumably including movement). These parts of visual information are even processed by anatomically clearly separate pathways. So as you can see the brain works entirely differently than a video recording with frames :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also interesting to think of vision in terms of the &quot;processing power&quot; required to conduct it. While seeing in darkness, the brain devotes almost double the oxygen to processing vision. This is something we are made aware of in pilot training - without supplemental oxygen while flying at night, a person can experience symptoms of hypoxia as low as 5,000 feet because of how hard to brain is working to see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so then riddle me this. I learned that when a wheel turns and we see it as actually spinning in the reverse (because the frames of the camera cannot capture a cycle in such a short amount of time depending on how fast the wheel is spinning) Why does this same phenomenon happen when we look at wheels with our own eyes?</p>
<p>(sorry for the totally improper language, just trying to spit out my thoughts)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A better way to think about it is that your vision emerges over time, more like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOc15-2apY0" target="_blank">progressive jpeg</a>.  Since there is no time = 0 to start vision, where all the neurons are silent, it's hard to say what the framerate would be.  Some regions of the brain can process things extremely quickly without knowing what they are (e.g. you flinch when an object approaches), but others take longer (&quot;is that really Bob I see across the street?&quot;).</p>
<p>We detect things by having neurons fire more.  Neurons can fire in a millisecond, and up to 100Hz.  So we know the first visual information may reach primary visual cortex from the eye in about 10-50 milliseconds.  But it's not &quot;refreshing&quot; at that rate, it's just a lag relative to the original photon hitting a photoreceptor in your eye.  Areas that identify objects reliably dissociate around 200 ms.  But to think that you're refreshing slowly is a misnomer.  You've got areas that are gradually coming online, but the information headed to them is constantly changing.  And you don't have to perform the same operation all the time - if grandma is on your right, and moves a little bit, you don't need to wait 200 ms to figure out that grandma is still there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this guy is good. You can also think about the input as a rolling array of synapses concurrently firing and refreshing. Your visual cortex knows you, and it knows how best to fill in any gaps. </p>
<p>You're able to process time differences in sounds arriving from one ear to the other with your auditory cortex at a temporal acuity of just one millisecond. Once the information is in your auditory cortex, the math can be done on which sound arrived first. (This is actually how we locate the source of low frequency sounds; high frequency sounds are located by an inter-aural intensity difference). </p>
<p>This makes me think, I'd like to do an experiment where people receive visual input of a light into each eye independently, and there a slight delay between the onset of the light from one eye to the other. We could shorten the delay and see what the inter-ocular temporal resolution of the visual system is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An additional point is how much prediction the brain is doing - not everything we see is direct sensory input. A lot of interpolation and guessing happens in the brain, predicting what we'll see next, correcting predictions based on current inputs.</p>
<p>I remember hearing a neuroscientist say in an interview that he believed that our sensory experience may be as little as 10% real-time input and 90% prediction/internal projections. (I don't know how widely his numbers are believed, though.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Excuse me, the <a href="http://www.psy.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/schall/pdfs/TheSuperiorColliculusCh3.pdf" target="_blank">occulomotor system</a> would like a word. These neurons can fire upwards of around 250-300 sp/s. (Figure 3.3, page 63)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun experiment:
Take a video of your eyes while reading (a text with longer lines), and then   again when trying to follow a horizontal line as steadily as possible. Last, try following the line by following a pen tracing the line.</p>
<p>Without following an object, you cannot move the eye without saccadic movement.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's called a smooth pursuit movement and it can only be done when tracking something. As hard as you try, you can't make this smooth movement and you'll find yourself jumping from spot to spot to spot along the page. </p>
<p>Also, rather than take a video of yourself... just ask someone else to try these two tasks and watch their eyes. Much easier! </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes. It's called visual acuity, typically about 1 arcminute (1/60th of a degree).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add to this, a classic physics argument is that this acuity is given by angle lambda/D (in radians) where lambda is the wavelength of light and D is the input aperture (pupil size).</p>
<p>This applies to all optical instruments, and amounts to the smallest dot that can be made by the optics given diffraction effects.</p>
<p>In arcmin, it is (lambda/D)x(360x60)/2pi.  </p>
<p>Assume that lambda=0.5e-6m (green light) and D=0.005 (5mm pupil) we get a resolution of 3.4 arcmin.  The real value is a bit better because the 'smallest dot of light' is really a 'smallest peak' and we can distinguish between partly overlapping peaks of light.</p></div>		</li>
