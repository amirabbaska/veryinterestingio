<p>Also, the analgesic effect will run out well before your lips heal leading to a simple &quot;dependence&quot; on constant reapplication to avoid pain. It may be wise to avoid these balms unless your chapped lips have reached the point where pain is affecting your life.</p>

<p>I  never knew why I was addicted to 'chapstick'. Thanks for the explanation. (I've been using since I was 8/9 years old and it's crazy to think how dependent I am on it.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I became dependent on it after using some anti-acne medication and ended up being addicted to chapstick for <em>years</em>. A similar amount of time to you, recently I lost my chapstick and after a few days of suffering I’ve managed to kick it and don’t think about it. It’s been close to 2 months now, I think. </p></div>		</li>
