			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thank you so much for this answer. </p>
<p>I've been reading all the replies as they've been coming into my inbox and I just think I need to thank you for the insight. May I ask how things are now for you? How long ago was that?</p>
<p>I have so many questions, not necessarily because of the original question (refugees vs. homeless vets) but because I've never met someone who's immigrated to here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hehe np. Things are great.  This was 20 years ago.  I'm in my early 30s now, married with 2 kids, kids are both in school, house (mortgage, will have it paid off in less than 5 years ), cars, full time jobs for both me and wife and we are both college educated...but not working in our fields lol...nice student debt (mine is paid off, still paying for wife's).  No regrets though, as I love my current job, even though I'm working 48 hours a week for the past 4 years and it's getting a bit tiresome.  Mom and dad live close by, few minutes away with a car, delighted to be so close to their grandkids.  Financially, they already paid off their house but they are both still working, dad as a truck driver and mom in a shitty factory, I hope she retires soon, but she refuses to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is awesome. This is the American Dream. It's really amazing how people come from so little (don't take that the wrong way) and make a life for themselves, reading stories like yours reminds me that the world isn't such a shitty place after all. Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of people who get taken in by the types of Facebook posts you mentioned elsewhere and anti-foreigner rhetoric are also people who have never met immigrants. I've always been really pro-immigration but as I've spent more time in cities and now have ended up in Queens, I'm so much more fired up about it. My scientific belief is that it takes three native born people to match the drive and work ethic of an immigrant, whether they're here as legal immigrants, refugees, or illegally here. I myself am native born, and I would die if I had to work as hard as my neighbors.  I've seen the guy who owns the deli I like sleeping standing up behind the counter. And then every time they turn on the tv or read a paper, it's a debate about whether they're destroying America and draining our resources. I would never actually fight someone but I feel like I could just smack stupid Trump and I keep seeing people on Facebook agreeing with him about refugees. He has never worked hard a day in his life compared to people who just got here and are trying to make it. </p>
<p>Anyway, what I really wanted to say is that since you are a curious person, it's pretty cool to volunteer with immigrants and refugees if you can find an opportunity. It's helpful for people to have native speakers to chat with, you don't need special skills. And I just think to be good citizens we need to interact with each other, I've volunteered in prisons and schools before too. It's important to understand these things at a personal level. It's good to ask a lot of questions but also good to physically get out and talk to people. I've learned a lot more from my &quot;students&quot; than I've probably taught them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only answer so far that responds to the question from an immigration perspective. Homeless veterans are only one half of the question, so thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See that's the difference between you guys, and most Americans.</p>
<p>Your parents TOOK WHATEVER JOB THEY COULD AND FUCKING SURVIVED. because why? They were grateful to get a fucking job!</p>
<p>I am so sick of hearing how little jobs there are around my area, I work in the entertainment industry here, and we have a fucking board full of open positions, literally, it looks like fucking wallpaper.  Most of these retards around here are too fucking spoiled by the government assistance that they have been getting the past 5 years, that they figure, why would I go work as a Janitor for 9-10 bucks an hour full time, when I can get free medical and 6-800 in food stamps a month!!</p>
<p>I applaud your parents for sticking with a shitty (well probably less shitty from wherever you came from) situation, and making the best of it, and raising some good, hard working children. ( You and your sister).  </p>
<p>Your story shows just how fucking simple life can be, get a job, no matter how little you like it, be thankful for it, stick with it, and good things will happen, and fuck, you may learn some strong morals along the way.</p>
<p>Again, what an inspiring story, your and your family truly achieved 'the american dream'.</p>
<p>Love it.</p></div>		</li>
