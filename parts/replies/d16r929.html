			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm trying to imagine being on one of A's planets.  A main Sun that rises and sets with the days, but there's this other one out there doing weird stuff.  Closer some generations, farther others.  How bright would the light from B be?  Would it cancel out night?  Only when it's on the closer part of its orbit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the wiki article, the stars are as close together as 11 AU (close to distance from the Sun to Saturn) at the closest and 36 AU (think more like the distance between the Sun and Pluto). So if you were on A then the light from B might actually be like a dimly lit room, it certainly wouldn't be like night time. From here, a full moon under ideal conditions has an apparent magnitude of -12.9. The sun from Pluto at apehelion is -18.2 while at Saturn at apehelion it's -21.7. Alpha Centauri B would be about 1 magnitude dimmer than the sun so let's make those -17.2 for Pluto distance and -20.7 for Saturn distance.</p>
<p>Using those values, B would be about 50 times brighter than the brightest full moon at the dimmest and about 1300 times brighter than the brightest full moon. For comparison, the sun is about 400,000 times brighter than the full moon so this wouldn't be comparable to regular daylight but when the stars were closest together it might be like dim indoor lighting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The concept has been tackled in fiction relatively recently, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem" target="_blank"><em>The Three-Body Problem</em></a> by Liu Cixin. Weird, but enjoyable. The second book is even weirder, and the English translation of the third book is scheduled to publish sometime this year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And not so recently in <a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/fwalter/AST389/TEXTS/Nightfall.htm" target="_blank">Nightfall</a> a short story by Isaac Asimov.</p>
<p>Spoilers: a species living in a trinary system consider the very concept of nighttime to be mythical, and when night does come (every few millennia) it drives the entire population violently insane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the likely reason that most bodies are captured in the first place is because they were already in a binary system. The velocity of one body is transferred to the other which usually ejects one of them, leaving the other in orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could 2 stars pass close enough by each other to decelerate and enter a binary system? Kind of like a collision? Could this throw out enough gas to create a 3rd star? Like the Alpha Centauri system? The 2 original stars are in the big orbit and the cloud of gas from the collision became a star that is now in the inner binary?</p></div>		</li>
