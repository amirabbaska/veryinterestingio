			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe OP is asking about the actual explosion and not the result of the explosion.</p>
<p>But what you linked still gives the answer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The explosion at the bottom of the Mariana Trench will create a quickly-expanding spherical cavity of hot steam... The bubble grows to about a kilometer across in a couple of seconds. The water above bulges up, though only slightly, over a large area. Then the pressure from that six miles of water overhead causes it to collapse. Within a dozen or so seconds, the bubble shrinks to a minimum size, then ‘bounces’ back, expanding outward again. It goes through three or four cycles of this collapse and expansion before disintegrating into, in the words of the 1996 report, “a mass of turbulent warm water and explosion debris.” </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember seeing the re-expansion of a bubble like that on TheSlowMoGuys.</p>
<p>They were shooting a pistol underwater and noticed the bubble would pulsate underwater a few times before finally disappearing.</p>
<p>EDIT : Also seen in the movie Battleship. But with soldiers instead.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Water Cavitation is the name of the effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I'm curious. At what depth would various weapons be unable to expel the projectile without the aid of gravity?</p>
<p>I imagine that once the pressure is high enough, the explosion. Is pretty much contained by the water pressure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorta.  There are two opposing forces:  The weight of the water pushing inward, and the gas pressure increase as it is compressed pushing back outward.  They will oscillate a few times as one beats the other, like a weight on a spring, until they reach a stable equilibrium.  Where does inertia come into play?  Well at some point, as the bubble is getting smaller, the gas-pressure force is higher than the water-pressure force.  But it still compresses a little while longer, because the inertia (movement x mass) of the water takes additional time to slow/stop.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Although your comment still breaks da rulz (because you're not simply supposed to refer to another source; you're supposed to explain things yourself in case the source is overly complicated and the OP still has questions), I'm going to leave it up because, well, I'm not sure you can get any better explanation than Randall's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nuclear device was detonated at a depth of 500 ft (150 m) in deep water. There was little evidence of a fireball. The spray dome rose to a height of 900 ft (270 m). Gas from the bubble broke through the spray dome to form jets which shot out in all directions and reached heights of up to 1,700 ft (520 m). The base surge at its maximum size was 2.5 mi (4.0 km) in diameter and 1,000 ft (300 m) high.</p>
