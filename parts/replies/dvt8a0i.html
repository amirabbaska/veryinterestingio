			<div class="markdown"><p>I roughly estimate the energy released to be on the order of 10^28 Joules. This is equivalent to ~100 billion Tsar bomb or the amount of energy the sun releases in ~30 seconds. It's hard to say how much of this energy would be absorbed by the Earth, but it would certainly leave a nice crater. However, the gravitational binding energy of Earth is ~10^32 Joules, so it wouldn't be completely destroyed.</p></div>		</li>
