			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience there are about 6 reasons why we explore or utilize space: scientific understanding (is there life elsewhere), exploration as a human imperative, cooperation for peaceful purposes, return on investment, encouraging STEM and a hedge against some future catastrophe on Earth. All of these are valid for some interest group and motivate the exploration of Mars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people say that this desire to live on Mars is to ensure the survival of the human race, if and when a large scale extinction event occurs here on Earth. That's a valid reason. We've evolved, with the rest of the world, to pine for the maintenance of our own genetic line. Putting human beings on the face of another planet is a veiled extension of our basic goal in life.</p>
<p>I think it's more our need to explore that hurls is towards the red planet, the insatiable curiosity of mankind. Sure, it'd be cool, but it would also answer the question of 'Can we?' that seems to drive most every innovation. </p>
<p>We've conquered our own environment, living relatively comfortable lives in places too hot and too cold. We've seen the deepest of depths on our home planet, the tip of it's highest peak, and most of what sits in between. For the curious, for the bold, and for the sake of having done so, Mars is next.</p>
<p>I think eventually you'll change your tune. When we land on Mars' surface, and you're watching ~225 million kilometers away, on Earth, in your home with your loved ones beside you, any feeling of 'Why' should slip away. I say now that in that moment, it will be obvious for everyone watching that this was something we were meant to do.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A large scale extinction event is already occuring on earth. To look at just humans misses the point. We'll do this for the dolphins and th elephants and the pandas and the neomammoths. </p>
<p>Also, being mars based kind of points people in the direction of the trillions of dollars floating around in the asteroid belt. And once we are fluent at asteroid, there's saturn's belts, etc. At that point we can be manufacturing large habitats for humans and wildlife and domestic species and newly designed species. </p></div>		</li>

<p>ok but here is my question: if we reach a point where we are able to create a self-sustained colony on mars able to house an important number of people, wouldn't we also be able to create a sel-contained colony on heart isolated from the external environment that can ignore whatever disaster happened? because i can't see any situation where it wouldn't be simpler to just make that same colony on earth to begin with, unless maybe if there's a zombie apocalypse. The colony would have to be completely airtight anyway, so even a deadly super virus wouldn't be a problem, some sort of extreme temperature change would still be nothing compared to the temperature ranges we would have to deal with on mars, you could have a meteorite disintegrate 60% of the world surface and what's left would still be simpler to recolonize than mars</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As with previous comment there doesn't seem to be a single answer that satisfies everyone. My sense is that Mars would initially be like an Antarctic science outpost - dedicated to looking presence of past or even extant life on Mars. To be able to have a sustainable operation would require &quot;living off the land&quot; and using the water ice, atmosphere and soil of Mars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems more achievable for a mars colony to offer a service. Like if it was an asteroid mining colony and traded with Earth mined commodities for necessities, such as water, food, and other products. I know that's not sustainable, it's more like economically sustainable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I look at it like this: trying to get humans to live on Mars will bring forward new challenges that will be met with new technologies and strategies made to overcome thosr challenges. True colonization of other planets could be centuries away, so every expedition from now until then will be part of a learning curve to prepare humans  for space travel that is practical and has an end product other than exploration. Getting better at this is going to take a long time, so the earlier we start the better off we will be in centuries time.</p>
<p>What could be practical for human space travel? Mining for resources would be the most obvious (doesnt have to be Mars but even if it is, in the future the time to travel back and forth may be cut down significantly). As for living on another planet, just think about animals and early humans who.migrate to new places. It's natural to have that drive and can lead to something beneficial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good comments.  For those who have similar questions I refer you to an op-ed I just published in Wired. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/01/put-people-mars-2033-good-nation/" target="_blank">https://www.wired.com/2017/01/put-people-mars-2033-good-nation/</a></p>
<p>Mars Recon Orbiter just discovered a buried glacier the size of New Mexico!  Plenty of resources.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The problem with this kind of thinking is that animals and humans migrate to places which have resources necessary for their survival. Sure, sometimes animals will adapt to pretty severe conditions,  but there are limits to that. Mars on the other hand has very severe conditions, which would require very advanced technology for survival.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One potential reason for settlement:  manpower for rapid, extensive expedition work.</p>
<p>An application:  One novelty of Mars is its long-duration &quot;freeze drying&quot; of its early surface.  If, hypothetically, Mars developed life early in its history, exobiology molecular fossils/markers should persist in some form, perhaps locked in ancient ices.  Such hypothetical markers could paint a detailed molecular picture of that history - an origins story quite obliterated on Earth.  Such a history - perhaps unique in the solar system - could shed much light on our own terrestrial origin, if only by proxy. </p>
<p>However, only sustained settlements could provide the ready manpower.  Each expedition would be an uncertain, educated guess, and many would return empty-handed.  A considerable number of  expeditions would be needed to improve the odds of success, and in a reasonable timeframe.  A settlement could run many expeditions in the 2.2 years between Earth-Mars synod, when Earth-launch expeditions are not feasible.  It's one value of settlement.</p></div>		</li>
