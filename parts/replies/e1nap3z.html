			<div class="markdown"><p>Some DPSs use a byte (or CHAR_BIT) which is larger than 8. The smallest type in Windows CE is 16 bits, but they don't call it a char. But in 99.99 cases out of 100 you can guess that 1 byte is 8 bits and be correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>prior to the mid-80's and advent of IEEE 754 standard, it was the wild wild west - I spent way too much of my early career writing low level C converters to approximate as best as I could converting from other formats <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nssdc/formats/" target="_blank"><a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nssdc/formats/" target="_blank">https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nssdc/formats/</a></a> to IEEE 754.  The Unisys 6 bit byte / 36 bit word was the worst.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking through DEC's Small Computer Handbook for the PDP-8 (1967), I can find no reference to 'byte'. Plenty about octal representation of 12-bit words, etc. Any reference to 6-bit chunks as bytes in your experience must have been some local convention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work on programmable logic. A byte is 8 bits. 16 bits to a word, 32 to a dword, 64 to a qword. Everybody just says word though or a xx bit transfer. A nibble is 4 bits. No 6 bit words are there </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A byte is almost always 8 bits. </p>
<p>But no you are correct, there are no 6 bit words.<br />
But taking the pdp-8 as an example again, it has a 12-bit word. Are you saying the pdp-8 never existed? Or that I am wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gah. Should have stated my thoughts better. I was watching Netflix and typing. </p>
<p>I meant 6 bit bytes and things of that nature aren't used in pretty much everything unless it's very niche or custom. </p>
<p>Pdp is niche. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Originally a word was defined as the natural unit of data a processor uses, usually the register size. So for x86 32bit processors a word would be 32 bit, while for modern x86 64bit processors a word would be 64 bit.</p></div>		</li>
