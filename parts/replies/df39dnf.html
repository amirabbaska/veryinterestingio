			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, its velocity wouldn't decrease, but it wouldn't be increasing either. There's a lot of misconception in this thread, A space analogy may be helpful. </p>
<p>Imagine an ice rink. One that is 100% slippery and goes on forever. On this friction-less and infinite ice rink, a hockey puck would continue to slide at a constant speed and direction forever after an initial push. In order to go faster, the puck would need energy, another push. This is space.</p>
<p>If an object in space is not being influenced by gravity or being propelled by an engine, it is not accelerating.
Acceleration = change in speed (faster or slower)</p>
<p>Acceleration requires force. An object not being pushed or pulled upon will maintain a constant velocity, i.e. it will not change speed at all. Your asteroid will only get faster if it is being pulled by a large mass like a planet, star, or black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, there will always be some small forces acting on an object in space. But at it's simplest, space is essentially a vacuum and those other forces are negligible until you're talking about extremely small changes in speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's not being influenced by gravity (or at least any gravitational pull is tiny enough to ignore) then it'll travel in a straight line at a constant speed.

<p>This isn't necessarily true. Scientists have theorized that objects slow down in space due to photons. Basically what happens is that a photo will impact with an object (which is how we see things, photos bouncing off objects and entering our eye's receptors) and it trades energy with it, albeit a very small about. This means that an asteroid going around the sun is slowing down. </p>
<p>You could make the argument that if it was completely away from any light source, that an object wouldn't slow down but photons have shown that they have no problem traveling vast distances.</p>
<p>A nice video on what I am talking about if anyone is interested.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nonetheless, the answer is that the object which OP has in mind would not be accelerating. OP's title was based on the misconception that an object floating in space would constantly accelerate even if no forces were acting on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, but this is never the case. There is a formula for the force of gravity that involves the masses and the distance. An oxygen atom 13 million light years away has a gravitational effect on you, it's just very low. So your velocity in different directions changes, albeit ridiculously slow</p></div>		</li>
