<p>I want to do this experiment with my nephews/niece and want to be able to explain it well enough to them -ages 4,8,11</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't need to be hot as far as I can tell, but it probably doesn't need to be warm or cold either. It's more of a physical reaction than chemical. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No better way to learn than by doing it personally I suppose. No dangerous chemicals, so I have no worries.
Thank you for your input! The kids will think I'm magic one I manage to do it right </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so there are two things happening there. The first is chemistry. The baking soda and vinegar react to make Sodium Acetate and Carbon Dioxide. This is the same reaction that makes science fair volcanoes.</p>
<p>In this case, they're keeping the Sodium Acetate, because it is easy to supersaturate water with it, which brings us to the second component of the experiment.</p>
<p>As you know, you can dissolve things in water. At a certain point, you can't dissolve any more of a given thing, this is called saturation. If you heat up the solvent (in this case water), it can carry more solute (in this case Sodium Acetate, whose solubility curve is really steep, so not a lot can dissolve cold, but a lot can dissolve hot), which is why you need to heat the pot for a while. If you saturate a hot solution and allow it to cool, the solute capacity of the solvent decreases, but there is still all that solute dissolved in the water. The solution is now supersaturated.</p>
<p>Like freezing water, any crystal needs something called a nucleation site from which it can form, meaning the Sodium Acetate can't drop out of solution without something to form crystals on (the glass won't work because Sodium Acetate doesn't bond well enough to it), even though it really, really wants to make crystals. This is where the stick comes in. You gather a little bit of Sodium Acetate on the stick, and introduce it to the solution, and now there is a nucleation site, so crystals quickly begin to form. In the case of Sodium Acetate, it actually does heat up, because the crystal has less energy than the solution.</p>
<p>You can do a similar experiment with wooden sticks and flavored, supersaturated sugar water. That's how they make those rock candies on sticks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sodium acetate is what is in the heat packs that skiers use.  The popping metal disk triggers ucleation. If you've ever used one you have a good Idea of the temperature.</p></div>		</li>
