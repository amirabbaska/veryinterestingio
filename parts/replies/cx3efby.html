			<div class="markdown"><p>The charger is likely rated globally for 110V-220V else, if you plugged a 110V (only) adapter into a 220V outlet, you'd immediately/irreparably damage it. (Check the label.)</p>
<p>Either way, the charger and/or laptop are poorly built/designed. AC noise is easily filtered out with a proper power supply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neat. I never before noticed that the static sound on my computer headphones goes away when I unplug my laptop. Are there any good ways to eliminate this static while charging? (I am working with a lenovo thinkpad T540p with the factory supplied charger.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not irreparable. Usually it's enough to just replace the blown capacitor(s) and maybe some transistors that were near the capacitor when it blew.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're using an Apple MacBook, you should use the full power cord and not just the transformer block.  At least in the US, plugging the MacBook transformer block in directly does not use the ground, letting the computer case &quot;float.&quot;  The power cord includes a 3-prong adapter and properly grounds the system.</p>
<p>I don't know if this applies in other countries, since you're on 220v, but in the US the cord makes a difference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>you can actually 'feel' the hum when you touch the laptop and it con sometimes interfere with the touchpad</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not a problem.  You can buy a ground loop filter (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001EAQTRI/" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001EAQTRI/</a>) and it will clear up.  It's just because of sloppy electronic design</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most chargers I've come across recently are not grounded. For example, Apple's charger without the extension cord is not grounded. The same goed for many Dell, HP and Sony chargers.</p>
<p>So the wiring in your house and the quality of the charger does not matter; 50/60Hz signals will always come through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the hum disappears after removing the charger, the most plausible reason of the bum is the charger itself.</p>
<p>You could try to find the frequency of the hum by playing a 50/60Hz sound (depending on your location) and comparing it with the hum. Or record the hum and do spectro-analysis... </p></div>		</li>
