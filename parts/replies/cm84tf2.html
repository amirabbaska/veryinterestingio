			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, yes. The time and space between events, and even the order of events, can differ to different observers. Who is correct? Everybody and nobody. That is why it's called relativity.</p>
<p>Edit: just so nobody has an existential crisis, there are so called &quot;invariants&quot; that can be calculated using data collected from more than one frame about the same series of events to make sure what everyone reports is checking out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a limit to how much the metric can be distorted? Could someone observing from within the highest gravitational field in the universe essentially watch the universe progress through time while appearing almost immortal to observers far from that point?</p></div>		</li>
