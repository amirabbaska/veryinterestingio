			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons super high speed trains like Shinkansen are pressurised like aeroplanes. You'll see some tunnels on high speed lines with sort of 'baffles' because of the boom caused by the air accelerating out of the way at tunnel entrances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did not know that! I am travelling fairly often in the French high speed trains and the tunnels are really uncomfortable. Pressuring trains make a lot of sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why the design of the Shinkansen trains has tended towards long aerodynamic nose cones. the longer, tapering shape allows air to flow out of the way more easily when entering a tunnel, lessening the &quot;boom&quot; effect, which is good for anyone living near the tunnel entrance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically tunnels are also positively pressurized to keep the air habitable. So the train runs into a pressure differential plus the pressure wave it makes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes its a pressure wave that hits you . It's compressed  air, so it has a loud sound </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's an <a href="http://folk.uio.no/sigurdkn/ny_tunnel_mathew.svg" target="_blank">example of the complicated pressure variations you experience when going through a tunnel in a train</a>. This was recorded with my mobile phone's pressure sensor when going through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_River_Tunnels" target="_blank">North river tunnel</a> from Manhattan to New Jersey. The red curve was recorded when going from the west to the east, while the green curve was recorded when going in the other direction, but <em>was flipped horizontally</em> to make features align. Each recording was taken at a fixed position in the train, but that position might have been different between the two recordings.</p></div>		</li>
