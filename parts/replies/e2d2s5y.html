			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, most comments I can follow but this one is a bit difficult for some reason. I blame the tiredness, so I'll sleep on it and will definitely come back to this in the morning. Thank you for informing me of this, whatever it is :) new little challenge</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure but I think OP mistyped something at one point.</p>
<p>When they write &quot;And then you divide away the (n+1), getting n! = n!&quot;</p>
<p>I think it should read &quot;[...] getting n! = (n+1)!/(n+1)&quot;.</p>
<p>Then as they said if you replace all the n with 0 you get 0! = (0+1)!/(0+1) = 1/1 = 1</p>
<p>In case you also don't understand the beginning, it's like this :</p>
<p>5! = 5<em>4</em>3<em>2</em>1 = 5*4!</p>
<p>So 4! = 5!/5</p>
<p>Same for 0:</p>
<p>0!=1!/1</p>
<p>However, it is only okay to say that because we said &quot;0! exists&quot;. It can be dangerous in math to assume things exist before calculating them. For example, we could apply the same logic and say &quot;-1 exists&quot; and</p>
<p>(-1)! = 0!/0 which would be undefined (infinity).</p>
<p>Hope it helped and I didn't confuse you too much at the end!</p></div>		</li>

<p>?</p>
<p>But &quot;the number of ways you can arrange 0 things is 1&quot; doesnâ€™t seem to make sense</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right to be confused! The definition of a factorial is &quot;the product of all integers below and including the original number, until 1&quot; e.g. 4! = 4<em>3</em>2*1. And it's this exact method we use to determine the number of arrangements of distinct items like cards. This method simply doesn't work for 0 items, nor negative, nor non-integer values, but the value of 0! is a common occurence in mathematics, and it'd be nice to have a value, so mathematicians have agreed to give it the value of 1 for two reasons.</p>
<p>One reason is that it makes a lot of formulas just make sense. The mathematical exponential function e^x has the definition of e^x = 1 + x + x^2 /2! + x^3 /3! + ... You can also write this as the sum of all (x^n)/(n!) from n=0 to infinity. So the first term is x^0 /0! = 1/(0!), the second term is x^1 /1! = x, the third term is x^2 /(2!) = x^2 /2, etc. Looking back at the function, 1/(0!) should be equal to 1, so surely 0! = 1. It just makes sense, and a lot of formulas involving factorials just end up being very untidy if you keep making an exception for 0!, but in all of them, they'd work perfectly if 0!=1, so we just agree that 0! = 1 for tidiness' sake.</p>
<p>The second reason is you can mathematically extend the factorial function. First of all, you can rewrite n! = n <em> (n-1)! We know 1! = 1, so we can say 2! = 2</em>1! = 2. 3! = 3<em> 2! = 6. 4! = 4</em> 3! = 24 etc. This agrees with what we calculated with the other formula. We can use this fact to extend the function to 0, because it says that 1! = 1* 0!, so it makes sense that 0! = 1.</p>
<p>More importantly however, because the factorial function is only really sensical for positive integers, mathematicians also found a new function called the gamma function that behaves identically for all positive integers, but also works for negative numbers and non-integers like 0.5. This means that the factorial function can really be thought of as a unique case of the more generalised gamma function, and the 'product of all integers ...' definition is just a neat little trick for when positive integer values are plugged into the gamma function. Sure enough, when we see what the value of the gamma function would be for 0 objects, we get 1 !</p>
<p>TL;DR: A lot of maths points to 0! = 1. More convincingly, the factorial function is just a specific case of a more generalised Gamma function, which works for all real values, and it agrees that 0! = 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have studied a bit of math, and am very familiar with factorial and it's many applications, and it was hard for me to understand until i read it very carefully. I think its just hard to understand math when it is written in text and or presented in paragraph format without any operations shown.</p></div>		</li>
