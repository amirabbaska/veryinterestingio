			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. A bot will often just be able to &quot;click&quot; on the button or will make a beeline for it immediately, whereas humans have to (1) figure out where the button is, taking up time and (2) drag the cursor across the screen in order to tap the button (and not in a straight line). As you mentioned, they have models to figure out this stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but most don't. Even simulating mouse movement at all is more than a lot of people do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but it would be a decent amount of extra work to make it human-like. It can definitely be done though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. There's no technical reason that clicking the submit button couldn't also go and fire off the event/mechanics of the checkbox, but part of the point is that you have to do something <em>other</em> than click the button. Robots are pretty good at entering spam in text fields and then clicking buttons. They're less good at entering spam, not clicking the button, clicking a checkbox, still not clicking the button, waiting correctly for some javascript to run then clicking the button, all in the way that a human would do.</p></div>		</li>
