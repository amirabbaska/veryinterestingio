			<p>Which is in itself intriguing, because to any machine learning aspect of the captcha, you behave a lot like a bot.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is correct. A bot will often just be able to &quot;click&quot; on the button or will make a beeline for it immediately, whereas humans have to (1) figure out where the button is, taking up time and (2) drag the cursor across the screen in order to tap the button (and not in a straight line). As you mentioned, they have models to figure out this stuff.</p>		</li>

			<p>Over time the patterns would be visible through all the noise. They'd do most steps in a particular order with a particular time range </p>		</li>

			<p>I used to play a certain MMORPG that required clicking in one spot thousands of times in order to level up a certain skill. The game developers had impressive anti-botting measures, so to make sure I didn't get banned I built a device out of Lego and an electric motor that would click my mouse at an approximately-even rate. I never did get banned.<br>  <br>I wonder if there's a potential for analog bots that physically move a mouse and physically press keyboard buttons to overcome these kinds of tests.</p>		</li>

			<p>You can get programmable microcontrollers that mimic HID peripherals like a mouse and keyboard. Anti bot code would look for consistent actions like the mouse moving on the same path every time or the time between key presses being inhumanly fast or exactly the same. Ways to get around this would be to introduce randomness to the timing and mouse paths such that no series of actions are never the same. The only issue is when anti bot measures introduce something that only humans can answer like reading obscured text or identify subjects in a picture. It takes a lot more CPU power to identify things like that so only more advanced bots could really get around this, increasing cost to the bot and hopefully making it less profitable to the guy running it. Machine learning is getting better everyday but it's still far behind how easily and quick humans are at identifying patterns.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's hilarious. I'd be surprised if the API doesn't already detect if it's one of their captchas and reject it though.</p>		</li>

The reason to automate this sort of thing is so you can do it faster than a human could. If you need a whole bunch of separate machines with real mice to do it then you might as well just pay people on mturk or whatever. </p>		</li>

			<p>Not for games. Since you usually need to wait for the game to progress, a bot can't do a task quicker than a human, but usually better (aimbots etc.).</p>		</li>

			<p>They kind of do that already. Shady websites will place files behind a captcha, but they are just mirroring a captcha on a different site they want to solve.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is the correct answer. There's no technical reason that clicking the submit button couldn't also go and fire off the event/mechanics of the checkbox, but part of the point is that you have to do something <em>other</em> than click the button. Robots are pretty good at entering spam in text fields and then clicking buttons. They're less good at entering spam, not clicking the button, clicking a checkbox, still not clicking the button, waiting correctly for some javascript to run then clicking the button, all in the way that a human would do.</p>		</li>
