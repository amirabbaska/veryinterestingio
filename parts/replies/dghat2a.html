			<div class="markdown"><p>It started when the Earth took shape, as the planet cooled down, oceans formed, and inorganic molecules precipitated into a thick goop, named &quot;prebiotic soup&quot; by Oparin and Haldane, in the early &quot;sea&quot;</p>
<p>As the Earth did not yet have an atmosphere, that prebiotic soup was constantly bombarded by energizing radiations (Gamma rays, UV radiation...) and constant thunderstorms, adding energy into the system, in those conditions, Organic molecules can and do form, as evidenced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment" target="_blank">Miller-Urey experiment</a></p>
<p>Over millions of years, you'd get a rich variety of organic compounds, unstable ones would naturally degrade back into more stable forms, while the structurally solid ones would remain, for example, molecules similar to current Phospholipids, with amphipathic properties, would merge together into micelles, as it's their favoured state, forming a primitive cell membrane (for reference, members of the Archaea domain, let us deduce how the cell membrane evolved) </p>
<p>Meanwhile, some primitive proteins and enzymes would form too, of course with random sequences, such a process could (did) take millions of years, but eventually, enzymes with similar amphipathic properties would embed themselves into those micelles, and catalyze the degradation of some of the abundant substrates in the primitive soup, or mediate the flow of specific components inside the micelle (like other proteins, or other compounds)</p>
<p>Nucleotydes would form and associate too, forming free single strands of RNA/DNA, which would be absorbed into those micelles via one of those membrane proteins, from that point, you just require a Ribosome-like protein, and a source of useable energy (remember that the prebiotic soup was very rich in nutrients) leading into the first digestion</p>
<p>From then on, those primitive heterotrophous &quot;cells&quot; would develop and enjoy the easy life in those rich conditions, suffering mutations in those primitive nucleotide chains (especially when you consider that UV rays were not filtered, as there was no atmosphere), favouring certain structures/proteins over others (evolving), and eventually, developing the capacity to replicate their genetic material and reproduce. </p>
<p>Non-reproducing cells would just &quot;die&quot; when the mutagenic stress could not be handled anymore and being phased out by the more abundant reproducing cells, from this first primitive, reproduction-capable cell, you can just apply natural selection, eventually adapting into all the lifeforms on Earth</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the earliest evidences of life on the fossil record date from <del>3800</del> 4200 million years ago (while the Earth formed around 4500 million years ago)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind, this theory is still hotly debated within the scientific community. Miller-Urey showed you can make a lot of different organic molecules in simulated conditions that we think were common on a young earth.</p>
<p>How to get from these really small building blocks of life to proteins, RNA, DNA and other big molecules needed for life <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/03/researchers-may-have-solved-origin-life-conundrum" target="_blank">is an active area of research and also debate.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is some misinformation in the comments in this thread. It seems that Miller-Urey conditions were not present at the time life first originated on earth. </p>
<p>Despite the many theories on how life was established, it is certain that the building blocks of life were once synthesized from smaller molecules present in prebiotic conditions. The order of events is currently unknown and while the general consensus places the emergence of RNA as the first macromolecule, evidence exists in favor of other possibilities. The RNA based world, however, is strongly supported by the versatility of RNA; ribozymes (RNA based macromolecules) can catalyze a wide array of reactions including self-replication which can be responsible for Darwinian evolution through mutations.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of earth 4.0 billion years ago is subject of an ongoing debate: while Miller's famous 1953 spark discharge experiments were based on a strongly reducing atmosphere, evidence for a more oxidizing atmosphere has since emerged. The conditions under which prebiotic syntheses of specific building blocks were accomplished are not always compatible with the conditions of a different building block, with syntheses of essential compounds being possible in temperature ranges from below freezing to above boiling. Hence, a unified method is required to provide a stronger argument for the conditions in which life first emerged.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v480/n7375/full/nature10655.html" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v480/n7375/full/nature10655.html</a> is an article that to me proves Miller-Urey conditions are wrong</p>
<p>The research group at Cambrige, led by J. D. Sutherland, is trying to unify the synthesis of all building blocks of life under HCN as starting point. I would suggest this article for the chemically versed. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201506585/abstract" target="_blank">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201506585/abstract</a> and perhaps this one <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201506585/abstract" target="_blank">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201506585/abstract</a>. I favor his work over most other things I have read but that's just my opinion, read up on this yourself and form your own opinion.</p></div>		</li>
