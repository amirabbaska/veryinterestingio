<p>They didn't forget to tell people.  They told the people they were supposed to tell, but some of the people they told screwed up and nobody bothered to tell the Russian guys watching the radars that there was a scientific test launch scheduled.  So the Russian radar guys saw a launch and raised an alert like they were supposed to.</p></div>		</li>
