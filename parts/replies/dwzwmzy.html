			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but not everyone is uncomfortable with moving often.</p>
<p>However, that's also why we tend to go out and socialize with new people, try new restaurants, explore new places...we can still figure out the environment without losing our safe space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But most people are inclined to settling down in one place. </p>
<p>I do agree with your second part. But to add on, I along with most people I know usually go to a food outlet and order the same dish everytime. </p>
<p>For example there's a café I frequent, I get the same red velvet cake every single time. The café may have a new flavour to offer but I still get red velvet every single time because I know for sure I'm going to love it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can go do those things, but socializing/exploring/newness can be fatiguing, physically and mentally. Having a place to go where you know where everything is, it is yours and beholden to no one else, and you feel safe is important to relieve this stress especially with age.</p></div>		</li>
