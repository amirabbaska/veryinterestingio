			<div class="markdown"><p>It can. The ISS has <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/radiators.html#.W2yFL_5KhSM" target="_blank">radiators</a> to release the heat into space. You could certainly rig a spacesuit with something similar, in theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't seem to understand how those radiators work, since there is no medium for the heat to transfer to? Wouldn't there need to be air (or any matter really) for the heat to disperse? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have worked on some satellite electronics, and heat is really tricky up there. You need those radiators to dissipate heat since you can't use convection transfer. You need to add a heating circuit to keep it from dropping too low when you don't have sunlight since the silicone doesn't work the same at  minus is 40. Some of the heater circuits built into the boards can be pretty cool though. But the heat cycling also causes a bit more wear and tear on the electronics as well. This is partly why you hear satellite dont have a long life (at least commercial cost effective ones). </p>
<p>Also as a side note, you get arc overs at a much lower voltage since the atmosphere acts as an insulator to some degree. So you also need extra clearance to anything over signal voltage levels on outer layers of the circuit board. And to top it off, any floating piece of metal will pick up stray charge from stray protons and build up a charge and arch over to adjacent metal, including your circuits, which is never a good thing to happen. </p>
<p>TLDR: space isn't at all like earth, and makes simple thing really difficult, including simple sounding questions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ISS also runs something like an air conditioner all the time to stay cool enough. It's pumping its heat into the radiators, which are hot and radiate the extra heat.</p>
<p>This system is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_Active_Thermal_Control_System" target="_blank">EATCS</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does radiate - everything does. And they design it to be able to radiate as much they need. If you look at a picture of the ISS, there are huge bendy fins sticking out from it. Those are radiators. Coolant gets pumped through the station and then through them, and their large surface area means a lot of heat gets radiated away. This is the kind of thing I meant by geometry being important.</p>
<p>(Also, keep in mind the ISS spends half its time shaded by the Earth itself.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how does it get radiated away?  Doesn't it need some form of medium to transfer?  Liquid cooling pulls the heat into the liquid, a breezy transfers heat off your body into the air, but where does it go in space? Or does it even need a medium? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we do some approximations (assume a spherical astronaut with 1 m radius, rotate it fast enough that the whole surface is at the same temperature) the major discriminator is the absorptivity and emissivity of the wrapper we put the astronaut in. If we wrap our poor spherical astronaut in Aluminized Teflon, then you hit equilibrium with a surface temp of 300K around 0.45 AU. (This is using absorptivity of .2 and emissivity of .75 from this NASA paper: ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20150002706.pdf</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically it's a kind of shiny blanket that is really good at keeping things cool in space. It doesn't take in much heat from the Sun's rays (low absorptivity) and it's really good at radiating heat into space (high emissivity). It's sort of like wearing white cotton garments in the desert to keep cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends heavily on the cookedness of the bacon. If it's raw bacon, I'm gonna have a real hard time finding good numbers for these coefficients. However, if you like your bacon crispy, we're in luck, because char is a good analog for a blackbody. This means absorptivity and emissivity both near 1. With those constants, you get 300K surface temp at .87 AU.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true in a misleading sense: their temperature would be measured according to the average momentum of the particles that make up the gas. If there is only one particle per cubic metre of space, but particles have a high average momentum, the temperature would register as high but as it is almost a vacuum you would not experience any of the heat in the same way that you would at atmospheric pressure. (There is a very region near the top of the earth's atmosphere that is thousands of degrees, according to this measure. But you would freeze there, because it is so thin.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, the sun is just that - a cloud of gas that got really hot. It's density is a little more than water, so perhaps it's better to call it a cloud of liquid - but to be honest all these definitions kinda break down in the sun (as do many other things).</p>
<p>Long before, it was a much less dense cloud of dust and gas in space. Regardless of whether it was hot or not (I believe it was several thousands of degrees!), at some point it condensed down to form the sun and in the process, heated up, so at some point it must have been at least hundreds of thousands of degrees.</p>
<p>Weirdly, though, you could be in a cloud of gas that's hundreds of thousands of degrees - and still freeze. These clouds are not like ones of earth - they are very ratified (aka mostly empty) and so would not keep you very warm... </p></div>		</li>
