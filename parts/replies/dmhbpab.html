			<div class="markdown"><p>Example of this: CSV exports. Many web-based software as a service platforms allow end-users to export data into a CSV. This is a common feature in eCommerce platforms, for example, where users frequently need to bulk export product data to a .csv, make changes to it in Excel, then import. Some product data (like product descriptions) can be many thousands of characters long (or so long it actually exceeds Excels character limit, which looks interesting). It makes more sense to view the spreadsheet without text-wrapping in this case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. The default always result in a manageable display, is not formatted well but easy to tidy up. If you wrapped text (using which column width?) you could end up with a sheet that is very difficult to sort out.</p></div>		</li>
