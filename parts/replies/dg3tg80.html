			<div class="markdown"><p>Partially, cooling, keeping air circulating. Servers need to be cooled at a higher rate then home computers or a workstation because there are many more parts that are closer together, all of which are generating heat. This means more heat in a smaller space then your typical computer. The more heat there is, the less efficient the parts are as well as a shorter life. So if you were to pack as many of those server banks in as possible, it would be much much hotter and parts would fail quicker. Also as mentioned by /u/locust377, it is space for people and machines to move things around as needed.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Front and back: for ease of access.
A server is relativelly deep, I have one here, a 2U.
The physical dimensions is roughtly:</p>
<ul>
<li>width: 19&quot; (standard width of a server rack)</li>
<li>height: a bit over 3 3/8&quot; (1.75&quot; per U, this is a 2U, 1U = 1 height unit, which is an easy way to calculate how many servers fit in a rack, as each one may vary in height)</li>
<li>depth: 28&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Some racks wasn't full, some server may have been not installed yet or removed for whatever reason (maintenance, retirement, not used anymore, ...)</p>
<p>The servers can be quite heavy, so you want easy access when you pull it out of the rack, enought to still be in the front. Some servers have some tracks that extend, leaving you a few inches at the back to connect stuff (usually it is done from the back).</p>
<p>Also, there is some cables that may come out of the front of the equipment on the rack, like ethernet switch, the server must clear those when you do some maintenances, so that add more space needed....</p>
<p>The front of the server is where it suck air in, the back is where it push it all.</p>
<p>The servers are usually arranged face to face, so one aisle is all the front of the servers, while the next is all the backs.</p>
<p>The front is where the air conditionning bring the cold air in, and is relativelly cold there.</p>
<p>The back is where it suck the air, and is warm there.</p>
<p>some data center will put a plastic sheet on top of the rack to the ceiling, this is to try to avoid that the hot and cold air mix. It increase slightly the efficiency of the cooling system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually don't know, but we could take a guess:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spare room that allows for future growth</li>
<li>Plenty of space to move things around including server blocks, forklifts, etc</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First is wrong.. second is kinda right..</p>
<p>I work in a data centre.. you need to be able to walk between racks.. maintenance.. how can you possibly install a server in the middle of the room without that space ?
Forklifts not allowed inside fyi.. Also the floor is empty because of air conditioning going from under the floor and cabling. Tiles can't handle the weight of a forklift.</p>
<p>Edit: sorry my answer is half assed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They double or triple store it. They use a storage system that automatically balances and keeps a couple copies of everything locally for when drives fail.  Because with the numbers of drive they have it's someone's job to just walk around and replace hard drives all day.  When a new one is plugged in, the software detects it and pushes files to it. Which files depends on what other drives are fullest and how many copies of things they want to store. </p>
<p>Also, remember that this stuff isn't stored in just one place. Google has 15 data centers located all over the world and popular content is stored in all the data centers so it's close by for delivery.  Not to mention they have servers in the big ISPs as well and keep popular content stored there for even faster delivery. That latest CGPGrey video probably exists hundreds of times around the world, all waiting for you to click on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess they use a RAID directly in the servers in case of hard drive failures. They also have lots of server farms around the world to be as close to you as possible. In case a whole server fails they can probably load the backup from a different site.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The very high quality videos are compressed to take up as little as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are they really applying lossless compression to the already (lossy) compressed videos? Somehow I doubt that, it would make little sense and cause quite some computing overhead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are not using lossless compression. Some guy once uploaded a video, downloaded it and re-uploaded it again for (iirc) 1000 times. Quality got worse and worse. Pretty interesting to see what happens to the video. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point is that they probably store the very same data you can view/download. Which is just normal VP9 or H.264 compressed video and AAC or Vorbis compressed audio. Not something YouTube specific. However, they are going for relatively low bit rates (i.e. bad quality). I guess thatâ€™s more so people with slower internet connections can watch them and not necessarily to save disk space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is this the reason why videos uploaded say, 10 years ago, now look blurry and pixelated compared to back then? I mean the videos were in 480p or less back then but they were still much clearer than now. Doesn't that mean that all videos will eventually be an indistinguishable blurry messes of pixels?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Youtube converts whatever you put in into whatever they want to store. That's what the &quot;processing&quot; stage after upload is. There is also no single format that it uses. The backend formats have changed over time, and they can also quietly re-convert your video one day into something new if they like. Giant web platforms like youtube are living, breathing things, and nothing stays still for that long.</p></div>		</li>
