<p>To expand on this, soap dispensers can get really dirty.  I worked at a chicken wing restaurant and the dispensers would get so gross because people's hands were covered in sauce.  Even if customers are washing their hands after touching the dispenser, there's a perception that &quot;this bathroom is gross.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. As much as I demand a hand washing after doing my business, if I were to see food/sauce on the soap dispenser or sinks, I'd skip washing and issue a complaint. </p>
<p>Logic be damned, I don't want that crap on my hands, period.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the less germs you come into contact with the better. Especially in such a high-traffic area. So while you are washing your hands after touching a soap dispenser, most people don't do a great job of completely cleaning their hands. The germs they touched from the soap dispenser (which were transferred there from people's asses and the toilet flusher) will still linger.</p></div>		</li>
