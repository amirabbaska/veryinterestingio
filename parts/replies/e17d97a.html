<p>Oh yeah, we have totally measured the size of things by sending a radar ping out, waiting decades for it to reach something, then waiting more decades for the ping to return.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a long time radar astronomy gave us the most accurate range measurements for the nearer planets in the solar system, out to Jupiter from memory.  Only the advent of spacecraft visiting those planets improved the accuracy.  Knowing the distance to the planets allows us to work out the distance of the earth from the sun, i.e., the Astronomical Unit (AU).</p>
<p>Knowing the scale of the solar system is the basis for all our measurements of the ranges of more distant objects.  That being said, the improved accuracy of radar ranging pushed the accuracy of our knowledge of the AU from four to five significant figures.  That's not an important improvement since the uncertainty around the more distant objects is often much greater.  Also, it only matters if you want to be able convert parsecs to metres or light years, for which you need to know the AU in metres.</p></div>		</li>
