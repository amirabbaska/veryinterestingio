			<div class="markdown"><p>When arresting someone, a peace officer generally reads from a script that informs the person being arrested of the charge, and the right to retain and instruct council without delay. <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Canadian_Criminal_Procedure_and_Practice/Arrest_and_Detention/Right_to_Counsel" target="_blank">This WikiBooks article goes into much more detail.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're only required to be advised of Miranda when being formally questioned while in custody.
If they're just asking investigative questions and you're free to leave you don't have to be advised of your rights. Sometimes they do it anyway but you don't HAVE to be. </p>
<p>Also, you have to ask specifically for a lawyer or specifically decline to answer questions. Asking &quot;should I get a lawyer,&quot; or saying &quot;maybe I should consult a lawyer&quot; is not the same as actually asking for one.
And if you say you want a lawyer then they tell you &quot;OK, if you're going to be like that we are going to go ahead and arrest you unless you decide to continue to talk to us&quot; and then you say okay and keep talking then you have waived your right. </p>
<p>Bottom line: SHUT THE FUCK UP, say &quot;I decline to answer any more questions and want an attorney&quot;</p>
<p>When you are in that little room it is extremely stressful. You are not in your right mind. Get yourself a script and stick to it. </p>
<p>EDIT because I've been drinking and my thoughts weren't concise. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, in the purest legal sense there is no verbatim script that has to be read. The charter designates that one must be made aware of the reason for their arrest, and must be made aware of their right to consult with counsel and be given the opportunity to do so immediately (read: as soon as practicable) should they desire to exercise said right. Each police service, depending on its province and/or municipality will have its own policy mandated script that an officer is expected to read verbatim. Though discretion can be exercised in a situation where a person is having difficulty understanding due to language barrier or level of education, etc. and you can put it in simpler terms for them. This is something that an officer would be expected to articulate in their notebook. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand a bit on the duty counsel system (in Ontario, at least), it's a central number that will connect you with one of the x number of lawyers on call at that time.  Advice is pretty much limited to &quot;don't say anything&quot; though, especially given the number of lawyers gun-shy about being subpoenaed (and that a lot are just there for their $30/hr).</p>
<p>Important to note as well that, unlike in the US, Canadian police aren't obliged to stop questioning after a detainee contacts a lawyer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish there was a place for more useful things like this about Canada. Reddit is pretty US centric, which is to be expected.</p>
<p>I know laws are available online but those need a specialist to decipher them.</p></div>		</li>
