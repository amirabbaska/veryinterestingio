			<div class="markdown"><p>And to pile on top that point, it's not that OP just has the coldest butt in the universe, it's just confirmation bias. Whenever they sit down and the seat is warm, they notice it (thus from now on thinking &quot;they have a warmer butt than me&quot;), but whenever they sit down in a cold seat, they don't think &quot;somebody had a colder butt than me&quot;, they just don't notice it at all, or they think that the seat has been vacant for a while, while in reality, somebody with a colder butt than their own could just have been sitting in the seat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue the following: you mentally expect your own seat to be warm. However, you are used to seats where you weren’t just sitting to be cold. Typically when you first sit somewhere, it is cold. So when you sit somewhere and it’s warm, it is surprising and so you notice it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's psychological too...</p>
<p>You expect a seat to be room temperature... Or slightly below. Your expectation makes these two cases not particularly eventful.</p>
<p>It could be that you sat on IceArse's former seat. It's cold... And you don't notice it. It could be that AverageJoe's seat wasn't warm enough. It's okayish and you don't notice that either. It's a seat. Same goes for your seat. Your mind knows the temperature.</p>
<p>But contrast that with a warm seat in a cold place... unexpected bliss. It's like getting unexpected hot fudge in your sundae. You notice it and correlate it with the other person's butt.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Definitely unexpected, but I don't know if I'd call it bliss. Those first images rolling through my head of WHY this seat is so warm are not blissful.</p></div>		</li>
