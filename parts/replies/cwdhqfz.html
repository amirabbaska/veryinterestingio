			<div class="markdown"><p>OPEC are NOT selling oil at a loss.  They are also not only selling to the US.<br />
What has happened is people thought oil price could only go up,  so they build a budget based on the price not lowering.  The price has more than halved now so obviously their budget will have to change.  They are NOT losing money selling at $47 a barrel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The smaller, sub-Saharan oil producers have rewritten their budgets at $45/bbl, but had to drastically cut social services and spending on infrastructure,since they didn't have the cash reserves of the Gulf oil monarchies. Venezuela is on the cusp of being a failed state, due to food shortages brought on by oil dropping 50%.</p>
<p>I think that Kuwait is the only Gulf state to have a budget predicated on $50 oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having a balanced budget and producing at a loss are two very very different things. Venezuela is also not failing because of oil. They were failing when oil was $100 and they had massive inflation. It has been years since everyday items have been available. They have been taking Chinese loan after Chinese loan for the past decade. It has been failing since they nationalized their oil industry and drove away all their educated with stupid government policies of Chavez. Their oil production has fallen by a third since 1999. </p>
<p>Oil getting cut in half just kicked that country in the nuts, but it had been getting punched in the face repeatedly.</p>
<p>All the countries in trouble basically courted huge foreign investment. When those companies found oil and invested billions to develop it they seized those assets for the state. Venezuela was the first and they can get fucked if you ask me. They all cut basically all forms of tax and tooled their government to live off the stolen assets because royalties on production weren't good enough. Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Iran, Algeria, Qatar, Lybia...etc. The story is the same. The seven sisters and the us in particular lost a lot of foreign investment and tax income. Those companies control very little of the future reserves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To produce a barrel of crude? No - they aren't losing money. But they are losing money in other aspects of the trade. (and also budget, like you mentioned)</p>
<p>The oil industry that OPEC ruled has long since innovated past what worked in the 90's and before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also a fact of US fracking operations being able to be profitable far lower than traditional middle eastern drilling. You are right they are not willing at a production loss but they did include a bubble of safety in budgets estimated around 80/bbl but the US became an exporter which allows producers to control the price and make the demand for oil from opec decrease dramatically until they followed suit and this has continued over the last few months </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The us didn't start producing it's own oil in the 70s, that's ridiculous. The us was the world leading producer (as it is now) in the first half of the twentieth century. How do you think we won wwii?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People forget that its not necessarily &quot;your oil&quot;. Its extracted and refined by primarily American oil companies who then sell it to the highest bidder which is not always American consumers. Basically, America doesn't consume all the oil that is extracted from American soil because of capitalism but pays the same price as the rest of the world (not including subsidies) because of monopoly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should have clarified - producing oil in large quantities compared to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>1 - Technology (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17lkdqoLt44" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17lkdqoLt44</a>)</p>
<p>2 - Industry (metal, coal, oil, etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't too awful as a quick and dirty summary of factors affecting the price but point 6 and 7 are incorrect. Oil is much cheaper to produce in middle eastern OPEC countries than the US. They are making massive profits at these prices (obviously much lower than before but still 100-300% profit margin). US Shale producers are into marginal profitability and it has forced some bankruptcies already. The issue causing sustained low prices is more that shale oil operates on much shorter time-scales than traditional oil developments. Even driving the majority of shale producers out of business now, as soon as the price goes back up they will be back.</p></div>		</li>
