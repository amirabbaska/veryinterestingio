<p>To answer OP’s question, other metals will work if you connect them to the ground or negative electrical side of the circuit.  We would test screens all the time with a small steel cylinder wired to the ground plane of the building’s wiring.</p>

<p>Why in gods name do those little rubber tipped styluses work... Rubber isn't supposed to do any of that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does this mean I can't use my touchscreen while skydiving? Or what if I'm wearing very-well insulated shoes-- will it not react as strongly? ^(I'm very curious now)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, although technically it would work 'less', I'm guessing it would be just as functional because of the human body's natural capacitance(ability to store charge), that's why you can give people or objects a static shock and apparently even build up kilovolts in the right environments </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read carefully.</p>
<p>I said that, electrically, you <em>look</em> like ground.  You are a large source of positive charge and will attract electrons that are pumped into the transparent electrode behind the glass.</p>
<p>The attraction changes the amount of time it takes to drain the negative charge out of the circuit.  And that's how your finger is detected.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically there are conductive wires within the screen that are supplied a voltage that is constantly changing. When something like a finger or other capacitive material gets close it will absorb some of the power as the voltage increases and emit some back into the screen as the voltage decreases. The phone will see the changes in the voltage waveform and interprets them as a user input.</p>

<p>This is the best explanation.  Thank you.</p></div>		</li>
