<p>This is huge, I think it just clicked.</p>
<p>So once I learned the melody of that guitar, I was making a conscious effort to sing along with it in my head. I'm anticipating it, acknowledging it, and emulating it in real-time, automatically filtering out everything else. </p>
<p>I don't know if I'm making sense but I think I get it now! So thank you for taking the time to explain it so thoroughly! You go ahead and have yourself a good day! <a href="https://i.imgur.com/iSVgqfv.png" target="_blank">Brokeboi gold.</a></p></div>		</li>

I hate to dance.  To compensate, I took swing and salsa classes with my gf now wife.  I was comfortable dancing at our wedding, with practice, and these duo moves.  But when we end up at some random club after cocktails, I'd default to some lame 80s shoegazing move.<br />
But a few years ago, I happened to focus on the bass guitar.  If I  can isolate that, I can boogie.  A good example is Flea w/RHCP's version of <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sdOLFtk9joI" target="_blank">Higher Ground</a>.  But every simgle pop song at the club has that driving bass rythym.  I can't hear a song now without trying to isolate the power behind it.  It's cool.</p></div>		</li>
