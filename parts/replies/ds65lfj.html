			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but the two Iâ€™ve specifically run into are not the same or better (IMO)</p>
<p>My SO got me a Scapa 16 while flying and I really liked it.  When I eventually found a Scapa locally it was not aged. Very disappointing. </p>
<p>The other one for me is the Nikka Taketsuru</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, NAS is very big right now. Every year start aging 2 to 4 times what your estimated demand will be for the aged bottles when they mature. Then over the years, &quot;steal&quot; a little bit every year to create NAS bottles to meet current demand. Something like Talisker Storm will likely be:</p>
<p>20% 4 Year /
20% 6 Year /
20% 8 Year /
20% 10 Year /
10% 12 Year /
10% 14 Year</p>
<p>Either that, or take some 4 year out of the normal barrels and put it in a sherry cask for 2 additional years and sell it that way. Lots to options, but even that takes years of advance planning and stock control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, but i think you buried the real answer to the question at the end. New labels but distilled spirits from large distilleries that run for that purpose. That's how they get the aged spirits. I think that's the question, not how do they get money to run off of early on.</p></div>		</li>
