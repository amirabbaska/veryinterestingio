			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the &quot;<em>&quot; character means &quot;wildcard&quot; to the os. In RegEx it means 0 to infinity match on any character. So if I had 30 files that are named random, but the file type is the same, I could do </em>.exe to mean any file that is a .exe format. Or if I had a bunch of png files that are named 'random'-pepe.png, I could use *-pepe.png to mean all files that end in -pepe.png. sorry at work so if this doesn't make sense tell me what part and I will fix it during lunch.
Edit: small quick grammer fixes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In windows/DOS as I recall, * is the wildcard for any number of digits, so &quot;*.exe&quot; is any file ending in .exe.  &quot;?&quot; Is the single digit wildcard so &quot;document?.doc&quot; could be document1, document2, documenta, documentb, etc., but it won't search for extra digits.  And I think \/ would be the escape character, or take you to the parent folder?  </p>
<p>So if they allowed these characters in regular filenames, when you tried to open the file it would end up trying to open multiple files due to the wildcard, or in the case of the slash, it would go to the parent directory looking for part of the filename.  It would be a disaster.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Safer and easier to just prevent those characters from being used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it's more just a legacy thing as the time taken to run those checks would be negligible.  We could easily make filesystems that use padding to allow for any character in a file name but back in the stone age when NTFS, EXT, FAT, etc, were being hammered out they probably just didn't want to deal with it.</p>
<p>Good explanation though so have an upboat.</p></div>		</li>
