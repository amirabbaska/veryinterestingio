			<div class="markdown"><p>I think China has been eating up the US's recycling for years. It costs much less to process, already processed metals. </p>
<p>As far as a reason, for OPs initial question; my guess is that its cost effective to do it that way. Globalization and all that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I attended an environmental lecture last summer. The speaker described how the majority of salmon eaten in the US is actually caught in US waters, but the cost of processing the fish is so much cheaper in China that it's shipped via freighter from the US to China, deboned, packaged, and frozen, and is then shipped back to the US for consumption. Globalization is a strange beast. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rapid spread of ash chalara dieback (an invasive tree disease) in the UK has been pretty reliably attributed to the fact that &quot;UK grown&quot; trees are seeded in the UK then transported to europe to mature enough to plant, and are then shipped back. This sort of thing isn't just daft-sounding, it's dangerous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All those boats from China need to haul something other than chicken feet on the way back.  And yes, we really do ship chicken feet to China. </p>
<p>Edit:. Yes I know they eat them, I've had some myself.  You eat the fatty deposits.  It tastes like you're eating a very tender hunk of fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe this is a dumb question, but doesn’t it make more sense to consume the material where it’s being recycled (provided there is sufficient demand)? Seems like the whole point of recycling is to lower overall cost / environmental impact. Shipping recycled material halfway around the world seems counter productive toward that end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The container ships have to go back to China anyway, so there's not much net environmental impact from loading those containers with scrap aluminum. Containerized shipping is so efficient, it has effectively eliminated the &quot;friction of distance&quot; that once made it difficult to do business across the world. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a good question.</p>
<p>Here is something to consider.</p>
<p>Cargo sent back in terms of &quot;trash&quot; do not have an exact demand in time for delivery. If it does have to be demanded-in-time, then you would have to push more energy to deliver the cargo. This applies to any form of travel, with air being more energy intensive because of the needed forces of lift in active propulsion.</p>
<p>Ships on a return trip may or may not have that demand in being reused for another cargo send out to export goods. Thus one factor is that the junk can take some time floating back slowly and in more mass to carry, versus a fleet of semi trucks constantly pulsing in traffic to have empty connexes and trailers.</p>
<p>You would have to look at the maximum mass pushed to energy used to the speed of cargo vehicle travel. Speed and time are correlated with demand.</p></div>		</li>
