<p>Huh, could you expand on this point? I've never heard it before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever you mathematically &quot;ask&quot; the Standard Model for an experimental prediction, you have to forcibly say, in math, &quot;but don't consider up to infinite energy, stop SOMEWHERE at high energies&quot;.  This &quot;somewhere&quot; is called a &quot;cut-off&quot; you have to insert. </p>
<p>If you don't do this, it'll spit out a gobbledygook of infinities.  However, when you do do this, it will make the most accurate predictions in the history of humankind.  But CRUCIALLY the numbers it spits out DON'T depend on what the actual value of the cut-off was.  </p>
<p>If you know a little bit of math, in a nutshell, when you integrate things, you don't integrate to infinity - there be dragons - but rather only to some upper value, let's call it lambda.  However, once the integral is done, lambda only shows up in the answer through terms like 1/lambda, which if lambda is very large goes to zero.</p>
<p>All of this is to say, you basically have to insert a dummy variable that is some &quot;upper limit&quot; on the math, BUT you never have to give the variable a value (you just keep it as a variable in the algebra) and the final answers never depend on its value.</p>
<p>Because its value never factors in to any experimental predictions, that means the Standard Model doesn't seem to suggest a way to actually DETERMINE its value.  However, the fact you need to do this at all suggests that the Standard Model itself is only an approximate theory that is only valid at low energies below this cut-off.  &quot;Cutting off our ignorance&quot; is what some call the procedure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somehow, I was under the impression that the Higgs boson was supposed to be the gauge particle responsible for attributing mass to other partials, and that the theoretical graviton was supposed to be the gauge particle responsible for gravity. Did the confirmation of the Higgs boson further the gauge theory of gravity or shed some light on the force of gravity in any way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Higgs boson is what's known as a 'scalar' because it can be described by a single number (the photon, gluon, W/Z are gauge bosons though). And yes, the Higgs is responsible for the intrinsic mass of some particles, but unfortunately has practically nothing to do with gravity, so the discovery doesn't really advance our understanding of gravity at all :(</p>
<p>It's kind of misleading because you would naively assume that mass has something to do with gravity, but in this case the mass that the Higgs creates is just some form of 'self-energy'. All types of energy influence gravity, even heat, electricity, sound, etc., so it's not really special in regards to its connection to gravity at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn. I guess when it came out I was dubiously disappointed because I was sure it would tell us something insightful about gravity.</p>
<p>When you say it's responsible for the intrinsic mass of <strong>some</strong> particles, are you only excluding massless particles, or are there some mass particles that the Higgs field doesn't apply to?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in theory could you either lock up, phase shift, or &quot;turn off&quot; the Higgs field so that it wouldn't interact with particles thereby eliminating mass of particles, or could you possibly modify the field to interact with massless particles thereby giving them mass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that by far the dominate determinate of gravitational force is (seems to be) mass, isn't this 'self-energy' either much more strongly gravity-effecting or much more energy than is stored by any other method?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just imagine, 50 years of the world’s best scientists going off a hunch that the Higgs field existed. Seems like every day or at least weekly there’s a breakthrough in physics of some sort. It has become expected in the world if social media. This puts into perspective the disruptive scale of this discovery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be worth saying that introducing the Higgs already gave a bunch of useful information, so much so that the people who introduced it won a Nobel prize for their work in the late 1970s. In particular, the full theory (&quot;electroweak theory&quot;) predicted the existence of other new particles, which were in turn detected in the 70s. It was clear that much of the theory was right, and if the full theory were right, the Higgs particle should also be found eventually. If the Higgs somehow didn't exist, you wouldn't throw the entire theory out, since it already had a lot going for it.</p>
<p>EDIT: For an example of a Higgless theory with many of the same predictions, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technicolor_(physics\)" target="_blank">technicolor</a>.</p></div>		</li>
