			<div class="markdown"><p>The Cretaceous had a couple mass extinction events of note leading up to the k-pa event. Could it be that those previous extinctions compounded the effects of the asteroid impact? The current formation exposure a couple blocks from my house showcases the absolute devastation of the Cenomanian-Turonian Event, known for causing the extinctions of large swaths of life like pliosauridae &amp; ichthyosaurs, but the rocks on either side of the event don't exactly show life thriving either.</p>
<p>It's always made me wonder how healthy populations were in general going into the k-pa event and whether the Cretaceous as a whole was hostile towards life.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i think this is one of the best explanations around - the culmination of multiple disasters - impacts, environmental changes, diseases - compounding to weaken groups, leading to the devastation from the asteroid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bob Bakker believed it was all about disease transmission. I don't buy that as stand-alone theory, but it could well be a part of the big picture. I've met him before. He's a lot smarter than I am, but he does tend to go off in weird directions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is outside of the scope of the original question, but you mentioned how flying dinosaurs survived. What about crocodilians? were they just small enough/lucky?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Megafauna are the first ones to die out when the food chain is disrupted. It's a bit weird, because they're not top of the food chain while at the same time requiring an enormous working food chain below them. Top of the food chain animals and smaller creatures can survive because their diets are so generalized they can live off anything. Turtles, Crocs, Birds, Sharks, etc. all have something very in common with humans: they're not picky. They can and will eat anything if their survival depends on it, and their bodies support that &quot;anything&quot; diet. Compare this with elephants/whales or mosasaurs/plesiosaurs, they're fucked if their one food source is not as plentiful as before. It doesn't even have to be extinct, the simple fact that megafauna evolve to survive in times of abundance, dooms them for survival in times of hardship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have often wondered about that, and honestly don't have a really good answer. Crocs and sea turtles were some of the largest animals to survive, but nature is messy and exceptions occur - especially where fossils are concerned and evidence is lacking. Perhaps it's luck, as per baildodger.</p></div>		</li>
