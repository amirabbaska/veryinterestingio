As the person who replied to already said (as the article also says), bleach is better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it gets hot it will kill anything that won't survive at that temperature, if the whole thing is letting off a lot of steam it probably won't get much hotter (until the water is all gone). There will still be all sorts of stuff on the sponge for new bacteria to eat though.</p></div>		</li>
