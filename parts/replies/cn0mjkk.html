			<p>Haha, a tech bubble, housing bubble, government bank and auto bailouts, and what will eventually be called a depression ALL took place under Bush.  Most of the problem was perpetuated by Reaganomics, and Clinton was to blame for questionable policies as well, but Bush junior did nothing to stall/prevent these issues until it was too late, and then it was just knee jerk reactions to multiple failures.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Nice try -  Democrats were more onboard with TARP that <br>the GOP was.<br><br><a href="http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2010/oct/18/kurt-schrader/kurt-schrader-says-more-republicans-democrats-vote/" target="_blank">http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2010/oct/18/kurt-schrader/kurt-schrader-says-more-republicans-democrats-vote/</a><br><br>Just because it all happened during the Bush Administration doesn't mean he should own it.  <br><br>... and in no way should you confuse my statement as an endorsement for the GOP. I haven't voted for them in years - same with Democrats.  I think both parties are entirely full of shit.<br><br>As far as the housing bubble - way to complex to pin on one party.  Too many factors to consider between multiple presidencies.</p>		</li>
