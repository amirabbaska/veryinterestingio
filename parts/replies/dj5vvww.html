			<div class="markdown"><p>The Bicameral Mind theory proposes that initially  ones inner voice was not recognized as part of the individual, but was thought to be &quot;Gods&quot; speaking. There is actually some really good evidence for this from ancient sources, Far too much to get into in detail here, but for one small example, in the Iliad, one the most ancient works of literature, no one ever makes a decision for themselves. All their actions are dictated by various &quot;gods&quot; that speak to them. People in that story, either because of stylistic choice of the writer, or because thats how ancient people thought, don't make decisions for themselves. Gods speak to them and they do what they are told.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its definitely worth reading if you have an interest in the nature of consciousness. I found a pdf version online for those who are interested: <a href="http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/pdfs/Julian_Jaynes_The_Origin_of_Consciousness.pdf" target="_blank">http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/pdfs/Julian_Jaynes_The_Origin_of_Consciousness.pdf</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might help to look up how people who've been deaf from birth think. It obviously wouldn't be exactly the same, since they still have a language, but I think it might give you a bit of an idea how it may have worked before people could communicate. As I understand it they think more in terms of actual concepts. Instead of thinking &quot;I'm hungry, I should eat an apple,&quot; the idea of eating an apple just comes to them. It's been a while since I read up on it, so I'm probably not remembering everything right, but I recommend you look that up a bit more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course not. You're absolutely right. My example was just to demonstrate thinking in concepts instead of words. Thinking in concepts is something everybody does, it's just that people who were born deaf do it all the time for everything. Sorry about the confusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually transition between both all throughout the day. In fact, now that I think of it, sometimes I'm not thinking of a picture or words but instead, a smell. Like when deciding what I want to eat. I'll think of the smell of spaghetti and decide I want spaghetti. Pretty weird concept we have on our hands though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently some people don't think with words. I don't understand how that works, but my friend thought I was crazy when I told him my thoughts are in words.(I thought he was trolling me, so I googled it..and just like everything you type in google you get an article on it)</p></div>		</li>
