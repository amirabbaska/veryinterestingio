			<div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: rlx02 is mostly correct. it's the utensil for preparation that does it, not the utensil for dining. (the kitchen knife, not the table fork). However, as Western knife-and-fork custom developed at the table, the effect on dentition became the same, i.e. overbites because of small individual food morsels. Whether it's a Western diner seated at the table in the present day, or it's a Chinese chef in the kitchen from a bygone dynasty who is doing the cutting, the small morsel size is there.</p>
<p>As an anecdotal aside, if your daughter wants to impale her chicken breast on the tines of her fork and take bites out of it as if she's eating a drumstick, don't scold her for it. Rejoice in the possibility that she won't need braces.</p>
<p>/EDIT</p>
<p>From the book<em> Consider the Fork</em> (Bee Wilson, 2012, Basic Books), Ch 2: Knife</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of the science of modern orthodontics is devoted to creating—through rubber bands, wires, and braces—the perfect “overbite.” An overbite refers to the way our top layer of incisors hangs over the bottom layer, like a lid on a box. This is the ideal human occlusion. The opposite of an overbite is the “edge-to-edge” bite seen in primates such as chimpanzees, where the top incisors clash against the bottom ones, like a guillotine blade.</p>
<p>What the orthodontists don’t tell you is that the overbite is a very recent aspect of human anatomy and probably results from the way we use our table knives. Based on surviving skeletons, this has only been the “normal” alignment of the human jaw for 200 to 250 years in the Western world. Before that, most human beings had an edge-to-edge bite, comparable to apes. The overbite is not a product of evolution—the time frame is far too short. Rather, it seems likely to be a response to the way we cut our food during our formative years. The person who worked this out is Professor Charles Loring Brace (born 1930), a remarkable American anthropologist whose main intellectual passion was Neanderthal man. Over decades, Brace built up the world’s largest database on the evolution of hominid teeth. He possibly held more ancient human jaws in his hand than anyone else in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>As early as the 1960s, Brace had been aware that the overbite needed explaining. Initially, he assumed that it went back to the “adoption of agriculture six or seven thousand years ago.” Intuitively, it would make sense if the overbite corresponded to the adoption of grain, because cereal potentially requires a lot less chewing than the grainy meat and fibrous tubers and roots of earlier times. But as his tooth database grew, Brace found that the edge-to-edge bite persisted much longer than anyone had previously assumed. In Western Europe, Brace found, the change to the overbite occurred only in the late eighteenth century, starting with “high status individuals.”</p>
<p>Why? There was no drastic alteration in the nutritional components of a high-status diet at this time. The rich continued to eat large amounts of protein-rich meat and fish, copious pastries, modest quantities of vegetables, and about the same amount of bread as the poor. Admittedly, the rich in 1800 would expect their meat to come with different seasonings and sauces than in 1500: fewer currants, spices, and sugar, but more butter, herbs, and lemon. Cooking styles certainly evolved. But most of these changes in cuisine long predated the emergence of the overbite. The fresher, lighter nouvelle cuisine that appeared on tables across Europe during the Renaissance goes back at least as far as 1651, with the French cookbook by La Varenne called Le Cuisinier françois; arguably, it goes back still further, to the Italian chef Maestro Martino in the 1460s, whose recipes included herb frittata, venison pie, parmesan custard, and fried sole with orange juice and parsley, all things that would not have looked out of place at wealthy dinners three hundred years later. At the time that aristocratic teeth started to change, the substance of a high-class diet had not radically altered in several hundred years.</p>
<p>What changed most substantially by the late eighteenth century was not what was eaten but how it was eaten. This marked the time when it became normal in upper- and middle-class circles to eat with a table knife and fork, cutting food into little pieces before it was eaten. This might seem a question of custom rather than of technological change, and to some extent it was. After all, the mechanics of the knife itself were hardly new. Over millennia, people have devised countless artificial cutting implements to make our food easier for our teeth to manage. We have hacked, sawed, carved, minced, tenderized, diced, julienned. The Stone Age mastery of cutting tools seems to have been one of the factors leading to the smaller jaws and teeth of modern man, as compared with our hominid ancestors. But it was only 200 to 250 years ago, with the adoption of the knife and fork at the dining table, that the overbite emerged.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In premodern times, Brace surmises that the main method of eating would have been something he has christened “stuff-and-cut.” As the name suggests, it is not the most elegant way to dine. It goes something like this. First, grasp the food in one of your hands. Then clamp the end of it forcefully between your teeth. Finally, separate the main hunk of food from the piece in your mouth, either with a decisive tug of your hand or by using a cutting implement if you have one at hand, in which case you must be careful not to slice your own lips. This was how our ancestors, armed only with a sharpened flint, or, later, a knife, dealt with chewy food, especially meat. The “stuff-and-cut” school of etiquette continued long after ancient times. Knives changed—from iron to steel, from wood-handled to porcelain-handled—but the method remained.</p>
<p>The growing adoption of knife-and-fork eating in the late eighteenth century marked the demise of “stuff-and-cut” in the West. We will return to the fork (and the chopstick and the spoon) in Chapter 6. For the moment, all we need to consider is this. From medieval to modern times, the fork went from being a weird thing, a pretentious object of ridicule, to being an indispensable part of civilized dining. Instead of stuffing and cutting, people now ate food by pinning it down with the fork and sawing off little pieces with the table knife, popping pieces into the mouth so small that they hardly required chewing. As knives became blunter, so the morsels generally needed to be softer, reducing the need to chew still further.</p>
<p>Brace’s data suggest that this revolution in table manners had an immediate impact on teeth. He has argued that the incisors—from the Latin incidere, “to cut”—are misnamed. Their real purpose is not to cut but to clamp food in the mouth—as in the “stuff-and-cut” method of eating. “It is my suspicion,” he wrote, “that if the incisors are used in such a manner several times a day from the time that they first begin to erupt, they will become positioned so that they normally occlude edge to edge.” Once people start cutting their food up very small using a knife and fork, and popping the morsels into their mouths, the clamping function of the incisors ceases, and the incisors continue to erupt until the top layer no longer meets the bottom layer: creating an overbite.</p>
<p>We generally think that our bodies are fundamental and unchanging, whereas such things as table manners are superficial: we might change our manners from time to time, but we can’t be changed by them. Brace turned this on its head. Our supposedly normal and natural overbite—this seemingly basic aspect of modern human anatomy—is actually a product of how we behave at the table.</p>
<p>How can we be sure, as Brace is, that it was cutlery that brought about this change in our teeth? The short answer is that we can’t. Brace’s discovery raises as many questions as it answers. Modes of eating were far more varied than his theory makes room for. Stuff-and-cut was not the only way people ate in preindustrial Europe, and not all food required the incisor’s clamp; people also supped soups and potages, nibbled on crumbly pies, spooned up porridge and polenta. Why did these soft foods not change our bite much sooner? Brace’s love of Neanderthals may have blinded him to the extent to which table manners, even before the knife and fork, frowned upon gluttonous stuffing. Posidonius, a Greek historian (born c. 135 BC) complained that the Celts were so rude, they “clutch whole joints and bite,” suggesting that polite Greeks did not. Moreover, just because the overbite occurs at the same time as the knife and fork does not mean that one was caused by the other. Correlation is not cause.</p>
<p>Yet Brace’s hypothesis does seem the best fit with the available data. When he wrote his original 1977 article on the overbite, Brace himself was forced to admit that the evidence he had so far marshaled was “unsystematic and anecdotal.” He would spend the next three decades hunting out more samples to improve the evidence base.</p>
<p>For years, Brace was tantalized by the thought that if his thesis was correct, Americans should have retained the edge-to-edge bite for longer than Europeans, because it took several decades longer for knife-and-fork eating to become accepted in America. After years of fruitless searching for dental samples, Brace managed to excavate an unmarked nineteenth-century cemetery in Rochester, New York, housing bodies from the insane asylum, workhouse, and prison. To Brace’s great satisfaction, he found that out of fifteen bodies whose teeth and jaws were intact, ten—two-thirds of the sample—had an edge-to-edge bite.</p>
<p>What about China, though? “Stuff-and-cut” is entirely alien to the Chinese way of eating: cutting with a <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/the-only-knife-you-need-the-mu-127724" target="_blank">tou</a> and eating with chopsticks. The highly chopped style of Chinese food and the corresponding use of chopsticks had become commonplace around nine hundred years before the knife and fork were in normal use in Europe, by the time of the Song dynasty (960-1279 AD), starting with the aristocracy and gradually spreading to the rest of the population. If Brace was correct, then the combination of tou and chopsticks should have left its mark on Chinese teeth much earlier than the European table knife.</p>
<p>The supporting evidence took a while to show up. On his eternal quest for more samples of teeth, Brace found himself in the Shanghai Natural History Museum. There, he saw the pickled remains of a graduate student from the Song dynasty era, exactly the time when chopsticks became the normal method of transporting food from plate to mouth.</p>
<p>This fellow was an aristocratic young man, an official, who died, as the label explained, around the time he would have sat for the imperial examinations. Well, there he was, in a vat floating in a pickling fluid with his mouth wide open and looking positively revolting. But there it was: the deep overbite of the modern Chinese!</p>
<p>Over subsequent years, Brace has analyzed many Chinese teeth and found that—with the exception of peasants, who often retain an edge-to-edge bite well into the twentieth century—the overbite does indeed emerge 800—1,000 years sooner in China than in Europe. The differing attitude to knives in East and West had a graphic impact on the alignment of our jaws.</p>
<p>The knife as a technology goes beyond sharpness. The way a knife is used matters just as much as how well it slices. The tou that cut this Chinese aristocrat’s food a thousand years ago would not have been significantly sharper or stronger than the carving knives that were cutting the meat of his European counterparts at the time. The greatest difference was what was done with it: cutting raw food into tiny fragments instead of carving cooked food into large pieces. The cause of this difference was cultural, founded on a convention about what implements to use at the table. Its consequences, however, were starkly physical. The tou had left its mark on the Chinese student’s teeth, and it was there for Brace to see.</p>
