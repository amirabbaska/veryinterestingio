			<div class="markdown"><p>My background is in molecular biology/physiology, so this is a little outside of my wheelhouse. Maybe a thoracic surgeon will chime in. </p>
<p>I looked into it a bit more and found that I misremembered in the instance of pneumonectomy. The goal is to <strong>contain</strong> the fluid that builds up following removal of the lung, not prevent it. If the fluid drains, the other organs (heart and lungs) will try to fill the void, and can cause a twisting of the great blood vessels and the heart. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually sounds logical to me. What is the fluid made of? Being stabbed and bleeding nearly 10liters from where your lung used to be is going to be a messy scenery :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really interesting to me. I had a partial lobectomy of my right lung when I was born. They removed probably half of my lung. </p>
<p>I don’t have trouble breathing really. But my ribs and chest are smaller on my right side because the lung wasn’t as big to grow around. </p>
<p>The surgery also severed my right Lat and possibly some other scapular muscles, also my lower right pec. </p>
<p>I do weirdly burp sometimes if I’m doing a bunch of cardio, but not every time. Haven’t had any complications with my heart or lungs since I was a baby though. </p></div>		</li>
