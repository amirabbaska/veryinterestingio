			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly, but not likely. Some Russian scientists tried in the 1920s with no success, and another attempt by the Chinese in the 60s but there isn't a single scientifically valid example of a human-ape hybrid.</p>
<p>However, the degree of similarity of chromosomes in humans and apes seems to be similar to equines, and horses have successfully mated with donkeys and even zebras. Human spermatozoa can penetrate the outer membranes on gibbon eggs, and the thinking is that any possibility of hybridization is limited to Hominoidea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting. I would be interested in the legal ramifications of a possible human/ape hybrid to be honest. If they'd have to have human rights for example. (Although, for that matter, I would also be interested to know if possible extraterrestrials would have human rights).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Penetrating the outer membrane of an egg is an easy part... the whole acrosome reaction, following the penetration of an egg plasma membrane is an entirely different thing...</p>
<p>If it were possible, we would already have engineered gibbon eggs to make &quot;gifts of gods&quot; for us.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In theory it could be possible. There have been no confirmed reports of it but some unconfirmed ones. There doesn't seem to be any research into it now, likely because of ethical reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we wanted to reduce the ethical reasons we could experiment with hybrids between the other great ape variants. Orangorillas, Gopanzees, Chimpobos, Chimpotans, Bonorillas, and Bonobans would be really cool names for animals and if all (or some) of these hybrids were possible, then it is not too far off to expect Humatans or Bonomans to be possible too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going back to OP's original question, isn't it possible that chromosome merger that caused us to have 23 pairs occurred after enough other genetic changes to cause speciation.  I mean do we know what order the genetic changes occurred as populations drifted apart genetically? </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is the likeliest of scenarios; the ch.2 fusion did not precipitate our speciation, it most likely happened afterward. Denisovians had 23 pairs, just like modern humans, and we interbred with Denisovians in the past. Denisovians are a branch off of Neanderthals, and it's assumed that Neanderthals have 23 pairs as well. This fusion event happened <em>at least</em> 800,000 years ago, as this is the newest-known human/devisovian common ancestor.</p>
<p>But know that these fusion events don't usually affect speciation to any large extent, since the affected members gradually spread it through populations via drift and information hasn't been changed significantly, just moved around.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How do we know that?  I didn't think genetic information was stable past a few hundred years, maybe a few thousand in perfect conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speciation from what? At some point, a child was born with 46 chromosomes, and it must have been able to breed with its <em>immediate</em> relatives - other tribe members, cousins, etc. in order for this trait to spread through the population, eventually to the point where all humanoids of its species that have descendants today also had the trait.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure and that was addressed by the post I replied to.  The question</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How did the first human ancestor with 23 chromosomes pairs breed with 24 chromosome apes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>sounds to me like &quot;how did humans breed with apes in the past when they can't now?&quot;.  Op did not ask about breeding between immediate relatives, one with 23 pairs and the other with 24, op is asking about <strong>humans breeding with apes</strong>.  The change from 48 chromosomes to 46 did not change one animal from ape to human, right?  I've seen questions like this before from people questioning the reality of evolution and it's as if people think that one day, long ago, a fully modern human baby was born to a chimpanzee (or other modern ape) mother.  I am not saying that op thinks that but the way the question was asked...  </p>
<p>edit: oh and I was wasn't sure if we knew when the chromosome merger occurred so I was genuinely interested.</p></div>		</li>
