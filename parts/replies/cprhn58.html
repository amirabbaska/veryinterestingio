<p>And I could be wrong, but I believe ischaemia can also cause paresthesia if the Vasa nervorum are affected. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on your source as to the exact point at which the name changes. Netters has the swap from Subcl to Axillary around where the pec minor fascia attatches to the coracoid. Then axillary becomes brachial after the posterior circumflex humeral artery branches off. I've seen it slightly different in other texts/atlases. Anatomists need something to argue over, after all.</p>
<p>From what I understand, the ischemia can cause paresthesia if you take out a large enough chunk of the vasa nervorum, but there tend to also be redundancies/anastomoses, especially for major fibers.</p></div>		</li>
