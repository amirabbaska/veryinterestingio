			<div class="markdown"><p>Light from the sun has a mix of different wavelengths/energies. Some of which (UV, high wavelength) passes through the atmosphere and gets absorbed by the surface *or reflected or whatever, but lower wavelengths are absorbed easier, and when they are re-emitted at lower wavelengths by greenhouse gases (towards the surface at least) it becomes trapped and contributes to warming rather than leaving the atmosphere into space.</p>
<p>It's not so much the absorption that's important IIRC, but that the pollutants hang around, and the more of it the more light that gets trapped. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite, but the mechanics are essentially that - you're just missing a step.</p>
<p>The sun emits a lot of visible light and UV light.</p>
<p>Both these hit the Earth and warm it up, where it's re-emitted as IR light (this is blackbody radiation - thermal radiation emitted by all things in thermal equilibrium with their surrounding).</p>
<p>Greenhouse gases are largely transparent to visible light and UV light, so they don't impede light from the sun.</p>
<p>However, greenhouse gases are semi-opaque to IR light, so the emitted thermal radiation from the Earth is absorbed by them and can't be transmitted into space to cool the Earth off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very incomplete and slightly inaccurate answer. </p>
<p>I don't specialise in this field but I have completed a few chemical materials classes. </p>
<p>You are correct on the photons exciting electrons bit. However, glass is transparent not because the electrons having energy requirement different to that a photon provides, but because it has a structure that isn't at all band like. Silicon, used in making glass does have this structure, and remits light and so isn't transparent. Glass is SiO2. </p>
<p>Diffraction and absorbance are the two main processes that dictate transparency. You described absorbance and its mechanics. Diffraction also plays a large part as humans have become very efficient at making homogenous materials. The crystals in materials can be made very small and spaced out to let light pass right through. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ionizing refers to stripping electrons out of an atom to cause the entire atom to gain a net positive charge.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with affecting the way in which electrons excite.</p>
<p>Even in ions, electrons will only ever excite by whole level jumps. The precise energy that characterizes a &quot;whole level&quot; can be different for different atoms, and for different ions, but it's still only ever whole level jumps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you misunderstood. My point is that if the absorbing energy exceeds the ionization energy, we no longer have to deal with whole level jumps and the electron can absorb <em>any</em> photon. </p></div>		</li>
