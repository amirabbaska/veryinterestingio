			<div class="markdown"><p>interesting look into the science behind this. So lots of practice, slowing building up and training is a must. I'm not able to do this , no matter how much I force myself if I've never done this before.
Also this doesn't seem safe for many people, such as children. I was a thin boy and couldn't even finish a juice box! One drumstick would make me full and nobody could force anything more in me. For most people, the discomfort and feeling of close to bursting would discourage anyone from eating contests</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are your swallowing muscles (or abs) really strong enough to burst your stomach? If you force food or liquids down with a machine it’s a different matter of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But an overfilled balloon with an open top.  Unless the “swallowing muscles” stay closed under that amount of pressure.  If they aren’t strong enough to hold in that amount of pressure, I imagine the food would just start piling up into the esophagus before the stomach could rupture.  (Which would mean suffocating, but that wasn’t the question.)</p></div>		</li>
