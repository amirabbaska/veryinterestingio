			<p>I wouldn't even bother with windows password to be honest. It's good for keeping out people you share your house with that's about it. It's ridiculously easy to boot into a linux ISO and reset windows passwords.</p>		</li>

			<p>Not if you use whole-disk encryption such as Bitlocker. I mean, sure, Bitlocker won't keep the NSA out. But the average hacker/cracker/bored dude/script kiddy will not be able to get my data out from a Bitlocker-encrypted device, especially when I use TPM as well. Sure, yes, bad from NSA. But average dude? Good luck. </p>		</li>

			<p>Can I still boot to USB? I may still be able to win against your Bitlocker + TPM.<br><br>Just somehow need to trick you into letting me touch your machine, then get you to login, oh and I have to retrieve that data..<br><br>But even still, its funny how simple it is to get into some of the most secure containers in the world once you involve peoples.</p>		</li>

			<p>You are completely out of the loop.<br><br>Bitlocker = Whole disc encryption. MS has no signer key for this, only the user and (hopefully) their AD repository.<br><br>TPM = Tamper protection Management, means I can't tamper with the unencrypted sections of the drive or TPM will error out and not let you boot either.<br><br>So I can't attack the disc, I can't attack the OS in anyway at this point.<br><br>If you'd like to know more, you can ask me but please don't speak completely out of ignorance like you are some sort of source on the subject.</p>		</li>

			<p>Thanks for the interesting read, but that seems to out dated and only considers disk encrypted disks separate from Secure Boot.<br><br>However, if you have a machine with Secure Boot UEFI (all Win 8 and newer),  the modification of a boot loader is expressly forbidden when using Secure Boot on UEFI. <br><br>Summary (?) -&gt; <br><br>Encryption + Secure Boot -&gt; pretty darn safe. <br><br>Encryption w/ Secure Boot -&gt; Evil Maid compromisable.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>I found a giant PDF as the first google hit. But my reading of page 87(?) seems to suggest that if your OEM signs hardware updates, and requires they be signed, you are protected (as is the case with the SP3). I think that is the point of pages 81 and 82 about secure boot when referenced by page 86 (for me 87).<br><br>No more from me today. Have to finish work.</p>		</li>

			<p>RSA is being phased out in favour of things like elliptic curve cryptogrpahy which allow for the same encryption strength at significantly smaller key sizes. </p>		</li>

			<p>No. Bitlocker has nothing to do with your windows password. If a TPM is used, the decryption key is stored by the TPM, then when an unlock is requested, the key is passed to the OS to decrypt the drive.</p>		</li>

			<p>It gets even better - Bitlocker was a feature of ultimate/enterprise editions of windows, but now most people will have / are having home + pro editions, so its really safe for hacker to asume that at least 99% of people will not have that feature, add that to the fact, that not much of that 1% will be using bitlocker, or any 3rd party encryption in general, so basically it will be even lower amount of people than linux usage on desktops, thats like nothing, and its not what hackers are targeting, so yeah, in general, hackers are good to go, there is nothing much in their way, especially with win10 introducing Direct Backdoor API for nsa and government spies and hackers.</p>		</li>

			<p>I assume the PIN only logs you in locally though, in an office with domain servers probably 400 people may have access to my machine and I don't want someone seeing my pin and being able to get stuff audited to me.</p>		</li>

			<p>it's not really an extra layer, it just enables you to tell people how to log in to your computer without compromising your entire account, i don't get how this adds anything to the systems overall security.  (but you had better trust that person because they could install a keylogger to get to your true account information)</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;  that person because they could install a keylogger to get to your true account information<br><br>No they couldn't because they would need your admin password to install software unless you turned the Access Control settings off in which case you have just made your third mistake (stolendevice/pin/no admin password needed) and you deserve to have your data stolen at that point.<br></p>		</li>
