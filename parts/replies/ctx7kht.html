			<div class="markdown"><p>Not if you use whole-disk encryption such as Bitlocker. I mean, sure, Bitlocker won't keep the NSA out. But the average hacker/cracker/bored dude/script kiddy will not be able to get my data out from a Bitlocker-encrypted device, especially when I use TPM as well. Sure, yes, bad from NSA. But average dude? Good luck. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I still boot to USB? I may still be able to win against your Bitlocker + TPM.</p>
<p>Just somehow need to trick you into letting me touch your machine, then get you to login, oh and I have to retrieve that data..</p>
<p>But even still, its funny how simple it is to get into some of the most secure containers in the world once you involve peoples.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Right, but that assumes that they are using Bitlocker. You have to assume they aren't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>your not using them together. The pin does not allow access to your MS account...it only unlocks the computer.</p>
<p>The point is basically:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the account can be accessed remotely by any device use a long password</li>
<li>If the device is a physical local device that has the additional security of the fact that you are physically in position of the hardware then a PIN is sufficient.</li>

<p>No they couldn't because they would need your admin password to install software unless you turned the Access Control settings off in which case you have just made your third mistake (stolendevice/pin/no admin password needed) and you deserve to have your data stolen at that point.</p></div>		</li>
