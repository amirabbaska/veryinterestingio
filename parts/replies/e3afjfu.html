<p>So the average growth from birth to 6 months is 6 inches at a fairly steady rate. Compare that to the cases that do cause stretch marks like pregnancy when it's common for waist size to increase 20 inches in the same period. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now look at how much weight I gained from steroids (to suppress my immune system) over a 1-2 month time frame.  I gained 40 pounds.  I went from this thin guy at 145 pounds, at 5'10&quot;, to 185 pounds in 1-2 months.  My stretch marks are awful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And by a year they are only triple their birth rate. Growth dramatically slows when they hit toddler, and they hit growth spurts during periods of childhood and adolescence.</p>
<p>Kids do frequently get stretch marks and all kinds of pains when they hit their growth spurts in puberty.</p></div>		</li>
