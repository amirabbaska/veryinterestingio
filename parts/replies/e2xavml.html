			<div class="markdown"><p>I do not know any applications of the other types of ice (other than Ice VI and amorphous ice), as most of these only exist at impractically high pressures, such as the cores of gas giants. Scientists theorize there may be more types of ice, but the limiting factor in discovering them is the technology. We simply do not have the ability to simulate 1000000+ atm pressures with our current technology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water molecules are shaped like little elbows. At normal ambient pressure, when temperatures reach freezing these molecules align into a regular hexagonal shape like a <a href="http://www.denniskalma.com/river/icecrystal.png" target="_blank">honeycomb</a>. These regular shapes are a solids &quot;crystalline structure.&quot; This honeycomb is the form of ice we're used to seeing and is called &quot;Ice I_h&quot;. By playing with the temperature and pressure, you can get water to stabilize into <a href="https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/2018/8-understandin.jpg" target="_blank">different crystalline shapes</a>, and these are the different kinds of ice.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ice-nine is a fictional narrative device in Cat's Cradle. It's a very cool hypothetical doomsday device, but as far as I know, it does not exist in our universe.</p>
<p>Ice IX is a very real thing, but it is much more boring. It forms at temperatures below -130 degrees C and between 2000 and 4000 atm. Other than its inherent crystal properties and interesting formation conditions, it has no applications.</p>
<p>There are 16 known phases of ice with roman numerals, with the most recent, Ice XVI, being discovered in 2014. Interestingly, Ice XVI is theoretically stable at negative pressures (at tension). This would be impossible to sustain with current technology, as we would require 35000 - 70000 atm of <em>uniform</em> tension.</p></div>		</li>
