			<div class="markdown"><p>One time when I was little I went to the park with my sister. We were walking around the lake when we saw two turtles sitting on a tiny floating log. As the log drifted near us I stuck my hand out to touch the turtles. These two bigger kids ( I thought they were adults at the time because when you're ten years old even kids two years older than you seem like adults) said &quot;Jesus Christ man they will bite your finger off! Don't touch them!&quot; I thought they were being pussies but I didn't touch the Turtles because I was more afraid of the bigger kids getting pissed off at me. It wasn't till a few years later that I saw a video of turtles that looked just like the park turtles, biting and snapping shit with ease. The older kids were right. Maybe they're the reason I still have my fingers. Maybe they were my guardian angels. Maybe they invoked the power of Jesus Christ to save me. They're still pussies though because If I had touched those turtles and if I had lost my fingers then I'd have a cool story to tell folks when they'd ask how I lost my fingers. I'd seem like a badass. Thanks for nothing you fools.</p></div>		</li>
