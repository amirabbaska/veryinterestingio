<p>Plastic cups change the taste because when the plastic cups are formed, there are still left over monomers and short oligomers which are in the plastic matrix but not really connected to it. These chemicals slowly leach out. The traditional 'plastic' taste came from formaldehyde that leached out of old bakerlite cups; nowadays barely any chemicals leach out and those that do have almost no effect on human biology, so for the most part any 'plastic' taste is in your head.</p>

<p>Ish, the endocrine disruptions are still a thing and not every bit of plastic drinkware is &quot;BPA free&quot; let alone other variants of chemicals within that same family. Even the BPA free ones leach chemicals in to substances they are in contact with.

<p>Now, as to why the water out of plastic bottles at the store tastes weird... more than likely they have been temperature abused for some period of time while in transit or storage. leaving the bottles out on some loading dock for a few hours at 90+ F temps leads to more leaching of said chemicals to the water. (temperature abused... but still technically wholly drinkable) In this case the plastic taste is definitely not &quot;in the persons head&quot;. However, if we are talking about pouring freshly purified ice cold water in to a fresh clean plastic bottle/cup and drinking it... then yes the plastic taste is likely imaginary. </p>
<p>Now, Then we have things like tupperware, styrofoam cups, disposable plastic plates etc. Those too leach out undesirable materials in to foods they come in contact with. Oils and fats in contact with the plastics tend to help facilitate this leaching even more than heat does... fats also tend to seep in to the plastic structures partially due to the similarity of the compounds in question. Now, more than likely you wont taste the plastic stuff int he fatty clam chowder heated and consumed form a tupperware tub... you will however likely taste it in a hot cup of tea out of a Styrofoam container.</p>
<p>Related to the stuff above but mostly for sake of the bottled water and styrofoam cup things... btw never buy or use stryro foam cups with hot foods/drinks.

<blockquote>
<p>In Styrofoam and PS cups studies, hot water was found to be contaminated with styrene and other aromatic compounds. It was observed that temperature played a major role in the leaching of styrene monomer from Styrofoam cups. Paper cups were found to be safe for hot drinks.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The heat + plastic jug or bottle of water = plastic smell/taste is definitely obvious to me.  I've never had that sensation when I was drinking cool water or drinking water out of a freshly poured solo cup but if my BPA free water bottle sits in the sun for four hours in my car, it's practically undrinkable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I say 'plastic' taste, I'm refering to the distinctive taste that drinks in plastic cups used to have a few decades ago because of the bakerlite (that old brown plastic that literally everything used to be made out of) was specifically leaching formaldehyde into the drinks. While other plastics leach other chemicals, formaldehyde is unique to bakerlite, which was phased out specifically for this reason. You may get a funny taste from food and beverages stored in other plastic containers, but it's not the same distinct plastic taste that once was universal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure its not the same taste, but it is still an altered flavor related to leeching of undesirable substance to subsistence. Modern plastics also leave a very distinct and universal taste in to foods when not properly used/handled such as that in temperature abused bottled water which pretty much everyone born in the past 30-50 years will identify as the &quot;universal flavor of plastic&quot;... though it is different from the Bakelite one. </p></div>		</li>

<p>One day we will realize that the ubiquity of plastics for storing foodstuffs was a huge mistake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah thank you, </p>
<p>Though I should note that the benefits of plastics tend to out weight the harmful side effects on humans. In addition to that the types, quality etc of the plastics used has improved and will improve over time. The main benefits with plastics involve durability and the ability to make things such as lightweight aseptic packaging and act as a great moisture and oxygen barrier. </p>
<p>With food the Mylar bags that chips are stored in are a  great example of this... where there is a shiny foil middle layer sandwiched in between thin films of plastic. Without those layers of plastics partly due to the fragile nature of the foil pouch the chips would not be protected from moisture, oxygen etc and turn all sorts of funky in a very short period of time. Those layers also help to protect the foil in the bag from the chips themselves and the chemically reactive substituent components therein. Only real other alternative to that would be to ship chips in a glass, ceramic or stainless steel containers which would not be economical and likely be worse for the environment than plastics for sake of things like manufacturing related greenhouse emissions. </p>
<p>Other places those materials come in handy are with various medical and surgical supplies without plastic pouches it would be somewhat difficult or very costly to manufacture, ship and store critical sterile lifesaving supplies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely this process you describe takes some time to impact the liquid though?  Pour water into a plastic cup, a ceramic cup, and a glass cup then drink them immediately and they will still taste different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe because you're tasting the outside of the plastic/ceramic/glass? Do they taste different if you pour and then immediately drink through a straw? Blindfold test!</p></div>		</li>

blindfold and face up and and let a friend pour it into the mouth.  no touching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The straw would contaminate the test though - if all three taste the same through a straw in a blindfold test it could be because of the straw itself.</p>
<p>Regardless, I suspect you're correct - in fact that has always been my assumption of why they taste different.  For example, if I drink water from a Yeti (stainless steel) cup without the hard plastic lid on it the results taste different compared to with the plastic lid on.</p>
<p>This is why I'm dubious about all the answers involving chemical reactions that take long periods of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure the odor of the container affects how we sense the taste of the drink. I hate plastic cups because the drink always takes on the plastic/dishwasher odor of the cup. Our old Libby glasses that are etched from thousands of trips thru the dishwasher have a distinct odor very unlike the almost non-existent scent of our fancy leaded crystal wine glasses that get washes by hand. I don't think many drinks sit in the container long enough for anything to leach into the drink (hopefully not, especially in those leaded crystal glasses).  I think we just smell the cup/glass as we drink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amazing. In my region it's common to use cider glasses for virtually anything (<a href="http://www.ayrehoteles.com/content/imgsxml/es/textos_internos/escanciar-sidra.jpg?7c0716" target="_blank">picture</a>).</p>
<p>I guess the fact that they are so very thin and that they allow you to better smell what you drink along with what you've mentioned kind of explains it!</p></div>		</li>
