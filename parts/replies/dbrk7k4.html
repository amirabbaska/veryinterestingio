			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. It doesn't take that much imagination to conceive of a pressure-based treatment for arthritis that could theoretically come out of a complete understanding of things. Or perhaps adjusting blood gasses in a minor way. Or one of a million things that we can't possibly guess at cause we haven't studied it carefully.</p>
<p>Prioritising study goals is always tricky, but very rarely is the careful collection of information a complete waste of time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can't find the sources for these, and don't know if they're even true, but a few years back I heard a bunch of scientists had come up with a better/more efficient fuel injector (or something sort of fuel/rocket propellant related) by studying duck penises. And if we could mimic the way butterfly wings reflect light, it could lead to something crazy like 70-90% less power consumption on computer monitors and TV screens.</p>
<p>If it seems stupid or pointless, just remember duck dicks.</p></div>		</li>

My step-mom had an aneurism a little more than a decade ago, but when there's changes in pressure she's not getting up that day. Happens a lot since I'm in the Midwest, so she'll sometimes be out of commission for a full week. It's a lot better for her now since she's changed her medication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The interesting part to me is the confirmation bias. I read that yes, people do report joint pain during weather changes; but there's no data on how often weather changes are NOT accompanied by joint pain because those occurrences go unnoticed. So the information is lacking to say the two are truly related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think most people with &quot;weather related&quot; pain will tell you that there isn't always or even usually an observable weather change. But if we have friends or family who experience the same phenomenon, we can see the correlation. </p>
<p>Edit to add: I've lived in several different parts of the country over the years. In some I could predict the weather, in others hardly at all. I was most accurate in upstate NY and least accurate here in CA, where the weather never changes much anyway (but I still get &quot;weather related&quot; aches and pains). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this is purely anecdotal but I hope it gives you an idea that there are explinations possible for why bad weather may affect people only sometimes.<br />
I have chronic migraines. When they're really out of control it's basically one never ending migraine that rises and falls in severity over a looping a 5 day period. And at best (like right now!) It's one 4 hour mild migraine a month with constant mild headaches and muscle pain.<br />
A huge part of keeping control of my migraines is keeping track. Of triggers, of migraines and treatments.<br />
There are a wide variety of things which I can see help or hinder the frequency and severity of a migraine.  </p>
<p>My diet (lots of vegetables, low salt, low sugar, low caffeine, not to much potassium but not to little, no alcohol etc etc etc)</p>
<p>My sleeping habits (there's a correlation between irregular sleeping and incoming migraines; prodrome)</p>
<p>Exercise </p>
<p>Hormones (I nearly always get a migraine a day or two before a period)</p>
<p>Mental health (there's a correlation between an elevation in anxiety and an incoming migraine. I use CBT and stress coping strategies to maintain my anxiety)</p>
<p>And barometric pressure changes (weather, sunrise/set, flying).  </p>
<p>If I have been living clean for awhile and nothing stressful has crossed my path and I'm not hormonal, I don't even notice the weather. And if that reservoir is built up I can afford some chocolate or a drink, or a late night. But every trigger I allow weakens me. If I have more than two triggers or I've been dealing with one on going trigger for a long time (spring/fall weather or a stressful life event for example) it's much harder to take a hit. Rainstorms become a problem.    </p>
<p>To summarize, I only notice the weather if I have already been weakened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your description of migraine management sounds exactly like mine. I'll share something I learned this year from my massage therapist. I often get very tense neck and shoulder muscles from a combination of my migraines, my posture and working at the computer, and was told that the muscles along the FRONT of my neck and chest (especially along my collarbones) are tight and also contribute - and that this can happen for a variety of reasons, including: shorter, shallower breaths in more humid weather. Which struck me as quite important given that my migraines tend to peak in frequency in our more tropical summers in Australia, and then level out and happen far less frequently in the cooler months. Thought this might assist in giving another method of investigation for your migraine control. Good luck, it's the worst curse. I wish you pain free days! </p></div>		</li>

If nine of the times you suspected rain, asked her who said yes, and then it rained, it might just be that <em>you</em> are very good at predicting rain regardless of her knees.</p></div>		</li>
