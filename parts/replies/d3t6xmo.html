			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible to get multiple sicknesses at the same time, even without AIDS. When I was in college I had mono, strep throat, and parvovirus all at the same time (confirmed with lab tests). My doctor was very surprised and said she does not see this very often. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've tested positive for mono and strep before.  Odds are you had mono before and only had a flare up when they were testing you.  You carry the EBV (mono virus) for life, and you don't notice symptoms when it flares up again (even though you can pass it on).  Basically mono is throat herpes.</p>
<p>I also looked up a couple studies and it's hard to differentiate parvovirus from EBV, so it could also have been a false positive from the lab as well.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EBV is human herpes virus 4. (1&amp;2 being simplex and 3 being chicken pox), so yes it is technically throat herpes.</p>
<p>EBV can also infect genitals and what seems like extremely rare cases can even cause herpes blisters making it &quot;technically&quot; genital herpes ;) It wont make me go around worrying about gebital EBV though....</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh god, the summer going into highschool got completely ruined for me when I came down with mono and strep. That combo is hell. </p>
<p>Not to mention the antibiotic I was given for the strep while waiting for bloodwork results. Turns out if you take Amoxicillin when you have mono your whole body breaks out with a rash.  <em>Whole body</em>, no inch of skin was spared.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. About 65% of patients given amoxicillin for strep when they actually have mono get this rash. Not a fun time for the patient. Also not a fun time for the prescribing physician. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason AIDs is severe is because HIV kills CD4+ T cells which is not something a normal illness will do. Not to be pedantic but a normal infection won't result in massive depletion of T cells (indeed, it typically results in a proliferation) and this is where the risk of secondary infection comes in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your bodies last ditch effort is suicide, literally. It can be seen in ebola patients. There eyes bleed bruises form everywhere. Your body basically floods itself with fluids to slow down the virus and let the immune system take it out, but like I said, the chances of survival are slim.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the hemorrhagic symptoms of Ebola were due to dissolution of membrane integrity by the virus (among other things due to very wide range of host cells capable of being infected). Edema isn't a common response to all viruses, is it not? </p></div>		</li>
