			<div class="markdown"><p>Coefficients and constants kind of amaze me sometimes. That we can  distill an incredibly complex value or formula to a constant or a coefficient, and still be just as accurate, just seems like cheating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a while since I was in college, but that is the entire basis behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_parts" target="_blank">Integration by Parts</a>.  You're trying to integrate this complex expression, so you basically half-ass it, simplify everything, and integrate the simplified expression.</p>
<p>The exams were kind of a pain in the ass.  If you guessed the right transformation, the problems were simple.  If you were wrong, it'd take you forever until you finally gave up and guessed again.  Practice helped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Integration by parts is just the product rule for differentiation, but backwards and re-arranged a bit. It's not particularly complicated; it's more that you're being sneaky by spotting that something backwards is something else.</p>
<p>The product rule tells you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>d(u.v) = u.dv + v.du</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Integrate that, and we get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>u.v = ∫u.dv + ∫v.du</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or rearranging:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>∫u.dv = u.v - ∫v.du</p>
<p>If you guessed the right transformation, the problems were simple. If you were wrong, it'd take you forever until you finally gave up and guessed again.</p>

<p>Aah, I remember analysis courses like that. You could spend a couple of hours messing around trying to prove something - go to the supervision and see it done in 30 seconds in one line, and it be &quot;so simple.&quot; Funtimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well geometrically, the area of a square with side lengths u and v is uv; meanwhile, draw a random line through the square between two opposing sides (analytical line), and calculate the area in either part of the square split by the line; one part has area int(u, dv), while the other part has area int(v, du), so uv = int(u, dv) + int(v, du).</p>
<p>So integration by parts in nothing more than trying to determine some underlying reflectional symmetry of the integrand in question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Irrational constants in pure theoretical math are better represented through their relationships/formulas. They seem arbitrary because they're better explained by derivation.</p>
<p>One example is <em>e</em>, Euler's constant. It's actually just a limit of a fairly simple formula. </p>
<p>You shouldn't look at math as numbers. I like to see math as a tool because I'm an engineer but there is definitely something divine about it_ always reminding us that everything is connected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wiki version of the proof works with Taylor series coefficients. Remember the formula, for any &quot;suitably nice&quot; f(x), that it can be written as a polynomial a_0 + a_1 x^1 + a_2 x^2 + ... where a_n <em> n! = the nth derivative of f, evaluated at zero. On the other hand, for the specific function f defined for the proof, x^n </em> (a-bx)^n, is of course a polynomial of degree 2n, but when you FOIL it out (which is what wikipedia means by &quot;Expanding f as a sum of monomials&quot;), that x^n in front means every term of the resulting poly has itself degree &gt;= n, or put another way, the terms with degree &lt; n all have a coefficient of 0 (and the terms with degree &gt;= n, the coefficients are all integer multiples of a and b, so those coefficients are also integers). That should explain Claim 1.</p>
<p>Claim 2 is more straightforward Calc 2 stuff. The last bit might be a bit confusing, but isn't bad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is pretty basic once you understand it, but the amount of power that you have with simple calculus is pretty crazy to me. Like this is an elementary example but how with the position function we can find the acceleration of an object through the derivative and second derivative </p></div>		</li>
