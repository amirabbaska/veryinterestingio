			<div class="markdown"><p>soo, how do we know that the redshift is caused by the expansion of space rather than just regular movement of objects.</p>
<p>ie. a bunch stuff explodes flinging clumps in all directions. there will be bigger clumps, small clumps, faster and slower clumps. it would make sense in this scenario that the faster moving clumps would now be further away from us without needing space to have expanded?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hmm, OK I see where you're coming from, but ... blueshifting would mean there are things coming towards us. in a &quot;newtonian explosion&quot; anything slower than us would be behind us and we'd be moving away. anything faster would be ahead of us and moving away. other things at the same velocity but moving in a different direction would also be moving away.</p>
<p>hard to see how anything could be moving towards us? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you believe that we are at the exact geometric center than that could be a possible explanation. But the odds of that are... cosmologically small.</p>
<p>Since we see all distant objects redshifted, the easiest explanation is the expansion of space. As it happens, that expansion is also predicted by cosmological models of the universe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm questioning whether we are in the centre of an expanding wavefront (that is perhaps 90 billion light years thick).</p>
<p>I'm not saying that's the case, it's just that the rate of expansion accelerating is a very weird thing and I'd like to reassure myself there are no other altternatives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can figure out how much redshift is caused that way through careful observation, and taking measurements at different points in Earths orbit. Redshift due to relative motion would be different at different points on earth's orbit, but cosmological redshift as it is called, would not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you're saying. when Earth is travelling directly away from the object due to it's orbit, that's maximum redshift. at the opposite point of it's orbit there will be some maximum blueshift effect. </p>
<p>how does that help you prove that the redshift from the object is due to cosmological expansion rather than plain old movement?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In that video they say you determine the distance of the object by comparing the amount of redshift vs the original color of the light.  but if the light has redshifted how do you know what the original color even was to determine this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two ways, and these ways work together a little. </p>
<p>First one: Emission spectra! All elements emit light in a 100% consistent way that is specific to the element emitting light. Elements emit light in the same way regardless of whether they are on earth or billions of light years away. So, given that we know that the universe started out as being filled with hydrogen, and stuff far away is in the past from our perspective, we compare the light spectra from really fast away to that of hydrogen and see how big the shift is. </p>
<p>Building on this, type 1a supernovas give off light in pretty much exactly the same way every time they happen, and they are very bright and very unique. So we can use those and check their shift to see how far away they happened. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This raises more questions than it clears. Like how do we know that the light is red shifted and not the actual light coming from galaxy?</p></div>		</li>
