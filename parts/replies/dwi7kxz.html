			<div class="markdown"><p>They do though. If you ask a horse to canter straight, they’ll always lead with their preferred side. Also, some horses really dislike ‘leading’ with their non dominant side, and getting them to lead with it is really difficult, even when going around a corner where it would actually be easier to.
My first horse always lead with her right, and it was nearly impossible to get her to swap </p></div>		</li>
