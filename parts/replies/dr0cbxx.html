			<div class="markdown"><p>Graphene is just as great once it leaves the lab, the problem for the real world is justifying the cost of developing new fab processes to mass produce the devices with projected revenue from those new devices. </p>
<p>Like with the transistor, it was too expensive for consumer products in the early days. NASA and the DoD however needed small, hardy devices and had endless funding to contract companies like Fairchild and TI to make them. They subsidized the fledging semiconductor industry until they got cheap enough to build the transistor radio. </p>
<p>So with graphene you essentially are looking for an industry that needs the application and has deep enough pockets to subsidize the first components that utilize it. At the moment that looks like GE, GM and the other major car manufacturers who need fast charging, lightweight, high capacity batteries for renewables and electric cars, or the mobile industry who make luxury items and constantly need bigger batteries that fit in tight geometries. It will happen, it just takes money. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might take a lot of money though to get to a point where it's cheap to make it. Might not be cheap until we have nano scale processes. Is there any indication that we have a method that will scale into large scale cheap carbon structures?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like even if we have a great idea there is the possibility that we do not have the money to make them become a reality for most consumers. I would imagine this could be said for lots of technologies. Makes me wonder what other technologies aren't present in our lives due to lack of funding or interest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, never. I mean... It might be several years.</p>
<p>If they can make them cheap, they won the battery game, but it's unlikely they will be producing them for consumers soon. More likely to use them at events to show off how cool they are, but it would probably cost thousands to replace your iPhone battery with one of those</p></div>		</li>
