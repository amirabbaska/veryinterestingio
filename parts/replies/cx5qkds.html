			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there is an ELI5. Like processors didn't just pop up one day, it took like 20 or so years of digital circuit design before people even had the <em>idea</em> of this kind of machine. </p>
<p>I guess a better ELI5 is to think of a computer like a car. It's got a bunch of parts, but the most important is the engine. The engine itself is a very complex machine but does a simple thing, turn energy in gas into motion. Similarly, a processor is a very complex system that does some very simple things, move data from one place to another and do some math with it. </p>
<p>And just like an engine, to understand how it works you have to break down the goal into several individual problems. You want to be able to do math, so you need a combinational logic circuit. You want it to do more than one thing, so you need a control logic circuit. You want to be able to hold onto data, so you need chunks of memory. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And that's not even counting the decades of quantum mechanical theory that went into designing the semiconductor or getting the actual physical components to function.</p>

<p>Computers are just 20 questions machines except they ask millions of questions a second to figure out exactly what it is that you want them to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did the very first processor arrange atoms too or was it something more crude? I'm picturing Mr. Burns's grandpa's nuclear power plant where workers are cracking atoms with hammers, because I would think  building something so intricate and minuscule would require a tool like a computer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd be surprised. The manufacturing processes, packaging, and testing equipment that goes into making these complex integrated circuits is pretty gnarly. I used to work in a fab in test development, the gear we used to test the devices before being packaged was far more complicated than the devices themselves. </p></div>		</li>
