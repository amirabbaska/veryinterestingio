<p>Temperature-wise, earth orbit is actually pretty benign. The biggest problem is rejecting heat produced by the electronics, as you do not have convection to help you out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>20,000 rads (Si) is not that benign. That was the level we had to design to. And you do get extreme variations in temperature in earth orbit. Remember, the satellite during what we call eclipse season, will go from direct sunlight (brighter than on the ground) to dark shadow of the earth. There are whole departments at aerospace companies dedicated to thermal design. They model the thermal control from semiconductor junctions all the way to the outer surfaces. </p></div>		</li>
