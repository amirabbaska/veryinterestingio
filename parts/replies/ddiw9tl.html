			<div class="markdown"><p>Its odd to me that electrons, a seemingly fundamental particle, have precisely the opposite charge as a non fundamental particle. It sorta implies a substructure of some sort shared across all the particles. Where does this anomaly cancellation come from, and how does it give particles such nice charges?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces arise from a property called <em>gauge symmetry</em>, and without gauge symmetry, the theories wind up not well-defined.  Turns out if you write down a gauge theory where the charges don't have the right ratios, there are physical effects that ruin the gauge symmetry, and the theory becomes mathematically ill-defined.</p>
<p>Once you have the sorts of ratios that anomaly cancellation implies, then the charges of bound states and fundamental particles will also have simple ratios; a ratio of -1 happens to arise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lay-expert question: Out of interest, could you point me to a place where I can read more about this? Peskin-Schröder? I know what anomaly cancellation is in general, but not in this case specifically. I take it that in order to relate quarks and electrons, you have to use a grand unified theory? Otherwise, I don't see why anomalies for U(1) and SU(2) shouldn't just cancel individually.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Quantum anomalies] and [then] the theory becomes mathematically ill-defined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, it's not necessarily ill-defined, but really weird. After all, the chiral anomaly which violates CP conservation for the weak force is a thing…</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Protons (and neutrons) are composite particles. The &quot;insides&quot; are messy, but the long-lived parts are three quarks: up-up-down for a proton and up-down-down for a neutron. </p>
<p>The neutron having no charge means down quarks are -1/3e and up quarks are +2/3e. And nobody really wants to go through the hassle of redefining the fundamental charge to 1/3e (particularly as the electron appears to be an elementary particle anyway.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be a dumb question, but would that mean that at very close distances a proton would act like an electric dipole instead of a monopole?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since it has a net charge of +1, the electric field of a proton has a leading monopole term.  It is possible that there is an electric dipole moment, but this has never been measured, and is known to be no larger than 5.4×10^(−24) e⋅cm.  (At distances less than 10^(-15) meters, you would be in a regime where you wouldn't really think about the proton, but rather the constituent particles that make it up.)</p>
<p>If you do a search for &quot;electric dipole moment of the proton,&quot; you will find links to articles regarding past measurements and proposals for new measurements.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A proton electric dipole moment would violate time-reversal symmetry. Since time reversal is a good symmetry of the strong and electromagnetic (but not weak) forces, the proton electric dipole moment must be very small at best.</p></div>		</li>
