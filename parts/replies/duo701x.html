			<div class="markdown"><p>One point is that fluorescent bulbs have starter circuits which can have limited life cycles, which will shorten their life.  Long tube fluorescent lights usually have separate starters. </p>
<p>So that’s another consideration.  (I have an older IKEA CFL bulb that almost lights, and if you touch it, it will usually go full bright.  The starter circuit is bad on it but if the light can get going it works fine. )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given the special nature of metal halide bulbs other considerations come into play.
Starting the initial argon arc (or xenon in automotive) sometimes takes a few seconds, and the warm up period can be as long as five minutes (depending upon lamp type). During this time the lamp exhibits different colors as the various metal halides vaporize in the arc chamber.</p>
<p>If power is interrupted, even briefly, the lamp's arc will extinguish, and the high pressure that exists in the hot arc tube will prevent restriking the arc; with a normal ignitor a cool-down period of 5–10 minutes will be required before the lamp can be restarted, but with special ignitors and specially designed lamps, the arc can be immediately re-established.</p>
<p>On fixtures without instant restrike capability, a momentary loss of power can mean no light for several minutes. For safety reasons, many metal-halide fixtures have a backup tungsten-halogen incandescent lamp that operates during cool-down and restrike. Once the metal halide restrikes and warms up, the incandescent safety light is switched off. A warm lamp also tends to take more time to reach its full brightness than a lamp that is started completely cold.</p>
<p>All metal halide bulbs have a relatively short life span compared to new technologies that are available today. This article is going to share with you the &quot;shocking truth&quot; that you may not realize if you are the owner of metal halide fixtures. </p>
<p>So what is the &quot;shocking truth&quot;?</p>
<p>400 Watt Metal Halide Lose 50% Light Output At About 50% Of The Life Of The Bulb...</p>
<p>How long a lamp lasts and how long it's good for are two totally different things. Most lamp manufacturers rate their 400WMH lamps between 16,000 and 20,000 hours.</p>
<p>However as you can see from the chart (<a href="http://www.hoveyelectric.com/hovey-electric-power-blog/bid/77000/Metal-Halide-The-Shocking-Truth-In-The-Life-Of-A-Metal-Halide-Bulb" target="_blank">http://www.hoveyelectric.com/hovey-electric-power-blog/bid/77000/Metal-Halide-The-Shocking-Truth-In-The-Life-Of-A-Metal-Halide-Bulb</a>)</p>
<p>the lamps are only producing around 50% of there intended light after only 10,000 hours. (IN FACT...If you look closely, the lighting output begins to decline after you turn on the power to the new bulb.) </p>
<p>So what does that give you? Well, you get a fixture that gives you the equivalent of 200 watts of light for the cost of 400.....pretty sweet deal isn't it?  If you think so, you may want to look at the induction line below. </p>
<p>metal-halide-loses-50%-lighting-output-at-50%-of-rated-life</p>
<p>Therefore given all of these considerations as long as quick restart is not required it appears that the best option is to shut them off when not needed both from a cost savings of electricity as well as extending their full operating ability and end of life.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was mercury vapour lights that diminished with age, and that metal halide lights didn't. </p>
<p>I can imagine they would use quite a bit of power at start up though. </p></div>		</li>
