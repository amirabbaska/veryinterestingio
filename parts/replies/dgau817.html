			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it isn't dangerous at all to human fingers, as long as you don't sit there with your finger in a flytrap for twelve hours on end. As deadly as they are, it takes a long time for them to digest their prey; as such, putting your finger in a flytrap isn't dangerous. Add to this fact that a human finger is way too large to actually fit inside most flytraps, and so it just sort of closes around part of your finger. I've done this myself, and all you get is the weird sensation of the plant's &quot;jaws&quot; closing around your finger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the implication is that you would have to keep your finger in there long enough, just as the fly does not instantly dissolve. </p></div>		</li>
