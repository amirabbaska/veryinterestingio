			<div class="markdown"><p>Sodium channels in cell membranes are actually quite specific for Na cations due to a few different mechanisms. They're quite good at preventing K ions from entering the cell even if potassium is a similar size due to coordination and energy states. This is important because Na and K balance is an important part in governing biologic functions. </p>
<p>That aside. KCl is actually a thing for people on low Na diets. In my personal experience it has the same amount of saltiness.</p>
<p>Edit: first paragraph is science. Second is just my opinion. I know patients have reported it tasting different, I just think it tastes similar enough to not notice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to your comment:
Cations like sodium and potassium have a bunch of water molecules that cling to them. In order for a sodium ion to pass through a channel, it has to release the coordinated water and coordinate with some amino acids. Those amino acids residues are very rigid and really only fit the radius of sodium. Energy is conserved for sodium but not potassium since water bonds that are broken can be remade with those amino acids. That allows sodium through but not potassium to lose the hydration shell and pass through. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I formulate food products for a living, and if everyone thought potassium chloride tasted the same as sodium chloride my job would be a lot easier. Unfortunately, when working on low sodium formulations nothing gives you the same punch as plain old sodium chloride. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do most people perceive it is a different taste, or just a weaker version of the same taste?  I've had it before, and I thought it was plenty strong, but the taste was off, like the difference between caloric and non-caloric sweeteners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't sodium chloride a flavour enhancer, though? It actually increases the effect of other flavours. I actually prefer the &quot;taste&quot; of Potassium chloride, (it has a bitter finish, great with chips.) but it doesn't work so well improving seasoning overall. probably why it is mixed with sodium chloride in &quot;lo salt&quot; formulations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pick something with wild organic groups like Pb(CH3COO)2, and it could even taste sweet.</p>

<p>There's no could-even about it in the case of that particular chemical! It was a food and drink sweetener for millennia until the correlation between lead and madness / sickness / etc. became clear.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once had a condition called Conn's syndrome where my blood pressure and blood chemistry were all out of whack due to a malfunctioning adrenal gland.  I had to cut all added salt and had to use substitutes.  I used Nu-Salt which is Potassium Chloride instead of Sodium Chloride in normal table salt.  It tasted like hell to me.  My 84 year-old father-in-law uses the same stuff and says he can't tell the difference between it and table salt.  Your answer explains a lot.</p></div>		</li>
