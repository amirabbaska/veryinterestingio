			<div class="markdown"><p>Well ELI5 isn't supposed to be an actual explanation for a five year old.  They describe the idea in their sidebar rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E is for Explain - merely answering a question is not enough.</p>
<p>LI5 means friendly, simplified and layman-accessible explanations - not responses aimed at literal five-year-olds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So people are doing it right really.</p>
<p>I had a job where I had to explain technical things to people who had very little basic understanding of technological terms.  So i focus on analogy a lot.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/60pirb/eli5_why_does_turning_the_wifi_router_on_and_off/" target="_blank">Take this example</a> from another thread.  The top comment in my opinion isn't really in the spirit of the sub.  It is a great explanation, but it relies on people knowing what firmware is or what volatile memory is.  </p>
<p>My comment in the same thread I feel is more accessible to the idea of a five year old in the context of this sub.  Explain it as if a person had as much information as a child has, not as if we felt they were stupid.</p>
<p>Which i think is a great approach to ignorance generally.</p></div>		</li>
