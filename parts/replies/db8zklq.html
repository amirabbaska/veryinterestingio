			<div class="markdown"><p>the rete mirabile is amazing</p>
<p>they clutch with their feet so it has to be living tissue not dead like the beak. so that's a whole other problem with heat because it is so exposed</p>
<p>so they just put the feet on a separate blood temperature program</p>
<p>amazing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to that - pipefitter here. Always fascinated when nature designs it better than we could. I've installed a lot of heat exchanging type systems and they're a direct rip-off of the veinous systems of cold-climate waterfowl. Limited knowledge so correct me if I'm wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes complete sense. Canadian coastal dweller here, and I've driven by a local lake in winter and constantly wondered how a whole flock of geese and gulls and ducks is just standing on the ice or swimming on the open brackish parts without parts falling off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The beak is not &quot;dead&quot; in birds. In most birds, the bill is extremely sensitive and loaded with nerves and blood vessels just under that layer of keratin. In many species, it is a major area of heat loss, and is actually very important in thermoregulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also rete mirabilis. It's amazing how well that thing works. But if you ever wonder why a waterbird standing on ground in cold weather often stands on one leg, that's why â€” insulation of a rete mirabilis is great, but not perfect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that their bodies are not exposed to the cold water. The outermost feathers are pretty waterproof, and essential create a seal. They have a lot of inner feathers, like the down found in some pillows, which insulate the body. </p>
<p>Edit: I think I should also mention that these waterproof feathers require some upkeep. All birds have a gland near their tail that secretes an oil, which they gather with their bill and rub on their feathers. It's called preening, and they are basically 'zipping' up the barbs in the feathers. All birds do it to maintain and clean their feathers, and I suppose the oil for waterfowl helps waterproof too, don't know. I feel like waterfowl do it more often then other birds (that is just an observation on my part, don't know for sure). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV5_8pp9iGY" target="_blank">Here's a video of some Wood Ducks preening</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Countercurrent exchange as mentioned, but these birds also have a dense layer of down feathers under a layer of waterproof (waterproofed with oil from their uropygial gland) contour feathers. It's essentially like they're wearing a natural dry suit. It's not just sitting on ponds; many species of ducks, mergansers, loons, grebes, alcids, gannets, etc. must dive underwater for all of their food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ducks and geese have a lot more fat than other birds to help with the cold water, just like how seals and whales have blubber.</p>
<p>This makes them kinda heavy fliers. You see a sparrow just jump off the ground like it's no big deal. I've seen pigeons make practically vertical climbs from a standstill when someone almost walks over one unawares. On the other hand a duck or a goose will have to flap like a mothertrucker just to drag its fat ass out of the water and then it stays close to the surface, building speed in the ground effect zone before climbing out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the fat in waterfowl is insulating blubber as you would find in marine mammals. Instead, much like us, it's energy storage that allows the bird to maintain its metabolism when food is scarce or, say, when its migrating and flying for long periods. </p></div>		</li>
