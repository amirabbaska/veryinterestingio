			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in southeast Alaska and there is a bar in Juneau that serves drinks with &quot;glacial&quot; ice from the Mendenhall Glacier. It's super blue and actually denser than regular ice and also has bubbles in it that when they pop release air from 10,000+ years ago. Perty cool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...how would they ensure the ice was clean enough for consumption? I mean, it’s been sitting out in the open for 50,000 years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also been frozen for 50,000 years. Anything alive in it is long dead. Also, the northern environment is so pristine that there's not much to be worried about. I spent a summer on Devon Island in Nunavut; there is nothing living on that Island. We could safely just dip our water bottles into the rivers and drink.</p></div>		</li>
