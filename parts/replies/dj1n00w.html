			<div class="markdown"><p>To explain the analogy, the way mining based cryptocurrencies work is that you are given input data (the previous block + any transactions you feel like including in your block), then you add a magic number, and then perform a hashing function on it to get a single number out.  The rules of bitcoin determine what that number must look like to be acceptable, generally the number of leading 0.  If after doing your math, the number you get doesn't follow that rule, you try a new magic number and repeat the hashing.</p>
<p>Bitcoin (et al) can look at their recent history to determine if blocks are being mined too quickly or slowly, and that helps to determine the number of leading 0s required.  So when it was just one guy mining on his CPU, it was way less picky in terms of what kind of magic number you could pick to get an acceptable outcome as opposed to now when there are huge farms of specially built hardware.</p>
<p>As more power is added to the system, the system doesn't become faster, it just adds more requirements (like the hamburgers going from meatballs to perfectly crafted burgers to be acceptable).  </p>
<p>To incentivize people to mine, the first person to get an acceptable number and let everyone else know about it, gets a bonus, I think right now its either 12.5 or 25 bitcoins, plus whatever fees were attached to the transactions they included.  The bonus goes down over time, I believe it gets cut in half every 2ish years.</p></div>		</li>
