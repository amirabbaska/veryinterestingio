			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this analogy, except who the hell is going to lift the bags that are already stacked to put the new one underneath? I think the analogy works just as well if the next bag goes on top: the new bag has to be physically lifted higher and higher each time (requiring more energy/time) to clear the already stacked bags. The more you stack, the higher you have to lift it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this is a good answer.
You seem to imply that it becomes more and more expensive to charge the battery, requiring a higher and higher power, which is not the case. If that was true, it wouldn't even make sense to try to charge it to 100%.
As pointed out in other answers, it's about the charging process(constant current first / constant voltage later, temperature, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree- if the last ten percent of charging (or last bag of flour) took more energy than the first ten percent, then it should release more energy accordingly when the battery is used- and then it wouldn't be ten percent</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You &quot;could&quot; do that, but as a power source (using above analogy) you want potential energy to be increased. Stacking them side by side is... Useless. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? Is there an equation of some sort that proves this? Not doubting you, I'm just having a hard time visualizing how that works.</p>
<p>Edit: Nevermind, I figured it out. Lifting 2 units x inches is the same as lifting 1 unit 2x inches. Basic algebra.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it would make the analogy clearer, though. Then, you could keep the bike in the same gear, and would just have to pedal longer for each bag as it has to go higher.</p></div>		</li>
