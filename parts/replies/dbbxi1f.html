			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not a doc or scientist, but an acupuncture lover so this is purely anecdotal. About 5 years ago, I started to develop debilitating back pain. It was in my upper back and would radiate through my chest to the point where it felt like I couldn't breathe. I went to the doctor and she did some x-rays and found the slightest scoliosis that hadn't become an issue until I started working a desk job. She prescribed muscle relaxers but I didn't want to take them and I opted for acupuncture instead. It took awhile, but after maybe 10-12 visits my back pain was completely gone. I go in for a tune up once in awhile and it's enough to keep the pain at bay. </p>
<p>When I was going, my acupuncturist would connect those electroshock clips to the end of the needles and it would deliver the tiniest most satisfying shocks right into the muscles. That may have been what helped with the pain. Another theory I have is that it facilitates blood flow to the areas of pain, which could increase healing from within, I have no idea if that's really a thing or not just something that vaguely makes sense to a layman like myself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good to hear stories like yours. However, the vast majority of back pain tends to resolve on its own over time. It's likely you would have improved just as much without the acupuncture. Additionally, there's a very good chance the scoliosis on the XRAY didn't have anything to do with your pain. Lots of people have abnormalities on XR. Often it is attributed to abnormalities found on plain film which have nothing to do with the cause. Problem is more likely muscular or ligamentous or even disk related, which wouldn't show up on plain films. Important to keep an open mind on that, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to hear your diagnosis, that sucks. I was unaware PD caused physical pain to the point of needing pain medication. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For Young Onset especially, pain is the most commonly experienced and under considered and reported issue. When you're unable to relax your muscles and cannot experience REM sleep, it's very difficult for those overused muscles to recover. </p></div>		</li>
