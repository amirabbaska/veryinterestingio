			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you trying to tell me <em>its the vibration of the mass of the whistle</em> that makes the tone, like a drumhead?</p>
<p>Thats not even true for giant vessel flutes, organs, or reeds.</p>
<p>A whistle is tiny, and also, you know, <em>held with your fingers</em>, muting any kind of resonance.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of the whistle, the noise is <em>definitely caused by the air.</em></p>
<p>These two examples create sound using different principles. In the case of the whistle, the air interacting with the reed/opening makes it oscillate, and in the case of most whistles and instruments, resonate in a tube. It is the oscillating mass of air at the opening and at the ends of the tube transmitting the majority of the sound energy to the outside. The solid metal bodies of most instruments and some whistles would resonate at much higher frequencies, and a plastic whistle would not resonate at all or couple with any sort of efficiency to the outside air to be able to produce anywhere near that volume.</p>
<p>In the case of the garden hose, the noise is coming from random turbulence moving the body of the hose. The water can do this much more effectively without resonance because it has more mass. You'll notice there is generally no tone to the noise.</p></div>		</li>
