			<div class="markdown"><p>The light would be exactly the same as on Earth. As I said, the spaceship isn't moving, not any more than Earth is moving. Saying &quot;a spaceship is moving at 0.5 c&quot; doesn't really make sense. What does make sense is saying &quot;a spaceship is moving at 0.5 c compared to earth&quot;, but in that case the weird properties would only start appearing if the light comes from earth. The light from inside the spaceship would be totally ordinary light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can calculate the speed of the rocket compared to earth. When you hear things like &quot;voyager is the fastest man-made object&quot;, that's what we're talking about.</p>
<p>More generally, you can calculate the speed as soon as you have a reference frame. If you pick an object in space (the earth, the sun, the center of the galaxy...), you can define this object as your reference frame. You decide that this object doesn't move, and you calculate speed compared to that object.</p>
<p>Without a reference frame, there is no speed. It's not that you don't know the speed, it's that the concept of speed is meaningless. There is no such thing as &quot;the speed of a rocket in space&quot; with no reference frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's accelerating, then mustn't there be something that it is accelerating from? Like, an ion drive accelerates from ion launched from the ship. Is acceleration therefore relative as well, or no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason I say speed is relative and acceleration isn't is that you can't know your speed without observing the objects around you, but you can know your acceleration. Suppose you're inside the spaceship and there are no windows. You can't see the planet's around you, or the ion particles which your ship is sending. You have no way of knowing your speed, but if you hang a mass from a spring you can calculate your acceleration.</p></div>		</li>
