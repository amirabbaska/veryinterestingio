			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's take this a step further, wouldn't it be fair to say that the kinetic energy of the objects are now potential energy? The potential is converted back into kinetic energy once it encounters another object with a different frame of reference. </p>
<p>For instance a swinging pendulum has kinetic energy through its swing but has only potential energy at the peak of each swing.
Let's imagine we are traveling along side it on a slightly longer string we would slowly get out of phase and its kinetic vs potential would grow and decline relative to how well or poorly you are synced up.</p>
<p>FYI I'm sleep deprived and may not be making any sense at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the particles would have potential energy from your frame of reference.</p>
<p>The pendulum has gravitational potential energy, because gravity is acting on it.  There's no gravity or equivalent force acting on the particles in the question.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Measuring the kinetic energy of the laughing and receding Neil et. al, however should give you the same answer that Neil gets as he giggles, watches you receding and measures your kinetic energy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No! Your <em>momentum</em> as measured by Neil is the same as Neil's momentum measured by you. But the kinetic energy is different (unless you and Neil happen to have the same mass).</p>
<p>This occurs in Newtonian physics as well. A charge at rest detonates, sending a 2kg block to the left at 1 m/s, and a 1kg block to the right at 2 m/s. They have the same momentum, but the second block has more kinetic energy (per KE = .5 m v^2)</p></div>		</li>
