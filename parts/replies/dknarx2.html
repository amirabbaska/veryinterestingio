<p>The practice began in an interesting way. In the early days of consumer goods, a known brand really made a difference. Early retailers spotted an opportunity to sell non-branded goods for much less to customers who couldn't afford the branded version. But everyone knew these cheaper versions were inferior. </p>
<p>The emergence of large chains like Wal-mart gave them enough buying power to lean on suppliers to provide a store branded cheaper product that was of a much higher quality. At first it was pretty collaborative, with each side figuring out essentially how to sell more product. But over time, as the large chains got larger, the outcome was essentially that you sold two versions of your product, one store labeled. </p>
<p>Some of the bigger brands pushed back. Firms like Heinz, Pepsi and Coke had a strong enough brand that a shopper would go elsewhere if their products weren't stocked, and so these firms could resist. Others, like Colgate, produced a gazillion types of their products and invested strongly in advertising so consumers would insist on their particular type of toothpaste. </p>
<p>I used to wonder the same question as the OP and enjoyed finding out the answer later in life both how and why. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, Usually the top brands do not do contract / store brand. Coke &amp; Pepsi are a big example of this. Their names are so well known, and their tastes so distinctive that they don't need or even want to get involved in store brand.</p>
<p>They also have the advantage of being the biggest names in the restaurant business. So when people go out to eat they get coke/pepsi and develop a taste for it that they want to continue at home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to add that the math doesn't tell the whole story. </p>
<p>There are a lot of logistical issues that a manufacturer would have to deal with that a retail store already has built in. </p>
<p>(using your example) Jack Daniels has to advertise. It might not be much, but Costco doesn't need to. The location in the store is enough to get people to buy it, especially sitting next to the expensive name brand. To be fair, Jack Daniels likes to be seen as the name brand that costs a bit more. </p>
<p>Distribution. Jack Daniels doesn't just have to get their product to Costco. They have to deliver to Target, Bevmo, a million local liquor stores, etc etc. Costco buys their bulk order then transports it to their own logistic system that would run anyway. </p>
<p>Competition. Jack Daniels doesn't want you to buy Wild Turkey. If you do, they don't make any money. Costco wants you to buy the store brand because they get the most mark up, but if you buy Wild Turkey or Jack Daniels or Glengooli Blue, they still make money. </p></div>		</li>

<p>To put this another way, many big companies want to be their own competition and want control of their brand. It's often preferable that the brand they put so much time and effort into forming (say, Jack Daniels) is associated in the public mind with a higher price point and, perhaps, a slightly higher packaging and product quality even though it's basically the same. If you don't want to buy that brand, they still want the sale, but they don't want to compromise their brand by associating it with that cheaper sale, so they allow somebody else to re-brand the cheaper sale.</p>
<p>Additionally, even if the store brand is perceived as the same quality, having other people re-brand your product offers other benefits. Let's say that Jack Daniels has some scandal related to rats in their factories or brutal working conditions and a big portion of the population decides to boycott Jack Daniels and instead buys this other re-branded/store-branded version of their product. There is a benefit to consumers thinking there is competition where there is not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know someone who worked at a call center for Avis/Budget rental cars. One of the biggest kicks they used to get there was when they got a customer who would get all mad trying to haggle a better deal and end up saying something like &quot;well screw this, I'm just going to go get a better deal at Budget!&quot; only to be the one to answer the same customer's call at Budget.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amidst the speculation as to who makes each variety of Kirkland brand liquors, I believe the only booze where you can easily identify the distiller is tequila. By regulation, in order to be called 'tequila,' one of the specifications is that each bottle must have a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Oficial_Mexicana" target="_blank">NOM</a>, a number that identifies the distiller that made the tequila at hand. You can find this 4-digit number on <em>every</em> bottle of 100% agave tequila.</p>
<p>In the case of Kirkland <a href="http://www.tequila.net/tequila-reviews/blancos/kirkland-signature-tequila-silver.html" target="_blank">Silver</a> and <a href="http://www.tequila.net/tequila-reviews/anejos/kirkland-signature-tequila-anejo.html" target="_blank">Anejo</a>, the NOM is <a href="http://www.tequila.net/advanced-tequila-search/tag/tdistillery/fabrica-de-tequilas-finos-sa-de-cv/" target="_blank">1472, or Fabrica de Tequilas Finos S.A. de C.V.</a>, who make a variety of tequilas of varying qualities, both high and low. The reposado is <a href="http://www.tequila.net/advanced-tequila-search/tag/tdistillery/destiladora-del-valle-de-tequila-sa-de-cv/" target="_blank">1438, or Destiladora del Valle de Tequila</a> (though Kirkland reposado is not listed on tequila.net).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong. Scotch under a kirkland label always has at the very least the scottish bottling company on the label. Scotch Whiskey has even tighter restrictions than Tennessee Whiskey.</p>
<p>Most of the bottles sold at Costco are bottled in Scotland by Alexander &amp; Murray. So you might not know which distiller the contents came from, but you definitely know who bottled (and if applicable, blended) it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couple different points - </p>
<p>Costco has to authorize a major purchase, and it usually comes down to advertising and specials. For example, Labor Day is coming up. Costco rival A already agreed to sell 12pk beer at $12.99, with a cost of $12.25. Costco rival B gets wind of this and agrees to the same deal. Costco catches this and decides they want a better deal. In states where it's legal, they get QD (quantity discount), driving their coat to 11.75. They can take the margin down, sell at $12.49 and beat their competition's ad box. In states where it's not, there are other ways to protect their margin, but I'm not getting into that here. </p>
<p>All of this activity is contingent on the distributors. They have to anticipate the heavy up, get the beer to Costco and on the floor for sales impact. </p>
<p>One example, we're already talking holidays with the major retailers. We commissioned 400k CE (case equivalents) of a holiday special run of liquid. A large mega national chain has already committed to buying everyone ounce of liquid, and will sell at 100% markup, meaning no other chain will have access to the inventory. Knowing this, the distributors need to review their market, anticipate how many of those retailers will carry the material and order accordingly. If they don't, we'll have an area or region without the special brew and the chain will be PISSED</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in advertising and work with a few companies that do business with Costco.  You 100% right.  Other things to consider is that from a company perspective because it's not labeled as your company's product you're not worried about it from a competitive aspect. Additionally this is the cost to actually be in a Costco store. Unlike a supermarket Costco doesn't have a lot of Brands so from a competitive perspective you really don't have anyone to compete with so it's worth the price of admission to give up some of your product for it to be relabeled as Kirkland products. </p>
<p>For Costco what they are able to do is keep their private label, Kirkland, product at a high quality level so that people are willing to buy the product. So what people don't realize is that Kirkland baby formula depending on the year could be Similac or Enfamil. Kirkland coffee is made by Starbucks and Maxwell House.</p></div>		</li>
