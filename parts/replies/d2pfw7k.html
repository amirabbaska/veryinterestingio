			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently took a Psychopharmacology couse (I'm an undergrad but the class was structured more like a graduate class) with a professor I trust to be up to date with research and thurough in his explanations. He mentioned the possibility of two types of depression, one more focussed on 5-ht and one more focussed on NE. He said there were clinical differences between the two, for instance NE patients are supposedly more likely to make violent (like self inflicted gunshot/cutting as opposed to pills) suicide attempts but less likely to externalize suicidal thoughts making this harder to detect until it actually happens. Have you read any research about such a distinction? He did mention that it was very recent research and not fully explored as of yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm undergrad too actually! I haven't heard about those differences despite taking pharmacology myself but that's super fascinating. What I find interesting is that the  lecture I've summarised above came from a neuroscience course whereas my pharmacology professor's take on it was much more orthodox and based on the chemical imbalance model. There appears to be a lot of debate and differing viable models at the moment.</p>
<p>To actually answer your question (in my less-than-completely-educated opinion) I haven't seen any research to that effect but I think what we call depression today is a heterogenous disorder. I think 10 years from now we'll be discussing neuroinflammatory depression, depression as a result of neuron loss not linked to inflammation, as well as a spectrum of chemical imbalance depression types</p></div>		</li>
