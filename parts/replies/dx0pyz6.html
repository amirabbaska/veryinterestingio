			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a side side note: we have no idea if this is true. He was credited for a lot of work that people in this &quot;cult&quot; did, but there is no evidence that tells us whether or not that is the case for this particular theorem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except for the fact that the theorem had existed for centuries before Pythagoras and there absolutely 0 written evidence that indicates he had any part in the development. I'm also confused as to why you put cult in quotations. Are you not aware of the Cult of Pythagoras or what it was?   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forming the cult certainly helped, but probably mostly general ignorance and luck. Unlikely to happen in the modern era.</p></div>		</li>
