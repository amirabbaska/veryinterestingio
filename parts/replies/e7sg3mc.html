			<div class="markdown"><p>I noticed this when I lived in a desert. Now I live in the south and I notice the pollen. I haven’t cleaned the furniture on my screened porch all summer and it’s yellow with pollen dust. I’m sure there’s a ton of it in my house mixed with the normal grey dust from dander, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with long hair, it's insane how much of the dust bunnies I pull out from the furniture are hair. I'm constantly finding clumps of my own hair.  </p>
<p>I also used to live near a cement plant (which is weirdly right in the downtown core of my city) and the amount of soot that came in around the windows from the trucks driving by... my white patio chairs would get a thick layer in a month or two. I could see where it'd come in around the windows. Even now I live in a building mostly surrounded with trees but with parking around the outside, I definitely see the same soot on my windowsills if I leave my windows cracked.</p></div>		</li>
