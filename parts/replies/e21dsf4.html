			<div class="markdown"><p>The movie theaters near me keep playing this ad that is quite literally &quot;look how awesome our theater is because our speakers go <em>this</em> loud&quot; and then plays shitty dubstep FULL FUCKING BLAST. I legit had ringing ears for the first 30 minutes of the movie. Fuck you Cinemark.</p>
<p>EDIT: As some suggested, I've now a decibel reader on my phone. I'll be getting readings from our loudest aircraft not too far away (pilot) and the theater ad to compare them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done a bit of amateur live audio mixing in the past, and there's absolutely nothing shameful about protecting your hearing imo, especially if it's one of the core aspects of your job. It's just a bit of machismo that very few people care about. You should consider getting a pair of flat-attenuation earplugs for maximum enjoyment while still being safe.</p>
<p>Your ears are a tool like any other one of your senses. You wouldn't tell a woodworker to forgo his safety goggles, or someone doing construction to not wear steel-toed boots; I don't think this should be any different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most theatres today can easily break into the 120-140dB range with no trouble; assuming 2 hours for previews and everything, the cutoff for damaging levels is 91dB. Most dialog is mixed to be 87dB at the middle of the theatre if I recall correctly. So, without earplugs, you’re pretty much guaranteed some minor hearing loss from seeing a movie... </p>
<p>(For reference on that upper end, when I saw Dunkirk I measured it at 108 at some points. That’s got a window of 1.8 minutes before hearing loss sets in... Granted I thought the loudness and sharpness of it added to the movie, but from a health standpoint it’s a bit reckless) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I had to do for my system, now it’s mostly nice. Except for John Wick II, for some reason the gunshot was getting piped though the center channel much louder than the dialogue. Probably my settings, I’m always messing with them, but that one was annoying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>interesting that you mentioned John Wick 2, because my copy of John Wick 2 had an audio option that balance the audio so that quiet scenes were louder and louder scenes quieter, and it's the most amazing thing I've ever heard. I wish all movies had it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What? You don't enjoy going from straining to hear mumbling dialogue at low volumes to deafening blasts of gunshot and cars crashing.</p>
<p>But yeah this has definitely been a trend, making the dialogue the softest most mumbliest quiet possible whilst maxing out on the louder scenes. </p></div>		</li>
