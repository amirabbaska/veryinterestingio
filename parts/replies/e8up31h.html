<p>Or would this behavior only be possible due to redshift?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can use synthetic aperture radar to make an &quot;image&quot; using microwave RF that has surprisingly good resolution. Could you do the same with the red shifted light in this example to create such a large aperture that you could get decent resolution from reflected light?</p>
<p>I'm not sure how receiving a signal from some other source (and perhaps a diffuse source at that) would compare to the relatively small aperture of a typical radar transmitter when it comes to resolution but it seems like it would be detrimental. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Radio waves are actually light. Different wavelengths of visible light are perceived by us as different colors, from the shortest wavelengths (violet) to the longest (red). Light with a longer wavelength than red light is infrared, and it's invisible to our eyes. Radio is just light with an even longer wavelength than infrared.</p>
<p>So while we can't see radio waves with our eyes, we can take images with radio telescopes. <a href="https://public.nrao.edu/gallery/saturn-in-radio-waves-2/" target="_blank">Here's a photo of Saturn in radio</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of a thought experiment.</p>
<p>I was curious about being able to see wi-fi signal, similar to the way you see heat, or UV with special cameras.</p>
<p>An afternoon of napkin engineering made me realize i'd have to build a portable radio telescope (camera) and i realized i was way over my head. </p>
<p>are there industrial devices out there that can do what I just described?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Visible light waves and radio waves are both electromagnetic waves, just at different frequencies. Sound is a physical wave through a medium, more akin to the waves in an ocean than radio or visible light.</p>
<p>Sending out radio waves so they bounce off something and detecting the returning signal is pretty much the same as shining a flashlight and seeing the returning image. </p>
<p>In fact, that's exactly how radar works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe worth noting that the black hole in Interstellar is close to maximally rotating, since circular orbits for non-rotating black holes are not stable at distances close enough to have a redshift factor of 60,000. ISCO (Edit: Innermost Stable Circular Orbit) for a Schwarzschild black hole is 6 times the radius of the event horizon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black holes are, in some ways, really simple objects - there are only a few properties they have that affect the world outside the event horizon: Mass, Spin, and Charge. It's widely assumed, for good reasons, that astrophysical black holes (i.e. ones that actually exist in nature) don't have any net charge, which just leaves spin and mass. The spin of a black hole will actually drag spacetime around with it, which leads to some different effects compared to one that isn't spinning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Invisible to human physiology, but you can still detect it with instruments sensitive to IR, microwaves, radio waves, etc.; remember that almost everything we observe in distant space, we don't see with our naked eyes.  We have instruments and telescope that can detect electromagnetic radiation (light) all across the spectrum, and we observe how those instruments react.</p></div>		</li>
