			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I don't care where the particular electron powering my laptop came from. If &quot;buying&quot; from a renewable provider encourages that provider to make new investments and add more capacity to the system, and discourages future investment in fossil fuels, then that's good enough for me. You have to look at it from the societal level. Earth doesn't care where each electron goes either (or if we survive the Great Filter, but that's a different issue).  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Let me interject here for a moment and make the technically correct but also completely annoying observation that in an AC system, not a single electron will actually travel any amount of distance but bounce back and forth in the conductor.</p>
<p>OTOH, it actually strengthens your argument, as all connected generators participate in keeping things oscillating: As long as there's a single renewable generator in play, the electricity arriving at your home cannot possibly be 100% non-renewable, it's equally everything that's connected up. Roughly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Current describes the net flow of charge, not the instaneous flow of one charged particle. Electrons are always bouncing around, and they absolutely do move. If there is no current, the electrons move about but the net flow is zero. If there is D.C. current, the electrons move about, some in the direction of current flow and some against the direction. But the net flow of electrons is against the current. AC current is the same way but the net flow oscillates. The net flow of all the electrons is what current describes, not one single electron. Electrons are constantly moving</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is really what it is doing.  Solar and Wind are going to sell all of their capacity to the grid either way.  All the consumer is doing is subsidizing the rate that the renewable company receives for a particular amount of energy.  If no one specifically purchased renewable energy, the electric company would pay them the same commodity rates that they pay other suppliers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is absolutely true that you cannot select the source of your power, but it is also not of any importance.</p>
<p>The power is no different once it hit the grid. So if you are paying for renewable energy. You are paying extra to make renewable power more profitable, so there will be invested in more renewable sources. </p>
<p>You analogy is stile apt, with the stipulation that no matter what, you where forced to drink the lake water. Just like we are all forced to breath in the pollution of the coal plant and live with the effect of greenhouse gasses.</p>
<p>The problem with this kind of free market tool is that it need a lot more support for it to have any effect. There needs to be a demand for more renewable energy than is supplied, then there is an actual loss of income for not being able to produce the needed amount of power on a yearly basis to take you money. </p>
<p>I remember when we got this option. There was a huge campaign and it was in the news for days. About 1% signed up..... At that time we got about 40% of out power from renewable sources. So it showed that 90% of people found clean power important, but most where not willing to pay a token amount for it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well let me say, I'm a big supporter of renewable energy.  However, I have my doubts about that renewable energy claims when selling electricity.  </p>
<p>A renewable energy plant produces only so much power (as it true for any type of plant).  Never have a I heard a renewable source state, <em>&quot;sorry we've sold our entire energy production for the year, we cannot accept your transfer to our service&quot;</em>.  Because of that, they must be buying power from other sources such as coal, oil, etc.   That's really why I say it'a bit of a scam.  </p>
<p>Buying electricity from source A which makes no claim about it's source allows them to buy their capacity any type of production, including renewable (but typically the cheapest source).  Buying it from source B, which is renewable does not allow them to buy the electricity they sell from alternate sources like coal, oil, etc.  So there's very limited production, yet they mysteriously never run out of production for the purpose of sales.  Having more customers does not mean they expand and add production capability. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They could also buy the power from another renewable source. However, corrupt business practices is always a risk, but that does not make the program a scam. Some companies might be scamming people, but that are two distinct things. </p>
<p>However, it is fare more likely that there is an overflow of renewable energy compared to the willing to pay extra for it.  At least if the numbers from where I live is anything to go on. The information is harder to get in the US as it is not collected automatically.</p>
<p>11% of grid power is from renewable sources in the US. So it would mean that a hell of a lot more people would have had to put there wallet where their mouth is, compared with here in Denmark.
Considering that the difference in cost is greater in the US and a low percentage identify clean power as a major concern I really doubt it. </p>
<p>It would make a really good uplifting story / expos√© for someone to wright, if you where right. </p></div>		</li>
