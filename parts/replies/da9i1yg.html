<p>It's not really a cure, but because you have these other things that are self-reinforcing, seems like it would help to do other things that tug the wheel back in the other direction a little bit: exercise, diet, friendship, safe work environment, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What was the value your physician determine was a &quot;normal&quot; testosterone value? Was your estrogen E2 (sensitive assay) tested as well? Most physicians are a completely uneducated in testosterone replacement therapy and think that a testosterone production value for a 90 year old man is okay. I used to have an okay sex libido, frequent manic depression, and zero energy. But ever since I was placed on a proper TRT regime (test + hcg + ai) I have had a complete opposite. My libido is through the freaking roof (albeit not everyone has this effect), no more depressive episodes, tons of energy. Also everything other than injections for exogenous test is pretty much garbage for various reasons (cost, effectiveness, adjustability, etc). TRT literally has been the best life changing decision I've ever made. </p></div>		</li>
