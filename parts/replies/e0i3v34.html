<p>That's just how long it takes a photon to travel from the core to the surface of a star. Then when all the photons have left the radiative layer, you have to wait a while for gravity, inertia, and friction to interact. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the mass of the star. Some stars (0.8 - 2.0 solar masses) undergo a &quot;helium flash&quot; in which a lot of the helium is fused in just a few minutes, comparable to all of the energy released in the entire Milky Way galaxy. However, various mechanisms keep that energy from leaving the star, so they are hard to detect.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This must happen repeatedly as the star works it's way up the Periodic Table until it reaches iron. Does this mini-collapse have any visible external effects that we could see?<br />
Also, I read somewhere that once the star reaches iron it has about 4 milliseconds to live before it goes nova.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the flash change from hydrogen to helium burning occurs deep in the star, and gets completely smoothed out on the way to the surface of the star. It's unobservable</p></div>		</li>
