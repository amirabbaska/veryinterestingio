			<div class="markdown"><p>LCD displays have a membrane that twists when an electrical current passes through, to allow light from the pixels (very weak LEDs) to pass through, which is enhanced by the backlight. So a black image wouldn't necessarily just have the pixels off, as it would still show something from the presence of the backlight, so the LCD membrane will &quot;twist shut&quot; and block the light, creating a black pixel.</p>
<p>LED displays have no membrane, just pixels, which are really bright LEDs so displays like AMOLED do not have a backlight.</p>
<p>I've taken a apart a couple of iPhone LCDs and removed the backlight and looked at it from behind (opposite the user-viewing angle) and had someone use the touch screen and depending what was on the screen, I could see my friend (or vice-versa) through the screen when certain colors were displayed, or not displayed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're thinking OLED display, not LED. The later is is simply an LCD display which uses LED for illumination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that just marketing? LED displays are what was described above but marketing has made it become &quot;LED back-lit LCD&quot; instead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, I believe there are actually LED displays, but colored LEDs aren't economical for consumer products. So most of the time if a display is labeled &quot;LED&quot;, it's usually an LED backlit LCD display.</p>
<p>The main benefit of OLEDs are that they are dirt cheap (relatively speaking) to produce.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No.   LCD displays are back-lit or edge-lit by various light sources...sometimes LEDs. There are no LEDs behind each pixel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, I was thinking a bit too much about LED displays.</p>
<p>Should I say that the amount the membrane is twisted a certain amount to allow a certain amount of &quot;red&quot; light through, same goes for green and blue?</p></div>		</li>
