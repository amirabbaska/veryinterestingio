			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! They are all around you, tweeting and squawking. Birds are the living members of the dinosaur group and several lineages of birds survived the mass extinction. These were, however, the only dinosaurs to do so, and many other groups, such as marine reptiles and pterosaurs, went completely extinct at this time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do we have any idea why birds survived when the others failed? Presumably it is more than just flight, since the pterosaurs also died out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few factors. One of them is flight - being able to travel long distances to get food in a time when resources were limited definitely affected survival rate. Another factor might have been body size. Birds were very small compared to the giant pterosaurs that lived at the end of the Cretaceous. For example, feeding yourself when you weigh 2 kg is much easier than when you weigh 70 kg. There are more factors to consider, of course, but this is one example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822\(16\)30249-4" target="_blank">a study</a> published last year that suggested that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36102018" target="_blank">seed-eating may have been responsible for the survival of birds</a> following the end-Cretaceous ecosystem collapse. Seeds would have provided a reliable food source following the destruction of flora after the impact, which would be unavailable to the closely related herbivores, carnivores and omnivores that died off at the end of the Cretaceous.</p></div>		</li>
