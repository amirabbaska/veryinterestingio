			<div class="markdown"><p>iOS is just a customized Darwin, the basis of OS X. If you get root access to a machine it's all laid out exactly like OS X is and is closer to how FreeBSD lays out its file structure than Linux.</p>
<p>Apple also has extensive history in porting their OS to new platforms with little to no interruption (for the most part).</p>
<p>They moved from 68k -&gt; PPC. Then from PPC -&gt; PPC64. Then PPC64 -&gt; x86/x64.</p>
<p>They used to package apps as 'fat binaries' which meant the same App would run on 4 different platforms. They also made it headache free for the developers. Adding a new platform was just checking a box. As long as you didn't do anything too weird in XCode it would &quot;just work&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Have you ever used the iPhone Simulator that comes with Xcode? It's not emulating an ARM processor; they just straight-up recompiled all of iOS for x86. And when iOS developers run an app in the simulator, they're compiling for x86 as well. It seems to work pretty smoothly.</p>
<p>How exactly is iOS specialized for ARM?</p></div>		</li>
