			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically there is no such limit that exists because mathematical complexity is a parameter that can always be increased. We can continuously increase the number of cases considered to a particular problem, or try to expand the domain for which a problem has influence in. Try to think of probability, where complexity could be observed in a factorial expansion kind of fashion. In terms of magnitude, it's not as frequent to see a large scale or ground breaking discovery because typically from case to case, complexity increases are rather small. It's only when you see either a headline problem be solved (like a Millennium problem) or something that largely stretches the limits of our understanding (take Pythagoras and the irrational numbers thing, for example).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well for starters, here are the <a href="http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems" target="_blank">millennium problems</a> - famous unproven (as of the year 2000) theorems and conjectures, each with a million dollar prize. since then only one has been proven and the mathematician even turned down the prize. </p>
<p>and if you want to get a glimpse of how complicated proofs can get, look into the abc conjecture and shinichi mochizuki. he spent 20 years working on his own to invent a new field of math to prove it which is so complicated that other mathematicians can barely understand what he's saying much less verify it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That seems... Sad. I'm doing a PhD, and having specialized in a quite specific area, there were times during which, for months at a time, I would be the only person understanding my own work.</p>
<p>It's a bit lonely, and a bit scary, like being alone in wilderness. </p>
<p>I can't imagine doing this for 20 years. That's really brave.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You've got a lot of people explaining that we'll never run out of interesting, solvable problems, but one thing I'd like to add.  &quot;Writing proofs&quot; sounds like a skill you can master but it's not.  If a problem can be solved by an existing proof argument, fine, it's trivial once you have the knowledge and understand the proof argument.  </p>
<p>But creating a new proof is literally creating a new way of thinking about things.  It's like discovering a new class of drugs in pharma, it opens up new lines of research and makes us understand the world in novel ways.  That's the joy of pure mathematics.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's worth adding why we believe this. In essence, it means the same as saying that enjoying a piece of music once it's already composed <em>is much easier</em> than actually coming up with the piece of music. Coming up with stuff requires a lot of creativity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Man, I can't remember the last time I heard someone else say something along the same line. This has been a favorite saying of mine for years!</p>
<p>Don't remember where I first heard it but the quote I know and love goes like &quot;Understanding just how much you don't know is the first step to true intelligence. Only the ignorant believe they're smart.&quot;</p>
<p>I've never been able to remember the original quote and it can be reworded a million ways but the meaning is still the same. </p>
<p>Another favorite of mine is, &quot;It's better to remain silent and look a fool than to open your mouth and prove it.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
