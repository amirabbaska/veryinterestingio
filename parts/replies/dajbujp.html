			<div class="markdown"><p>This explains why some diseases are more problematic in the elderly but misses the mark on the stated disease state: herpes zoster. In the case of chickenpox it is more dangerous to adults due to an overly powerful immune response causing massive collateral damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Immunology is complex.  There are viruses like 1918 influenza, thought to kill young adults in their prime, for an OVERZEALOUS immune system leading to a massive cytokine storm, rapid sepsis, circulatory collapse, and death.  This is not about an ageing immune system or weakened system in this case, and this can not be easily simplified.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, OVERZEALOUS. But it's OVERZEALOUS because it has lost the efficient and appropriately measured response of its youth. Flu of 1918 is actually more complicated than OVERZEALOUS response. Multiple waves of a disease with varying degrees of severity, complicated by social and political factors that ultimately increased virulence. Those same factors influenced susceptibility to/treatment of secondary infections, too, and (if I remember correctly) death by these secondary infections outnumbered primary.</p></div>		</li>
