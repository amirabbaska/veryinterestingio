<p>If you imagine a semi-truck, one full of packing peanuts and one full of bricks, which costs less gas to move? The one full of packing peanuts. However, it still costs money to move the semi truck full of packing peanuts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually if you've ever worked in shipping, paradoxically, the one full of packaging peanuts might cost MORE to ship. It boils down to freight class. The lower the freight class, the more dense (and by extension, usually, the less fragile it is). A pallet full of metal bars measuring 36x36x36 weighing 500 pounds and being class 70 costs me the same, almost to the penny, as the same pallet carrying ping pong balls and weighing only 100 pounds but being class 500. In fact I changed the pallet weighing 500 pounds from class 70 to class 500 and the cost almost tripled.</p>
<p>Also a heavy box can have items stacked on top of it, making it cheaper than the box that can't have stuff stacked on top of it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You got it, the guy above you was close in saying &quot;size and weight matter&quot;, but what really drives your price is the space that you take up.</p>
<p>A typical aircraft pallet measures 125inches x 96 inches, and you can stack it like 5 feet high. That's a huge amount of volume. But if you wanted to ship a 127inch long glass pole that was just 4&quot; thick and couldn't have anything stacked on it, you're being charged for the volume of 2 entire pallet positions. Which is a <em>shitload</em> of money.</p>
<p>So yeah. Weight is important, but it's all about volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Make an account with some shipping brokers. They should not charge you. It helps if you have a registered business and can at least lie about the number of items you intend to ship.</p>
<p>Here are two some to get you started</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freightcenter.com/" target="_blank">https://www.freightcenter.com/</a>
<a href="https://www.unishippers.com/" target="_blank">https://www.unishippers.com/</a></p>
<p>You would just simply quote a bunch of made up shipments. They both have online tools so you should be able to get up to date shipping information almost instantly. You could even throw out the highest and the lowest quotes and average the rest of them, as these two are shipping brokers and provide options amongst around a dozen carriers.</p>
<p>I'm sure if you plot enough data points, you could probably figure out details such as where their hubs are located, which locations are comparably high/low, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's another link that's more general but talks about how UPS does it. Basically, they look at the actual weight and the dimensional weight (based on density) and bill based on whichever is higher.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, interesting.  Does this apply to large companies that (presumably) have their own transportation?   If you had a truck containing only 1 type of lightweight items that can stack on top of themselves, it seems like the usual costs wouldn't apply.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, as far as I'm aware, this is specific to freight carriers like UPS who charge based on dimensional weight. We deal with this in the industry I work in because we ship fairly light items. Basically, to ship a t shirt might be $10, but to ship 72 t shirts might be $15-20.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would likely ship as a FTL (full truck load) instead of LTL (less than truck load) and would typically be subject to different rates/etc.  For most freight lanes it would be cheaper to move an FTL of the same type of freight loaded appropriately, rather than a series of individual LTL shipments plugged together by overworked/underpaid forklift operators like a kid's first game of tetris.</p>
<p>Former international broker, but been out of the game for a few years... got too damn tired of dealing with customs.  Always great to see logistics appreciation on reddit though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a point where shipping stuff is about size and then goes over to weight. There's limits to how much weight a truck can carry, at which point it starts to be about floor space rather than volume. A trailer &quot;full&quot; of bottled water is 24 to 26 pallets that are 5ft high. A flatbed full of steel beams is 2 feet high, depending on their shape. A trailer with aluminum pellets is just 20 bags barely larger than black garbage bags. </p>
<p>At this point, fuel costs start to explode and considerations have to be made for the terrain. Where a FedEx trailer full of boxes wall-to-wall and up to the ceiling might cost 32 liters/100 km (7.3mpg), a 4 axle trailer carrying 35 tons of wood will easily run up to 55 liters/100 km (4.3mpg). </p>
<p>Even if the company deals only with lightweight items, the cost of shipping needs to be factored in regardless. Courier services have to consider opportunity cost, which is why shipping a bundle of t-shirts or some pillows costs the same, but the packing peanuts company still has to pay for fuel, salary, truck ownership costs, insurance, etc just to be able to ship truckloads of custom-shaped styfofoam pellets. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cost increase goes all the way to planting and harvesting, and the factors there might outweigh the logistics considerations.</p>
<p>1) Tree fruits intended to be processed into juice or otherwise destroyed can be harvested mechanically, while those to be sold as whole fruit must be treated more delicately and are still overwhelmingly <em>hand picked</em>.</p>
<p>2) The fruits people buy whole must <em>look</em> prettier in order to sell, which means they may be more heavily treated, or need a more expensive environment to grow properly, and have been bred over time to have those pretty characteristics, typically thicker skins and brighter more consistent color. Oranges for grocery stores and oranges for processing are, by many measures,  totally different crops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also need to consider how many cartons of orange juice were produced at the same time. It's not like some guy with a juicer made a carton of orange juice out of 22 oranges and sold it to you. The larger and more efficient an operation is, the lower their overhead costs are. Those costs are spread out among millions of cartons of orange juice, so the price of an individual carton isn't that much. </p></div>		</li>
