<p>It's also been suggested that once a large colony is established on Mars one of the first industries could be manufacturing a large quantity of these magnetic dipole shields (or something similar) and creating a global shield to reduce gamma rays.</p>

<p>Magnetic fields do not block gamma rays.  They only block charged particles.  Gamma rays will go right through till they hit the atmosphere/surface.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly right.  It's why I said &quot;or something like it&quot;.  I should have specified in terms of size and function not necessarily actual effect.
It's also why later I mentioned this criticism would be lessened once the atmosphere became denser.
I do appreciate you pointing this out for clarity.  </p>
<p>Along similar lines as NASA's proposal there's some very promising work being done to protect astronauts on long, deep space missions by Rutherford Labs UK in creating, essentially, a <a href="http://www.minimagnetosphere.rl.ac.uk/" target="_blank">mini magnetosphere</a> for virtually any space ship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah isn't a gamma rays like a neutrino or something? It has no electromagnetic polarity? Where charred particles are just more like greatly accelerated ions? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A gamma ray is a photon, gust with really high frequency (energy) so it is an electromagnetic field.  Photons don't interact with other diffuse fields at all, they just interact with charge (usually electrons).</p>
<p>Neutrinos are different.  They have no charge at all or any electric field so they don't see charges or fields, only the weak force.  </p>
<p>Gammas can be stopped by a few k of air or a few meters of water.  Neutrinos on average would go through a light year of water before stopping (it's a random attenuation though, so if you have a meter of water and a lot of neutrinos you will see one somtimes.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The current consensus is that Mars would have plenty of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore_resources_on_Mars" target="_blank">viable metals</a> for manufacturing.  Aluminum, titanium and iron mainly since those are the ones we have direct evidence for.  But I'd expect by the time we have a functioning outpost there that asteroid mining will be an available source as well.</p></div>		</li>
