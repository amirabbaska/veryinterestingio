			<div class="markdown"><p>I got tinnitus as a result of taking/ceasing Sertraline. I gradually weaned myself off after taking the antidepressant for 6 months. After cessation I began experiencing electric sounding noises that occurred  every few minutes then became more frequent until the noises became a hiss every few seconds, then turned into constant ringing about 4 months post cessation. Does that make my tinnitus primary or secondary? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a common side effect of Sertraline, other antidepressants, antipsychotics and a range of other prescribed medications. In my case it was definitely the Sertraline. It progressed from a very annoying frequent noise on ceasing Setraline to a constant ringing. I didn't injure my ears in any way through exposure to noise etc</p></div>		</li>
