			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget timing attacks. </p>
<p>A failed login should have artificial timing inserted into it so it takes as long as real login. </p>
<p>For example, say it takes one second to look up an email and two seconds to do the password hashing on it. </p>
<p>If someone is trying logins and it takes 1 second some of the time and 2 seconds other times, it can be inferred that a valid email address will take 2 seconds instead of one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is useless on websites that allow email login.</p>
<p>You just attempt to register with a certain email: 'This email is already registered.'</p>
<p>Username login is also a target, as most people use the same username everywhere. So realising that an individual has an account is as simple as checking to see if the email/username is taken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sites that address this securely allow you to register with a taken email address. The email you receive simply states you already have an account.</p>
<p>The point here is that you shouldn't be able to tell if it's registered or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That reminds me of an account I used to have at a hedge fund administrator.  I didn't get to pick a &quot;security question.&quot;  The security question was preselected, and all of us got the same one.<br />
What was that security question?  &quot;What is your favorite color?&quot;<br />
Bitch, I'll tell anyone who asks what my favorite color is.</p></div>		</li>
