			<div class="markdown"><p>Because this seems like the top comment, I'll add a note about poisons. As /u/wvbotanist said, putting something in your mouth is ALWAYS safer than injecting it into your bloodstream. Venoms: bad to inject; okay to swallow. Poisons: bad to inject; also bad to swallow. It is okay to eat a venomous snake, but it is NOT okay to eat a poisonous frog. </p>
<p>This has to do with the structure of the chemicals in the venoms vs. poisons. Venoms have proteins. Stomachs are really good at degrading proteins--digesting proteins is a key part of digestion. So stomachs will digest/degrade venoms. On the other hand, poisons are (usually) not proteins; they are smaller/simpler molecules; they will not be affected by stomach acid. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the hypertension medication class, ACE inhibitors, was first discovered in the venom of a Brazilian pit viper. Getting bit by this snake causes excessive bleeding partially because the venom relaxes blood vessels. Scientists were like, &quot;Hey, we have a lot of people with blood vessels that could use relaxing, let's prescribe some snake juice&quot; (paraphrasing). The first ACE inhibitor was a peptide (small protein) found in this Brazilian pit viper's venom. </p>
<p>To bring it full circle, modern ACE inhibitors are MODIFIED versions of this protein. Since the medication is a pill taken orally, it was not very effective as the original protein, as most of the protein would be degraded in the stomach. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keeping with the ELI5 mentality: Think of your digestive system as a security check for foreign invaders. Once something's in your blood it's passed the heaviest security your body has, whether that was actually going through or circumventing (injection).</p>
<p>Most of what's bad for you and you're likely to encounter on a day to day basis will go through security and they'll do their job. Some stuff is going to sneak past, or even destroy security, and that stuff is especially bad, regardless.</p>
<p>Poison is pretty much all bad. I'm sure there's exceptions, but as a general rule, I'd assume you're right, you're likely better off having it 'go through security' first, even if it's going to burn that motha to the ground in the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Apologies if I suggested otherwise. Hypothetically, if a poison worked specifically on cells of the digestive tract, then ingesting that poison would be worse (I am sure there is a non-hypothetical example). But most poisons work by being absorbed into the body and working on the cardiovascular system, nervous system, etc, such that having the stomach as a buffer is preferable to straight injection. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly potassium cyanide is actuallly less deadly when injected than when eaten. That's because potassium cyanide on it's own is just some salt, that doesn't do much (not that I'd want to inject it). If however it comes into contact with stomach acid it releases hydrogen cyanide. And that does kill you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is the dart frogs are NOT inherently poisonous. They eat venomous insects and part of their biological process is to capture the insects venom and store it in there own glands, making them poisonous. In other words, if you raised one as a pet and fed it flies and crickets, the frog would NOT be poisonous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You could make a non-poisonous poison dart frog in the same way that you could make a goitered human by removing iodine from their diet. They don't synthesize their poison themselves, but concentrate it from what they eat. But what they eat is just ants and things; plenty of other creatures could eat these ants and not become poisonous. </p>
<p>Also I wouldn't say they eat &quot;venomous&quot; insects. The insects don't use these toxins aggressively (or defensively). They use them for &quot;normal&quot; functions. Its just that the poison dart frog concentrates them so much that it becomes poisonous to certain predators. </p></div>		</li>
