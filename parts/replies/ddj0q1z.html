			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, companies making peanut butter are buying their ingredients in bulk.  So, the sugar, oils, and any other ingredients are being bought by the truckload versus the homecook buying a bag or two.  I think economies of scale is mentioned below, but basically, it'll cost a company overall, about 0.50$ to make a jar of peanut butter when it is all said and done.  There's not much R&amp;D overhead as peanut butter has been around for quite some time and the companies making the peanut butter have the resources to create new formulas quickly and cheaply, if they needed to.  The processing equipment will all be the same, just different cleaning procedures to meet certain standards.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.  Chances are they're getting in truckloads of peanuts at one time, sorting at their facility, sending the good ones to packaging and the bad ones elsewhere for further processing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This goes all the way down to stuff that barely resembles the food you think you're eating. When a 5 ton bag of almonds arrives at a food processing facility and there's 200 pounds of dust at the bottom, that's what goes into your generic &quot;almond&quot; cookies.</p></div>		</li>
