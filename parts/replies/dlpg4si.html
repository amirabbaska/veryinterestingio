			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. There's socially desirable responding (SDR), which is one's tendency to respond to items in a socially desirable manner. Depending on which research camp you ascribe to (for example, I'm an organizational psychologist and we view things slightly differently than personality psychologists), SDR includes both conscious and unconscious behavior. Unconscious is called &quot;self deceptive enhancement&quot;, and conscious is considered &quot;impression management&quot;. </p>
<p>I do a bit of applicant faking research and I typically operationalize faking as &quot;deceptive Impression Management (IM)&quot;, in that the applicant is purposely distorting their responses in order to look better. </p>
<p>It gets even more complicated than that and I can go into more detail if anyone actually cares for me to, but the main points on survey faking are: no matter what, people will do it; you can use prompts/warnings to attempt to reduce faking, but those who are determined to fake will ignore these; there are statistical methods to reduce faking - using items that are known as &quot;statistical synonyms&quot; (or something like that) that are similar to one another and you ask them multiple times and then check the reliability of the responses later. You can also check responses to these items against &quot;antonym&quot; items. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question, since you're here. Tests for dissocial personality disorder, like the PCL, supposedly account for impression management by the subject. How?</p>
<p>Edit: I know they often ask what seems like the same question a huge variety of ways, and I assume draw conclusions based on the variance in your answers according to the wording of the question, so I imagine that has something to do with it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I must confess I know much less about these sorts of things because I'm an IO psychologist, not a clinical psychologist. However, I am assuming that it's the same sort of idea as with our surveys: that is , the tests will have an IM scale built in to the test, and some might have their own proprietary methods for detecting IM (which may or may not work). I do not know how the IM scales look on these kinds of tests, so I apologize. Typically, this information is proprietary so I could only get a look at it if I was using them </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Use careful wording. OVer time the best wording arises. </p>
<p>E.g. There is a &quot;standard generalised trust question&quot; that is used by eveyone who studies generalised trust. That ensures comparability. </p>
<p>The same is with other traits. There are standard questions or &quot;groups of questions&quot; (called sets) that have been re-tested dozens of time to determine that they measure what they are supposed to measure.</p></div>		</li>
