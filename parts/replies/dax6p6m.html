			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything other than your last line is unsupported, and based on most of our understanding, outright wrong. Can you point to some evidence as to your theory of being fixed in place having that effect?</p>
<p>As to the last line, fundamentally, plants have a much lower cost of genetic maintenance than animals do, because they are by definition, autotrophs, i.e. they make their own food. So essentially they can turn air, water, sun, and some soil nutrients into whatever they want. So having a larger genome has low cost to them. For animals, who have to acquire all nutrition by finding other organisms to devour, the cost of a bloated genetic base is high, and so from the very beginning of their lineages, there has been strong selection pressure to be more genetically efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually is known, or at least part of the mechanism is known, plants hybridize like a mother F $!@king boss. Unlike animals hybridization is a: very common and b: not detrimental to development and total fitness (usually). Plants have specific cellular machinery that allows them to function totally normally when they have a missing/extra/set of triple chromosomes which would wreak havoc on an animal and cause sterility at best, or down syndrome or even death</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're also a lot less anatomically rigid in their development, and so can tolerate mammoth genomic changes that would cause an animal embryo to abort at an early stage.  But yes, plants have evolved to handle virtually all of life's problems metabolically, and gene duplication/divergence is a killer way to do that.</p></div>		</li>
