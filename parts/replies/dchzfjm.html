			<div class="markdown"><p>Because ?Pliny?, the ancient &quot;expert&quot; on worldwide animals, described whales as &quot;spouting steam clouds like a chimney&quot;, European artists began depicting them as having actual, bricklaid chimneys strapped to their bodies.</p>
<p>Heraldic whales are depicted this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://prehistory.archeurope.info/uploads/images/Gundestrup/Gundestrup%20Cauldron%20007.jpg" target="_blank">This</a> is one of the panels of the Gundestrup cauldron. A huge, silver cauldron found in Denmark in 1891. It was made some time between 150 and 1 BC and obviously the guy who made the ornaments had never seen an actual elephant but only had a description to go about. </p>
<p>I think they look more like boar with trunks than elephants. </p></div>		</li>
