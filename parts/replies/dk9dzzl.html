			<div class="markdown"><p>or okay we can be a bit more complete... again this is a bit of a guess but let's say BBO obeys a four wave mixing hamiltonian like K a^dagger a^dagger b c where b and c are the vertically and horizontally polarized modes of the \omega/2 signal... then introduce d and e, the horizontally and vertically polarized modes of the \omega/4 mode... then we have L b^dagger b^dagger d e or something. label the kets |b,c,d,e&gt; (ignoring a as it's stiff), so we end up with |0,0,0,0&gt;+m |1,1,0,0&gt; +m^2 |2,2,0,0&gt; where m is some combination of the pump strength and K and coupling and all that. Then the second crystal acts and we have  |0,0,0,0&gt;+ m |1,1,0,0&gt; +m^2 |2,2,0,0&gt; + n|2,0,1,1&gt; where n is a function of m and the coupling and blah blah blah. Written a bit more illustratively we have |vacuum,vacuum&gt; + m|vertical,horizontal&gt; + m^2 |2 vertical, 2 horizontal&gt; + n|2 vertical at \omega/2, 1 vertical at omega/4, 1 horizontal at omega/4&gt;.</p>
<p>Edit: Fixed my math... the way I had written it, it wasn't conserving energy. One needs two photons in the second BBO crystal's pump mode for SPDC to happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read that to generate 1 entangled photon pair, one needs to input approx. 10^12 photons. Thus if the secondary streams of B1 and B2 are to be practical, one would need something of the order of 10^24 photons as input .. I guess?? I read that laser pulses with 1000 Joule do exist. A 1 Joule laser pulse creates approx. 2x10^18 photons, so a few thousand &quot;1000 Joule laserpulse machines&quot; could 'do it' :-P ... (again: I guess ... ??)</p>

<p>... but IF you spot an \omega/4 photon, the \omega/2 photon WILL be horizontally polarized.</p>

<p>that's odd .... does that mean the second BBO effectively acts like a polarization filter and the photons are <em>still</em> in superposition??</p></div>		</li>

<p>This kills the BBO crystal.</p>
<p>Seriously though, remember that the original B photons are downconverted, so they have a wavelength of about 800 nm. Doing another downconversion, to 1600 nm, would be very difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right... but also consider the pulse frequency (not wavelength! The number of pulses per second)! Generating an omega/4 photon is a low probability process but maybe you use a ridiculously powerful laser and wait a long time while generating these pulses at a very high frequency. </p>
<p>Come to think of it... a BBO crystal probably naturally emits omega/4 photons. What if you took a BBO crystal and glued it to another BBO crystal? What's the difference between this and a BBO crystal twice the thickness? Not much really. It's just a much rarer process.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>And yes absolutely. Well... okay. A lot of things are polarization selective in optics. The first BBO is polarization selective. It only downconverts pump photons whose polarization is along its optical axis. But look... superpositions are only destroyed in the presence of an environment. In other words, if you make a bell-pair and let one photon get perfectly absorbed by a block of some other crystalline material, you now have a photon entangled with a phonon (lattice vibration) in the crystal. You observe decoherence when you measure a system while ignoring all the other things that the system is entangled with, the very definition of an open quantum system. These processes that lead to decoherence are very likely because an excitation in a quantum system will wanna go to everywhere there's a coupling, and in general it's hard to isolate a system completely. A traveling photon might get absorbed by a dust particle or something (maybe? idk. Again used to thinking of superconducting circuits) and now there's decoherence, because that dust particle is gonna float away.</p>
<p>Okay so what sort of polarizer &quot;destroys&quot; coherence and what kind doesn't? One for which you can keep track of everything! So an absorptive polarizer is unacceptable... because you can't track the information of the photon once it's absorbed. A reflective (lossless) polarizer is fine because now one of the polarization modes is just moved into a different spatial mode and you can keep track it, do gates on it, measure it, whatever.</p></div>		</li>
