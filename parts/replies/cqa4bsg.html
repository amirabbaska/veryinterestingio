			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the detailed explanation. I have two questions.  When the boundary layer warms up (or cools down), does that air continuously rise (or sink) and get replaced?  Can a layer of aluminum foil keep warm objects warm (or cold objects cool)?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Indeed it does!  At least it does if it can.  If you put a hot stone on the ground outside at night, the boundary layer will continually rise and get replaced with cooler air.  But if you have a big bowl made out of ice, the cold air in the bowl won't have anywhere to sink to, so it'll be pretty cool there.  The effect may not be small, but I just want to point out that you need to consider <em>where</em> the air in the boundary layer will head off to.  A blanket works by preventing that air from going very far, but you can prevent it from moving in other ways too.</p>

<p>It can, but not so well.  The problem is that, while air is a bad conductor of heat -- as is a blanket -- aluminum is a <em>good</em> conductor of heat.  The aluminum will fairly quickly change temperature to the temperature of the surrounding air -- if you've ever baked something in an oven on a baking sheet covered in aluminum foil, you know that the metal sheet takes a few minutes to cool down so that you can touch it, but the aluminum foil cools down much faster.  So while it will keep the boundary layer in, it'll also be exchanging heat with it at a much faster rate than a blanket, and it'll be doing that both on the inside and the outside.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as /u/OccamsParsimony points out, aluminum also affects radiative heating.  Aluminum is reflective, so light that hits it is bounced back.  Well, one way objects lose their heat is through light (usually, at normal temperatures, only infrared light, but a hot iron in the oven will radiate visible light as it heats up to red hot; lava, also, glows for the same reason).  So if that light hits the aluminum foil from the inside, it will bounce back to the object and get reabsorbed.  The same principle also prevents radiative heat from getting <em>in</em>, because light hits the object from <em>outside</em> and gets bounced off instead of being absorbed by the object.  Since the air is mostly transparent to infrared light -- it absorbs some of it, but it lets most of it through -- radiative heating is mostly not concerned with the boundary layer at all.  On the other hand, radiation, especially sunlight, can heat things up enough to cause boundary layers to form, which is why things are warmer in sunlight than in the shade, etc., etc.  It's a whole cycle.</p></div>		</li>
