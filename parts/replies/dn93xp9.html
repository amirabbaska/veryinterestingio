			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no information propagation. The outside doesn't know anything about the BH except things like mass, charge, angular momentum.
All those properties are determined at the surface, not inside. Picture a thin metal sphere with electric charges inside it.
The outside doesn't know about the location of charges inside the sphere, only the total charge, which is a property you can measure at the surface.
The same happens to a BH.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Aren't all these properties determined by the metric and not the surface? Especially, what are you referring to as the surface? The Reissner-Nordstr√∂m metric has two horizons you could call surface, and the Kerr-Newman-metric has four, but they are not characterized as something special IIRC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you familiar with Gauss' law? By measuring the electric or gravitational field's flux through some surface, you can determine the charge/mass within that surface. This way you can non-locally detect the charge or mass within the surface. This is sort of the heart of the no-hair theorem: black holes only have properties determined by something like Gauss' law (as well as spacetime properties like linear and angular momentum).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I'm thinking about this: say a charged particle is falling into the black hole. The information about it can propagate without any trouble until it crosses the event horizon. </p>
<p>Once it does, the electromagnetic field in the region stops getting new information, which would imply that it stops changing. Not that it goes away, but that nothing from inside the event horizon disturbs it further.</p></div>		</li>
