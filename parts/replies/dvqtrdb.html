<p>Sports are a plague on those who don't care to watch them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is missing the point. Netflix can put its servers wherever it wants and still sell its product to anyone with an internet connection, while the cable company can only sell its product to people who physically live in their geographic footprint. </p></div>		</li>
