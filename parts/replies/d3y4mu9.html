			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a weird and vauge 7 year law too when things get sold off like this. If there is any kind of payment withing 7 years of the last payment toward the debt, 5 cents or anything, the 7 year clock restarts and the debt has been completely religitimized. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. This kind of debt would be things like someone that is unemployed getting a $20,000 medical bill and it going 9 months without being paid with the person pretty much saying, I can't pay this bill. That is the kind of debt that sells for so cheap. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be more accurate, it's more like they went 10 years without paying it.  Nine month old debt wouldn't sell that cheaply, there's still a reasonable chance you'd pay it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one's mentioning this, the debt was &quot;out of statue&quot; meaning the owner of the debt couldn't recover really if they sued in court as the debt was too old. The debt is thus borderline worthless as the debtor could pay but they could also totally ignore it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. As far as the creditor goes, you are correct that it doesn't make much of a difference. </p>
<p>As far as the person in debt? It can make a huge difference not only emotionally but also on their ability to get other credit for necessary things like a car or a house. </p>
<p>If you had a $50,000 debt that you know you could never pay, you're likely to write everything off and say: &quot;damn, I can't pay that, I may as well not pay any of my debt.&quot; It hurts the entire economy. Not to mention, knowing that you are in debt that you can never repay makes you less motivated to work and grow your income, because you know if you do that you will lose that to a creditor. This gives the debtor more motivation to work hard and do better. </p>
<p>Also, if you need to buy a car to get to work, or to rent or buy a home, total debt to income significantly affects your ability to to that. Having debt erased can make those much easier to do. </p>
<p>So no, John Oliver is not getting rid of debt that would likely ever be paid, but he is making a huge difference to those who owed the debt, possibly changing their lives. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of statute just means they cannot take you to court, the can still bug the hell out of you, place on credit report (then after 7 years sell to someone else who can do the same thing then). The debt doesn't disappear, it kind of just does a shuffle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is exactly what the ancient biblical notion of the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+25%3A8-13&amp;version=WEB" target="_blank">Jubilee</a> was about. (And of course knowing that a jubilee year was coming up would affect the risk appetites of moneylenders.) Funny how this is one of the verses of Leviticus that the &quot;Christian&quot; Right is most silent about.</p></div>		</li>

I mean if he can buy 15,000,000 for 60,000 it means a reduc of 99,6 % if so by sharing the information he can really help the persons that he didn't forgive by telling them that the publicity stunt would be a way to share the information and not the main goal of the operation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Essentially no. Companies only sell debt in large bundles, so an individual could not buy just their own debt without buying a large pile of debt.</p>
<p>Additionally, the debt John Oliver bought is super super bad debt. Debt that collections agencies have given up on trying to collect. Most people that have $20,000 in medical bills that have been unpaid for a year cannot get enough money together to buy a big bundle of debt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that they probably wouldn't let you buy your own debt even if it was bundled with others.  The reason for this is that they want to discourage people from not paying their debts so I don't think anyone is stupid to sell the debt back to the person who owes it.  They probably only selling to people who have are legit credit collections agencies?  That would be the smart thing to do.  That way you can't get a friend to buy it back for you either.</p>
<p>Although I guess fucking up your credit score may be enough incentive to pay the debt if you had the money.  But if it was $200,000 bought back at $2,000.  I think I can live without credit cards and not borrowing money.  There's always prepaid CCs.</p>
<p>Edit:  By legit debt companies, I meant ones that have history of buying debt with the bank or other banks.  Obviously other people can still somehow find a way to buy back their own debt but it won't be as easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you, as an individual debtor, can attempt to negotiate a settlement of the debt with whoever owns it.  Since they likely bought it cheap they are sometimes willing to settle for almost as cheap.  HOWEVER I've heard that less than honorable debt collectors use bad language in the settlement that turns it into just a payment towards the full amount.  If negotiating you need a lawyer to look over the terms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only can you only buy large bundles like other people have said, but it's completely random which debt is going to be offered to you. John started his business in Mississippi and the debt he was offered and purchased was all from Texas. It's not like you can start a business and say, &quot;I'd like to buy Dave Smith from Chicago's debt please.&quot; </p></div>		</li>
