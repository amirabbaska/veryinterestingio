			<div class="markdown"><p>Imgur uses 8 characters, so the actual math is 62^8. This math gives you over 218 trillion unique URLs. That means that in order to use up every 8 character combination, every single human being alive on Earth would have to submit about 31 <em>thousand</em> pictures each. </p>
<p>Now let's say somehow all humans on earth we're able to do this, and Imgur ran out of URLs. How would they fix it? Simple, they would just add another character. Now you're dealing with a 62^9 block of URLs. To put that into perspective, that maths to approximately 1.9 <strong>million</strong> unique URLs per living human being today. Add another character and now it's 119 million. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Since when are URLs case sensitive?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The portion up to and including the TLD is not case sensitive, but anything after that is internal to the specific website, and can be case sensitive if they design their site to treat them differently.</p>
<p>For example, here's an imgur URL:  <a href="https://imgur.com/dQpr2" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/dQpr2</a></p>
<p>And here's the same URL with the first 'd' changed to upper-case: <a href="https://imgur.com/DQpr2" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/DQpr2</a></p>
<p>The second one doesn't work, because it's not referencing a valid image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whilst URLs do often map to files in a file structure it is also very often not the case. I'd say that it is more frequently not the case nowadays as a lot of systems are going the way of easy to remember URLs and internally using programming patterns such as MVC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first part of a URL often isn't. The second part which comes after the forward slash and identifies which specific page of a website you're on often is.</p>
<p>For example, browse to a random YouTube video and change one of the capital letters after the /watch?v= to its lower case variant. It will either direct you to an entirely different video or tell you that the video is unavailable.</p></div>		</li>
