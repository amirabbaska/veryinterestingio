			<div class="markdown"><p>So I'm a chef and when I'm making a meal I know what to do by adding tastes in my mind. </p>
<p>I can taste a dish (soup is easy cuz its a long simmer, plenty of time to add type dish) and can roledex my mind with what can help the final flavor and then I add it to it.</p>
<p>It's not just that, obviously, as I am using a history of cooking as a reference for what I should add in any situation. Honestly, until this question, I never understood the full extent of how I use smell/taste memories so thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is weird to me is WHY different brains are good at different things. The spectrum seems to be huge.</p>
<p>Im really good at spacial memory, but suck at everything else. To remember anything, i have to imagine some physical location and put the thing to remember somewhere in the space. Then i'll never forget it. Unconsciously too. I can walk and talk with someone and yet know exactly how to get back where i came from.</p>
<p>What my favorite song sounds like? No idea. My mothers face? Barely</p></div>		</li>
