			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is the company is paying the phone company to make it easier for their customers to contact them, and originated when it actually cost more to connect long distance calls since there were only so many long distance lines. </p>
<p>It's be more like the ISPs charging because the remote server was located physically far away, and the company paying that bill so their customers don't have to pay it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is true for ISPs as well though.  An ISP providing service for Netflix is more expensive than providing it for Reddit for example due to the increased bandwidth requirements.   How is that different from telephone companies wanting to charge more for long distance calls?  Or more recently how mobile carriers provided &quot;free minutes&quot; for in-network or family calls?</p>
<p>As far as I know there was no regulation forcing companies to charge the same rates for local and long distance calls.  The market just moved away from that on its own.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Should make clear that it's the other pizza places that likely would have to pay more. Maybe include the competitors AND people who call? </p></div>		</li>
