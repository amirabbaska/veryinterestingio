			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so much microscopic, but you have the basic idea. It goes back to the age-old question &quot;when will I ever need geometry to save my life?&quot;  A circle can be divided into 360 degrees, and a degree can be further divided into sixty 'minutes' of angle. The first question often asked is &quot;well how wide is a minute of angle?&quot; The ELI5 way to think about that one lies in pie (and not mathematical pi, altho it is in the same general neighborhood). But I mean good ol chocolate cream pie. If you cut a 90-degree slide of pie (one quarter of a whole pie) the length of the crust (the outermost curve) might be a few inches for a normal sized pie, but if you had a giant pie that same 90-degree slice might have several feet of crust. So now imagine a pie slice cut to one Minute of Angle (MOA), so an insanely stingy, narrow slice. If the slice was a hundred yards long (I am using rough numbers here) the crust would measure an inch wide. At two hundred yards of slice, the crust would be longer (the pie slice gets wider as you get farther from the center, right?) so two inches of crust.</p>
<p>So one turret on the scope will move the 'reticle' or crosshairs up or down in pre-defined units. A common combination would be for every 'click' of the knob the scope adjusts one-quarter of one MOA. So if at your start point the scope is set (known as 'zeroed') at 100 yards and your target is 400 yards away, you can 'dial up' a given number of clicks (based on a table of math for your given ammo, rifle, conditions, etc.) so your crosshairs will indicate where to aim more precisely.  This is sooooo abbreviated, but this is ELI5.</p>
<p>The other main turret adjusts left and right in a similar fashion, to compensate for how the wind might push a bullet laterally. Some scopes have a third turret for focus, pretty much like a focus knob on any optical device.</p>
<p>There is a lot of other details but I hope this helps.</p></div>		</li>
