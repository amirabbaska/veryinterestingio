			<div class="markdown"><p>I have one question.  Isn't the 'tube' part supposed to shield the optic from any stray light?  Almost every optical systems I can think of need their respective optics to be enclosed : microscope, binoculars, digital camera, biological eye.  Why doesn't JWT need this?  Its design reminds me more of radio telescopes (a dish and a sensor).  Does this has anything to do with it being an infrared telescope?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tube primarilly seems to just be a <a href="http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/nuts_.and._bolts/optics/" target="_blank">support structure for baffles</a> to reduce interference from stray visible light. </p>
<p>The reason JWST might <em>not</em> need such an enclosure could be because it will sit parked at LaGrange point 2, which is far past the orbit of the moon. Essentially in an earth-synchronous, helio-centric orbit, being towed along by earths gravity. Out that far JWST wont have to deal with situations where earthshine, sunshine and moonshine are all coming in from different angles. Hubble, by contrast, is in LEO and would experience this kind of interference on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Technically radio experiences this same kind of noise, but considering the materials required to focus radio waves are much cheaper, much lighter, and to some degree have a larger acceptable margin of error due to <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~vjd1/electromag_spectrum.gif" target="_blank">the wavelength difference between radio and visible light</a>, it's much easier to build larger telescopes like the Arecibo Observatory (without the need of fancy digital imaging/mirror alignment tech as noted in the OP). And having a bigger telescope increases the signal to noise ratio, making it easier to sort the meaningful data from the garbage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that the JWST might not need a tube to guard against stray light, but why doesn't it need a tube or other housing to guard the sensitive, highly-polished mirrors from micrometeoroids and other space dust / debris? I would imagine that its mission could be seriously compromised if something like <a href="http://www.sciencephoto.com/media/338527/view" target="_blank">this</a> or <a href="http://images.slideplayer.com/16/5148814/slides/slide_30.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> happened to the mirrors. But all of the diagrams I've seen have the mirrors out, exposed directly to space and everything whizzing past. Of course L2 is probably less-dusty than earth orbit, but there's no guarantee that it's perfectly dust-free.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Telescopes with tubes don't use tubes to protect from stray light. It's used as support to hold the secondary mirror. Look at all big telescopes. They use truss frames to minimize weight and they're built in the middle of nowhere so there's no light pollution. Stray light isn't a concern for the JWST because it's always facing away from the sun and it's in space, so no light pollution to deal with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They absolutely do, and you counter your point, many of the largest newtonian telescopes are still located inside observatories with controlled openings specifically to reduce stray light. Even on large amateur grade truss framed dobs there are enclosures specifically around the primary and secondary mirrors and fabric is often used as a lighter alternative to the aluminum tubes you see on smaller designs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good description. My only addition is that, as with Hubble which shared it's heritage the KH-9 series of spy sats, our experience building massive folding spacecraft has advanced considerably due to NRO projects. <a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/jhtml/jframe.html#https://www.globalsecurity.org/space/systems/images/sigintadvancedoriontrumpet.jpg|||" target="_blank">We've built these now</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>In late 1990 the first Keck telescope was finished and saw first light, this was a more advanced segmented/multiple mirror telescope design which contained 36 hexagonal segments to create a 10m diameter telescope, vastly surpassing the previous record holder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the Hobby-Eberly Telescope has 91 segments and ELT with 798 segments (for 39 m diameter) is under construction. The secondary mirror of ELT with 4.2 meters diameter diameter is a single mirror, and just a bit smaller than Hale. If the secondary mirror would be the primary mirror it would be among the 30 largest telescopes.</p></div>		</li>
