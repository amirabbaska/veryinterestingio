<p>Aside from that, I think that this amount - $14,940,000 is lost forever. I'm not sure though. This is a good question, I'll add another edit and post this one too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I suppose that depends on how you look at it.</p>
<p>On one hand, John Oliver's company &quot;CARP&quot; took a $60,000 loss (i.e.. his expenses were $60,000 to purchase the debt and his income on it was nil). Had he collected those debts, as most companies would, he would presumably have had an income of $14.94 million. This would have been subject to income taxes (likely at a lower rate because CARP is a corporation). In this sense, the economy would, technically speaking, have been helped by gaining more tax revenues to use for roads, schools, prisons, police, etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, thanks to John Oliver's company, this is now $14.94 million of money that these people will never have to pay...what you may call disposable income. This $14.94 million that people will not have to pay out for medical bills will, presumably, be spent on other things (buying food, paying electric bills, buying cars, etc). This means, by spending money on all these other things, the grocery stores, electric companies, and car dealerships of the world will, again presumably, have gains from these people in the amount of $14.94 million less whatever their expenses happened to be. This will result in taxes being paid to the government for roads, schools, prisons, police, etc. It will be less than it would be had CARP collected the debts, but they will still collect taxes.</p>
<p>So in short, if you look at it as an opportunity cost, the whole thing comes fairly close to netting itself out in the end. The government suffers slightly, but the people gain substantially. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Debts and even money aren't like something like gold. He didn't just throw 100 ounces of gold into the sun. He didn't even burn $15 million in paper bills. He just cancelled debt.</p>
<p>The debtors either would have gotten money from other sources to repay their debts, or settled the debts for a lesser amount eventually, or they would have just not repaid and taken a hit on their credit reports.</p></div>		</li>
