			<div class="markdown"><p>No, if the egg has two sets of chromosomes because a failure of cell division in meiosis and the pollen has one, the resulting plant will be triploid. If the parents had 14 chromosomes normally (2n) then the resulting offspring would have 21(3n) which would be an odd number. </p>
<p>This can cause problems because it is hard to create viable egg and sperm with an odd number of chromosomes. Mules are infertile and because of it. Mules have 63 chromosomes. When it creates egg or sperm, the resulting egg and sperm have either 31 or 32 chromosomes and makes them unable to be used.</p></div>		</li>
