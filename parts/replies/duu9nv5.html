			<div class="markdown"><p>This is counterintuitive to what I learned about the Krebs Cycle and lactic acid fermentation.</p>
<p>The latter being your cell's anaerobic process for producing ATP when <em>it can no longer do so using aerobic respiration.</em> It's extremely inefficient compared to Krebs Cycle (2 atp vs. 34 per cycle) and produces lactic acid as a biproduct as well.</p>
<p>But there's two of you saying you learned this and I'm not expert. hopefully an expert can chime in here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no you're right, he probably recalled it backwards. we only go into anaerobic (burning your fuel rich) when there is a lack of oxygen. this can occur during high intensity work where your lung &amp; cardio efficiency can't keep up with the oxygen requirement. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>both actually, it performs the anaerobic exercise first(as you are exerting prior to an increase in breathing/oxygen supply increase), then into aerobic, then back to anaerobic in addition if not enough oxygen can be supplied and the exertion is too high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heâ€™s half right, he skipped a step.   There are three:  creatine phosphate which is already stored ATP, anaerobic, and aerobic.   Different muscles based on training are preferentially powered by each.   Creatine phosphate allows for short burst high power exercise.   So that first 5 reps or so of a set of weights.   Anaerobic respiration than takes over to quickly make more ATP.   This can power you for another 30 seconds or so.  Lactic acidosis build up takes over and then you have to stop as basic biochemistry stops the reaction as product becomes much higher concentration.   Aerobic exercise is your Krebs cycle, beta oxidation, and electron transport.  It take a time to start these become of the complexity of moving reactants into the mitochondria and getting the energy back out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct for exercise when the phosphagen system is considered too. If OP is not referring to exercise and is asking about wakefulness, then anaerobic pathways don't apply here. At rest, your body is beta-oxidizing fat molecules and sending them to the mitochondria for aerobic metabolism. </p></div>		</li>
