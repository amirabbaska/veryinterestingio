			<div class="markdown"><p>What if I see noise all the time? I've been to a neurologist but she didn't want anything to do with me and I've been to the eye doctor but forgot to ask him specifically about the noise. Although talking to him about other stuff with my vision he determined I'm visually sensitive to a fault... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I defocus my eyes I can see a small honeycomb like grid of tiny red dots all over my entire field of vision. I've had two different doctors tell me it's me actually seeing some cellular element of my eye. It's much easier to do in low light. Is this something similar to /r/earrumblersassemble ?</p></div>		</li>

<p>What you're looking at is the very dense set of blood capillaries called the choriocapillaris that supply your light photoreceptor cells inside your eye. Although that example is for horse eyes, even in humans, they tend to occur in a hexagonal pattern. It's possible that your eye has an arrangement where you can see the pattern more easily.</p>
<p>Not to scare you but if you want to rule out any other factors, you should contact your primary doctor to check your blood pressure and sugar levels. Both of those can change how blood flows through your body, especially the eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This could very well be an artifact of our eyes being built backwards (one of the great arguments for evolution as a series of successful accidents, as it were). </p>
<p>You'd think the rods and cones would be the first layer light reaches, but in actuality, they're buried under a few layers of meshlike nerves and blood vessels.  If you're picking up the ganglion cells your pattern-seeking brain might be encoding those as a hex/grid. </p>

<p>So they call it a nice name for this terrifying affliction.</p>
<p>Where's the scientific, too many syllables, hard to pronouce name?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought photoreceptors were unusual since they depolarize in response to absence of stimuli, and hyperpolarize in response to light.</p>
<p>Do you think these friscalating visual effects have anything to do with the so-called '<em>dark current</em>'? (i.e. in the dark high cGMP levels hold open sodium channels allowing a steady inward current, keeping the cell depolarized, and tonically firing).</p></div>		</li>
