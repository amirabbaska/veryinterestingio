			<div class="markdown"><p>Further the chemical reactions able to make a small, light battery power your phone all day are very high energy, which means your phone battery could easily become a small explosive if the reactions occurred in an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbnjEt8msjI&amp;t=3m25s" target="_blank">uncontrolled manner</a>, so the phone makers carefully design the battery to remain under control.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fast version of a battery is called a capacitor, which does not use chemicals like a battery but does in fact store the electricity in raw form. These charge extremely quickly, and discharge just as fast for momentary power spikes, but because they do not use chemicals the amount of energy that can be fit inside is much less. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can't charge batteries instantly because of how they work, they can't handle too much electricity in little time.</p>
<p>Charging batteries produces heat and heat can damage the battery and maybe even make the battery catch fire if the heat is strong enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Following up on this, the charge speed issue is one of the reasons various groups have been working to improve capacitors for use as primary power sources in electronic devices.  A capacitor stores electric charge rather than storing energy chemically, so it can be charged very quickly.  Unfortunately, capacitors don't store nearly as much energy in the same size/weight as high density batteries, so your phone would need to be much larger to use capacitors as a power source.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also your phone wants to use the power slowly, and capaciters will release the energry as quickly as it went in. So it's tough to use capacitors for phones because of that too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true.  The rate that a capacitor releases energy will depend primarily on the load applied - i.e. it will release energy at the same rate as a battery at the same voltage.  The issue is completely about energy capacity, and with current (!) technology, reasonably sized capacitors just can't store enough energy to run a phone for a practical length of time.</p></div>		</li>
