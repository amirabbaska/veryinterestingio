			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's my understanding that some possible treatments lose funding and interest when they don't show promise in, say, a study with mice or rabbits. Isn't it possible that we've abandoned a treatment that works really well in humans but not in the lab animals?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that's great to hear because that's exactly what I fear here. The way the trials system is set up is heavily biased toward treatments that work in mice and humans rather than just humans. Can you give me some examples of where this reviewing is being done?</p></div>		</li>
