			<div class="markdown"><p>In my country, Malta, desalination (reverse-osmosis) accounts for 56% of all potable water. Bear in mind that LA is far bigger, our population is 450,000.</p>
<p>In 2013 desalination plants required 78,871 Mwh, or 3.7% of Malta’s total electricity supply. In terms of the amount of energy used to produce one cubic metre of water, in 2004 this was 5.7 Kwh and in 2013 this had dropped to 4.6 Kwh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Converting that back to power, that means Malta uses about 9MW of power constantly to provide clean water. That's a lot, but not an insanely huge amount, however it's a very small population. </p>
<p>But, scaling up to the population of LA plus its agriculture requirements, and we're looking at six gigawatts. That's around 12 nuclear reactors running full blast for desalination (using the AGR design that's common where I live). So it's not really practical in terms of sheer power until filtration gets much better. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless the agriculture in Cali is using some insanley absurd amount of water, how did we go from using 9 MW to provide roughly half of potable water for 450,000 to 6 GW for only 9 times the amount of people. </p>
<p>Even if you only used desalination for the residential population, using the same MW per population you're looking at roughly 160 MW. That's one turbine at a combined cycle plant, not a huge deal but again building all that new infrastructure would be a massive investment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand your question.</p>
<p>Reverse-osmosis produced water accounts for 65% of the municipal water supply, the rest is from groundwater. These are mixed together at the plant. </p>
<p>Agricultural sector uses a combination of groundwater, captured rainwater and polished wastewater (purified wastewater sewage). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Imagine a city like Los Angeles (pop. 4 million); according to the CA-LAO government website residents use 109 gallons a day per person in the warmer months. That's 436 million gallons per day. The biggest desalination plant operating today produces 228 million gallons a day in Riyadh and cost 7.2 billion to build. So we would not only need two of those just for LA, but enough real estate to place it as well as enough electricity to power it. Let's imagine how much power is needed to power 2 plants so they can produce 456 million gallons of water a day, just for LA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To piggy back on this, municipal water use (i.e. water in homes), globally, accounts for about 10% of total water use (which I believe is where the 436 million gallons/day is estimating). The biggest user of water by far is agriculture, which uses about 70%, with industry using the remaining 20%. </p>
<p>OP was asking about using desalination for agriculture. The cost is really no where near viability for that. For agriculture to be economically viable, water needs to be very cheap, particularly if you're growing low value stuff like grains. But in addition to the cost concerns, the above comment points out just how much infrastructure would be needed to produce the water to grow the food for a city like Los Angeles. It's simply astronomical. A back of the envelope estimate says that if agriculture needs 7x as much water, feeding Los Angeles on desal alone would require 14 desal plants. Not to mention that that water would need to be spread out of thousands of kilometers of land, and much would be lost to evaporation/groundwater seepage. </p>
<p>Outside of small, densely populated, dry, coastal regions, like the Persian Gulf and Israel, there really is no substitute for the natural water cycle. We just have to be smarter about how we use water!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the major reasons for agriculture using so much water is because it's so cheap. If the only source of fresh water was suddenly expensive, use in agriculture would drop immensely as solutions like drip irrigation and evaporative loss prevention systems would suddenly become economically viable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sub-surface drip irrigation is already economically viable, especially in rural areas and groundwater conservation districts, a la Texas. It costs a lot more than you'd think to own and operate a well, and, speaking for farmers in general, damn sure want to make the best use of our water resources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently, drip irrigation at agricultural scale doesn't necessarily reduce water use.</p>
<p>It's more efficient, which leads to higher yields, but we're not limiting the yields of the farmers.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on this, yes but</p>
<p>We have to take into account the farming industry since they’d be the ones taking on the financial responsibility. Without looking it up, i believe the farming industry isn’t doing great at the moment, meaning they might not be financially able to shoulder that burden without going under (bad for everyone too).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at overall water use, say in california as a whole, yes 70% is agriculture and 20% industry. However, in the LA basin, there is almost no agriculture. For years I used to be facinated with &quot;dairy farms&quot; in LA that used the land undernearth the high voltage power lines criscrossing the LA basin. They keep cows and have a milking barn, but the feed is all trucked in from elsewhere, some as far away as Colorado and New Mexico. A lot of that hay is also from irrigated land. Industrial usage is still pretty high, but I think you'll find in LA the vast percentage is either directly residential or related municipal use. I always marveled at the sprinklers watering the landscaping plants along the sides of the freeways. Does that too count as &quot;agriculture&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the answer lies inbetween both. Make agriculture save more water (some approaches like aquaponic work for some crops and cut water cost for for example salads, herbs, tomators down by up to 90%) while making desalination more efficient. All you need to input by then will be energy, which could in huge parts come from renewables. Although the installation cost of these facilities are enormous: Aquaponic greenhouses are extremely expensive (about 43kUSD per hectar <a href="https://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/SustainAg/workshop/downloads/Aquaponics-May2013/Tokunaga.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>. Even though i can’t imagine they have a greenhouse involved in their calculation. 43k is not enough. Also automated ventilation and harvesting/ planting would explode the cost of this) it’s almost a closed circle and has a huge ROI.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to piggyback on the above, I did a lot of development work in niche RO systems so I will share my experience. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/am2017135.pdf?origin=ppub" target="_blank">This</a> is a good unbiased reference article. Desal via RO is a massive growth area where now millions of people get water from Reverse Osmosis every day. I think we probably hit 1M homes sometime in the 90's? so it really is a mature technology. Desal is used for most dry climate wealthy major cities now as a supplement. </p>
<p>Efficiency is an odd statement since efficiency is largely governed by the osmotic pressure of the solution and graphene systems do not effect that. The amount of energy required to remove 1 L of pure water from 10L of seawater is strictly governed by the osmotic pressure which is the pressure that must be created in order for there to be any flow, this is the lowest possible thermodynamic energy. Typically a large sale RO unit operates  at 1.56 kWh per m3/water versus the thermodynamic minimum energy of 1.06 kWh. </p>
<p>Graphene may be able to go slightly higher in pressure then traditional Reverse Osmosis systems but its unlikely they would actually operate at those pressures of 100 bar. Slightly better porosity may improve inefficiency on brackish water streams but that is kind of a niche area, in reality graphene would probably only lower power usage by 10-30%.</p>
<p>The overall most major limiting factors are in order:</p>
<p><strong>Capital Equipment Cost</strong></p>
<p>RO Plants cost money, and although there are shipping container units these are not sufficient in size for whole city or to be used for farm. The reality is there is unlikely to ever be a small unit possible for that given the vast amounts of water usage. </p>
<p><strong>Capital Infrastructure Requirement (Piples/Electricity, Pretreatment Tanks, Pumps, Seawater Access)</strong></p>
<p>If you suddenly find your area in a shortage of water its simply not possible to deploy all the equipment in time. In order to provide water to say 500k 1M homes you really are looking at a 5 year construction project. You can look a the Australian Perth/Melbourne Desal plants as cost and timeline guides. You simply can't build the equipment fast enough, and you cant run hundreds of km worth of copper electrical wire in a week.</p>
<p><strong>Tech Complexity</strong></p>
<p>Water treatment consists of multiple upstream and downstream steps along with the actual RO membrane. Water has chlorine in it - dead membranes. Water has solids, massive holes ion membrane producing no pure water. This add large complexity to he circuit and means that the system is almost tailor made/optimised to the water its going the be treated. This isn't easy to do in a hurry cheaply and a major reason why desal is not as widespread as it could be across all parts of the world. As for Graphene this is probably where it will make the biggest difference. The ability of a graphene filter to reduce these additional steps (its OK with chlorine for example) will likely make cost go down and reduce its technological complexity. We are however some years off that for seawater.</p></div>		</li>
