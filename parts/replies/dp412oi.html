<p>(Had to look this up)</p>
<p>It was far too subjective.  Now they use high performance liquid chromatography because it's far more accurate and repeatable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks like in the 1980's labs started using HPLC systems to get a number and then multiply by 16 to convert to Socville. Very odd system. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting.  It looks like they find the amount of capsaicin present in parts per million, and 1 ppm is about 16 Scoville units.  Seems simple enough.  </p>
<p>Scoville isn't exactly the most scientific system (too much human subjectivity, for one thing), so I'm honestly surprised that it's in such widespread use.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's exactly what I was thinking. It's very strange such a subjective system lasted until the 1980's. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, yeah! A score of 100 SHU (Scoville Heat Units) means that if you took 1 cup of the dried pepper, you would need 100 cups of water to dilute the heat.  </p>
<p>In practice, we don't need to start that small - we can make a 1/1,000 solution if we want, or a 1/1,000,000 solution for the very hot peppers, and work our way from there.  And for the extra hot peppers, they don't usually use human testers - they use machines that analyze the spicy compounds in the pepper and determine its heat in Scoville units.  But that's the original method used and the reason for the numbers.</p></div>		</li>
