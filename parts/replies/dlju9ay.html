			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the emphasis is on &quot;different&quot;, not on &quot;producing offspring.&quot; In case of subspecies, unless they found a lone individual specimen, it would be trivial to note the population can produce <em>viable</em> (offspring are not sterile) offspring.</p>
<p>So what makes them sufficiently different? In many cases (especially among fish, but present in most groups of animals), the subspecies, and sometimes even species from different genuses can still hybridize and produce viable offspring, if given the chance. So while inability to breed across subspecies is usually sufficient (I think it is always sufficient, afaik), as I just explained by example, not necessary for defining a subspecies.</p>
<p>Two populations of a species begin to drift apart when there is a geographical barrier between them, be it a desert, a forest they can't live in, etc, or if they spread far enough across a space that a species on one extreme does not normally have the opportunity to breed with species on the other side (Google &quot;ring species&quot; for extra fun--both groups on both sides might eventually be unable to breed with each other, buy can both breed with the guys in the middle!)... Well, then they have an opportunity to genetically drift, as the populations are separated. Eventually, they drift to an extent where it becomes &quot;noticeable&quot; by a taxonomist, they then genetically test the two populations to determine whether certain mutations are uniform within each population, and if &quot;enough&quot; are, then we consider them to be subspecies. What is &quot;noticeable,&quot; and what is &quot;enough&quot; are constantly bickered about in taxonomic circles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of fish, there are some subspecies that refuse to interbreed in clear water, but will start hybridizing in cloudy water. In this case better vision acts as a barrier rather than geographic separation. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is really important for lay people to realize. What exactly defines something as its own species vs. subspecies vs. the same species is often a matter of opinion rather than exact science. Obviously there are many clear cut cases but theres a lot more grey area there than most people realize. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of the platypus what he is saying is that to us humans both species are indistinguishable. However, due to modern science we've been able to map the genomes of said platypi and we've seen enough differentiation in two specific groups to beleive they may be different species entirely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Platypi, like octopi, is technically incorrect. The -pus here is from Greek, not Latin, so the correct plural would be -podes, but most people use -puses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, this means that two groups that may appear similar are actually two distinct populations that do not breed with each other.  A &quot;new&quot; species of wild animal isn't generally newly evolved, just newly discovered.  It may have existed for millions of years but was only recently observed by humans.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In part because if we want a consistent definition across all species that wouldn't cause humanity to suddenly split into a whole bunch of subspecies a lot of existing species are going to have to get combined.</p>
<p>And that means lots of biologists that got to name a &quot;new species&quot; are going to lose that feather in their cap.</p></div>		</li>
