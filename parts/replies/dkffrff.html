It uses the flash and the camera to look for changes of colors in the skin. I wonder how accurate it is compared to hospital machinery. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty accurate! The downside is that it takes maybe 10-20 seconds to get a single reading, but a pulse oximeter gives you readings beat to beat (if I'm not mistaken).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similarly, some people are developing ways of testing jaundice in babies using your average smartphone light and camera for use in remote places that don't have the specific medical equipment. Although, gets more complicated and harder to do since you'd want to test absolute values of bilirubin, not just relative values of oxygenated hemoglobin to total hemoglobin.</p></div>		</li>
