			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Not only that, but it's more of a risk to commit such a string of murders, as well. We have CCTV and phones everywhere, it's definitely a put off to wanting to commit the crimes. Of course, once people escalate they always don't have clear heads, so that only accounts for the people that are aware enough of consequences. </p>
<p>Mental heath care is more &quot;wide spread&quot; and &quot;effective&quot; (I'm holding back the sarcasm because more often than not, people still ignore the signs or the stigma of being mentally ill wards people away from getting help or treatment). </p>
<p>Jeffrey Dahmer is a prime example of how the stigma around homosexuality was so bad. He was almost caught one time, but the police were so &quot;disgusted&quot; by the homosexual relationship, they ignored the victim and let Dahmer escort him back to what would be his demise. If he'd been able to experiment like we can today, he would probably have had issues, but nothing so far as what he did. Of course, that is speculation, as he <em>could</em> have killed today, stigma free or no. </p>
<p>Gacy is another strong point, but with his mentality, and being a pillar of the community, would he have been able to have that same position being openly gay/bi? There's still a considerable amount of issues he would have faced, and he might have started his spree for different reasons. It wouldn't have lasted as lon, however, with today's modern technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to your point about homosexual acceptance - their victims would have had safer options too, and more support in place, if being gay was more acceptable then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point too. Gay men and women of color who were sex workers were big pools of victims that the police generally didn't even bother to investigate when they went missing. </p></div>		</li>
