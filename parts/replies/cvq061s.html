			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a dream that I had one and kept leaving it places and people kept handing it back and casually being like; &quot;You left your baby on the counter&quot; and I was just like, &quot;Oh, right. I forgot I have a baby...&quot;</p>
<p>I do not have a baby in real life. I have to take the mini-pill and set a timer on my phone so I don't forget... And then have a baby that I forget about. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Lesbian here... don't need BC for actual pregnancy prevention but do like to take it for skin/consistency of periods. Is one better than the other for me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I take Tri-Nessa, I'm pretty sure it is a combo pill. Any other type for me causes me to have horribly erratic mood swings. I'm talking I can go from being the happiest person to wanting to commit suicide in the space of an hour at most.
For whatever reason I can only take this particular one, so if you take a bc that doesn't work for you PLEASE tell your doctor so you can a different type! There are more types than you think and there is one that is just right for you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you consisted an implant? I have the mirena. I know everyone thinks it's a scary horrible thing that will kill you, but in reality it's extremely safe. It's just also extremely popular, so you hear about more horror stories simply because more people have one.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've had my mirena for two and a half years almost, and I could not be happier! I have not had a period since before my pregnancy (I got the mirena six weeks after giving birth), my skin has never been clearer (although idk if that's just me - I never had bad breakouts), and I never have to worry about forgetting it one day and getting breakthrough bleeding. In the states it's good for five years, but they're about to change the guideline so that you can actually use it even longer than that.</p>
<p>Plus, if you ever decide you want to have a baby (I'm sorry, I don't know exactly how that would work if you're a lesbian - I'm guessing IVF? Forgive my ignorance please...) you'll be able to start trying about twenty-four hours after the removal of the implant, and it's perfectly safe for breastfeeding mothers. That may be useless information for you if you don't want to ever be pregnant, but maybe someone here will find it helpful :)</p>
<p>If you have any questions, pm me! I know a lot about different birth control method at this point lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How long did it take for your periods to go away? I tried to go on a continuous pill and still had a period every 4th week (starting two days before the week), plus one after three packs (that also started two days before). So three periods total, each a week long, in the span of 10 weeks. I got annoyed and quit lol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on which contraceptive you take there are stricter/looser guides. </p>
<p>If I remember correctly, the minipill must be taken at the same time everyday, with a 1-2 hr leeway. For a combination pill it is up to 12hrs after your usual time. </p>
<p>I read somewhere that for the combination pill the active ingredient has a half life of 36hrs.</p></div>		</li>
