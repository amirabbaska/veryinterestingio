			<p>Reading about effective times is giving me a creeping terror better than any horror film.<br><br>(I take it the same time every day, right? Unless I forget, but I never forget for more than 3 hours, right?! Except sometimes. Oh crap. I'm definitely triple pregnant. <em>Jump scare</em>) </p>		</li>

			<p>I always dream about leaving my baby in the car. Last time I left it there it fell down between the seat and the door and its head got squished. Thank god I do not have a real baby.</p>		</li>

			<p>I had a dream that I had one and kept leaving it places and people kept handing it back and casually being like; &quot;You left your baby on the counter&quot; and I was just like, &quot;Oh, right. I forgot I have a baby...&quot;<br><br>I do not have a baby in real life. I have to take the mini-pill and set a timer on my phone so I don't forget... And then have a baby that I forget about. </p>		</li>

			<p>The effectiveness of the pill doesn't change depending on what time of day it's taken so long as it's taken at the same time every day. I'd imagine that 9pm is convenient for a lot of people as their working day is over but they'll hardly ever be asleep by that time therefore the risk of missing a pill is minimized. <br><br>Edit: I forgot to say that nausea can be a side effect of any type of birth control pill. Taking the pill later in the evening allows you to sleep through the worst of it and not have it impact your day so much.</p>		</li>

			<p>Not strictly true, the combined pill is good for 24 hours. The estrogen in it stops the pituitary gland from producing a couple of other hormones that are vital for ovulation - this process takes time to start again. POP's work by hindering ovulation and also thickening the cervical mucus to make sperm less viable. These changes begin to reverse as soon as the progestin leaves the body: hence why taking the POP at the same time every day is very important.<br><br>I suspect you're getting confused with some newer progestin-only pills. Any POP that uses desogestrel (Cerazette is the only brand I can name offhand) has a 12 hour margin of error because the desogestrel takes longer to leave the body.</p>		</li>

			<p>I was taking the combo pill and I didn't even know I'm supposed to take it at the same time every day. Either I'm lucky or 12 hours is fine.</p>		</li>

			<p>Same. Well, I knew but I am really shitty about it. Basically just took it when I went to bed, which could be anywhere from 8am to 4am (lol at that one nowadays...) 16 years and no rugrats to my name.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's an odds game, taken at the same time each day you have the odds of getting pregnant that are written on the side of the box <br>(~ 98-99% effective IRC) if you are not as good about it, the odds you ovulate go up, (exponentially until reaching normal) as the drugs work their way out of your body. An extra hour or two is only a couple percentage points probably a couple of days and you might as well not have taken it at all.</p>		</li>

			<p>I never understood that statistic. Is it saying that it's 99% effective each pack, and you should get pregnant once every 9 years if you have constant sex. Or is it that it won't work in 1/100 people?  Is that just a random mix up of somehow it just doesn't work one month for you, or is there one person in every hundred that is just fucked from the start and will get pregnant regardless of using it right?</p>		</li>

			<p>It is per couple in a time span, if 10,000 couples us this drug X% will get pregnant. Not sure what that time span is exactly and it is probably different from company to company and would be adjusted to either 1 year or 10 years for the statistic I would assume. <br><br>Note more frequent sex would impact condom use stats but not the pill as it is really the odds you ovulate and that is only 12 chances a year or so.</p>		</li>
