			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent point. My friend's 15 month old basically wakes up and spends all day moving objects around, playing with them, getting us to open bottles for her, etc. It's really a full time job if the entire world is completely new to you. You have to figure out everything from scratch. </p></div>		</li>
