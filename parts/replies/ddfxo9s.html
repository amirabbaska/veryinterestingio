			<div class="markdown"><p>Much of my job involves reading and writing policy documents and scientific articles. I often meet with scientists and other policymakers to figure out how to keep research running smoothly. Millions of dollars are invested in research, both at NIH and at universities. NIH science policy analysts make sure the money goes to the best researchers and best projects while being responsive to the needs of scientists and the priorities of the public.</p>
<p>There are multiple science policy fellowships you can apply to, and I'm a AAAS Science and Technology Policy fellow. It's a fantastic fellowship because I'm actually embedded in science policy and can get on-the-job experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your response. I'm in the process of earning a PhD in biomedical engineering, and currently filling out the now obligatory Individual Development Plan so future paths are much on my mind. </p>
<p>Are NIH science policy analysts involved in deciding what study sections will exist for each grant cycle?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember hearing that the executive branch fellows are actually federal employees - if that's correct, do you know whether future fellows will be affected by the hiring freeze? (I was hoping to apply in November if I could finish the PhD in time...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you recommend doing a AAAS fellowship now? I was thinking of applying, but I'm not sure how the political climate might affect my job prospects.</p>
<p>Side question- how did you decide which kind of policy you want to do? From what I understand there are different STPF tracks, and I'm not quite sure which would be the best for me. Obviously I want to figure that out before applying. My PhD is in the neuroscience of feeding behavior (obesity), and currently doing an educational psychology postdoc where we study STEM education. </p></div>		</li>
