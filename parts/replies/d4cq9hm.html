			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious. If I get a moderate cold, my nose will probably stuff up to the point where <em>no</em> air at all comes through it at the worst. I could pop my ears trying to breathe through it, and I'd get nothing. If my mouth were forcibly covered for whatever reason, what would happen? Would my body do anything to prevent suffocating itself to death?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes your body would act...
I suffer terribly with blocked sinuses, and in my search for relief I discovered that if your nose is blocked and you can't breathe through your mouth, your nose will clear so you don't suffocate...
I breathe in, close my mouth and pinch my nose. I rock my head back and forth slowly (no idea why!), and hold the breath for as long as I possibly can (obviously I stop before I get dizzy or pass out!). I let  go of my nose, open my mouth and breathe. My nose will be unblocked! Only lasts for a minute or two though.
Lots of Google results for this technique.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm this works. Holding your breath till you feel the burning urge to breathe again clears nasal blockages right up.</p>
<p>Probably not a good idea to do this repeatedly though...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is what would happen; the same effect occurs when exercising while sick. Adrenaline is released and your nose frees up. Not that you should exercise whilst sick, but that's what happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed before that when I brush my teeth while sick my nasal congestion will temporarily subside. I'm assuming this is the body realizing that breathing through my mouth has been compromised and I'll need to breathe through my nose again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. It's more likely that you lift your head back or upright to brush which drains the mucus to the back to your throat. Some toothpastes are mint flavoured and can also have a decongestion effect, much like menthol/mints/other decongestants. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's likely the menthol or whatever is in your toothpaste making you tear up and produce more fluidlike mucus that washes your nose out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He also asked about allergies, it's much the same the immune system sees allergens as foreign invaders much like bacteria or viruses and it goes overboard in an attempt to get rid of the offending material.  </p>
<p>Mucus plug form in the lungs, the bronchioles constrict, and the blood vessels dilate.  I'm rusty on my A&amp;P as to why exactly the body reacts this way, but left unchecked a severe allergic reaction well close the bronchi and the blood vessels will dilate as far as they can go making it impossible to breathe and leaving a massive container (your blood vessels) with very little fluid to make the system run.</p>
<p>The reason epinephrine so popular is because it is a bronchodilator and a vasoconstrictor thus reversing the effects of your own immune system.  This can be a temporary fix and ANY use of epinephrine should be followed up with a trip to the emergency room, even if you aren't having an allergic reaction when the epinephrine was applied.</p>
<p>I'm sure I could research more if this answer isn't satisfactory and I would like to find out exactly why the body does what it does for allergies as well all I know is your own immune system acts like it does as a reaction to fight off the foreign invaders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In pretty broad terms.  IgE is responsible for allergic reactions. the histamine reaction which causes bronchoconstriction vasodilation,  redness,  swelling.  Pretty much histamines is what helps your body facilitate the entry of immune cells to the area of infection.  The cells that secrete histamine most effectively are mast cells and they respond very well to IgE.  Its kinda an overreaction of the immune system to something harmless.  Hence the hygene hypothesis.  </p>
<p>Edit: mast cells secrete histamine due to IgE not the other way round.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, I think the original question is not being answered here. People are focusing too much on mucus secretions, and not the bronchoconstriction mediated through IgE/Mast cells, which is the true cause of your airways tightening (anaphylaxis) and hence why epinephrine is used as a treatment.</p>
<p>Mucus secretions make sense in terms of mucociliary clearance of pathogens from the lungs but don't explain why bronchoconstriction occurs in allergic reactions. I would argue the chief reason why there is bronchoconstriction (and spasm) is to try and force out parasitic worms that reside in the lungs. </p></div>		</li>

<p>infections IN the lungs can prevent that mucus from leaving, and draw off fluid from the blood or the surroundings, which can lead to fatal breathing problems (see tuberculosis)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm slowly getting over the first bout of pneumonia I've had in my life. Almost had to be hospitalized because my oxygenation level got down to 91-92. Doubling down on some strong antibiotics did the trick, but breathing was hard for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>That shit sucks, man.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% agree. Many people think of pneumonia as a geriatric health concern and don't think it can be so dangerous for otherwise healthy 20 or 30-somethings.</p>
<p>I had pneumonia a few years ago and had to visit an urgent care clinic after fighting a 102+ fever for over a week. I was getting light stomach bleeding from fever reducers and completely lost my appetite. I had become so dehydrated the nurses at the clinic almost couldn't get IV started. 4 different people had to try about 10 times all over my arms/hands. Not a pleasant experience for someone uncomfortable with needles. Got a powerful antibiotic (only 6 or 8 pills I think) and that cleaned <em>everything</em> out. It took me an additional month to be able to walk up a few flights of stairs w/o suffocating.</p>
<p>Take care fellow pneumonia survivor!</p></div>		</li>
