			<p>What I'd love to know is where in the hell does the amount of mucus that can be produced at these times come from..? The last time I had a sinus infection I swear I could blow a pint of snot out and within 2min or less do it again and again. Just how?!</p>		</li>

			<p>This doesn't address that the mucus contains a lot of proteins and other things that are meant to grab on to the larger debris or foreign bodies, coating them, and subsequently expelling them either through the nose and mouth or by simply investing them. The ingestion route can actually upset the stomach as the proteins are not easily digestible and may cause intestinal discomfort or diarrhea. </p>		</li>

			<p>We are excellent at removing many pathogens. The problem is in the collateral damage caused to our own bodies. In the most extreme cases, cytotoxic cells are not given the &quot;off&quot; signal when the infection is contained and they are highly sensitized to kill potentially uninfected cells, and the signals released by this cellular damage activates a positive feedback loop, recruiting more and more cytotoxic cells to the problem area.</p>		</li>

			<p>I've heard swallowing mucous containing a virus or bacteria will help you build immunity to it.<br><br>Which is why children instinctually eat their boogers.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/eatresponsibly" target="_blank">eatresponsibly</a>
			<p>Nah. Ingesting bacteria or viruses that have already infected you won't make a difference. Plus it infects through the respiratory system, not the digestive system and it likely destroyed and digested completely in the stomach. <br><br>To your second point, I can only speculate about booger eating. The nose catches dirt and germs that generally shouldn't be let into the body. However, exposure to germs can, in fact, build up your immune system. So eating nose dirt and germs, while can lead to a common cold or other illnesses, may also boost the immune system. </p>		</li>

			<p>Personally, I wouldn't encourage people to actively go out of their way to &quot;boost their immune system&quot; but taking hygiene to the extreme is also not good.  Antibacterial soaps can create resistant strains of viruses and overwashing your hands with AB soap can theoretically decrease the effectiveness of your immune system.  <br><br>So I would say don't go around feeding your kids their boogers and bathing them once a week, but don't overdo any hygiene either.  Standard hygiene procedures, such as washing hands before eating (with a surfactant-based soap rather than AB), bathing regularly, brush teeth 2-3 times a day, etc.  Don't need to wash them head to toe whenever they step outside, though.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, I think kids just grab shit and put it in their mouths as a way of learning about the world. Humans are social creatures and rely a lot on culture and community more so than innate specific instincts that have an evolutionary advantage. So in this case putting stuff in their mouths <em>could</em> be an evolutionary behavior since an adult would hopefully stop them before the &quot;kill you&quot; stuff was ingested. Maybe the kids that put weird stuff in their mouths had better immune systems and produced more offspring. But when you start to focus on an activity as specific as eating boogers for humans it's hard to point to it as instinctual and having evolutionary significance. </p>		</li>

			<p>By ingesting I mean eating. Actually consuming a virus that you are already sick with is essentially like eating protein from chicken. Your body will see no difference and digest it as such. You won't get re-sick from it, and your immune system is already reacting to it so it's not going to augment the response. <br><br>Yes I know they are the same, bacteria are a type a germs. So are viruses. I guess I didn't read through my post literally enough. <br><br>Also, exposure to germs through their infectious route can build up your immune system, provided you are not already sick with it (different from my first point)</p>		</li>

I took a huge cold swig, but only got the first gulp down and the nicotine from the chewing tobacco knocked me out. I woke up still with a mouthful hours later (warm now), it had kinda stained my teeth by then, and there were a few strings of mucus that were caught in my gums.</p>		</li>

			<p>Actually, do not swallow. The body is attempting to rid itself of whatever the invader is. This is the same with a bloody nose, do not tilt your head back. This is actually bad advice. Swallowing too much blood can make you vomit. Apply pressure and allow the blood to flow out. You're not &quot;saving&quot; blood by swallowing it. At this point it has already left your system, best to just let it out. (in the case of a bloody nose) <br>Also commenting on the below epi pen comments. I understand they're attempting to make a joke, but in all seriousness, if used inappropriately bad things can happen. Epinephrine is a potent vasoconstrictor (blood vessel constriction) and if used inappropriately. I.e. poking your hand or finger you could potentially lose that finger.<br>Source: ICU Nurse</p>		</li>

			<p>Ew, what? People really try to keep their blood in their body? Anyone could tell that that's unhealthy.<br><br>When I said &quot;just swallow&quot; I meant that your priorities should be kinda like this:<br><br><em> If alone, spit out.<br></em> If in a crowd, cough into a handkerchief<br><em> If in a crowd, swallow<br></em> If in a crowd, spit out<br><br>In that order.

			<p>Nurse or not, that doesn't sound entirely accurate. There's a reason why your stomache is filled with potent acid and a thick wall of mucus. things that grow in your sinus cavity are <em>generally</em> not going to survive a trip through the digestive tract, any more than a fish would make it far on land, or you under water.<br>Just not the environment you're cut out for.

			<p>You're correct there is a reason your stomach is filled with a &quot;potent&quot; acid. And it's not as an antibacterial. It's to assist in the digestion of food. And the human developed a swallow reflex to do just that swallow. As in Food/drink. And the mucous lining, that's to protect your stomach from that &quot;potent&quot; acid. So that it doesn't eat away at your stomach tissue. And for your generally statement, you are correct some bacteria may not survive it. But most can, if you want to swallow, that's on you. But my advice would be to use a tissue to blow your nose or spit it out. </p>		</li>

			<p>It's probably half A half B. Your body can definitely kill you for no good reason as an over reaction. Autoimmune diseases are a good thing:strong immune system going overboard. Dying from a new sting is a bad thing, even though your immune system is helpful in most cases. You can die of shock from killing too much virus too fast. You can also die from overproduction of mucus or too high of a fever.   The body doesn't really plan anything, it's pretty impressive that it's reacting proportionally as often as it does to the threat. So it's only natural that unusual circumstances Will result in the usual response perhaps being bad. If the chemistry is such that 99% of the time it's good for you, evolution Will still favor it if 1% of the time it's an over reaction.</p>		</li>

			<p>nope.. although it may contain some after they've done their job, that are not primarily made up from them..<br><br>&gt; In vertebrates, mucus is a slippery secretion produced by, and covering, mucous membranes. Mucous fluid is rich in glycoproteins and water and is typically produced from cells found in mucous glands. Mucous fluid may also originate from mixed glands, which contain both serous and mucous cells. It is a viscous colloid containing antiseptic enzymes (such as lysozymes), immunoglobulins, inorganic salts, proteins such as lactoferrin, and glycoproteins known as mucins that are produced by goblet cells in the mucous membranes and submucosal glands. This mucus serves to protect epithelial cells (that line the tubes) in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital, visual, and auditory systems; the epidermis in amphibians; and the gills in fish. A major function of this mucus is to protect against infectious agents such as fungi, bacteria and viruses. The average human nose produces about a liter of mucus per day. Most of the mucus produced is in the gastrointestinal tract.<br><br><br>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus</a></p>		</li>

I rock my head back and forth slowly (no idea why!), and hold the breath for as long as I possibly can (obviously I stop before I get dizzy or pass out!).

			<p>Neti pots are amazing. They are inexpensive, and you can buy them and the saline packets at any pharmacy chain (e.g., Walgreen's, CVS), at Walmart, on Amazon etc. I've suffered from sinus infections my entire life (as in multiple times a year), and have even had sinus reconstruction surgery to alleviate the problem. I couldn't function without my Neti pot. I use it daily, even if I don't have a sinus infection, and it has greatly reduced my issues with allergies and congestion. <br><br>EDIT: There's a lot more discussion about Neti pots than I anticipated, lol. To be clear, do NOT use tap water (or gasoline); use boiled or distilled water. Wash the pot after each use. Also, keep your mouth open while pouring to prevent the water from going down your throat. </p>		</li>

			<p>I just eyeball it. Keep a shot glass of salt in the vanity, toss in enough to make a 2mm high sloping pile on a quarter (so 1/2 gram??), would be how I describe my method. Water temp at the level where it doesn't feel hot or cold on your fingers. From what I gather, you want enough salt that the pH of the water doesn't give your membranes that burning sensation, but not so much that you have more than a light aftertaste of salt. Sounds like it's up to the individual's comfort level. </p>		</li>

			<p>When I had nose surgery my ENT gave me a recipe for making homemade saline nasal rinse. It's amazing. I used it 2-3 times a day during recovery, and now use it a few times a year when I have bad allergies.<br><br>- Fill a clean 1 quart glass jar with distilled water<br>- Add 2-3 teaspoons Mediterranean sea salt (start easy, maybe 2 heaping spoons, then work up as tolerated)<br>- Add 1 rounded teaspoon baking soda<br>- Stir/shake to mix contents<br>- Store at room temp for up to a week<br><br>Warm it up to body temp in the microwave. I use the NeilMed bottles not a neti pot, but that's just preference.<br><br>The sea salt cuts down on the burning, and the baking soda makes it &quot;slick&quot;.</p>		</li>

			<p>Try this: breathe out ALL your air, then breathe out more, then a little more, then a little more, keep breathing out small amounts, try to get it all out and then hold. Once your blood oxygen levels start dropping you will feel your sinuses open up real quick.

			<p>I tried exactly this because I was curious. I suffer from cat allergies and have found that breathing incredibly slowly (to the point of your lungs screaming for air and you trickle enough in to stop yourself from gasping) your nasal airway will open up (it's very cool to feel it happening). Breathing deeply then causes it to close up again after a short while.<br><br>However, trying this when my nose was blocked due to a cold?<br>I would have passed out waiting for it to unblock.

			<p>There's actually a nose-unblocking exercise you can do that is outlined in a book called The Oxygen Advantage. All you do is keep your mouth shut tight, exhale completely and walk briskly until you need to breathe again and only use your nose. You can do it repeatedly just make sure you give yourself a minute or two rest between sets. Once clear, just keep breathing through your nose instead of your mouth.</p>		</li>

			<p>Not really. It's more likely that you lift your head back or upright to brush which drains the mucus to the back to your throat. Some toothpastes are mint flavoured and can also have a decongestion effect, much like menthol/mints/other decongestants. </p>		</li>

			<p>I remember hearing from way back in junior high that swallowing phlegm and mucus is a good thing because it helps coat the walls of your stomach to protect from stomach acid. Is that true?

			<p>gross is less &quot;reminds us that we're animals&quot; and more &quot;signal of things leaving the body&quot; because things leaving the body usually carry disease and waste (like mucus, saliva, feces, urine, vomit) or directly related to death (blood, exposed organs, rended flesh). Which then extends to  things like long hair, long nails, (lack of grooming=greater chance of disease) and then to other natural female body processes mixed in with a little patriarchy for good measure (childbirth, menstruation, breast feeding) and some male parts too (semen in a nonsexual situation)<br><br>and then extends to things like unfamiliar smells, and tastes, because again poison, waste, disease. <br><br>So anything that either comes out of the body, looks like it could have come out of a body, or looks like it could cause things in the body to come out are &quot;gross&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>honestly, that's the best way to remedy a stuffy nose. Breathe all the way out, hold your breath, and then move around a lot (basically creating a higher demand for oxygen). When you feel your nose start to clear begin taking small rapid breaths through your nose. You'll feel like you're suffocating and your brain will be screaming at you to breath through your mouth but after like 10-15 seconds your nose will be completely clear. repeat as necessary. works every single time.<br><br>edit: words</p>		</li>

			<p>Actually your nose would clear up. Here, next time you're stuffed up, seal your nose shut and breathe out, and try to breathe through your nose, until you absolutely need to take a breath. At that point, your nose should have cleared up some. I know, it sounds like compete BS, but give it a try, it works. It goes to show how your body will adjust if you can't breathe. </p>		</li>

			<p>I actually use this technique to clear my congestion! Cover your mouth (or just refuse to breath through it) and keep trying to breath out of your nose as you would normally. You'll get super winded and you'll be desperate for a breath for a few seconds, but your nose will be clear in no time. Any sort of moderately strenuous physical activity will do wonders as well.</p>		</li>

			<p>This actually happened to a kid at my college.  He was working at a gas station and had a really bad cold.  Some guy came in and robbed the place.  Before leaving, he tied him up then duct taped the guys mouth shut so he couldn't yell for help.  Unfortunately, he was so sick he couldn't breathe through his nose.  He ended up suffocating and died.  It was really sad.</p>		</li>

			<p>Interestingly enough that's exactly how I feel with a completely stuffed nose. Exhale all the air from you lungs and run around a bit. Try to breath through your nose. At first you will feel like your going to die but eventually your nose will open up. I think it has to do with co2 in your blood making it more acidic but I'm not sure. </p>		</li>

			<p>I actually do this to loosen up my nose when I have a cold so I can blow it into a Kleenex. Hold your nostrils together, mouth closed, and tilt your head back and forward slowly taking a second or two each time. Once it gets unbearable and you need to take a breath, do so. You'll find your nose is temporary clear and you can blow it.</p>		</li>

			<p>Actually, I have experienced this before. If you have a really stuffy nose you can cover your mouth and hold your breath for a long period of time. Your nose will clear up almost 100% and you can breathe through your nose easily. Once you recover and get oxygen back into your system, your nose will &quot;re-stuff&quot; </p>		</li>

			<p>100% agree. Many people think of pneumonia as a geriatric health concern and don't think it can be so dangerous for otherwise healthy 20 or 30-somethings.<br><br><br>I had pneumonia a few years ago and had to visit an urgent care clinic after fighting a 102+ fever for over a week. I was getting light stomach bleeding from fever reducers and completely lost my appetite. I had become so dehydrated the nurses at the clinic almost couldn't get IV started. 4 different people had to try about 10 times all over my arms/hands. Not a pleasant experience for someone uncomfortable with needles. Got a powerful antibiotic (only 6 or 8 pills I think) and that cleaned <em>everything</em> out. It took me an additional month to be able to walk up a few flights of stairs w/o suffocating.<br><br>Take care fellow pneumonia survivor!</p>		</li>

			<p>What about anaphylactic shock? I had a severe allergic reaction once after eating garlic (eat it regularly, usually causes hives but was never worried because I like garlic too much) then one day, I ate something with strong garlic and instantly I couldn't breathe. I have asthma, and it was similar, but so different. It was like the worst asthma attack I have ever had, plus diareah and cramps that brought my period on about 10 days early?  My period went on for around 8 days when usually it lasts half that time, but was extremely watery? I am hoping for serious answers here because I never went the hospital afterwards because I can't afford it and I was exhausted and wanted to stay in bed for days after anyway, it was that tiring. I live with my mum and she gave me ventolin during the initional asthema attack stage, I went to sleep straight after because I was exhausted. It has worried me ever since. I know the answer is &quot;go to the doctor&quot; but I can't afford to, too expensive. I really need to know other people's experiences before I can take that risk and go to the doctor.</p>		</li>

			<p>Mucus production is only part of the answer.  Congestion related to allergies is more related to vasodilation of the small vessels of the nasopharynx.  For allergies specifically, release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators cause engorgement of the nasal mucosa- hence our use of antihistamines, nasal steroids, and vasoconstrictors such as pseudoephedrine for treatment.  Mucolytics such as guaifenesin (mucinex) are only an adjunct therapy.<br><br>Source: am an anesthesiologist </p>		</li>

			<p>He also asked about allergies, it's much the same the immune system sees allergens as foreign invaders much like bacteria or viruses and it goes overboard in an attempt to get rid of the offending material.  <br><br>Mucus plug form in the lungs, the bronchioles constrict, and the blood vessels dilate.  I'm rusty on my A&amp;P as to why exactly the body reacts this way, but left unchecked a severe allergic reaction well close the bronchi and the blood vessels will dilate as far as they can go making it impossible to breathe and leaving a massive container (your blood vessels) with very little fluid to make the system run.<br><br>The reason epinephrine so popular is because it is a bronchodilator and a vasoconstrictor thus reversing the effects of your own immune system.  This can be a temporary fix and ANY use of epinephrine should be followed up with a trip to the emergency room, even if you aren't having an allergic reaction when the epinephrine was applied.<br><br>I'm sure I could research more if this answer isn't satisfactory and I would like to find out exactly why the body does what it does for allergies as well all I know is your own immune system acts like it does as a reaction to fight off the foreign invaders.</p>		</li>

			<p>In pretty broad terms.  IgE is responsible for allergic reactions. the histamine reaction which causes bronchoconstriction vasodilation,  redness,  swelling.  Pretty much histamines is what helps your body facilitate the entry of immune cells to the area of infection.  The cells that secrete histamine most effectively are mast cells and they respond very well to IgE.  Its kinda an overreaction of the immune system to something harmless.  Hence the hygene hypothesis.  <br><br>Edit: mast cells secrete histamine due to IgE not the other way round.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Exactly, I think the original question is not being answered here. People are focusing too much on mucus secretions, and not the bronchoconstriction mediated through IgE/Mast cells, which is the true cause of your airways tightening (anaphylaxis) and hence why epinephrine is used as a treatment.<br><br>Mucus secretions make sense in terms of mucociliary clearance of pathogens from the lungs but don't explain why bronchoconstriction occurs in allergic reactions. I would argue the chief reason why there is bronchoconstriction (and spasm) is to try and force out parasitic worms that reside in the lungs. </p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/frizbledom" target="_blank">frizbledom</a>
			<p>Bronchoconstriction in combination with increased mucus production allows cilia to move foreign material from the airways easier. See bronchiectasis for the opposite of this effect where airways become wider, leading to a reduced elimination of mucus and increased risk on infection (e.g. COPD)<br>Also the vasodilation is only one reason your blood pressure will drop, histamine also increases capillary permeability, causing fluid to leak into surrounding tissues, massively increasing the 'container size'. This is the cause of the swelling you see in anaphylaxis.</p>		</li>
