			<div class="markdown"><p>It does if you consider that the atmosphere has tides. The oceans on earth are slowing down our rotation, so why not the atmosphere on Venus? And you have to remember, Venus’s day is longer than its year, so really, its <em>barely</em> spinning</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The oceans on Earth are slowing down our rotation by transferring that rotation to the Moon.  Venus doesn't have a moon to give angular momentum to.</p>
<p>/u/Alotofboxes 's point about solar tides could potentially work, but I still don't see a way to actually <em>reverse</em> the rotation with tidal motion.  If somebody's got a journal reference I could check out...</p></div>		</li>

<p>A Venusian day is 116 days. A Venusian year is 225 days.</p>
<p>Edit: A sidereal year is 243 days. Nevermind. But doesn't a synodic year make more sense to use in this case?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Venus was (and possibly still is) a very geologically active planet. Any crater several billion years old would probably be buried under huge lava flows. Or it may have hit so early in the planet's history that there was no crust to begin with. Earth was hit by a small planet billions of years ago, a event that formed the Moon but left no visible marks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m by no means an expert, but I was under the impression that whatever hit us and created the Moon is what helped jump-start plate tectonics and the oceans. If the Moon is an ejected mass of molten rock, that would <em>kinda</em> make sense...again, speaking as someone with no expertise on the subject. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely. However in the case of Venus (IIRC), the planet undergoes &quot;re-surfacing&quot; - the surface gets bathed in lava, then solidifies again.
I may be thinking of Mercury, so the better informed will correct me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct. Mercury is geologically dead (still interesting, but interesting in the manner of an alien corpse, not a live alien). Venus is, however, still <em>very</em> much active - and why shouldn't it be? It's roughly the same size of Earth, and Earth is still geologically active. If they had roughly the same amount of energy in them during their formation, they would (discounting respective atmospheres and incoming energy from the Sun) cool at roughly the same rate. With atmospheres and incoming energy included, Venus might even be cooling <em>slower</em> than the Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the video it's mentions how the theory is having a comeback. The idea is that instead of the asteroid simply colliding with Venus, that  the planet at the time was significantly smaller and the asteroid merged with the baby planet to make what we now call Venus.</p>
<p>I don't know anything about this myself, just quoting the video.</p></div>		</li>
