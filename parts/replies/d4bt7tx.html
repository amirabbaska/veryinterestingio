			<div class="markdown"><p>Bees only being able to sting once is a result of a barbed stinger becoming stuck in our skin and then subsequently torn out when they can't pull it away cleanly. </p>
<p>Against another insect I don't think they would have the same problem - their exoskeleton wouldn't catch hold of a stinger the same way that thick/flexible mammal flesh does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They sting each other. Balling (bunch of bees trapping another insect and overheating it) is generally done with the queen, when they want to get rid of it, or with wasps. I've never seen or heard of balling for an opposing bee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume you cover all of the entrances. I mean, yea you will probably not be able to cover 100% of them, but at least you limit the area through which the robbers can enter.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a bee research lab. I'm pretty sure that by making only one smaller entrance such as blocking off the landing board with leaves, or normally a tightly fit block of wood, a small entrance is left where the defending guard bees can more easily control the income of enemy bees. We always come across problems during the winter when hives run low on nectar, the old hive frames are riddled with holes making it easy for bees to rob. We normally feed hives sugar syrup over winter to limit their need for robbing, but if you leave a glob of honey on the ground you will be swarmed in minutes.</p></div>		</li>
