			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, another &quot;current laws of physics&quot; problem. We will never be able to build something that is ground based and can do that due to the atmosphere here. It would also have to be impossibly large. To put something in space that could do that would similarly be impossible due to just how freaking big the lens would have to be</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree it would be absurdly large in space with current tech. Is there anything in the horizon or theoretically possible within 100 years that would make it possible? </p>
<p>Or is that that tech is either impossible by current physics or just not invented yet? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you... but I have no special knowledge to say we're right so don't get hyped. :)</p>
<p>However; this seems within range of something that would work as an astronomical interferometer.  I know it's hard but, what if we had say 20-50 telescopes, in space, linked by lasers and very,very accurate clocks for positioning.  Spread them out over 100k KM diameter in whatever pattern is optimal and then point them at this planet?</p>
<p>Maybe we don't get 50 Mile radius.. maybe 100 miles (totally making that up).  But, that would be amazing.  Maybe it's blurry because we're doing math that says what it takes to 'perfectly' resolve photons. But we're looking for just a hint of patterns, signs of artificial light, radio waves, maybe chemistry in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>It's bigger than anything we've done in space by far, but, it also seems eminently doable in a 50 year time span.  Let's get cracking! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How many photons from that planet actually hit the telescope.  Maybe 1 or 2 a day?  (Not mathing it just illustrating concept). If we want a 1 mega pixel image and we assume we somehow can map that photon to a planetary position we would still need an exposure of 3000 years to build an image at that rate.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In part because we have almost no details. You get the distance to the star from things like redshift and how much we see it move over long periods of time. From the distance of the star and the amount of light we can see you can get how bright it is, and from its color you can get its temperature. Astronomers know enough that the light from a star can inform its size and age.</p>
<p>For the planet, all we really know is how much light it blocks, and how often it blocks it. How often it blocks it tells us its orbital period (385 days I think?) which tells us how far it is from the star (newtonian gravity if you know the mass of the star). How much light it blocks tells us how big it is. We know where it orbits and we know how big it is.</p>
<p>We don't know anything else. We don't know its mass or density (it's likely to not be a rocky planet given other planets that we've observed around its size, although those planets have sufficiently different environments that we really just don't know). We don't know it's surface temperature (habitable zone is super different than having liquid water). We don't know its atmospheric composition, or if it even has one. etc, etc, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Figuring out size and distance is relatively simple maths involving angles. </p>
<p>You can determine molecular composition of atmosphere by applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy" target="_blank">spectroscopy</a>, if you have taken high school chemistry/chemistry at uni, you would have applied this at a different level, but its the same principles involved.</p>
<p>To determine if it is rocky of gas. Im pretty sure its based on its gravitational influence on the star relative to size of planet. This would give an indication of mass and thus density.</p>
<p>I dont know how they determine star age. But whether its a brown dwarf/blue giant/in this case, a yellow should be immediately obvious</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're ready for the depressing answer, it won't happen in our lifetime, unless there's some super radical discovery that breaks the laws of physics. </p>
<p>As it is, it took New Horizons 9 years to get to Pluto, which is 0.0008 light years away. Space is big. </p>
<p>Personally, I think humans will have killed each other before we get the technology to send someone to the stars</p>
<p>I also want to add that if we could somehow build a powerful and accurate enough transmitter to send a signal here, and we're lucky enough that there is a civilization capable of reciprocating, it would take 1400 years to send and 1400 years to read receive. You and I will be long gone. EM waves move at the speed of light, so this is the fastest method we have for getting there allowed by current physics. </p></div>		</li>
