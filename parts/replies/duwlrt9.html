			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you please explain what maneuvers you were doing that required you to feather the throttle to adjust gears? I’ve only driven in America but I’ve driven in a variety of situations and I can’t think why I wouldn’t just let the car figure out what gear I need to be in based on how hard I was pressing the gas.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to be mean or condescending, I am truly curious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its certainly easier to do a short burst of acceleration in a manual, so you can make a difficult or short-distance high-speed merge.</p>
<p>When you slam the gas on an automatic, there is a noticable delay as the car shifts, and another each time you shift as you accelerate. Those dips in acceleration can throw you off when you are trying to get in. In a manual, you know when those dips are coming because you decide when to shift. </p>
<p>Automatics* often put you in second when you want to be in first, and vice versa. The car can't predict what you are going to do, so its always reacting to your actions, and there is a delay</p>
<p>Sometimes its also nice to shift at a higher rpm to smooth out acceleration, which is also tough in an automatic.</p>
<p>*edit. I originally wrote &quot;manuals&quot;. Typo</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Passing cars or trucks on single lane road without many passing opportunities is one example. Another is slowing down at an intersection with a yield sign (much more common than stop signs in Europe) when the car would stay in 4th gear and get a bit confused upon pressing the accelerator pedal, especially when you needed to accelerate quickly. Another example: speed bumps when you need to slow down from 50kmh (30mph) to 15kmh (10 mph) and accelerate back. </p>
<p>One example when having a clutch pedal helps is parking which involves getting onto a curb/sidewalk (I know, unthinkable in the States), often tight between 2 cars. With a clutch is much easier to control the power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, other than the last issue, it just sounds like you've only tried bad automatics. In most modern autos, downshifts are fast once you hit the gas and need more power, and the cars react much faster to changing conditions (acceleration and braking).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the car. Modern Honda automatics are very well programmed, but certain other cars are just stupid with gear selection. I drove something recently (can't remember what) where I was constantly trying to get the thing to be in the correct gear and it would go back and forth. For whatever reason I've never had a problem with Honda autos.</p></div>		</li>
