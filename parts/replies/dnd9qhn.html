			<div class="markdown"><p>You might actually have woken up partially, seen the time and went back to sleep. Your dreams wouldn't necessarily be broken up due to that. It's not that uncommon that some people can be interacted with during sleep (sleepwalking, responding to speech), so it's not unthinkable that you could read the clock too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had this issue when I would sleep in class. I would start dreaming of everything going on in class. Someone would get up to throw something in the garbage in my dream, I'd wake up and see them doing it for real. I just assumed I was getting some sort of data via hearing or actually opening my eyes a bit while &quot;sleeping&quot; for my dream and the actual world to sort of merge.</p>
<p>Also happens anytime I take a nap in the car. Fall asleep but enough stimuli is going on around me that my dream is based very much on what's going on around me.</p></div>		</li>
