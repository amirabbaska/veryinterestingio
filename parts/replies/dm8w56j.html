It's clear to me that I have little knowledge of this topic. Keep on keeping on! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's basic machine learning. Specifically, it's asking about different ways of doing non-linear regression (or classification which is basically a special case of regression) using neural networks; even more specifically, what function to use to induce nonlinearity in the model, and why we use some (eg ReLU, which is a fancy name for max(0, x), vs tanh(x)) and not others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Replying to you in hopes that none of it gets removed. I can only lightly follow the thread, but I've learned more than I knew before and the conversation has been fascinating -- which is always the #1 thing I want from of my reddit experience, and this sub had kept me informed for the better part of a decade!</p></div>		</li>
