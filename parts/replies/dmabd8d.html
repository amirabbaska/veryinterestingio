			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I kinda figure a lot of our foods can probably be traced back to somebody either stupid or desperate and starving enough to say fuck it and try a bit, and then instead of getting sick as usual, it actually turned out nice. For example, I imagine two iron-age dudes having a conversation along the lines of:</p>
<p>Dude A: &quot;Aw shit! I forgot about that bread dough I made a few days ago and now it's gone all bubbly and weird! </p>
<p>Dude B: &quot;Fuck! That was the last of our wheat in that! What are we gonna do?&quot; </p>
<p>Dude A: &quot;We'll just have to cook it anyway and hope we can keep it down.&quot; </p>
<p><em>later</em></p>
<p>Dude B: &quot;Hey, that weird bubbly bread is amazing! We should do that again!&quot; </p>
<p>Dude A: &quot;Hell yeah! Maybe if I leave it out in the Sun it go even more weird and bubbly.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can imagine the invention of coffee.</p>
<p>Some iron age layabout teen dumps some beans in the fire but they don't burn. So he scoops them out. He can't be bothered to throw them away ( because teen) he puts them in his drinking bowl.</p>
<p>Which then fills with rain water (cos he left it out- see above).</p>
<p>Wakes up thirsty after a late night,  and finds said bowl, shrugs, and drinks the cold brew (because reasons) and discovers the first caffeine rush. :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you get a caffeine rush from them uncooked(they noticed the goats getting all frisky), you can also make a &quot;tea&quot; from them as well. People made &quot;teas&quot; from damn near every fucking thing. All that was left was to roast the beans first to enhance the flavor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Used to do tours for a &quot;chocolate factory&quot;. The pulp of the cocoa bean is actually pretty damn interesting flavor wise. It's sort of like banana flavored. All the cocoa beans need to be good enough to eat is to roast them. Add a little bit of sugar and they're actually damn tasty (in my opinion. I know it's not everyone's cup of cocoa). The pre-European people of Mexico would grind up the cocoa beans and mix them with water and spices to make the first hot cocoa. Not as much processing as you'd imagine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Cocoa pulp is bloody delicious. Used to have a tree on my backyard and it was my favorite fruit back damn. It's sweet and tasty - tasty in it's own way</p>
<p>Never tried roasting the beans though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to tell /u/jtoeman that there are plain chocolate bars that consist entirely of cocoa butter, cocoa liquor and cocoa solids (100% cocoa), while mainstream milk chocolates can contain as little as 10% cocoa or even less if they're white chocolate. They're not bad at all but some people can handle &gt;50% it just an acquired taste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alleluya someone said it. Cococa beans with pulp are extremelly sweet which is the reason people probably started eating them. You don't &quot;eat&quot; them, rather you just suck the pulp then throw the seed. Just doing that basically is 50% of the process of making aztec/mayan chocolate. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Suck seed and throw it to the ground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seed dry up with the sun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ground the seeds.</p>
</li>
<li>Add them to hot water with other spices.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is all you need to make the original chocolate. The problem seems to be that people think chocolate has always been a &quot;solid&quot; treat. </p></div>		</li>

<p>People don't appreciate how much time we've had on our hands, as a species. We've had a damn long time to eat, boil, ferment, roast, and otherwise prepare pretty much everything we've ever come across. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the pleasure of hiking recently where stinging nettle had thoroughly overgrown the trail. It's a brief but acute misery to come in contact with it, though it is edible if cooked.</p>
<p>It was a good time to reflect on how earlier peoples went through rough times if plants like this ended up getting embraced. If nothing else it is plentiful where it grows in season, but damn, someone must have been <em>hungry</em>.</p></div>		</li>
