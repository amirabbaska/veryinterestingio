			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically we pulled support from Taiwan as being the &quot;official China&quot; and acknowledged the mainland PRC who had won the Chinese Civil War after WW2 and pushed the old govt off onto Taiwan where they remain today. This was Nixon &quot;opening China&quot; in an attempt both to harness and tie in their growing economy, and to separate the two major communist powers in the PRC and USSR who had an at times warm and other times cold relationship.</p>
<p>Among other things Taiwan lost the China seat on the UN Security Council and much official diplomatic recognition.</p>
<p>However over the years we have also made sure that if the two reunite it wont be by PRC military efforts, by selling weapons and ships to Taiwan(who call themselves the ROC), doing training with them, and even at points sailing a carrier battle group through the Taiwan straits as a show of intimidation in the 90s. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd just like to say that only the party that brought martial law to Taiwan (KMT) adopted the name Republic of China, whereas the other party (residents of Taiwan before the KMT fled there) really don't like that name.  However, there is political pressure, mostly from China, to forbid Taiwan calling itself Taiwan, so the Republic of China has stuck.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is wrong. The United States <em>acknowledges</em> the &quot;One China&quot; policy but maintains an ambiguous position to avoid conflict and allow for flexibility.</p>
<p>If the United States had <em>adopted</em> China's position, we would not be discussing this, as Taiwan would have be integrated back into the PRC's government.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more complicated than that. Half of the Taiwanese are not on board with One China, slightly less than half are on board. Taiwan is a multiethnic society too and a plurality of them feel like they are not Chinese, while a significant minority still feels Chinese. And there are aboriginals and other nationalities living there as well which don't get as much of a say because they have fewer people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the older folks who fled communist China after wwII and people who do business with China are pro unification. Anyone else I've met here is very anti-china, and if you call them Chinese they'll be pissed. They identify as Taiwanese and want nothing to do with China. They have their democracy and freedoms, and the plan to keep it.</p></div>		</li>
