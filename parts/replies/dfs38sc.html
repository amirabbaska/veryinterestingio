			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a difference between &quot;evolving the ability to get nutrition from a wide variety of sources&quot; and &quot;requiring a wide variety of food that didn't exist 100 years ago.&quot; Humans don't <em>require</em> every kind of food currently available but, being omnivores, we <em>have the ability</em> to eat just about anything that isn't blatantly toxic (and even then there's wiggle room, considering many humans regularly consume the deadly toxin known as alcohol <em>for fun</em>).</p>
<p>To break it down a bit, humans need only a handful of basic nutrients: proteins, carbohydrates, fatty acids, vitamins/minerals, and water. Just because now we have a billion different kinds of foods that have those nutrients doesn't mean those nutrients can <em>only</em> come from those foods.</p>
<p>Barring having some kind of medical problem, your stomach and your metabolism doesn't really care whether the protein you just ate came from an antelope you ran down and killed or from a crop of black beans and rice that you cultivated on a farm. Your body cares about whether you have protein to build muscles, not where the protein came from. Carbohydrates can come from a wild apple or a bag of potato chips; it doesn't matter, just that you have carbs to convert into sugars for energy. The source is irrelevant. Now, certain foods have better <em>quality</em> nutrients - the sugars and carbs from an apple are better quality than the sugars and carbs from a snickers bar, which is why you feel better when you eat more apples than snickers bars - but the nutrients themselves are basically the same. The lack of stone age snickers bars does not equal a lack of stone age sugars and carbs.</p>
<p>Also, a calorie is a calorie; it's a unit of energy, the end. Your body doesn't care much about the source of those calories any more than your computer cares about how the electricity powering it was generated. A watt hour generated by a nuclear plant is the same as a watt hour generated by a solar panel; similarly a calorie from a gummy bear is the same as a calorie from a piece of broccoli.</p>
<p>Evolution is actually the opposite of picky, especially when it comes to humans. Unlike damn near every other animal on the planet, we have the advantage of huge complex brains and opposable thumbs. Habitat too cold? Other animals die or migrate... humans invent clothing and houses and stay right where we are. Prey too fast? Other animals starve or get faster... humans evolve to be so good at sweating and running marathons that we can just jog after nearly any animal until it <em>dies from exhaustion</em>. And so on and so on for millions of years until we have skyscrapers, domestic cows, and powdered doughnuts. But any healthy human today, if they had all the right knowledge, could go out into the wilds and live just fine on the variety of wild foods that have existed since the dawn of the human species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be more specific:</p>
<p>For protein, we only need to eat ~9-15 amino acids, depending on other factors and out bodies can make the rest. We can break down any additional amount or protein for energy (with some negative consequences when it gets to be too much).</p>
<p>For fat, there are some essential fatty acids and many others that are useful in the diet, but our body can produce what we need beyond that if we have enough energy. We can break down just about any kind of fat for energy without negative consequences [too many calories is too many calories, but unlike protein, you can get burn a lot more fat without other negative consequences].</p>
<p>There are a number important of vitamins and minerals, but we can manage with very sporadic trace amounts of most and our bodies will horde them and make due.</p>
<p>For carbohydrates, like fat, our bodies can burn a ton without other negative consequences, but unlike fat, there are no &quot;essential&quot; carbohydrates -- they are &quot;just fuel&quot;. We can survive just fine without any as long as we have enough fuel. The most common health problems with low carbohydrate diets are from <em>too much protein</em>, not from lack of carbohydrates, per se.</p>
<p>One more factor -- <strong>a big one</strong> -- to be considered is fermentation. Before we had all this variety, we also had more fermented food sources -- on purpose or out of necessity. These acted as a preservation technique, but they also often improved nutrition as the microorganisms created vitamins and proteins missing from the food they were growing on.</p>
<p>I don't know, but I suspect that cleanliness is another factor -- even bad microorganisms that made people sick and dirt that we consider of little nutritional value might have added just enough of trace vitamins and minerals....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wanted to add to your statement that we don't have to eat diverse foods. The &quot;Three Sisters&quot; of Native American agriculture provided most of the essential nutrients with just three crops that could all be grown in one patch: corn, beans, and squash. Supplemented with occasional meats and this provided a fairly well-balanced diet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sisters_(agriculture" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sisters_(agriculture</a>)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I heard an overweight girl explaining to some guy she was with that &quot;My metabolism doesn't work like that, so Calories don't actually matter to me&quot; I was so tempted to turn around and exclaim that it was amazing that her body has figured out how to defy the laws of physics, and that she should contact a scientist right away, they would love to study her. </p>
<p>Instead I smirked to myself and thought about how I totally should have said that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main point most people aren't clearing up for you here is this:</p>
<p>Evolution doesn't make choices about what is best. It's about reproduction, and that's it.</p>
<p>If a random change makes reproduction easier, and it is passed on genetically, then it propogates through the species.</p>
<p>As long as humans live long enough to reproduce then evolution is done with them. Most women lose the ability to bare <em>healthy</em> children between 40-50 years old, with ideal breeding ages (from a health standpoint, not a societal one) being late teens through ~30 years old. </p>
<p>As long as we live long enough to get through that period of life then evolution doesn't care about us anymore. We can go die and it has no effect from an evolutionary standpoint.</p>
<p>If all you care about is making it to the 30-40 year old range, you can eat shitty food no problem. So evolution did it's job, because we can live on horrible nutrition long enough to breed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prior to the agricultural revolution humans were hunters and gatherers, meaning food was less stable but FAR more diverse. We needed to be able to eat anything we came across out of survival necessity, so we evolved to eat a wide range of foods.</p>
<p>It wasn't until recently (by evolutionary standards) that humans began limiting their intake to foods that could be farmed. As far as variety in food intake, you could say that modern humans are actually behaving more closely to the way we originally evolved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This guys right.  We ate primarily plants, roots, tubers, etc. were staples.  Hunter gatherers, depending on location, are traditionally about a 70/30 split between plant matter and meat.  A typical hunter gatherer group would stay in a particular spot for a short amount of time until they exhausted most of the easy food, depending on need of course, for a few miles around.  Then they move to a new spot outside of their foraging range and stay there until there isn't easy food.  This means that they might subsist on one particular plant for a little while as a staple, with other little things being thrown in.  Then move to a new area with a slightly different diet/move entire regions if they migrate.  This means that we needed to be able to live on a large variety of food types and this constant moving meant that most diets weren't just one food and people didn't become deficient in things because of variety.  It wasn't until people became sedentary and the agricultural revolution happened that people began subsisting on a few food sources year round and chronic deficiencies became a real problem.  Yes people lived longer, grow bigger, and support a bigger population because of more food but there's times in our history, medieval Europe for example, when the peasants were in worse condition than you would find in a stable hunter gatherer society.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well cared for domesticated dogs and cats eat a much better and more diverse diet than their wild counterparts and they live much longer as a result. </p></div>		</li>
