<p>From an intuition standpoint, the area of a surface is something intuitive and straightforward, but from a <em>foundational</em> standpoint, you're going to want to define multiplication first, and area second, along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The area of a rectangle is the product of the length of the sides.</li>
<li>The area of an arbitrary (bounded) surface is the lower limit of the sum of (finite) sets of disjoint covering rectangles.</li>
</ul></div>		</li>
