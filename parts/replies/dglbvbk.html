			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good info here.  As a programmer, can confirm that people like to use SSN as a unique identifier because it's one of the (if not the only) unique identifiers for a person in the US.</p>
<p>I really wish people would stop using SSN in this fashion because:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of companies store SSN data incorrectly (i.e. in plain text /unencrypted, or poorly encrypted) and this leads to identity theft when that company has a data breach</li>
<li>SSN-based systems fall down when you start having to store data for non-US citizens, which is a fairly common requirement for an IT system</li>
<li>The average person doesn't want to give you their SSN, if you're not my employer, my financial instutition, or the federal government, you really have no business asking for it</li>
