			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question!</p>
<p>Can a wire then be too big to be effective? So, if 14 gauge and 12 gauge are the code standards (US). Would using something like 2 gauge cause problems?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wire heating is the main issue in home wiring, it is what dictates minimum size wiring for given circuit ampacities. The only negatives with using larger wire sizes are the additional costs of the larger wire and the increased difficulty of working with thicker wire. There are also maximum sizes for the various terminals on things like switches, outlets, and breakers, so in your example of 2 gauge wire it would not be possible because it would not fit into the various terminals of fixtures typically used on 15 and 20 amp circuits. </p>
<p>It is, however, considered &quot;above code&quot; to use one size larger wire for 15A outlet circuits. Code requires 14ga, so 12ga is considered better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All wires have a built in resistance. It is usually so low it isn't worried about. Resistance=(resistivity of material * length of cable)/cross section area. The thicker the cable the less resistance (more power if you have a set voltage less power if you have a set current)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the biggest reason I way over wire everything. I even use 2 gauge copper for my inverter bank. Less heat, less resistance, just better. Used house primary wire for trailer running lights too.</p></div>		</li>
