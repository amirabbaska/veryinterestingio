<p>hmm even with the speed of light I wonder how much you would have to lead (or trail, depending on where in the orbit it is) Mars to be on target.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldn't.  Let's say Mars is 20 light minutes away (it changes and I totally made up that number, but you get the point).  That means Mars has moved for 20 minutes worth from what you see, and by the time you light gets there it'll have moved another 20 minutes worth.</p>
<p>The distance Mars moves in 40 minutes is miniscule compared to the distance between the two planets is miniscule.  The angle that gives you is going to be somewhere on the order of a thousandth of a degree if not smaller. </p>
<p>When you consider that your flashlight has a spread of at least a couple degrees you don't have to worry about it at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The easy way to do this calculation is that Mars' orbital speed is ~24km/s, which is about 8.0*10^-5 c.   So if it were moving perpendicular to the beam, you'd have to lead it by arcsin(8.0e-5) ~ 8.0e-5 radians ~ 4.6e-3 degrees ~ 16.5 arcseconds [Ninja edit: times 2, because you're seeing where it was and not where it is.]</p>
<p>Unless you have pretty fancy laser, shining from space (so that there is no atmosphere in the way), you aren't going to be close to that accuracy.  So you don't need to lead Mars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mars moves it's width every 4 minutes 40 seconds, so if Mars is 20 light minutes away you would need to lead by approximately 8.5 Mars widths (4.25 for the delay in apparent position, 4.25 for the delay in transit)</p>
<p>EDIT: It would obviously vary with the distance from Earth, and which part of the orbit Mars is in. This is for the average velocity of 24km/s, but the actual velocity varies from 22.0km/s to 26.5km/s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But wouldn't that mean you only need to move your flashlight by less than an inch? Mars is what, 1/32&quot; wide in the sky, so you'd be having to lead it by about 1/4&quot;, and since your flashlight is probably more than 1/4&quot; wide, you're going to hit some of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they meant in order to ensure your giant spread out photon cone hit the planet or spot you wanted, which is why they said vector. Like watering the planet with light, you don't just water in one spot, wiggle it around some and take your time and you get better coverage. Now, that's probably overkill, but I don't think any of you have a photon detector on Mars to test it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>a perfect aim</p>

<p>This got me thinking - if you point a flashlight at Mars from earth, and rotate it one degree, how far away will the point of impact (point B) on Mars be from point A? Meters? Miles? Will it completely miss the planet now?</p>
<p>I know that the beam of light will disperse a ton, so let's just say this is the absolute center of the beam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would miss Mars.</p>
<p>According to the sine law, for any given triangle in euclidean space, the length of each side divided by the sine of the opposite angle is the same for all three sides of that triangle. In this case we have a triangle with angles of 1 degree, 89.5 degrees and 89.5 degrees. The distance from Earth to Mars is a minimum of about 75 million kilometers (when Mars is directly in opposition). So we have 7.5*10^(7)/sin(89.5°) = ~75002856, then 75002856*sin(1°) = 1308980. Mars is only 6779km in diameter, so we miss Mars by roughly 192 mars-diameters, at a minimum.</p></div>		</li>
