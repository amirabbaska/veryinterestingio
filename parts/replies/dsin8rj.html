			<div class="markdown"><p>Popular Mechanics did a nice article on <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/a27359/how-to-make-plutonium/" target="_blank">how we produce radioactive fuel for satellites</a> in the US. </p>
<p>TL;DR: We don't produce Plutonium-238 like we used to anymore, so Oak Ridge National Laboratory had to recreate the process in a lab setting. They produced about 300 grams last year, gearing up towards eventually make all of 1.5 kg per year.</p></div>		</li>

(Running a reactor can make some atoms that were unsplittable splittable. That is not the same thing as using the radiation from the spent fuel by itself.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>We only have so much &quot;waste&quot; because we don't use breeder reactors.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeder_reactor" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeder_reactor</a></p>
<p>And we don't use breeder reactors mostly because of politics, as the final waste product from breeders is weaponized fission material. The counter argument is breeders make around only 1% of the waste and that waste is only dangerous for a few hundred years instead of a hundred thousand for more (or they can be if built optimally for that purpose).</p>

<p>Thorium is a type of breeder reactor that uses a slightly different process, adding the fuel as you use it instead of all at once in a big pool.</p>

<p>Edit: the breeder reactor citation talks about &quot;burner reactors&quot; but I couldn't quickly find any info on them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Spent nuclear fuel still contains a lot of fissionable material, but it would be much harder to control the reaction when compared to uranium (if you are more interested about this topic, read about &quot;delayed neutrons&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just read about it (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_neutron#Importance_in_nuclear_reactors" target="_blank">Here</a> for the lazy), very interesting.  So that raises a new question... Since there is a lot of fissionable material left but some of that material has a smaller controllable sub-critical margin, would it be possible to refine the usable fissionable material to separate it from the unusable fissionable material?  Or is this not worth it because acquiring fissionable material isn't [comparatively] difficult?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The majority of radioactive waste is not old fuel, it's old parts, powerplant components, maintenance supplies/tools, liquid wastes, absorbents, cleaning agents, filters, resin beads, and other waste that has been exposed to radioactivity, thus making it radioactive. You can't take those things and make a reactor out of them. They're just radioactive enough to cause cancer (possible radiation sickness) but not anywhere near the same solar system of the energy produced by fission.</p></div>		</li>
