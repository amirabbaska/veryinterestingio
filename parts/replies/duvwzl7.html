			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying we start out as &quot;female&quot; implies that we start out with a female reproduction system and other female characteristics, and that every foetus would develop into a female unless something happens. </p>
<p>This is not the case. We develop with neither gender's characteristics. At some point you either develop into a female or a male foetus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the time we start developing primary sex characteristics, we've already got a sort of blank slate structure down below. It's equal parts male and female, and is set to go either way once it starts developing into a boy or a girl. Due to the way cells work, the arrangement of the blank slate structure causes the seam once it's all finished growing into a ballbag </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert here, but don't humans develop female unless Testis-determining factor is present. If a genetic male (XY chromosomes) has faulty genes for TDF then they come out with female sex organs. However, there's no equivalent condition that causes genetic females to get male sex organs. So there is some kind of lean towards the female side during development.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, really?  Then what's going on with women who have internal testes rather than ovaries?  I'm genuinely asking; I don't know much about any of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Woah that throws me for a loop. Do they produce hormones at typical male-level or is it consistent with their outer appearance?</p>
<p>Forgive my ignorance. I'm far from a biology major. </p>
<p>Edit: that actually is a stupid question since they would probably have hormone levels consistent with how their body developed. Feel free to disregard lol</p></div>		</li>
