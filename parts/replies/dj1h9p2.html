			<div class="markdown"><p>For bitcoin there's a thing called the blockchain which contains all the transaction information.</p>
<p>Each block in the blockchain contains transaction data, data referring to the previous block and one of these maths problems. When you solve the block it commits it to the blockchain and validates the transaction data and a new block is created.</p>
<p>It always seemed like a waste of processing power to me though when there's other cryptocurrencies that use the processing power to fold protein structures potentially helping find cures for diseases. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That still doesn't answer the question. </p>
<p>It was stated that those who successfully answer the equation are &quot;rewarded&quot; with bitcoin in the top answer. </p>
<p>Which implies someone is distributing bitcoin and therefore is also responsible for providing the original question. </p>
<p>So <strong>who</strong> is asking the question and for what purpose? </p></div>		</li>

<p>The other guy didn't really answer correctly. The fact is the question stays the same everytime: it is what random number do you need to add to the latest list of transactions to that the hash of the lot has a certain number of 0s at the start. </p>
<p>The transactions are always changing so the asnwer is always changing, but the question remains the same. </p></div>		</li>

<p>When using money, you agree to its rules, for example, you agree that the Federal Reserve has the power to print money when you use the dollar. You agree that no one else has the power to print money, that is called counterfeiting. </p>
<p>Similarly in bitcoin, everything has rules and these rules are designed such that anyone can verify that a person using bitcoin is not cheating the system. </p>
<p>By agreeing in using bitcoin, you also agree that the mining system grants the ability to create these bitcoin out of thin air. Since most people agree with this, that means that freshly made bitcoins are desired by others, therefore currency. </p>
<p>The mining problem is also in the rules.</p>
<p>The purpose of these rules are twofold, 1, to allow for distributed generation of funds based on effort put into the system, and 2, to secure the blockchain, which is what u/<strong>LE<em>MERDE</em></strong> said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not entirely sure tbh as I've not looked into it. From what I've gathered though the transactions are placed into a queue on the mining network whilst waiting to be confirmed and placed into the blockchain. </p>
<p>Certain sites where you can view the blockchain also allow you to see pending transactions like this: <a href="https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions" target="_blank">https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions</a></p></div>		</li>
