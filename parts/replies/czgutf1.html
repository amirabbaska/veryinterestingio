<p>The only alternative would be to somehow frequently &quot;promote&quot; previous threads for rediscovery by new audiences. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>exactly, no one with new and valuable information is going to add more to a post that is more than a day old, let alone 9 months.  That and Reddit doesn't necessarily have the most awesome search options available.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the point of this? Reddit is an ever-changing community platform. Maybe now as this question has been asked again, there are more smarter people around that will give a BETTER answer?</p>
