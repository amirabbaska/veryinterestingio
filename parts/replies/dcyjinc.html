			<div class="markdown"><p>Look, imagine this. </p>
<p>You start out with nothing but energy, okay? Like, let's say photons. I'm talking a fucktonne of photons here, like a universe's worth of energy. </p>
<p>And they're inhomogeneously distributed, and in some regions of space the energy density is high enough that the photons are trapped by their own gravity. E=Mc^2 and all that, at high enough energy densities <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_production" target="_blank">photons start just converting to matter/antimatter and back again</a>, which is part of how we know that photons exert a gravitational pull, apart from the action-reaction principle with gravitational lensing.</p>
<p>So you've got a black hole made of light. There's a word for this, but it's stupid and sounds like a pastry so I don't like using it. That word is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugelblitz_(astrophysics\)" target="_blank">Kugelblitz</a>. </p>
<p>So you've got a bunch of primordial kugelblitzen zooming around your universe. They're probably moving close to light speed, since they're made of light and the energy density in your very early universe was likely to be smoothly-varying. They're probably also spinning at near-extremal velocities. But, massive as these things are, titanic as their gravitational pulls may be, the universe is vast.</p>
<p>And so it is a long, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe#Dark_Ages" target="_blank">dark age</a> before they begin to collide.</p>
<p>And when they do, it's never head-on—they're caught in one another's gravitational fields. Their individual angular momenta—spin, rather than orbital—may kick against one another, or may pull the two together through frame-dragging effects, but in the end they'll spiral in toward one another, gaining angular velocity like the ice dancer pulling in her arms.</p>
<p>Only here, it's as if the act of pulling in her arms sped her up enough for the centrifugal force to tear off her fingertips and fling them away from her body at high speed.</p>
<p>The gravitational pull of the mass remaining at the center slows these flung-off particles to a stop in the radial direction, leaving spiraling trails of gas orbiting tangentially, which coalesces down into stars that ignite in fusion.   </p>
<p>And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you make a galaxy from scratch.</p>
<p>I like it better than the spontaneous baryogenesis thing we've got going on right now, anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so you're suggesting that the reason why the universe is dominated by normal-matter is that a bunch of early black holes ate up all the matter in the universe and then spewed it out again in a slight (random) bias towards normal-matter? Is that allowed?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I tried to get past kugelblitz and then you hit us with this sentence immediately. Had to take a breather before reading the rest! You were right about that word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Learned this today in lecture :D </p>
<p>Adding on more stuff from memory from today. if you have a binary blackhole system with total angular momentum greater than some maximum for the resulting single merged black hole, the extra energy radiates away through gravitational waves fast enough to (always?) prevent the resulting black hole from having an angular momentum greater than its maximum (I don't know if there's a name for the max angular momentum) and thus prevents a black hole with no radius size since more spin corresponds to less of a radius.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a bit of handwaving going on here. We really don't know.</p>
<p>A black hole with an angular momentum above a limit ceases to have an event horizon and becomes a naked singularity.</p>
<p>We don't think this really happens. Naked singularities are usually considered nonphysical (fancy language for &quot;this is far too weird to be real.) Theoretically you could stroll over and poke the singularity with a stick. I suggest a rather long stick - it has a mass of about a billion suns.</p>
<p><a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/feb/27/black-hole-found-spinning-near-the-relativistic-limit" target="_blank">We do know that some supermassive black holes come close to the limit.</a></p>
<p>We simply don't know how systems above the limit would evolve. Radiating the angular momentum away is a pleasing hand-wave, but there's no clear mechanism for it to happen.</p>
<p>It's possible that a naked singularity emerges instead, and we have no idea how that would behave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may not make sense, but I've always wonder if you somehow heated up a black hole, would that be able to cause it to expand and become less dense. Like, if you somehow were able to bring the temperature in a black hole to to the Planck temperature (1.41679 x 10^32 Kelvin), would that have any noticeable effect on it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would it expand if you heat it? Expansion due to heating is a property of materials made of atoms.</p>
<p>A black hole is not made of atoms. The concept of temperature doesn't apply. How would you go about heating it up? Add high-energy photons? That will only add mass.</p></div>		</li>
