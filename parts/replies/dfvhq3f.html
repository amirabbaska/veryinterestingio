			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. A recent case in North Carolina hung on the fact that the Republicans in the State legislature specifically asked for data about where certain racial majorities lived. Their defense was that they drew maps in order to maximize Republican representation, it just so happened that this blunted the voting power of racial minority. This is legal.</p>
<p>The plaintiff showed that they specifically requested the racial data and was able to demonstrate that they used this data in drawing the maps. This is illegal. If they had used data related to voter registration, income, etc., they probably would have gotten away with it.</p></div>		</li>
