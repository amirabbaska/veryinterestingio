			<div class="markdown"><p>All plants (I think) can only &quot;grow from the tips&quot;.  If you completely remove a branch from the tree, it won't &quot;regrow&quot; that branch, it will just focus on growing the others.</p>
<p>If you cut the tree at the trunk, it can't grown anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are dicotyledonous plants and monocotyledonous plants. Generally speaking, monocots have a meristem closer to the plant body than appendages (think grass or corn where the plant grows from within the stem but isn't technically the tip). Dicots grow from the tips (think tomatoes or beans where the seed houses the cotyledon that is eventually pushed above ground and the apical meristem is the &quot;peak&quot; of the plant). This allows you to cut your grass super close to the ground and it'll come back vs cutting your tree close to the ground and the existing stump have new shoots come from the top. </p></div>		</li>
