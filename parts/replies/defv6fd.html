			<div class="markdown"><p>I was excited at the first part that you lost 60 lbs in 4 months because I want to lose that much (286 back to army weight of 220) but then read you're steps. Fuck shit God damn. You are a monster. Great job man, I don't think I could do that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He lost 60 pounds in 4 months. That's like 3.4lbs per week. Most weight loss targets are 1-2 lbs per week.</p>
<p>You could halve what he did and still lose a ton of weight. If you're lazy like me it's so much better to do it slowly and stick to it than to go all out and give up on week 3.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Last time I went all out I lost ~3 lbs a week for a month and then blew it all away when I gave up. Think I kept off half the lbs but basically gave up on doing it when I started smoking again. </p>
<p>I need to get my gym membership back up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment is exactly what I needed. 255 down to 205, but have been stuck at 205 for months. </p>
<p>I hate working out—and I don't want to be the answer—but maybe it's what has to be done.</p>
<p>Thank you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hated working out as well in the beginning. After time I missed it when I didn't get to the gym. Now I yearn for it. I am happier at the gym burning calories (or mountain biking or trail running or whatever) then anything else. Because I see and feel the results I appreciate it. You're down 50 pounds and that is huge. Not sure how much further you have to go but don't lose faith. There were several times where my weight loss paused for 3-4 days but I kept crushing it at the gym and then it would kick back in again. STAY STRONG!!! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weight is diet.  You're stuck because you hit equilibrium with your new diet.  You need even fewer calories now at this lower weight.</p></div>		</li>
