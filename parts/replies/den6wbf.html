			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's what I'm wondering, does the idea of absolute zero describe a purely hypothetical temperature that is literally impossible due to physical laws such as the uncertainty principle, or it <em>is</em> possible but there's weird shit still going on despite the system having no energy?</p>
<p>The above commenter's answer implies the latter, but the former makes more sense to me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well absolute zero <em>temperature</em> is a thing, and you can get reasonably close to it (I remember reading about nanokelvin as an order of magnitude. Zero <em>energy</em> on the other hand is not a thing. Neither is zero <em>movement</em> or <em>momentum</em>.</p>
<p>And yes, negative temperatures also exist, but are not lower energy than zero temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly what it implies, and not only for zero particles but for every other particle and every macro object too.</p></div>		</li>
