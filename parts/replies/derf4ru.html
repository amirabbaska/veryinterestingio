			<div class="markdown"><p>With a thermonuclear weapon talking about efficiency gets a little more complicated. One estimate of the W-76 is that is gets 330 kt out of 4 kg of Pu-239 (which contributes 30 kt), 6 kg of LiD (which contributes 150 kt), and 150 kg of U-238 (which contributes 150 kt). For the primary, that's a 40% efficiency (very high; it is probably boosted), for the fusion secondary, that's 40-50% (depending on what figure you use for LiD â€” 50 kt/kg is standard but I have seen 66 kt/kg cited), but for the final fission stage, that's 8%. If you average those, you get 33% efficiency, that's mostly because the U-238 stage, while contributing to about ~50% of the yield, is pretty low efficiency. </p>
<p>The Fat Man bomb in World War II, by contrast, got 20 kilotons out of 6.2 kg of plutonium, so that's about 18% efficient. Apparently the most efficient pure-fission bombs were in the neighborhood of 50% efficiency. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not generated. Basically, a super low yield nuclear weapon is a controlled fizzle, i.e. supercriticality ends before all potential energy is relased (usually by controlled changing of fissile mass / thermonuclear fuel configuration to one that does not support the reaction any more)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about that time when the screwdriver holding the two halves apart slipped out?  I can't think of the specific incident, but I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.  Didn't that go critical, but pretty much just released radiation? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Slotin accident did go briefly critical; it resulted in some 3 x 10^15 fission events, which corresponds to the energy equivalent of 23 grams of TNT. No explosion at all, just a palpable wave of heat, ionization of the air (the &quot;blue flash&quot;), and a fatal dose of radiation to the experimenter (but not the others in the room, though the closest person to the experimenter did suffer some health effects). (I have written at some length about the accident <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/demon-core-the-strange-death-of-louis-slotin" target="_blank">here</a>, for the curious.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The plutonium pit that killed Daghlian and Slotin was originally nicknamed Rufus, but after the accidents it came to be called the demon core. The pits that killed tens of thousands in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, meanwhile, got no such pejorative monikers. Such is the difference, perhaps, between intended and unintended harm, between the core carefully assembled for the purpose of mass destruction and the core reserved for the realm of experiment.</p>

<p>That was a really interesting thought, thanks for writing this! </p></div>		</li>
