			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a single extra copy of one chromosome - chromosome #21. Normally, you have two copies of each chromosome, but in Down Syndrome, you have three copies of chromosome #21. This is usually a result of a mistake made when the egg is being produced in the ovary. Specifically, this mistake happens when the stem cells in the ovary do not divide up the chromosomes evenly, and one egg ends up with an extra chromosome #21.  When the egg is fertilized, it has its two #21 chromosomes plus the chromosome #21 from the sperm. This gives the fertilized egg its three copies. The same thing can happen with other chromosomes, but it is almost always fatal and results in spontaneous abortion very early on, often before you would even know you are pregnant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the shorter the chromosome, the less likely that an extra copies is fatal. Having an extra (or missing) copy of one of the sex chromosomes is also usually non-fatal. But having extra copies of chromosome 1 usually is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>and generally not as life altering(same life spans), though there are differences and they are also sometimes sterile. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mainly an issue with how the eggs form? From my understanding couldn't sperm cells just as easily produce similar errors in production? Or is it less of a problem due to the sheer number of sperm cells driving down the chances? </p>
<p>Also now that i think of it, i wonder if other chromosome pairs cause similar issues. I've only ever heard of #21 being a problem.</p>
<p>Edit: I really need to read the whole post before posing questions like that last one...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is usually coming from the egg not the sperm. This is because the woman has her eggs from the beginning of her life and therefore the older she gets, the worse eggs she has. Sperm are made more in the spot. You can be trisomies of other chromosomes, in fact 13 and 18 can also live to birth but have more severe anomalies and die early.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides trisomy 21 (three copies of the 21st chromosome), you'll also find several disorders associated with trisomy 13. However, trisomy in any other chromosome is so lethal that the offspring generally dies very early in development, sometimes before the mother even knows she's pregnant. That's why there aren't any living people with, say trisomy 2 - it's so lethal that it causes death instead of a disorder like Down's. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Men are generating new sperm constantly. This allows for replication errors to occur, but the chromosomes themselves usually split correctly and don't have an opportunity to degrade. In women, the eggs are all arrested in prophase 1 at birth. They complete meiosis during ovulation. Over time, the arrested eggs degrade, and chromosome separation abnormalities can occur as the egg attempts to complete meiosis. </p>
<p>Trisomy 13, 18, and 21 are the trisomies that result in living offspring. The rest are presumed to result in miscarriages. This is part of why older women often have trouble conceiving. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it happen more often to the 21st chromosomes than others? Or does this happen to all sets sometimes,  and 21 is one that doesn't kill you? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually there’s a nondisjunction error in meiosis I. Your chromosomes replicate and then get pulled apart to each daughter cell. Sometimes they don’t get pulled apart and one daughter cell gets two copies and one gets none. If this happens in an egg cel then you end up with two copies of 21. </p>
<p>Other ways are unbalanced Robertsonian translocations and metotic mosaicism but those mechanisms are complicated but interesting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay just for completeness unbalanced translocation errors happen when crossing over (a normal process where homologous genes mix and match and provide genetic diversity) end up exchanging entire ends and certain chromosomes are lopsided and crossing over results in the short ends getting lost and making a monster chromosome with two of the same long ends. It just so happens that some of the lopsided chromosomes include 13, 18, and 21 which are the common trisomies. Mosaicism is just when nondisjunction happens but not in germ cells so some cells are normal. Nondisjunction is by far the most common mechanism for trisomy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your cells contain 46 chromosomes, in 23 pairs (that’s where the genetic testing company 23 and me gets their name).</p>
<p>When a sperm or egg (called a gamete) is made the 23 pairs split - one from each pair goes to one gamete, the other goes to a second gamete.</p>
<p>So from 1 cell that had 46 chromosomes you now have 2 with 23 each. These can then combine with another gamete to produce an offspring with 46 chromosomes.</p>
<p>With Downs (and other conditions) the split isn’t perfect - instead of a pair separating into 2 separate gametes both end up staying together. So now instead of 2 gametes with 23 each you have one with 24 and one with 22.</p>
<p>If a gamete with 24 chromosomes is used to produce an offspring when the DNA combines one of the pairs is actually a 3 - called trisomy. Depending on which of the 23 pairs has the trisomy you can have lots of different conditions.</p>
<p>Only one of the parent’s gametes (either sperm or egg) need to be ‘defective’ to lead to this - iirc if you actually had 4 copies of a pair then the embryo is non viable.</p>
<p>It is a chromosomal condition that means that it’s fixed from the instant of conception and isn’t caused by anything during pregnancy. The mothers age, however, does seem to play a role in how likely she is to release a defective egg.</p></div>		</li>
