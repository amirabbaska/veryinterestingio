			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  But the point stands:  you can still use the water flow analogy.  Just say &quot;positive charge flows&quot; instead of &quot;holes flow&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you are changing the density of the material, the total cross section is the same, it's just shorter and wider. So the shorter increases resistance but the wider decreases it by the same amount.</p>
<p>However, the misconception is not about &quot;if you crushed the wire into a super-dense version of itself&quot;, it's &quot;if you put a stack of books on the wire of a lamp, the lamp gets dimmer&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Replacing a wire with a thinner one does increase resistance, so the analogy still works. Wires are made by drawing them through dies. The dies squeeze them. It isn't the water analogy which is wrong in this case, it is the assumption that squeezing a rubber hose is equivalent to squeezing wire. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Right. Which comes along with &quot;electricity in a wire is like water flowing through a hose&quot;. </p>
<p>I understand that there's a bunch of things wrong with the misconception. It's a misconception. I know there's ways to teach it better, or to use the analogy in a way that doesn't bring with it the misconception. I know. But nevertheless the common way of teaching electricity which involves using this analogy apparently ends up with a lot of kids thinking wires are like hoses, as evidenced by how frequently they'll get questions like that wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really matter. Negative charged particles flowing left is the same as positive charged particles flowing right. It's the same current. Electrons themselves are also stupidly slow in DC and in AC they're more or less vibrating and not displacing. Knowing the direction the electrons are flowing doesn't really matter for conventional purposes. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Luckily when you're designing with the components it doesn't matter.</p></div>		</li>
