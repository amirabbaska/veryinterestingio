			<div class="markdown"><p>Same reason that women tend to have much larger breasts than they did a million years ago - sexual selection. Primary and secondary sexual characteristics in humans are much larger than they are in our closest relatives in the animal kingdom because sexual selection has played a much larger role for us than it has for them due to different constraints on successful reproduction for different species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breasts are just fat storage, old humans had large breasts since they needed to  stock energy and now we dont, so now we're presentes with those wonderful ittybittytittys. I doubt you'll ever ser any kind of athlete with boobs of the same size or bigger than yours, physically active people hardly grow breasts unless pregnant</p></div>		</li>
