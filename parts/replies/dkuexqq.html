			<div class="markdown"><p>That is why any cash business is good for money laundering. In 'Breaking Bad' they invested in a car wash. Also the mob traditionally would buy garbage businesses. Since operators got paid by the truck load, It was easy to run the same truck through entrance check in's multiple times to fake whatever multiple times they wanted to record a payment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to spend some of the money to clean it, thats just inevitable. But if you just deposit 8 mil in a bank account people will wonder where you got it. So you spend a mil on a business. Then over the next year or two, every time the business profits 1$ you say it actually profited $2. This way you take money with suspicious origin and make it look like its just profits from a legit place. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What Marty does is take all the drug money and invest it into legitimate business.</p>

<p>Now I know why it isn't suspicious in the TV show, but wouldn't it normally suspicious to invest drug money, like Marty did in the show, in the first place? </p>
<p>That problem aside, I get why the money would appear to be clean for the owner or investor of the business after it got laundered, but how would the money go to the boss of Marty? Just sending him $500,000 would be suspicious, too? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Depends.  Many times, the businesses being used to launder the money know that is what is going on and they specifically structure the business around it.  When he says &quot;invest&quot; he really means &quot;funnel the money through&quot; - you just make it look like your business made a lot more revenue than it actually did, and deposit your dirty money as that revenue.  This makes the money look like it was earned legitimately, or &quot;cleans&quot; it.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Not really - some owners make outrageous salaries.  So long as the business is making money and the money is legit,  the government really doesn't have any say in the salaries of the people employed there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am not from the US, so maybe our laws are different. If I would have $200,000 cash (drug money) and some business that I could invest in (no matter if they know what I want to use them for or not, like the bar in the TV show), then I would still have $200,000 of dirty money that somehow needs to get on the accounts of the business. Surely some agency would be interested where those $200,000 come from?</p>
<p>I know why it's no problem in the TV show, but surely if the money would be dirty for real?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>But the boss of Marty isn't the owner of the bar, he is (I guess) totally unrelated to the bar and I am sure the boss doesn't want his name on the salary list of X businesses that his guys are using to launder money?</p></div>		</li>
