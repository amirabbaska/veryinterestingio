			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer:  Do your research and see.</p>
<p>Long answer:  My son and I did this as a science fair project one year and our results were different.  We researched the fastest way to empty a bottle without introducing air through a tube or a second hole (which is the fastest way).  Results in order of fastest to slowest were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn bottle upside down and allow it to 'chug' to empty,</li>
<li>Swirl to create a vortex,</li>
<li>Shake up and down, and</li>
<li>Pour slowly so that air can always enter as water is pouring out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Try it yourself and see if your results differ -- Science depends on repeating experiments and comparing results.  Also, fluid dynamics is pretty cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This response is extremely valuable to me. While working in a biochem lab, I'd often find myself emptying <a href="http://static.coleparmer.com/large_images/3451425.jpg" target="_blank">bottles</a> and wanting to know the fastest method. My measurement-free conclusion was in line with your results, but I'd often do the vortex because it was so goddamned satisfying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My high school chemistry teacher did this but he bet the student an A in the course, no repercussions if he lost. He used large glass jugs and the swirl method, which we had never seen before. Making the vortex and allowing air to flow in was much faster.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>My buddies filled two empty beer bottles with the green apple Smirnoff after we had been doing it with beer for a while. I beer bonged a almost a 26 of vodka. Thanks guys. </p></div>		</li>

<p>For the fastest pour ever, stick a straw up there, and give it a little blow as you turn the bottle upside-down. That's the fastest way to empty the bottle, ever.</p>

<p>Or puncture the bottom. That way the straw isn't using any precious space the water needs to exit. And you don't risk getting water on your face...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fast way is to give the bottle a little hula hoop action when you pour it out upside down. The cyclone-like effect will blast out the water much faster than the glug-glug way or at an angle. </p>
