			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm familiar with synecdoches as a concept (&quot;I have wheels&quot; = &quot;I have a car&quot;) but is there definitely nothing uniquely morally perceived in the eyes or in that area of the face? Like, in a police lineup of just eyelines would we be unable to distinguish Gandhi from Hitler by their eyes' &quot;warmth&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of fine muscle movement going on around the eyes and eyebrows which relate to how a person feels. </p>
<p>There's also something called microexpressions. People very often mask how they feel to have a more socially acceptable reaction, this is where microexpressions come in, because those are instant and you can't control them.<br />
They are usually minor muscle movements, and they last less than a second, so it can be difficult to have a conscious read on it if you haven't practiced it, but if you're watching they eyes of someone you will likely still pick up on some of it unconsciously. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I read somewhere that this is generally what experienced police officers actually talk about when they are interrogating someone. When they say they know someone's guilty, because they can feel it in their guts, it's just that they've, often subconsciously, have learned to read micro expressions through years of experience. </p></div>		</li>

<p>the hypothesis that human replicas which appear almost, but not exactly, like real human beings elicit feelings of eeriness and revulsion among some observers.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a quiz on the NYT about how well you can read facial expressions and it isolates the eyes. Studies show that women are somewhat better at reading expressions, so as a woman, I can relate to the expression about someone having kind eyes. As others have said, it's hard to hide your true emotions in your eyes, so even if someone has a poker face, if something is off, you can usually hazard a guess by the eyes. Women also share a lot of private looks behind men's backs in situations where we're not in positions of power to speak out. Reading eyes comes in handy for moments like that. </p>
<p>Quiz is at the bottom of this article: <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/well/2013/10/03/well-quiz-the-mind-behind-the-eyes/?referer" target="_blank">https://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/well/2013/10/03/well-quiz-the-mind-behind-the-eyes/?referer</a>=</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's something undisclosed or &quot;extra&quot; about this test that I can't put my finger on: All the female eyes are young hot chicks (most with heavy eye makeup), but the male eyes represent a wide variety of ages and attractiveness. Also the female eyes are more often described as &quot;fantasizing&quot; or &quot;interested&quot; and other appealing &quot;feminine&quot; expressions.</p>
<p>Very weird. 34/36</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>26/36. Not bad, but it felt like I had to study the eyes and rule out answers rather than know the right ones right away. I may have done worse with more choices. Side eye would always be accusatory for me, but not always in the options. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hit or miss. A person's facial structure could look warm and caring or it could look dark and mysterious. Looks aren't everything, and, in this case, they are nothing. </p>
<p>If you were to somehow measure people's ratio of &quot;eye warmth&quot; to humanity, you'd find no trends. </p>
<p>Facial expressions can be long term or short term, however. Someone can maybe look like a killer by having an evil grin and squinted eyes, but he'd probably look normal (as in not looking to kill) if he'd wipe that smirk off his hypothetical face and opened his eyes. </p>
<p>On top of that, our brains are hard wired feel certain ways about facial structures. Like biology coded our brains to love babies. We love how cute they are and almost everything about them. That's no coincidence of nature. That's kinda like nature's way of making us want to love our young. Not just your own (because that brings a whole lot more instincts into it) but others' babies as well. </p>
<p>All in all, you can not always accurately judge a book by its cover, but it can happen. </p></div>		</li>
