			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely someone who's blind could field this. I feel like we'd have heard about it at some point though. </p>
<p>Your eyes are far more complex sets of muscles, lenses and methods of digesting information. I suspect that's got more to do with it.</p>
<p>Your ears are more &quot;simple&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of a side note but have you heard of the 20/20/20 rule? It's said that if you're on the computer for long stretches at a time take a break every 20 minutes staring 20 feet away for 20 seconds. It's actually a great way to ease tension on the eyes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been going to eye therapy for a few months now and it is amazing how much work the muscles that control your eyes and the the eyes themselves do. They're constantly adjusting to light, moving to what you want to see, and converging/diverging so you can see things at different distances. You don't really notice how easy that all is until it stops being easy because of a medical problem or, in more likely cases, you become tired. As they rely heavily on muscles to work if you don't take care of them and overuse them they can become fatigued easily and, in my case, start to hurt like Hell which contributes further to fatigue and headaches (which make everything even worse). Having our eyes stare at a screen for an extended period of time can worsen fatigue much like holding a weight for a long period of time would hurt and tire your arm. They need breaks from looking at one distance and type of light for an extended period of time. Without a break they get sore and weak which makes them lose focus so you might see double vision, get sore eyes, or start feeling tired, at which point they are long past the point of needing rest. Taking a break like looking at something in the distance for a few minutes or shutting your eyes for a little bit can give them some much needed R&amp;R. If your eyes have trouble focusing that should help at least a little.</p>
<p>TLDR your eyes are controlled by muscles that are constantly working hard, even harder if you have eye conditions, and get weak/tired without breaks. Rest your eyes occasionally to combat fatigue and loss of focus.</p></div>		</li>
