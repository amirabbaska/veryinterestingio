			<div class="markdown"><p>Gold's configuration of electrons do not easily lend themselves to forming bonds with other materials.  Their configuration is just not &quot;compatible&quot; with many other atoms, and they most commonly bond with other gold atoms.  (Please remember this is an ELI5 version of it.  Don't repeat this to your physics professor.)  That said, gold DOES make oxides, it just does so less easily than something like iron. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gold's naively expected electron configuration is [Xe] 4f14 5d9 6s2, but elements with d4 or d9 electron configurations often borrow an electron from the valence s orbital to make a half filled or completely filled d block, ie d5 or d10. So gold's actual electron configuration is [Xe] 4f14 5d10 6s1. Now the nucleus of gold is so heavy that relativistic effects cause the 6s orbital (among others) to contract, making it less available for bonding. Finally, it's generally energetically unfavorable both (1) for gold atoms to dissociate from other gold atoms in, say, a bar of gold, and (2) for those gold atoms to then bond with other types of atoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a similar reason that the noble gases (neon, helium, etc.) are generally non-reactive: the outer electron shell is full (not necessarily the case for gold. Been a while since I studied chemistry). Therefore it isn't willing to take in or lose any electrons. </p>
<p>Then on the other side of the periodic table you have highly reactive materials like lithium and cesium. Their outer electron shells are populated in a way that they can happily take in or give away electrons in many various amounts, so lots of things react with them and many things react quickly and violently with them. </p>
<p>TLDR: Everything wants to be stable. If that means giving or taking electrons to reach stability then it will do that. Gold is pretty happy with its electron configuration. </p>
