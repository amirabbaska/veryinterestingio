			<div class="markdown"><p>Jumping on to this. Some fruits are evolutionary ghosts. Like an avocado for example or papayas. The large mammals that used to eat them are now extinct. The ginkgo tree is also that way. Have any modern mammal in central America try to eat an avocado whole and it would probably choke them. But giant ground sloths and woolly rhinoceros could eat them no problem. Maybe this is the same case with a pineapple.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A guy walks into a bar with his pet monkey. He orders a drink, and while he's drinking, the monkey jumps all over the place, eating everything behind the bar. Then the monkey jumps on to the pool table and swallows a billiard ball.</p>
<p>The bartender screams at the guy, &quot;Your monkey just ate the cue ball off my pool table -- whole!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry,&quot; replied the guy. &quot;He eats everything in sight, the little bastard. I'll pay for everything.&quot;</p>
<p>The man finishes his drink, pays and leaves.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, he's in the bar with his pet monkey, again. He orders a drink, and the monkey starts running around the bar. The monkey finds a maraschino cherry on the bar. He grabs it, sticks it up his ass, pulls it out and eats it.</p>
<p>The bartender is disgusted. &quot;Did you see what your monkey did now?&quot; he asks.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; replies the guy. &quot;He still eats everything in sight, but ever since he swallowed that cue ball, he measures stuff first.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe in eating genetically enhanced fruits/vegetables. That's why I stick with mostly inedible, all natural plant strains. </p>
<p>Also I can't stand dogs. If I want a pet I go out and find a wolf and slaughter it so I can steal its babies. Then I kill the ones that try to eat me and raise the ones that are more docile. It's more natural.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not technically true though. Using the top of the pineapple is a type of propagation technique that uses a cutting of the plant to grow a new one from the original. A seed would normally have different genetics </p></div>		</li>
