			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy moly, as someone who works with fiber optics here on the ground (with a little background with office WiFi deployment) that is practically magic. Optical transceivers give up after like 5dB loss, especially in high speed (100Gb/s) applications, I wish I had satellite's error margins!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point, I realise now that in my comment I'm comparing apples to oranges kinda, since the margins are more about SNR than transmitted versus received power like you were talking about. But now I'm even more impressed, honestly. I remember being surprised that wireless APs only used a few milliwatts to transmit around offices, but picowatts per square meter is something else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked for a company that supplied the terminals for a major US Army Public Affairs program, supporting the conflicts in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Pretty much any video you saw coming out of those conflicts came out over terminals that I touched at one point and/or trained the PAOs operating them. </p></div>		</li>
