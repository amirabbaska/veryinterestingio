			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I didn't want to really go into the weeds here and it's a bit of an over simplification sure. But bridges and routers both do the same thing. Connect networks or segments together. As you said bridges create seperate collision domains but they create a single broadcast domain.  Routers on the other hand create a seperate broadcast domains. Basically bridges connect networks together at layer 2 and routers at layer3.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some routers do have the ability to prioritize certain traffic over others which can help in those Instances. Look for routers that say they do QoS or have a game mode. Those modes can help with congestion but your milage may vary</p></div>		</li>
