			<div class="markdown"><p>Apollo astronauts did have life insurance. The Apollo 11 astronauts each had a $50,000 life policy, underwritten by Travelers. I have seen the signature sheet. That said, you are directionally correct that the astronauts also signed &quot;first day covers&quot; for their families. The last time I looked, they usually sold for a few thousand dollars each.</p></div>		</li>
