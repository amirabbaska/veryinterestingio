			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll give you points for creativity, but that's really funny from a spacecraft engineering standpoint. </p>
<p>Imagine the requirements:</p>
<p>PROP-123: The spacecraft and all subsystems shall be tolerant to a rapid deceleration of &gt;21km/s. </p>
<p>HARP-1: The harpooning system shall accurately target a 40m object with a translational speed of 21km/s. (Rationale: it's just like bulls eyeing womprats back home)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>26 thousand meters per second is ALOT of Delta V.  New Horizons is the fastest spacecraft ever made and it still lacks an extra 10K DeltaV</p>
<p>For sample return, you would probably need at least a ballpark of twice the DV of New Horizons. Thats a whole lot of ifs and buts. And it also assumes we could get our butts moving and build a mission somehow doing it with existing comsat electric propulsion busses and be able to move launches around to get it up in time.</p></div>		</li>
