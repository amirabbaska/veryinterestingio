			<div class="markdown"><p>The first answer is a definite maybe.  It's just too big and has too many factors in play.  While the thermohaline circulation may very well stop, it could be replaced by something else or other factors may just play a greater role.  </p>
<p>As for what the oceans would look like if they stopped... bad.  A huge number of aquatic species rely on the upswelling of nutrients in the arctic regions, many of these (like almost all whales and most orca's) would go extinct.  Europe may be hit the hardest, every one will suddenly learn that France is as far north as Montreal and Dublin is just south of Moscow</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the marine life. Ocean currents disperse energy across the globe. Without it, you might see increased heating at the equator not only of the ocean but the atmosphere as well. Vice versa great cooling at the poles and atmospheric instability between them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Those lattitudes would have to be warm enough by the time all the ice is completely gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tempering of the climate of western Europe is caused also by the wind crossing the ocean. We see the same tempering happen when we compare western Canada/Usa and East Asia/Russia, since in the northern hemisphere the bulk wind direction is from West to East. </p></div>		</li>
