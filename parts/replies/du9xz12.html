<p>So the question for blood donation is, &quot;Are you a male who has had anal sex, even once, with another man?&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, here in MD, the question is &quot;If you are male, have you ever had sexual contact with another man, even once&quot; where sexual contact is earlier defined as any of PIV, anal or oral sex. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That used to be the question (technically, have you had sexual contact with another man since 1977?).  Now (for like 10 years or so) it's have you had sex with a man in the past year.</p>
<p>At least this is donating blood in California and Oregon. Not sure if things differ over the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does differ.</p>
<p>Up until a few years ago in Texas it was the &quot;since 1977&quot; version.</p>
<p>The FDA updated their suggestion from &quot;Since 1977&quot;  to just the past year a couple of years ago.  I'm assuming most states would adjust their blood donation rules to be in line with FDA guidelines, but it might take awhile.</p>
<p>I can't donate blood anymore, so I don't know if Texas has changed their questionnaire recently.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So then why not just ask if you've had intercourse with another dude in the past two or three months? If you caught the HIV four months ago, it should be detectable. Nearly zero risk, and opens up a wider swath of potential donors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HIV and Hepatitis tests are not 100% accurate, even after the first few months. So if they can weed out a population that has a disproportionate HIV rate, it's safest to do so. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the UK makes you wait 3 months before donating blood.</p>
<p>The current US FDA suggestions is a 1 year wait, which puts it in line with the suggested waiting period for other possibly risky behavior (piercings, tattoos, transfusions, etc).</p>
<p>I'm really not sure why they have a 1 year wait though.  Screening technology has really improved over the years.</p></div>		</li>
