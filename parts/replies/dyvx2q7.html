			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine it could be crazy expensive for data retention and public record keeping laws however would the cost be worth the lives potentially kept out of prison for crimes they aren't really guilty of?</p>
<p>If there's a body cam that could have captured the evidence but didn't for whatever reason, who is held liable for that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ask yourself. It can be done if a city of about 90,000 gets several millions dollars extra a year (in taxes). There literally isnt a tax base for it,  anywhere. It would be like requesting each child in school to have a Rolex. Theres just not that much money. It requires personnel  and huge corporate like servers, and even then The amount would be too large to manage. You just cant record everything constantly.</p>
<p>As for it keeping people out of prison- it doesnt do that a whole lot. Most of the time it just corroborates the officers story. Not to say they arent useful, but they dont work the type of life saving magic you think</p>
<p>As far for liability- the officer will have to explain himself if he turned off a camera mid event, and would be subject to discpline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, schools have been requesting (successfully in most cases) that each child get a laptop or ipad for learning purposes. I think the issue here is as a society we have to want for change to happen to actually make it happen.  </p>
<p>The federal government spends far too much on data collection as it is, and yet we can't seem to have them instead collect data that might be vital in the event of government officials committing brutal acts against its people. You are correct, in most cases, the bodycam footage should match the events recorded in official records and testimony. But in the event it doesn't, it can save taxpayers money in the long term of avoiding lawsuits and large settlements if things go wrong. Either way we're paying for it. Why not invest in preventative measures rather than settling suits when bodies are already in the ground?</p>
<p>I'm not going to respond to your discipline comment, intentionally. </p></div>		</li>
