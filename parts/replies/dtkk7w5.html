			<div class="markdown"><p>Testicular cancer and biliary cancers are pretty much the only ones you have to worry about seeding. Assuming the stimulated T cells sought out and destroyed metastases, I would think this would be less of a problem. I'll have to read /u/Seraphenrir's paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Osteosarcoma, and really a variety of other cancers, also open up channels for self seeding when/if IL-6 and IL-8 is expressed which can cause tumor migration after resection thru almost any unavoidably damaged vascular pathways that are exposed (and usually end up in tumor cells trafficked to the lung). Starting to realize this is a bigger problem than we believed.. </p></div>		</li>
