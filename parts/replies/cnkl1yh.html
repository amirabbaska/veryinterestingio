			<div class="markdown"><p>For some context, the above is a picture of <a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141202.html" target="_blank">the Homunculus Nebeula</a>, not a supernova.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How did the Eta Carinae star system create this unusual expanding nebula? No one knows for sure. About 170 years ago, the southern star system Eta Carinae (Eta Car) mysteriously became the second brightest star system in the night sky. Twenty years later, after ejecting more mass than our Sun, Eta Car unexpectedly faded. Somehow, this outburst appears to have created the Homunculus Nebula. The three-frame video features images of the nebula taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995, 2001, and 2008. The Homunculus nebula's center is lit by light from a bright central star, while the surrounding regions are expanding lobes of gas laced with filaments of dark dust. Jets bisect the lobes emanating from the central stars. Expanding debris includes streaming whiskers and bow shocks caused by collisions with previously existing material. Eta Car still undergoes unexpected outbursts, and its high mass and volatility make it a candidate to explode in a spectacular supernova sometime in the next few million years.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We would be able to tell. The color of stars is fairly easy to predict from basic principles based on their gas content and temperature. If we were in a nebula we would be able to observe a uniform tint of observable stars due to the gas between us and them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That reminds me of a great Chemistry teacher I had back in college. When talking about significant figures, he said the sun at it's core is 27 million degrees.</p>
<p>A student asked &quot;Fahrenheit or Celsius?&quot;</p>
<p>And he yelled back, &quot;IT DOESN'T MATTER.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, sooner than that, Betelgeuse (pronounced &quot;beetle juice&quot;) is due to explode within the next 1,000,000-100,000 years. It's so close to Earth that the explosion will be the second brightest thing in the sky next to our sun. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I wrote an issue about Eta Carinae. </p>
<p>In truth, this is not a supernova but Eta Car is the best candidate we have to become one some day. It is really massive, and really close (but not too close to outburst us).</p>
<p>TL;DR : This is not a supernova, it's a complex explosion due to a likely two-star system (and there have been likely at least 3 explosions here).
But a supernova might happen in the really really near future (can be any moment or in 10 years).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are the lobes and jets caused by the fact of there being two stars involved, or is something else going on?  Is it possible for a single star to explode and create multiple lobes of gas?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What created the lobes and jets is still &quot;unknown&quot;, as we can't directly access the inner stars because of the huge cloud of gas.
But the theory is that when both stars are at their periastron (their closest approch), the interaction between their winds and masses disturb the larger star. This stars then seems to &quot;eject&quot; its superior layer. That would explain the shape of the lobes.
The jets are explained mainly because of the other star interaction (but remember we don't see it, in fact its the jets that showed the existence of the other star).</p>
<p>As for the homunculus, there are in fact 3. The biggest is caused by the 1842 explosion, there is also a smaller one due to a smaller explosion in 1870. And another that could have happenned thousand of years ago, there are some remains still visible.</p>
<p>I don't know any example of a star that would &quot;explode&quot; and survive alone, but who knows ?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So when astronomers talk about stuff like this, are they saying &quot;10 years&quot; as in &quot;10 years from our perspective&quot;, or &quot;10 years, <strong><em>plus</em></strong> the amount of time it would take for the light to reach our eyes&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They talk about &quot;10 years from our perspective&quot;.
But you're right, it's always a problem as an astro journalist to talk about years, as these events might have already happened but we can't know it yet because light is still on its way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, we say it all the time, what does it mean? We use it to mean something got broken, destroyed, ended, demolished. I have a 3 year old so I use it a lot...</p>
<p>I looked it up:
kaput
/kæˈpʊt/
adjective
1.
(postpositive) ( informal) ruined, broken, or not functioning
Word Origin
C20: from German kaputt done for, from French être capot to have made no tricks (literally: to be hoodwinked), from capot hooded cloak</p></div>		</li>
