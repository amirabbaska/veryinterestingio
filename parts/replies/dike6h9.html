			<div class="markdown"><p>After a made basket the ref does not need to touch the ball and if it gets tossed to the ref for some reason they will look to toss it immediately to the inbounding player... essentially the ball is live.</p>
<p>If the ball goes out of bounds, the ball is dead and the ref will only give the ball to the inbounding player when the ref decides everyone is ready.</p></div>		</li>
