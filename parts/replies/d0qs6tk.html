<p>they discovered they needed about 3 times more powerful lasers</p>

<p>That's not entirely accurate. The main problems NIF runs into are the same ones physicists were pointing out at it's inception and that is the problem of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. The paper published not so long ago by Hurricane et al where they used a &quot;high foot&quot; to puff up the capsule and smooth out imperfections helped to clamp down on the instabilities and brought the experiments to within a factor of 2 on the rho-R, Lawson criterion for ignition. The result was that the energy produced by the fusion reaction in the capsule was more than the energy dumped into the capsule. This is not break-even yet since there are significant losses all along the chain from producing the laser up to the final optic before the capsule.</p>

<p>As far as laser energy goes, NIF is actually capable of putting out a lot more laser energy than it currently uses on experiments. The problem isn't with the laser energy but rather the damage threshold of the optics used to transport the beam to the target chamber (and possibly some optics earlier on in the chain).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's... not really true. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory" target="_blank">Lawrence-Livermore National Lab (where NIF is located)</a> started as a bomb lab. But NIF was founded with the direct goal of fusion power. <a href="http://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/658936" target="_blank">Here's a technical report describing the history.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I meant NIF was focused on bombs not LLNL. The pdf you linked mentions power as Teller's motivation for research at the beginning but then goes on to talk about bomb research the whole time. It's well known that the conditions at NIF are made to replicate what happens in fusion bombs since we don't test anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funding got cut in 2012 makes it sound like they're closed. I would say it got reduced, and actually I believe they're shooting at a faster rep rate than ever (about 1 shot a day). Part of the problem is that the platform is very difficult to adapt, the lasers are in their positions for shooting at hohlraums and that isn't going to change, which reduces the number of experiments you could possibly field. Since the lasers are spatially confined to a certain configuration it means that the biggest knob they can tweak is pulse shaping, which is what they're doing now</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding was the focus was moving back towards bombs and materials research and away from fusion power? In other words, the knob they're tweaking is the target pellet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding of what's going on is that there's two funding sources with proportional time on NIF, the bomb side has been doing their thing and the fusion energy people have been doing theirs. Funding wise, the fusion money hasn't so much as gone away as changed objectives, now with trying to understand the underlaying physics rather than trying to achieve ignition right away. There's also discovery science campaigns (astrophysics and other topics), which while being a small amount, are increasing almost every year.</p>
<p>You can find the actual numbers of NIF usage <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/content/assets/docs/nif-workshops/user-group-2016/NUG16_mark_hermann.pdf" target="_blank">here in this presentation at the last users meeting</a></p></div>		</li>
