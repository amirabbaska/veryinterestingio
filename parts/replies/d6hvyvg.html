<p>Fun Fact: Nietzsche was not a nihilist. He was exceedingly pro-living. This often gets overlooked due to his often quoted line &quot;God is dead&quot;, which many people then assume to mean &quot;life is meaningless&quot;. But Nietzsche, on the contrary, urges people to live full and ambitious lives, and to constantly overcome their weaknesses.</p>

<p>This is the uber-comment. I never understood how people thought Nietzsche was a nihilst. Any of his stuff I've read is all about being awesome and kicking ass. </p></div>		</li>
