			<div class="markdown"><p>I was literally writing this,  my 7yr old is on the heavier side though she's short,  even though she's active,  eats healthy etc.  Drs told me due to her weight,  she's at risk of early onset puberty and may need to have blockers ad it can cause rapid growth which well impact her bones (something to do with how she'll stay at a short height,  i can't quite recall)  we're waiting to see what happens as she hasn't started yet.  </p>
<p>On the other hand,  my son who is 10 no sign of puberty,  he's on the shorter and lighter side of the scale , so may be a while off yet and they both eat and do the same things ... metabolism is so different </p>
<p>(be interesting of they both go through it at the same time )</p></div>		</li>
