<p>Notice that for volume, for a fixed increase in radius, the resulting increase in volume grows much faster than for surface area.</p>

<p>Which leads to a great brain teaser for kids and a way of learning to think through a problem with givens rather than formulas. &quot;If you have two identical buckets full of water, and in one you drill a single 2-inch radius hole, and the other you drill two 1-inch radius holes, which bucket drains faster?&quot;</p>
<p>Thinking linearly, 2&quot; = 1&quot; *2, so they would be the 'same'. But even simple reasoning shows this isn't the case: both 1&quot; holes would fit inside the 2&quot; hole with room to spare 'above' and 'below' where the two smaller holes touch in the middle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all very relevant for pizza sizes too.  Thinking linearly, going from an 8 inch personal pan pizza to a 24 inch XXL monstrosity seemingly triples the pizza.  In actuality though, you get nine times as much pizza.  I'm surprised a national pizza chain hasn't started advertising the area of its larger pies (rather than the diamater) using a clever ad campaign somehow making a pi/pie pun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My kids asked about that a couple weeks ago...  &quot;Why is the small pizza 10&quot; and the large 14&quot;?  Doesn't seem like that much of a difference.&quot;  But once I explained that they'd get an extra 2&quot; added to the widest end of each slice it suddenly seemed like a big difference.   </p></div>		</li>

<p>Because people don't want to bother doing the math or even having it explained to them. <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/76144/why-no-one-wanted-aws-third-pound-burger" target="_blank">This article</a> explains why A&amp;W's 1/3 burger didn't do as well as McDonald's 1/4 burger because people thought it was smaller (3 is less than 4, duh!). Good luck trying to explain A=Ï€r2 to the masses.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The 2&quot; hole drains all the red area AND the green area. The two 1&quot; holes only drain the red area, so half as much flow as the one larger circle. (Half as much because (one 2-inch hole)/(two 1-inch holes) = (pi*2\^2)/(2*pi*1\^2) = 4pi/2pi = 2.)</p>
<p>Even without the formula, the two 1&quot; circles &quot;fit inside&quot; the one bigger circle, with plenty of room to spare, which means the 2&quot; circle will drain more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incidentally, this relates really well to F-stops in camera lenses.  As someone who often teaches photography, explaining to people that twice as much light can 'pour' through an aperture opening that is roughly 1.4x larger (and not 2x) is a difficult concept to get across to the layperson.  But this is why full f-stops are numbered 1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two inch radius hole has an area of pi*2*2, aka 12.57 square inches</p>
<p>Each one inch radius hole has an area of  pi*1*1, aka 3.14.  There are two of them, so the total cross section is 2*3.14, aka 6.28</p>
<p>Because it has a cross-sectional area twice that of both one inch holes combined, water is going to come out of the 2 inch hole much faster than the 1 inch holes</p>
<p>EDIT: sorry for the confusion folks, forgot that * was a formatting character</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Side note, this is exactly why things that cause vasoconstriction are such a big deal for health - for example smoking and stress. Even just a tiny amount of relative vasoconstriction increases the pressure within the arteries and forces the heart to worker harder to get the blood out.</p></div>		</li>
