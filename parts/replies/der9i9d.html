<p>Although I'd love to hear about the theoretical possibilities, I believe current R&amp;D on this is limited due to nuclear arms treaties.</p>

<p>It's also that strategists have realized that tactical nuclear weapons are extremely dangerous to have on the battlefield. Almost by definition, you're putting the authority for deployment into the hands of your forward troops. The trouble is that the use of a nuclear warhead on the battlefield is most likely going to escalate into a full on strategic nuclear exchange, and, well, that's bad.</p></div>		</li>

Also, the last Reacher novel, <em>Night School,</em>  and makes you question the premise of <em>The Peacemaker</em> film.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one view. A couple of months ago I went to a panel discussion about tactical nuclear weapons. Two of the four speakers were opposed for various reasons. The other two favored the US developing more tactical options.</p>
<p>The main argument they made is that if (say) Russia and NATO get into a skirmish over the Baltic states, and things start to go poorly for Russia, one option on the table for them would be to use tactical NWs. The intent would be to get the US to back off due to unwillingness to escalate to strategic weapons and lack of good, more measured options. But if the US did have more tactical options, Russia would be less likely to try to call the US's bluff in that way, and ultimately less likely to get into a fight to begin with.</p>
<p>So, while I think it's true that there's not a lot of appetite for developing more tactical options among decision makers who count, that's not necessarily the consensus view in the strategy community as a whole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've sort of looked at it as the same kind of reasoning why CS Gas (Teargas) is prohibited by the chemical weapons conventions. It's not that CS gas itself is all that toxic, it's that when you see it drifting across the battlefield you don't initially know whether it's CS or Sarin or VX. In the fog of war, it's easy to make mistakes that can have drastic consequences when you don't have all the information.</p></div>		</li>
