			<div class="markdown"><p>My cognitive science professor at UCSD (Lera Boroditski,  renowned in the field of linguistics and cognitive analysis)  preformed the research on the aboriginal tribe in Australia that used location as a basis within their language. Instead of how are you doing today, they would ask &quot;in which direction are you going today&quot; to achieve the same effect. The necessity for knowing direction in their speech patterns meant that they always had a consistent awareness of where they were location wise relative to the landmarks or cardinal directions that they used. An interesting byproduct of this was that they had an intrinsic trust of their own ability to know where they were. She had taken some of them on their first airplane flight to Sydney and when they left one of them remarked that they thought that Sydney was odd - it was the only place they knew where the sun set in the east and rose in the west. They had gotten turned around while on the plane but still trusted the cardinal  directions they had chosen over utilizing the location of the sun. Absolutely fascinating. </p>
<p>Here is a speech where she relives this story, but also talks about other instances where language influences thought if you are interested. <a href="http://longnow.org/seminars/02010/oct/26/how-language-shapes-thought/" target="_blank">http://longnow.org/seminars/02010/oct/26/how-language-shapes-thought/</a></p>
<p>Edit : Australia had autocorrected to Africa, not the same haha fixed it (at least it wasn't austria) </p></div>		</li>

<p>Being a linguist I feel like I must state that much of her work is heavily contested/debated among cognitive linguists. Especially her somewhat extreme conclusions that lean very heavily towards the even more disputed Whorfian hypothesis (aka. the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, aka. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_determinism" target="_blank">linguistic determinism</a>).</p>
<p>Having read much of her work on the conceptualization of time in the Pormpuraaw language, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuuk_Thaayorre_language" target="_blank">Kuuk Thaayorre</a> (Pama-Nyungan), it seems to me that she's very quick to discard alternative (and less sensational) explanations for her findings. The data she's published is far from conclusive — and she even admits so herself — but it hasn't stopped her from drawing very sharp conclusions and publishing them as pop-sci in numerous places.</p>
<p>I'll be happy to share a critique I wrote (as an exam paper in a sociolinguistics course) back in 2011 of her original journal article^[1] on the Pormpuraaw people to anyone that sends me a PM.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your assessment of Boroditski is pretty much identical to my opinion of Emile Durkheim (Elementary Forms of Religious Life), who also extensively studied Australian aboriginal culture and came away some ... challenging ... conclusions biased frequently by his own personal beliefs.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indigenous Australians' knowledge of land and their ability to navigate is so damn fascinating, and so integral to their culture. I remember reading a book about songlines, and how they're used for navigation, knowledge of plant and animal species, art, language and interaction between different groups. Blew me away, really. I'll try to find the book in case anyone else is interested!</p>
<p>Edit: the book was The Songlines, by Bruce Chatwin</p></div>		</li>

<p>Any chance that the source of their confusion was due to them being in the southern hemisphere for the first time? Video in the link doesn't work, btw.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because it does not. The sun still rises in the east and sets in the west down under.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I'm a living example of what you just said.
I was raised with North, South etc and I can't help but always know where I am. It's like I can see a google map on top of wherever I am since I was little, also at night.
I have friends with the worst sense of direction, and it always amazes me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To me, directional awareness is more than knowing what direction I am facing. To me it is, from where i am now, which way do I need to go to get to where I want to be? For example, I do a lot of hunting and often will be far away from the vehicle, walking over varied terrain in unfamiliar areas. Finding my way back to the vehicle or to a location we are supposed to meet is very important. So I am answering your question with that thought in mind. Have your kids lead you to the car when you come out of a store or something similar.  While in the store, ask them if they know which way the car is from where you are now. Ideally, you know this too so can tell if they are correct. In addition, you can work on distance. How far away is the car? Being able to know where you are in relation to the car even if you approach it from a different location is a helpful skill imo. It has helped me when traveling around the city. I can develop my own alternate routes because I know where my destination is without going a known way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get around in new cities via &quot;walk in the approximate direction and hope you get there&quot;. Works a surprising amount of the time, and we always have GPS trackers on us anyway so it's pretty difficult to actually get lost. Haven't gotten lost enough to actually need my phone to bail me out, yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, due to human brain plasticity a better sense of direction, if not already there, can also be aquired at a later point in life. I remember reading an older <a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/04/esp/" target="_blank">pop-sci article on Wired</a> about an experiment where a participant wore a belt embedded with vibrating motors telling him at all times where North was, and how after a few weeks his spatial awareness changed and improved. Fascinating if you think about the implications for our brain to get used to and make use of new, artificial sensory input.<br />
