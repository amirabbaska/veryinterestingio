			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Valence-bond theory is a working approximation that can predict some but not all molecular geometries but not a whole lot else (e.g. MO explains aromaticity, conjugated bond systems, inorganic complexes with &gt; 8 valence electrons, boron allotropes, kinetic effects of substitution in SN2 reactions). But the theory itself is wrong or incomplete: covalent bonds do not form discretely between overlapping atomic orbitals with nonbonding electrons smushing them off to one side. In most polyatomic molecules, the bonding orbitals span across the entire molecule, and the symmetry of the molecule’s geometry determines the types of bonding that can occur between atomic orbitals.  </p>
<p>Valence bond theory is to MO theory what Newtonian physics is to relativity: accurate and useful within certain limits, but fundamentally untrue. </p>
<p>But yes, the orbitals supply the probability of finding an electron in a location. If psi is the wavefunction, then | psi^2 (x,t)| is the probability that the electron exists at x at time t. That’s from the postulates of quantum mechanics, though, not valence bond theory or MO theory. </p></div>		</li>

It stands for valence shell electron pair repulsion theory</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>VESPR relates to the structure of a molecule based on accessory lone pairs, such as an sp3 quaternary carbon having bond angles of 109.5, whereas an oxygen with 2 lone pairs will have less than 120 degree bonds on the opposing side. MO theory relates more closely with electron pairing (s,p,d,f) and valence shell theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an overlapping subject, whose contents might be taught in either a quantum mechanics course in a physics department or in a physical chemistry course (I think) in a chemistry department. The basic notion of the mixing of energy levels due to interactions is very fundamental in quantum physics, and needs to be understood by any physicist or chemist who works with quantum systems.</p>
<p>The properties of the electronic configurations in molecules is more in the realm of chemistry departments/journals than physics, but there's no hard line. I had a quantum professor in my undergrad physics department whose PhD was in chemistry, and we covered a lot more properties of molecules than any course I TAed for in grad school.</p></div>		</li>
