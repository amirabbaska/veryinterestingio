<p>I like metal a lot, but I am not immersed in it enough to call myself a metalhead. And Zeppelin is my all time favorite band.</p>
<p>One thing about metal culture is that there is a strong purist movement in there. And Zeppelin is awesome, and some of their songs are heavy with badass riffs. But with all the acoustic stuff and albums like In Through The Out Door, which I really like, but is not heavy at all, they don't seem to really be heavy. Granted, bands like Sabbath have their mellow songs like Planet Caravan or Orchid, and Slipknot with Circle or Keep Away. But those are unusual songs for them.</p>
<p>That being said, you wrote a really good breakdown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>most music historians include zeppelin along with black sabbath as <del>the &quot;first&quot;</del> one of the acts that contained elements which led to heavy metal. prior to those bands, no one really had any music that anyone today would call  &quot;heavy&quot; or &quot;metal&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand.</p>
<p>There was a lot going on in the late 60's where it wasn't metal, but those bands inspired it. Hendrix, Cream, The Doors, etc. Not metal, but certainly were inspiration for what would become metal. I'd put Zeppelin as one of the last bands to bridge that gap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, Zeppelin had elements that would lead to metal, but they aren't a metal band per se.  I disagree with this &quot;most music historians&quot; claim.</p>
<p>Helter Skelter by the Beatles is even earlier (1968) and definitely crosses the same rock/metal kind of line that Zeppelin did, but you wouldn't ever call them a metal band.  They were all influencing each other, but Sabbath was the first one to really push the boat out and really define metal.</p>
<p>The Beatles and Zeppelin (and the occasional other track like in a gadda da vida, also 68 I think) were great rock bands and were following the same progression that lead to metal, though they didn't really cross that line themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They really divide opinion. Most US journalists and magazines place them solidly in the Metal canon but most Brits place Sabbath firmly at the beginning. Perhaps because they too are British but I think it's because they genuinely sounded different to all the other Hard Rock bands and were rejected as simplistic, noisy crap but a lot of journalists at the time. Initial rejection by the mainstream seems to be a hallmark of every genre covered here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The British consensus is that Led Zep are absolutely not metal (not even that close). Metal starts with the Sabs. Led Zeppelin are kin with Cream, the Jimi Hendrix Experience... the power-trio blues scene of the late sixties. </p>
<p>Metal is (from a musical perspective) largely about stripping the blues out of rock. (Prog too, though it largely replaced it with tricks from the Romantic canon.) Zep are, more than anything else, a really loud folk and blues band.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>IIRC Led Zeppelin got their name because early in their career a record exec rejected them saying they would drop like a &quot;lead balloon&quot;.</p>
<p>From that they coined the name (lead balloon obviously not quite having a cool ring to it).</p>
<p>I am not musically savvy enough to say if Led Zeppelin is &quot;metal&quot;.  If they aren't I would say they are the immediate pre-cursor to it.  To me they are the definitive &quot;rock &amp; roll&quot; band.  When someone says &quot;rock &amp; roll&quot; they leap to mind first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are tons of metal bands that have acoustic elements and entire acoustic tracks. Check out &quot;Fight Fire With Fire&quot; from Metallica for a quick example. Also, &quot;Dee&quot; on the Ozzie Osbourne &quot;Tribute&quot; album which showcases a little of Randy Rhodes (RIP) acoustic/classical guitar abilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, it's definitely in there. I just meant that the heavy to acoustic ratio of Zeppelin is low enough to make them questionable. I don't think they are not metal per se. I just know a lot of metalheads who dig Zep but don't consider them true metal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black metal absolutely did <em>not</em> begin with the &quot;group of teens in Norway&quot;. Black metal is commonly considered to have begun with Swedish band Bathory, who released 2 albums (1984, 1985) before Mayhem even recorded their first demo (1986). When Mayhem was first active there were already black metal bands such as Root (CZE), Parabellum (COL), communicating through tape trading networks. For more information, read Metalion: The Slayer mag diaries.  </p>
<p>Black metal as a genre of music doesn't really have a birth date or place. Contemporary to the early Norwegian scene were scenes and bands in places as far apart as South America and Southeast Asia. To a large extent, and if pushed, Black metal was primarily born in Sweden with Bathory. But you have to understand it in the context of the time. Black metal as a genre was largely a logical evolution of a template variously set by bands such as Sodom, Slayer, Venom, Deicide and Morbid Angel. Especially in its early days Black metal was more a cultural movement than a genre, one that represented a thematic approach of Satanism as well as an generic evolution of extreme metal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>op doesn't really have an in-depth grasp on black metal, it's a really complex scene compared to the other genres, because it's so insular (albeit now the atmospheric BM scene in the west is popping) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Norwegian</em> black metal started with Mayhem. Black metal does have roots with Venom, after their second album titled Black Metal in early 80's. Their style influenced later, more extreme versions of black metal. Granted Norwegian black metal made it a lot darker and more extreme, which became its signature.</p>
<p>Details aside, shout out to Immortal and Abbath for being so epic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Venom definitely were influential, yes. As were other bands such as Sodom. DSP was named after the Sodom song. Yes as well, Norwegian BM as a whole started with Mayhem. But that is not the entirety of BM. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And the song selection at the end, top notch.  Would also have accepted Hades by Kalmah or Incantation from Edge of Sanity for melo death, the rest I wouldn't change.</p></div>		</li>
