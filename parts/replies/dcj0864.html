<p>If they passed on the corresponding profits into worker's wages, we wouldn't have the massive income gap we have now.</p>
<p>Capitalism, or more accurately Corporatism, as it stands now, is a failure for the worker, but it is a massive success for the guys at the top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats a great question. Youre right.  The only real way this trickles down is that the business thrives so much, there is still a hiring surge to keep up with all of the new demand. This could lead to jobs (which is his #1 platform) and it could even drive down Domestic pricing if you reached economies of scale from huge increases in production.  The tarriffs though would likely allow firms to keep the prices up and pocket the increased margin from economies of scale.  Of course this all has to start with everyone buying American, which is a tough sell for people who make 20% less than they did 40 years ago and are barely getting by with current low priced imports.  </p>
<p>A good start might be to find a way for Americans to collect on all the extra output they have created in the past 40 years. But nah, fuck that...  CEO bonuses til i die. </p></div>		</li>
