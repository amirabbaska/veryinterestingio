			<div class="markdown"><p>And we just had a leap second this year (June 30, 2015 at 23:59:60 UTC, ~I believe~ to be exact) which also is a correction that can help because the difference between 365.24225 &amp; 365.242188792 is on the order of 5.29 seconds, if I am doing my math right:</p>
<pre><code> (365.24225 
- 365.242188792) days
x 24  hrs/day
x 60  min/hour
x 60  sec/min
---------------
~5.29 seconds</code></pre></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You got the time of the leap second correct, but for the wrong reason.  It's to keep UTC time (based on atomic clocks) consistent with UT1, which is calculated based on measurements of quasars, and is important in figuring out &quot;true&quot; inertial frames in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Leap seconds correct for the length of the day, not the length of the year.</p>
<p>More specifically, Earthâ€™s rotation is slowing such that a day is somewhat more than 86400 seconds long, a discrepancy that amounts to a full second every few years. A leap second is then inserted to account for this.</p>
<p>The error is the Gregorian calendar is of a different nature, and leap seconds do nothing to correct it.</p></div>		</li>
