			<div class="markdown"><p>Hybrid rice is grown from hybrid rice seed which is produced by growing an inbred rice variety having sterile pollen which is cross pollinated with normal pollen from adjacent rice plants of a different inbred variety. Hybrid rice therefore has two genetically different parents. As with other types of hybrids, hybrid rice typically displays heterosis (or hybrid vigor) such that when it is grown under the same conditions as comparable high-yielding inbred rice varieties it can produce up to 30% more rice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the days when equines were our major form of transportation it was not extremely uncommon to get a potentially fertile mule, but they were always female.  They called them a Molly.  Even though they would have an estrus cycle they seldom actually got pregnant.  </p>
<p>The same thing happens with hybrid cats.  Domestic cats can be bred to a few small wild species, such as Fishing cats or Servals.  The first generation (F1) males are always sterile, as are many females but some females are not, and can be bred to domestic cat males.  That is how the Bengal and Savannah breeds of cat started.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many domesticated grains are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid" target="_blank">polyploids</a> - some varietels of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid#Crops" target="_blank">sugar cane are even dodecaploids</a>, with 12 distinct sets of chromosomes. Plants can tolerate such high levels of polyploidy because unlike animals, they have amorphous symmetry and their organ systems can support themselves independently (i.e. if one leaf dies due to polyploidy, it doesn't kill the entire plant). Plants that are &quot;mules&quot; also have other ways to propagate themselves, such as vegetation (the act of growing a new clone from the parent plant). Plants are also more forgiving when it comes to chemical barriers around their eggs, allowing sperm from other species to contribute DNA to their eggs more easily. This probably is an evolutionary advantage for plants, since pollination events are relatively rare, especially for wind-borne species, and the consequences of polyploidy are reduced due to their body plans. In fact, to plants polyploidy offers some distinct advantages - easier access to mates, hybrid vigor that boosts resistance to pests and viruses, and a larger gene pool to draw from in general for accelerated evolution background rates. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rule of thumb with plant hybrids is that they happen a lot and plants don't have any semblance of concern over what a proper number of chromosomes is. If it's even number of sets, they'll make it work and are fertile. If it's an odd number of sets, they'll make it work anyway but will not be fertile. It won't stop them from cloning themselves though, which is how seedless plants like some bananas and king's holly were able to survive before humans found them.</p></div>		</li>
