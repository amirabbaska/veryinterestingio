			<div class="markdown"><p>Reflexes are the result of processing data without sending it all the way to the brain. If you use that metric you'd have to consider a lot more of the nervous system to be the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nerve itself is an outpouching of the brain rather than a peripheral nerve. We know this based on embryological data as well as differences in the cellular makeup; the optic nerve is myelinated by oligodendrocytes, as is the rest of the central nervous system, whereas peripheral nerves are typically myelinated by Schwan cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the central nervous system is lined up by the blood-brain-barrier and the meninges, that give it a special status for immunology, selective permeation of molecules from the blood, particular environment (corticospinal fluid), and a lot of other particularities... The eyes and the spinal cord are within those meninges, and are therefore part of the central nervous system, this is why they are said to be closer to the brain in organisation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To also help prove your point, embryological data also proves to us that the early eye develops from an outpouching of cerebral tissue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. I'm pretty sure that neither the lens nor the vitreous humor are  part of the brain for any useful definition. Thanks for the clarification. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this true both ways, IE also in the sense that a lot of how the brain deals with concepts is through visualization?</p></div>		</li>
