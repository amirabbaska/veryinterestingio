			<div class="markdown"><p>I had read that, but I'm not 100% sold it applies. When it happens in the situation I mentioned, it doesn't feel like I go into &quot;fight or flight&quot; mode and get a shot of adrenaline. It's more of a &quot;that would've sucked. Probably would've died if that happened&quot; type of feeling. </p>
<p>It's a &quot;you could have easily just died&quot; shiver </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably a more emotional response to the image that formed in your head, you may just not see it as an emotional response because otherwise you didn't feel anything?</p>
<p>I have tourrettes and I get that shiver when I'm not even doing anything. Most times it brings a tic and I get goosebumps if I supress the tic. No idea on scientifically why I get it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>huh, curious. these two feel the same for me.</p>
<p>then again my body does weird things sometimes (that time when I was the angriest I've ever been, the front half of my body went entirely numb, from my jaw to my... thighs) so maybe I just don't function correctly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, your adrenal glands release a hormone called adrenaline, which is responsible for the 'flight or fight' response. It prepares the body to confront danger. It increases your energy by several folds. For this, it pumps blood from the periphery (hands, toes) to your vital organs such as heart, kidney, lungs etc so that they pump faster, and work more efficiently. As a result, your face, hands and feet tend to feel cold'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fight or flight response includes taking blood <em>away</em> from the extremities? Then how I am going to fight or fly? If anything, <em>more</em> blood should be going there, diverted from the digestive tract most likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, you wouldn't expect blood at your extremities.  Your extremities aren't vital.  You wouldn't need fine mortar control in a classic fight or flight situation (in the modern world you might, but that's a fairly new evolutionary pressure).  In case of injuries, reduced blood flow close to the skin is a really good thing. In a fight or flight situation you want your senses on point and blood flow to your major muscles.</p></div>		</li>
