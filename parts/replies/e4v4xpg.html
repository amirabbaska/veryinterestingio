			<div class="markdown"><p>I have 2 week old sliced bread in my kitchen right now that is showing no signs of mold. I'm not at home and can't recall the brand name at the moment, but it's 100% whole wheat bread. It's a fairly common brand to see it at least where I live. (Pennsylvania.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my parents have always gotten wheat bread. These days, &quot;Sara Lee&quot; brand, and maybe 3 or 4 days after the expiration date on the bag, it starts getting moldy.</p>
<p>Only time that I ever had sliced bread last a long time is if I either froze it or put it in the fridge.</p></div>		</li>
