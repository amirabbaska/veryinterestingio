<p>Being underwater in a lightning storm isn't a big deal. The electricity goes outward along the surface of the water and doesn't really do too deep into the water itself. I don't know the science of why that is, but it's true. </p>
<p>I've sat underwater when freak storms have rolled in waiting for the worst to pass so I could surface in less dangerous conditions. The worst time for a diver caught in the storm is when you're on the surface. Underwater you're more or less safe -- salt or fresh. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely dead on.  I'm also a diver (but haven't been out diving during lightning storms).  Basically, large bodies of salt water are a giant and very conductive mass.  It is also amazingly uniform in conductivity.  When the lighting hits, the electrons spread through the water essentially diffusing it.  It's a very similar concept so any type of energy dissipation but extremely efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely the skin effect.  a lighting strike the you can see is sort of pulse modulated. wikipedia state something like 3 to 4 strikes. </p>
<p>So the characteristics of the current are likely high frequency, the higher the freuency the more the current will cling to the surface of it's conductor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the distance from the place the lightning hits. If the fish is deep underwater nothing would happen to it. If it's near the place it will either die from the shock, if its a bit further away it may only get stunned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unlike fish, humans like to stick out of the water.</p>
<p>Now, I can assure you that, given the right positioning, the oceans are a perfectly safe place to ride out a lightning stormâ€”but that goes for beings that wouldn't really be hurt by lightning in the first place. For squishy humans like ourselves, being in the ocean is a great way to be the highest spot around, and the lightning will hit you first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But, I was under the impression that, while lightning <em>does</em> strike the highest point around in general, a couple feet difference in height wouldn't matter that much.</p>
<p>If you're treading water, then pretty much only your neck and head and <em>maybe</em> shoulders are above. So, are you <em>really</em> going to have that much of an increased chance of getting struck? Presumably you're near a boat or something much higher if nothing else, otherwise how did you get out there? But even if the boat has sunk or something, a floating human isn't that tall, it seems to me. So how much of a difference will it make?</p></div>		</li>
