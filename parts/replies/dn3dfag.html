			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true if you mainly account the purpose and meaning for said individuals. Then it can be comforting. I doubt everything religion tells you is what you really want to hear. On the contrary. However I'd like to argue that also the opposite is quite troubling for example politically. If you don't value individual needs, you start seeing people as statistics and don't need to take them into account. Going even further you disregard any moral oblications to masses to advance the goals of the few, ex. stockholders.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We are a byproduct of the universe. We like to think everything has a greater meaning because it's comforting, and because when we make things we give them purpose, but in many cases there isn't any meaning. Things just are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To tag onto this, depression and suicide are conplex, emergent behaviors. That is to say, there is no single gene that codes for suicidal tendencies. Such a gene would quickly be eradicated from the gene pool (assuming it expressed itself prior to procreation -basically anything that happens after successfully begetting offspring has much less evolutionary pressure). Rather, suicide and depression is the result of a cascade of other critical-for-survival/mating genes flipped in just the right combination of on and off. Further complicating this is that there are more than one set of combinations that these genes can be flipped in to create a similar effect.</p>
<p>Schizophrenia is likely similar, and that is what makes it difficult to pinpoint and treat. You need the underlying genes individually, in some rare combinations they backfire dramatically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This could suggest that suicide is an evolutionary trait designed to weed out undesirable genes. Through no fault of our own of course. I wonder if an experiment could be designed to test this. From an evolutionary perspective, it could be beneficial if it has a very low chance of weeding out desirable traits. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to think of it like this:</p>
<p>12 years ago we had cellphones that you could throw against a wall and they would still work, and the battery lasted a week before needing to be recharged. We prefer our modern smartphones even though they are not as durable because we can do more with them, but we have to deal with some disadvantages.</p>
<p>Our intelligent brains gave us an evolutionary advantage, but they also came with some drawbacks such as depression.</p>
<p>I subscribe to the theory that evolution actually caused religion to exist because it is a coping mechanism that helps us deal with our understanding of mortality that most animals don't have.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Evolution doesn't design traits.
Also, genes that produce traits that kill their hosts before they can pass on those genes, tend not to be passed on. They probably just ride along with some other, beneficial genes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Suicide and depression are most likely side effects of another trait (or series of traits) that offer an overall advantage. That is the prevailing hypothesis, in part because depression has no single etiology, and in part because the behavioral outcomes of moderate depression (without suicide) have been hypothesized to be beneficial in some survival situations.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the average onset of suicide comes during or after puberty. While this means less in the modern age because we have children later, it means that the genes which contribute to depression and suicide would be a particularly crappy form of removing &quot;undesirable genes.&quot; And since an intermediate phenotype (depression, but not suicide) may in fact be an <em>advantage,</em> we can infer that whatever causes suicidality doesn't sufficiently compromise the fitness of the organism, and could actually be advantageous in an intermediate form.</p>
<p>One of the biggest complications in understanding the evolutionary development of complex behaviors is that we define these behaviors in very imprecise terms. What does it mean to be depressed or suicidal? We have a psychiatric definition but it's not comprehensive and it doesn't address the biological underpinnings of the disorder. What about suicide? Does successful suicide versus unsuccessful suicide matter when considering phenotype? We are limited to anthrocentric terms that are led by the assumption that &quot;normal&quot; (nonpsychiatric) states of mind are more fit. If we can't adequately define what the behavioral phenotype is, it's going to continue to be difficult to infer what the genetic causes may be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I guess it's because in that case, the brain isn't really functioning the way it should. Check out a mental illness called apotemnophilia, if memory serves me well. It's the stuff of nightmares and horror movies.  </p></div>		</li>
