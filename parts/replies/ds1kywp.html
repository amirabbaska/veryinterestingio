			<div class="markdown"><p>Although, Narcan binds too, having a higher competitive affinity for the receptor sites, pushing the opiate out, but having no effect because the molecular shape doesn't have the shapes or molecular ends on it that cause the release  of dopamine or whatever it does.Narcanmins effective.. there is also Naltrexone which is facinating.. lasting 24 hours per 50mg dose, and it stacks. So if you take 25mg = 12 hours, 100mg = 48 hours. You can get an injection that blocks opiates working for a month (Its called the vivitrol injection). Good for recovering addicts worrying about straying accidentally, it's a handy safety net. I have no idea how it works though because you obviously don't get a gram of stuff injected per month (shit, what do I know, maybe that it exactly what happens every month, a full gram...) Well, whatever the thing is, it seems to break down slowly and in a constant rate, no half lives, it just works until it's depleted.</p>
<p>Okay, so as 'endorphin' is short for endrogenous 'mor x phine' (the body's own internal version of an opiate) somehow are not blocked by Naltrexone. However, it does seem to prevent EXCESS endorphins. For example, the Sinclair's Method is a treatment program for alcoholics where they take Naltrexone every morning, then drink as you normally would. Your pleasure and pain responses seem unaffected, except the 'high' from the alcohol, which would be register as spike or excess of endorphins, is blocked.. the patient associates alcohol with normal responses even boring or uninteresting, the alcoholic either cuts substantially, or loses interest.</p>
<p>That's the science behind it.. But I just don't get how it seems to know the difference between normal every day feelings - and the excessive rush from a drug or alcohol high.. its facinating. However, I'm so very upset and unimpressed with the progress in helping addicts. After all, I firmly believe the pharma companies, making additional opiates, as much or even more as addictive as heroin.. yes, legitimate uses for everything exist. But they pushed drugs like Oxycodone in adverts and giving out samples to doctors and now Ametica is facing a disgusting addiction epidemic, largely due to the over prescribing of highly addictive drug. It's not like, on the way to this epidemic the company said 'gee, maybe we should tell doctors or patients of the warnings'. Nope,they got rich and saw more and more people using drugs like Oxycodone, Diludid, Hydrocodone, Oxymorphone, Opana etc etc.</p>
<p>Designed for pain relief, just happen to be utterly and dangerously addictive, even under strict and supervised doctors orders, you take any opiate more than a week, you're asking for tolerance and physical withdr@al.</p></div>		</li>
