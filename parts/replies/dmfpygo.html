			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanted to chime in regarding what you said about being woken up, interacting with someone, then falling back to sleep, only to reawaken with no recollection of the previous interaction. Happens to me all the time when I'm trying to wake up my 13 y/o daughter. She'll swear that she doesn't remember the previous conversation at all. Weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also did this all the way through puberty, and still in adulthood but less frequently. I wonder if the teenage years have something to do with it. My dad occasionally will do it too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe this is why my parents have yelled at me for not doing something that I had no recollection of them saying... they'd often say something really early in the morning, usually while waking me up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best answer so far - thx. This also kinda explains why I can set my alarm to 7:20am one day and then maybe 9:30am the next and both times I will wake up perfectly two minutes prior to my alarm sounding off.</p></div>		</li>
