			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because they are too high energy.  Normal refraction works by the incident light oscillating the electrons in a material.  The properties of the material determine how much the electrons are able to oscillate and by extension how much the material refracts light.  But with x-rays, the energy contained in a single photon is either enough to ionize the atom, stripping away an electron and thus any chance for an oscillation, or the frequency is just too high for the electron in the material to keep up with the oscillation and so you end up with nonlinear effects.  Interestingly, metals, which normally behave as conductors and strong reflectors due to the loose binding of their electrons, begin to behave somewhat like dielectrics, such as glass in the visible, precisely because the loose binding of their electrons allows them to somewhat keep up with the high frequency movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What course would cover light-matter interaction in detail like this? I'm an electromagnetics engineering grad student, but unfortunately most of my classes focus on the macroscopic effects, and don't really go too deeply into the physics at the atomic level. Sounds really interesting though, I'd like to learn this stuff at some point if I get the chance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>x-rays penetrate materials, and become attenuated. The index of refraction is typically very close to one, with a small refractive part and also an absorptive part. The index of refraction is a complex quantity (meaning a real part for refraction, and an imaginary part that relates to absorption).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light doesn't react to static magnetic fields. Magnets are used to focus charged particles, like electrons in a Scanning Electron Microscope.</p>
<p>As others have pointed out, there are X-ray mirrors that can focus quite well, and you can build compound lenses that may be useful for some specialist applications. In general, things should be kept simple - just use a really big sensor.</p></div>		</li>
