			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually somewhat factual and discussed in Duhigg's book as well. Keep in mind that the radio execs have many ways of knowing which new songs are the best to spend time on, so their decisions are very much analyzed beforehand. One such way is a computer algorithm that has accurately identified popular songs just based on &quot;hearing&quot; the song itself.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this makes sense, I witness this a lot with artists experimenting new genres or having a new album. Many times I've had a new album I listen to bore me to death with disappointment. Then I pick it up months later, and give it another run or two, and suddenly i'm bumping it on repeat for weeks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what you're asking here. Are you saying that you continuously listen to music you don't like and you wonder why you don't like it? No shit....</p>
<p>2 scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I stick a brand new death metal song in between 2 popular pop songs on a station that plays pop music.</p>
</li>
<li>I stick a brand new pop song between 2 popular pop songs on the same pop music station. The new song sounds different than what people are accustomed to so it didn't immediately take off, but it's not too different. It still falls in the same genre of pop.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you like pop music, cycles of scenario 2 will slowly get you accustomed to the new song. After you think you've kind of listened to the new song you might eventually like it. </p>
<p>Scenario 1? A majority of its listeners will likely change the channel as soon as the new song starts. Death metal is obviously different than pop. You can't just subconsciously relate the two so your brain rejects it. To connect to the original question: you might get a headache if you leave it on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The station basicly only does pop music, and I do like pop music, but most of the mainstream stuff is awful to me. And yes at my work the same radio station is on everyday, and I have no control over it. </p></div>		</li>
