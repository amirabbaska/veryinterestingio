			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that it will remaining &quot;wet&quot; from the ocean water to about as deep as the sediment layer is. Sediments pile up in different ways and different depths, but a rough average might be something like 500m. All of that rock will still contain some of the sea water it was buried with. Below the sedimentary layers, the oceanic crust is made up of primarily basalt. Basalt is for all practical purposes impermeable. If the basalt is highly fractured for some reason, the water will penetrate as far down as the fractures go, but outside of that, water will not penetrate any significant distance into the rock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t there a huge volume of water crystallized in minerals in the mantle?</p>
<p>Thank you /u/_fmm, I'm referring to water stored in ringwoodite. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/94d77s/how_far_do_you_have_to_go_beneath_the_ocean_floor/e3kxsv1/" target="_blank">Here is his reply!</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dehydration melting is not really a mantle process. He's referring to the so called 'Ringwoodite ocean'. For those not familiar, ringwoodite is a polymorph (same chemical composition but a different crystalline structure) of olivine that occurs in the mantle between 410 and 660km. Ringwoodite is notable due to it's ability to accommodate water into its structure and is named for the Australian experimental petrologist, Ted Ringwood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ringwoodite looks <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Nlua1Iu.jpg" target="_blank">pretty cool</a> with a deep, ocean-blue color. It's been detected as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/08/blue-diamonds-are-born-buried-deep-below-but-bear-ocean-bottom-boron/" target="_blank">a component of blue diamonds from the lower mantle, near earth's core.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That would mean that blue diamonds are sparkling evidence of elemental recycling by plate tectonics, including the transportation of water (bound up in minerals) down to the lower mantle. And since the boron likely got into the seafloor plates through hydrothermal reactions with seawater, the diamonds’ color is—coincidentally but truthfully—an oceanic blue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An ultra-deep diamond found in Juína, Mato Grosso in western Brazil, contained inclusions of ringwoodite—the only known sample of natural terrestrial origin—thus providing evidence of significant amounts of water as hydroxide in the Earth's mantle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no formal training in geology (that's my brother!), just chemistry, but I've read up on this mineral before!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So based on that, is it possible that as the earth gets older and layers are broken down, that the water is able to penetrate all the way down to the Earth's core? If so, what happens then? A situation like that seems like it would be catastrophic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry but this is wrong. Hydrothermal circulation penetrates at LEAST as deep as the base of the dykes layer in oceanic crust. There is significant evidence to suggest it also penetrates the gabbros. To answer OPs question, we really don't know. In some cases, hydrothermal circulation may even penetrate down to the mantle.</p>
<p>To clarify, this is seawater that circulates within the igneous oceanic crust, largely before any sedimentation has occurred, at the mid-ocean ridge. We're talking certainly km's deep. This is why the oceanic crust is hydrated.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know much about this topic, but I'll do what I can.
First of all, you want to define &quot;water&quot;. H2O is obviously water, and the molecule is stable all the way to the Marianas trench and probably deeper than that.</p>
<p>But I don't know the effects of the increasing pressure and heat on the water molecules as you go deeper into the crust.</p>
<p>Past a certain point they would definitely ionize, forming OH- and H+ ions. Someone smarter than me would be better able to explain the exact details, but at a certain depth water as we know it wouldn't be able to exist.</p>
<p>I would google &quot;effects of pressure on H2O ionization&quot; as a starting point.
If that line exists, then you have your &quot;absolute&quot; answer in a way.</p>
<p>You also need to consider that the H2O levels in the rock will drop off gradually, not all at once. Rock near the ocean floor will be very saturated with water, and the deeper you go the less of it you would find. So what would you, for all intents and purposes, consider to be a dry rock. A part per million of H2O is obviously very dry rock, so where do you draw the line? ten parts per mil? 1% H20? Whatever number you choose, you would then have a definitive number to look for.
Sorry I can't give you a definitive number or anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately the auto-ionization of water is not be driven to a significant degree by the extreme pressures, and would never solidify as a result of the pressure, so I would assume permeates the crust just floats in a super heated liquid state above the first molten layer, flows outward from the where the ocean is, and becomes the water table we are familiar with? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as a Geologist, this would occur where the soft, unconsolidated sediment meets bedrock. The thickness of unconsolidated sediment can vary greatly depending on how far you are from the coast (or closest sediment supply, like a river). I would delineate the ocean's downward influence at this horizon.</p>
<p>Edit: I am not the world's foremost authority on this, so correct me if I oversimplified. </p>
<p>Edit 2: I found you a map of sediment thickness in the world's oceans:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/sedthick9.jpg" target="_blank">https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/sedthick9.jpg</a></p>
<p>So, this illustrates that location is everything. If standing at the mouth of the Mississippi, you have 10's of thousands of feet of soft sediment beneath you until you reach bedrock. If you're on the abyssal plain of the Atlantic, you might only have 10's of feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dark blue areas indicate the lowest thickness of sediment. Sediment is supplied to the oceans *mostly* via rivers. The further the distance from a river, the lower the thickness of sediment on the ocean floor. There is likely only a couple of feet of sediment in these areas. However, there is exposed bedrock in many areas of the ocean, specifically around mid-ocean ridges (sites of active divergent plate boundaries -- where the ocean is rifting and creating new crust). One of the largest and most contiguous rifts is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and runs North-South from Greenland to Antarctica: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Ridge" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic\_Ridge" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic\_Ridge</a></a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! These are good questions; I feel like I'm teaching Geology 101 lab again.</p>
<p>The Pacific Coast of the Americas is an active convergent plate boundary, and the Pacific tectonic plate is colliding with the American continental plates. This explains the numerous volcanoes found all along the coasts, from the Aleutian Islands to the southern tip of Chile. Whereas the Atlantic coast of the Americas is a passive margin, and sediment has built up along the Atlantic coast for millions of years, the Pacific Coast is an active margin and the sediment does not have time to build up before the plate slides underneath the American continents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There hasn’t been an active tectonic plate boundary along the Atlantic Coast for at least 100 million years, so all the sediment stays where it is deposited offshore. The Appalachians were once as mighty as the Himalayas - everything eroded off them is now on the ocean floor. While the Pacific coast has impressive mountains too, tectonic activity keeps disturbing offshore sediments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as a geologist working in hydrogeology, this is definitely an oversimplification. Groundwater is found well below the overburden, both in sedimentary and crystalline rock. Surprisingly, crystalline bedrock can be a pretty good source of groundwater if it’s fractured enough (which most of it is), and many towns in New England actually rely on crystalline aquifers for their water supplies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ocean does not exactly make the sediments below it wet.  They are basically all born wet.  In geologic time we start with molten rock.  It weathers into grains.  Those are transported by wind or water and settle somewhwere to become  what we call sedementary rock.  There is space between the grains and this space is called porosity.  It is immedeately filled with water, either from rain or the grains may have been deposited in lakes or oceans to start with.  As more sediment is deposited the material is squeezed by the increasing weight of sediments above it, and the pore spaces between the grains become smaller.  So some of the water is squeezed upward and out.  But it is always true that whatever space remains is still filled with water.  Over time, there are places where sediments have become many miles deep.  It wll still have water as long as it still has porocity.  </p>
<p>So the question is not how deeply the ocean makes the sediments below it wet.   They start out wet.  If the pore space is 20% of the rock, they are 20% wet.  The reason we tend to think of shallow dirt as being wet is mostly because it still has a lot of water-filled pore space because there isn't much weight of sediment above it.  At 10000 ft into the earth each square inch has the weight of one King Ranch Ford dually pickup truck on it.   It has been pretty well squeezed.   There are other factors that determine porosity, like the dfferent sizes of particals in the mix.    But the dominant factor in rock getting dryer as you go deeper into the first few thousand feet is simply the King Ranch Ford dually squeezing the crap out of it.</p></div>		</li>
