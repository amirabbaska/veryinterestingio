<p>Electronic Medical Record systems exist but tend to be customized for each hospital.</p>

<p>Interface programmer reporting in.  Some would think it'd be easy but every system has their own method of reporting and storing data...gender, race, ethnicity, religion.  Even with all the standards (CMS for example) it's one thing when dealing with DRG or <a href="https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes" target="_blank">ICD10</a> codes, but it's another when trying to adhere to visit types, patient classifications, abstracting, etc because those are often <em>very</em> unique to the hospital.</p>

<p>A lot of this can deal with legal requirements or billing requirements, but they do need to know if you are on any new medications or have any new allergies that may not be in <em>their</em> system.  If you recently started a prescription of benzodiazepines from a different doctor's office, it'd be <em>very dangerous</em> if this one had prescribed you phenothiazines or MAOI's.  If you only recently noticed a latex or iodine allergy they'd need to know before treatment.  Them asking the patient this stuff every time is partly about providing the best quality care as well as reducing potential for incidents as much as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty surprised by all the complaints about antiquated records keeping. In my area every hospital and doctor's office I've been to uses Epic software. Usually I just give my name and date of birth and they'll have everything they need. I had to visit the ER yesterday and the only paper work I did was a signiture to authorize care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Epic has been very resistant to allowing hospitals to customize how the data is stored. There are advantages (eg easy to transfer records) and disadvantages (eg harder to adapt some things for unique circumstances). It isn't the only system hospitals use. The hospital I worked at used Cerner and McKesson. The VA has their own system too.</p></div>		</li>
