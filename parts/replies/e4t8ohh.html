			<div class="markdown"><p>Im an auto glass tech.  The glass for heads up display doesnt change thickness or anything, hell most of them nowadays it is nothing special at all as far as the glass goes.  Older cars like the late 90's early '00 Cadillac had a film coating to catch the light, but now with the modern projectors in the dash its not needed.  The biggest thing with cheap aftermarket glass is the chance for fisheyes, waves, or other distortion in the glass, but even then the quality on most of even the cheapest brands of glass has gone through the roof in the last 5-6 years to where its super rare.</p></div>		</li>
