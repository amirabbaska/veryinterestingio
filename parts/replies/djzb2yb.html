<p>It also brought global oxygen levels past 35% (vs 20% today), which allowed the largest dinosaurs to evolve.</p>

<p>Uh no. The first (small) dinosaurs did not evolve until the mid to late triassic, ~60 million years after the carboniferous, and the average atmospheric oxygen concentration in the triassic was a little lower than today.</p></div>		</li>
