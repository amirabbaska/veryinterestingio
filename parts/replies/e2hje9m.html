			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna say this now. I've worked at a chain bubble tea store and we vrewed all our tea using loose tea leaves in a coffee filter in a tea machine that drip brewed the tea. Everyone that says that tea cannot be brewed this way is wrong. The people who argue that it's not the correct way, that's arguable. A lot of people say you can't brew coffee using a drip coffee maker either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, I don't make tea with a drip pot but I do make it with a French press. It works fine and I know it works fine in a drip pot too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You must have been using a special device made for tea. A drip-style coffee maker will not work to make tea if you put tea in the basket. The tea will be too dense and the leaves will not steep long enough to produce anything but very weak tea. Special machines exist that can do this; Mr. Coffee (I think) made one back in the '90s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I make tea using a small drip coffee maker all the time.  One bag for two-three cups.  It comes out fine.</p>
<p>edit:  If you do this, you mus lay the tea bag down flat over the opening and make sure the tea is spread out evenly in the bag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was a commercial tea/coffee brewer. The tea setting is more like a hot water shower over the leaves as opposed to conventional single drip method.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've made tea by putting tea bags where the coffee goes in my drip-type coffee maker. I couldn't tell the difference, maybe I could with a side-by-side comparison but whatever, but a barbarian like me doesn't care.</p></div>		</li>

<p>a drip-type coffee maker wouldn't work with regular tea.</p>

<p>I've made loose-leaf tea in a keurig before using one of the re-usable k-cups and it came out well.  I've never tried a regular drip-style coffee pot though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can make tea, but it's not the correct way to make it. I've made it before too and it doesn't taste like normal steeped tea.</p>
<p>I have made it several times by heating the water in a coffee pot and pouring that over a tea bag in a cup. That makes it pretty well.</p></div>		</li>
