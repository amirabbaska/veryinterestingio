			<div class="markdown"><p>The last sentence is an important one.. It's why a lot of developing and 3rd world countries suffer from so much corruption. It is hard for me to bribe a police officer making $50,000 a year in the US, but one making $300 a month in Romania? A lot easier..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought this had a lot to do with it, but it really tends to go back to the laws.<br />
For example, running a red light in Romania costs you your license. In most other countries it's a hefty fine and a bunch of demerit points. So imagine a cop pulls a guy over for running a red light (shit happens). The cop has to take his license away, but the guy, who is probably on the same salary as the cop, needs to drive in order to keep his job...now his entire livelihood is at stake over a red light. The law is the law, but if it comes to this, the law is pretty ridiculous, right? </p>
<p>Anyway, that's a more clear-cut case of the moral dilemma caused by short-sighted laws, but this occurs everywhere. Obviously, I'm not condoning nor defending acts of corruption, but I'll argue every time that the system, in its current form, encourages corruption.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Weaker institutions are the other part of what makes it easy to bribe people in developing countries: a cop in the U.S. who takes bribes is quite likely to get caught quickly and suffer severe punishment (at least lose their job, probably face criminal charges) due to mechanisms built into the police force to stop corruption. Developing countries tend to have weak institutions that are vulnerable to corruption because protective mechanisms aren't in place.</p></div>		</li>
