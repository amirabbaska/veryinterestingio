<p>Out of his chair and everything of course.</p>
<p>I felt like it would have been really uplifting and funny.</p>
<p>He also would have gotten a many physisits, and eventually celebrities to join the cause. </p>
<p>They could have raised so much more money to research the condition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's actually not the only one living for so long with ALS. Jason Becker who used to be an amazing guitarist is close to hitting 50 years and still making music through eye movement. He got diagnosed with ALS around his 20s too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't read about Becker but I went to a Junior high that shared a building with a school for kids with disabilities. There are a few different systems depending on what your needs are but one I have seen a lot is a computer with a camera (think webcam) that tracks your eye movements relative to the computer screen that lets you type, click etc.</p>
<p>So that could be a way he manages to compose if he has a system like that</p>
<p>Edit: apparently it was even more inspiring. Found an article from 2016 in which he blinks to his father to instruct him. <a href="http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-10-22/jason-becker-the-man-who-could-have-been-king" target="_blank">article</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hawking typed by eye movement. He had a special computer that read his eye's motion and allowed him to type using it and blinks, I believe. It was agonizingly slow. Dara O'Briain did a nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooQGBYrndfw" target="_blank">documentary</a> about Hawking that explains this fact very early in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Afaik he has software that allows him to control a computer by moving his eyes. You can write and synthesize music on a computer so I guess that's all it takes. I'm not a huge Becker fan but I assume he gets other guitarists to perform the stuff he writes too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't have existed. At that point Marty had left for Megadeth and Jason was signed over to David Lee Roth's band right before his diagnosis. For anybody actually interested in Jason Becker I highly suggest his music. Listen to &quot;Air&quot; and &quot;Altitudes&quot; and you'll gain a further understanding that this man wasn't just an ordinary rock guitarist. He was a virtuoso. A full on composer when it came to the guitar.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless it’s genetic (SOD1, C9orf72, etc) which last I read was only about 10% of ALS cases then there is no test. If you have these sort of symptoms (many different onset symptoms) and they rule everything else out... then you get an ALS diagnosis if the dr even knows what that is... though that’s getting better. </p>
<p>Source: wife’s Mother died of ALS in 2010 and died 9 months after her first symptom. Wife was already looking into strange weakness in her leg. She was diagnosed less than a year later and confirmed C9orf72. Still impacting mostly just the one leg today. </p>
<p>Edit: sorry the point of my post was that saying he did or did not have ALS is not easy to say since ALS (MND outside the US) is really the lack of another diagnosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not that doctors don’t <em>know</em> ALS, it’s just that the signs and symptoms of ALS are also found in diseases that are much more common than ALS such that it’s diagnosed by elimination most of the time.</p>
<p>EDIT: Didn't see your edit there. Mobile. Carry on!</p></div>		</li>
