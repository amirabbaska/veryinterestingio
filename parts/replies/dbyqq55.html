			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the cost of crude is the main factor in the cost of gas, like 70% of the price. Even if the price of crude were only 50% of the cost is gas, cutting the price of crude in half should cut the price of gas by 25%. Cost at the pump doesn't fall because of price gouging, they know people will pay it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true.  Depending where you are the price of crude is anywhere between 30 and 50% of gasoline price.  Most places taxes are the biggest factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easy, land prices, taxes, and wages are generally significantly higher in urban areas than less densely populated areas, also the increased population means that the gas stations don't necessarily have to lower prices to get the necessary customer base.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My city has a population of 75,000. The city an hour away has a pop of 300,000. We undoubtedly have lower taxes, etc. transport costs would be a tiny fraction. Especially at the gas station 5 minutes from the refinery.</p></div>		</li>
