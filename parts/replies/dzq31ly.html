			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a cancer or disease biologist in any way (I'm an ecologist), is it at all possible to locally starve tissues in a human body where a discrete cancerous tumor is located, without killing off any non-cancerous tissues?</p>
<p>Just an idea off the top of my head I had when I read your comment about &quot;cancerous&quot; microbial colonies</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cell biologist here, You dont wanna do that unless you're super sure you can keep the &quot;starvation&quot; extremely localised, otherwise the tissue and its surroundings becomes necrotic and the patient will die from toxic shock as there is too much cell debris to be taken care off by macrophages and such. Thats also why you don't want your cancer treatment to be too effective too quickly as the dead cancer cells just dump all their toxins into the bloodstream, poisoning the patient</p>
<p>Edit for clarity: Tumour lysis syndrome is what I am describing. Toxic shock syndrome/Septic shock is ususally used for reserved for infections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different cancer cells thrive in different conditions, so it's impossible to generalize.</p>
<p>For example, after observing that many cancer cells thrive on glucose, some people report success using a ketogenic diet to reduce the glucose in the system to an absolute minimum in order to slow and inhibit cancer cell growth.</p>

<p>But in some cases, cancer cells use ketones for fuel and, apparently, it can even make them more prone to generating &quot;cancer stem cells&quot; which seem to be a driving force in metastasis and recurrence after remission.</p>

<p>That's <a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1162" target="_blank">the thing about cancer</a>, it's not <em>a</em> disease, more like a huge family of related diseases.  Unlike influenza, etc., where everyone gets one of a few common strains, every single cancer patient has a cancer that's never been seen before, because it's based on a random variation of their own unique genes.</p>
<p>Perhaps someday we will be able to analyze the DNA of cancer cells and produce a single one-shot cure for that exact cancer, perfectly targeting it by the precise mechanisms and pathways that make it cancerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be interested to know that this is actually done for some tumors! TAE (trans-arterial embolization) is a procedure sometimes used for treating liver tumors that plugs up the blood flow to the tumor, thereby starving it. It’s very good for tumors that cannot be removed surgically and are too large to be ablated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an informal sense, yes.  You could say that because the organism was previously part of an ecosystem, it then becomes a cancer on that ecosystem.  It's not really a stretch, since the human body can be seen as an ecosystem of cooperative cell types.</p>
<p>If one of your vital gut bacteria started to reproduce out of control, though, we wouldn't call it cancer even though they are essentially permanent parts of your biology.</p></div>		</li>
