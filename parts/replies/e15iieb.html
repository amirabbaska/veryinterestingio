			<div class="markdown"><p>The body can regulate pressure by controlling tone of the vessels, output of the heart, spare blood in the spleen, fluid intake through digestion, and fluid removed through the kidneys.</p>
<p>Short-term pressure is obviously affected by the loss of blood volume, and the loss of tissue needing blood running through it. Blood pressure needs aren't otherwise changed—roughly the same pressure is needed to force blood from the arteries through tissues to veins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Initally, blood pressure would probably go up. Then the kidneys would work to remove liquid volume from the blood. Eventually blood pressure would even out, but the person would have less total blood volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your blood pressure actually doesn’t even go up initially.  First, because if you experienced an amputation, you’ve probably lost blood and so you’re short on blood volume.  The heart will be pumping faster to keep your blood pressure elevated.</p>
<p>However, even in the absence of blood loss, a healthy heart can rapidly change the speed at which it beats to maintain your blood pressure (much faster than the kidneys which will take several hours).  Suppose you place a tight tourniquet on your arm right now and block the arteries in your arm.  This will immediately cause the arteries proximal to the tourniquet to back up with blood all the way back to the aortic arch, carotid arteries, and the heart.  You have baroreceptors in the aorta and carotid arteries- which are stretch receptors- and they’ll notice the increased pressure-stretch and send a signal to the brain which will send a parasympathetic signal to the heart telling it to beat more slowly (thus maintaining nearly the same blood pressure as before).</p>
<p>Without a baroreceptor reflex and the heart’s ability to rapidly self-regulate blood pressure, modest changes to position could potentially cause severe problems elsewhere in the body.  Imagine tourniqueting your leg and now having most of that blood shunted to elsewhere in your body.  If the heart beat at the same rate, the pressures in your brain would suddenly become so large that you’d be at risk of a stroke.  This obviously doesn’t happen in healthy people, because the body has multiple mechanisms to self-regulate.</p>
<p>Now obviously, there are other reasons you may have slightly elevated blood pressure during an amputation...physical stress/trauma causing an increased sympathetic response, psychosocial stress, fluid shifts, etc...but as a whole, blood pressure is more or less maintained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if your were to suddenly amputate your legs and the only blood that was lost was the blood that would have been present in your legs anyway.</p>
<p>It shouldn't be a huge deal to the heart. At least not in terms of volume. </p>
<p>Think of it like a 2Litre bottle of drink. You suddenly cut it down to a 1.25L bottle.</p>
<p>The bottle is still full the missing 0.75 litres has disappeared with the rest of the bottle.</p>
<p>The heart is only worried about maintaining the same pressure. If it is pumping 1.25 litres in a 1.25 litre system. There is no change and it keeps on chugging. </p>
<hr />
<p>If the pressure is below what the body expects(because extra blood was lost, the body will start making more)</p>
<p>If the pressure is above what the body expects(The kidneys will start filtering excess liquids out of the circulatory system until it returns to expected pressure levels)</p></div>		</li>
