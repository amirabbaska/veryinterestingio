			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also worth noting that many companies use &quot;pear juice&quot; as a filler &quot;fruit&quot; juice.</p>
<p>Any drink that says it is &quot;100% juice&quot;, is likely mostly apple and pear juice + minority % of the juice advertised on the label.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the Netherlands it's often apple juice, but it may depend on what's cheaper in the region.<br />
Either way it's usually the cheap juice (often from concentrate) and preferably one that doesn't have a distinctive flavor (apple and pear fit this criteria).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add though that it's not <em>totally</em> about cutting costs and juice concentrates <em>can</em> be very dominate and strong flavors that require diluting. In certain instances, watering down flavors like grape or cranberry with apple/pear juice mutes the flavor enough for it to have the correct taste. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More often than not the ingredients are similar to this:</p>
<p>70-90% Water, typically followed by one or more Juice concentrates at about 20-5% then citric acid, for a fruity type sour, a preservative, and the coloring.</p>
<p>Edit: Copied from a Welches 100% Grape Juice Bottle:</p>
<p>Grape Juice From Concentrate (Filtered Water, Grape Juice Concentrate), Grape Juice, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), No Artificial Flavors or Colors Added.</p>
<p>So in addition to water and juice concentrate, we have a very low amount of real grape juice, Probobly &lt;5%. We also have ascorbic acid, which is that fruity sour, but it is a 'natural' flavor, so they can claim no artificial flavors. </p>
<p>From a business aspect think about like this. You are the business owner of a fruit juice company. You pay the farmers 2 cents for every ten grapes. 1,500 grapes fill a standard size bottle with juice. So your juice costs you 3 dollars in juice alone, not counting packaging, labeling, and shipping (add +1 dollar)</p>
<p>So we've arrived at about $4 a bottle of pure, 100% grape juice. To make a decent profit you need to sell this juice for at least 250% of what it cost to make. So your juice on the shelf costs $10.</p>
<p>Now imagine you've run across juice concentrate. So you can fill your bottles with 85% water, 10% concentrate, and 5% juice (for simplicity).</p>
<p>Lets say to concentrate juice 1/2 of your juice from the grapes goes away. With that concentrate though you can fill 5 bottles of juice when the normal amount would be 1 bottle. So now you have expanded your profits by Ã—5. You sell 5 times the bottles while spending the same amount of money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a wide variety, and even though they most often don't lie about t being 100% fruit juice, it's often not the kind of fruit you'd expect.<br />
And more importantly, it's not even as healthy as you would expect. They usually only package the juice, which is often full of the natural sugars in the fruit.<br />
If you eat a fruit normally, you'd not eat a lot of fruit at once, and you'd normally eat the whole fruit (or the whole fruit minus the peel, which in much fruits is edible (you can even eat kiwi, banana and citrus peels) and healthy but often not eaten). The whole fruit contains some sugars (but percentage-wise much less sugar than juice, especially if it's concentrated juice), but also a lot of fibres.<br />
Sometimes you can buy apple juice and orange juice with pulp/mush and those are usually the healthier options (not always, as they can cheat with this as well).<br />
Basically most fruit juice is just about as healthy as lemonade (and just marginally healthier than soda), and it's basically a high dose of liquid sugar. (Note that sugar itself isn't bad, just the sheer quantities of it we consume on average while not having enough of foods to counteract the sugar, like fibers).<br />
For example <a href="http://www.welchs.com/products/100-juices/grape-100-juices/100-grape-juice-with-fiber" target="_blank">Welch 100% grape juice with fiber</a> compared to <a href="https://g.co/kgs/gBrMVh" target="_blank">real grapes</a> is actually pretty close to real grapes (although the juice has a lot more salt for some reason, and apparently also added vitamin C, at the cost of potassium).<br />
The version <a href="http://www.welchs.com/products/100-juices/grape-100-juices/100-grape-juice" target="_blank">without fibers</a> has exactly 0 fibers (but also a bit less salt, still far more salt than actual grapes though).<br />
Comparing <a href="http://www.minutemaid.com/products/orange-juice/premium-original/" target="_blank">minute maid</a> to actual <a href="https://g.co/kgs/j3tgqi" target="_blank">oranges</a> turns out minute maid performs shockingly bad.<br />
Most juices retain the sugars, but discard the fibers. If you are looking for healthy juices, try looking for those with a reasonable fiber content or just make your juice yourself.</p></div>		</li>
