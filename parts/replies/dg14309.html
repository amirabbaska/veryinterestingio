			<div class="markdown"><p>I was once on a kayaking tour where they provided a packed lunch with an orange in it. It was only when I was half way through peeling it by hand that I noticed half of the group were staring at me in amazement as I removed the skin in one continuous spiral. I don't think I've ever impressed anyone since doing something so simple. </p></div>		</li>
