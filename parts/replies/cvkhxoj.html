			<div class="markdown"><p>It tastes like water.</p>
<p>Source:  I used to be a pharmaceutical chemist and used D2O to run NMR samples with some frequency.  I got curious at one point, did a small amount of reading, and drank about a ml of it.  No effect other than a brief &quot;I'm gonna die&quot; panic that I'm sure was purely psychosomatic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not in the same concentration. Concentration is also important for some aspects of physiology - if you have a toxic substance spread out over your body, it might not do damage, but if all that toxic was concentrated in, say, your liver, it might damage the liver. Very simplified example but I think the concept is clear. ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two kinds of heavy water. You've got DHO and D2O. The overwhelming amount of heavy water that we naturally drink is DHO. So it's not a given that 1 mL of D2O would be harmless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, heavy water sinks in regular water.<br />
So it's unevenly distributed on our planet, and you probably don't need to worry about it at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll just add that heavy water has quite different H-O bond strengths to normal water (due the zero-point vibrational energy being different), which means that enzymatic and chemical reactions will happen at different rates, and so it will disrupt some enzymatic pathways. This isn't good for your health! Other isotopes like Carbon-12/13/14 have essentially negligible effect on their chemistry and biology (Unless you are making new C-C bonds, eg in plants) ; it's only really Hydrogen isotopes which behave different biologically.</p>
<p>[Edit, C isotopes can make a difference in C-C bond formation/breaking which can be significant for plant/bacteria; growth rates]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is likely that the enzymatic reaction rate changes are related to the <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00299200#page-1" target="_blank">circadian rhythm effects</a> of consuming heavy water.  It's been well documented for decades that giving animals heavy water makes their daily rhythms longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I logged in just to say that I learned this last semester in a class on biological clocks. Our professor related how, when he was doing animal experimentation in the 70's at Berkeley, the researchers wouldn't do anything to the animal subjects that they wouldn't also do to themselves. He volunteered to consume D20, which lengthened his circadian rhythms and kept him awake for days. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. </p>
<p>C12/13/14 behave differently in enzymes, which is why you see substantial C13 depletion in C3 plants. Their rates of C-H activation are quite a bit different. Using C-14 as a radiotracer accentuates this even further, and caused a lot of confusion during early investigation of the Calvin cycle. This is also why  cultures grown on C13 labelled glucose for protein NMR experiments grow very slowly compared to their C12 analogues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if you can conclude that 50% is the toxic point, given their study.  There must be some continuum between chronic and acute toxicity, and the study cited in the Wikipedia article is a funny middle-ground: the rats were drinking 50% D2O, but it took a week to achieve a biological concentration of 15%.</p>
<p>At 15% they saw behavioral changes, and by 25% there were definite negative signs (necrotic tails).  It took more than a month to hit 30% D2O, but they were dying during that time.  I haven't read it carefully, but I actually can't find where they state that a 50% D2O makeup in the body would be acutely fatal: maybe that's an extrapolation?  It seems reasonable.</p>
<p>On the flip side, maintaining at 10-25% would probably cause chronic poisoning.  You might not survive a year at that level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good points. It's worth noting that toxicity was evident at lower concentrations. It's difficult to extrapolate from rats to humans as well, probably better to err on the side of safety anyway and assume even 5% would be toxic. </p>
<p>It's probably best to avoid drinking uncertain substances altogether. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know personally of researchers who have been involved in recent studies providing D2O to human subjects.  I don't know exactly what concentrations they used, but it was not-insignificant: probably 20-95% for their input, and hitting maximum biological levels of 10-20%?</p>
<p>This would have been for brief periods of time, since the point was to get flux data for biomolecules.  But this kind of experiment has definitely been carried out.</p></div>		</li>
