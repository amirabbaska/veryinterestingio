			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's more to do with the reduction in blood pressure when you stand up too quickly and get a head rush.</p>
<p>There's no physical force being applied to your eye to make the visual distortions, but I presume enough blood not getting to your eye causes the cells to send similarly strange messages.</p>
<p>Anecdotally if I apply pressure to my eyes it becomes like a trippy 90s space game where shapes are passing me by but a headrush seems to be more of like my eyes just malfunction and there's colour and shape distortion or nothing at all.</p>
<p>So I'm going to say they're a wee bit different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds about right. The headrush fractal doobydoo is quite vivid and impressive in a way, almost a look at how some part of your brain works. Def get that 80s/90s space game vibe with that too. If I lived in a far gone age id think we were seeing something magical. </p>
<p>But as always it's just my brain dying a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your eyeballs are very sensitive to the amount of oxygen available to them. When you stand up too quickly you momentarily reduce blood flow, and thus oxygen to your eyes, which manifests as spots, tunnel vision, dimming, etc. You are essentially experiencing the same visual impairment a pilot does when they perform a maneuver requiring increased G loading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ophthalmologist here, many children born with poor vision will purposefully push on their eyes for this stimulus (oculodigital stimulation). However, it depends on what is causing their blindness, you need an intact optic nerve and retinal ganglions to form the stimulus response. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just from an MD, and a guy who loved neurobiology in undergrad, I'll add to this. </p>
<p>Many say your retina is another part of your brain, and in some ways this is true, your dura, arachnoid, and pia mater extend down the optic nerve, and the neurons that transmit from initial processing in the retina only synapse when they reach the occipital lobe, as opposed to the standard synapses in the brain stem and spinal cord of other external stimuli systems. </p>
<p>Now, a point of interest is, a lot of initial image processing is done at the level of the retina, before you ever leave the eyeball. Your rods and cones detect light, but how they work is by combining in large groups. They actually form kind of donut like shapes, where there's an outer circle and an inner circle. Enough light or dark on one part of the circle vs the other, leads to a particular set state in the next cell up the chain. Now, your brain ignores constant states, it only likes things that change. So, a signal only transmits down the optic nerve when the set state of that cell is changing. As in, light and dark or color are shifting on that donut shape of rods and cones. Meaning, you only get to the next set of signaling with image movement. This means that to see an image, your eye actually has to keep moving (ever notice that if you stare for a long time at one thing, the edges of your vision gray out? That's because the size and density of those little donuts is so large and sparse on the edges, you're not providing enough movement for them to fire and send a signal, but your central vision is so dense that it's virtually impossible to naturally impair movement enough to not send a signal). </p>
<p>Now, your retina also processes up to some basic lines and shapes together before sending it to your occipital lobe for further image processing. Your visual cortex actually only takes those lines and shapes and broad color swaths and puts them together into complex image recognition, integrating that data with memory and other executive functions. </p>
<p>So. When you apply pressure to the eye - you're introducing movement into the eye, as well as a physical stimulus. And your retina, being just a dumb, line and shape image recognition program, interprets that movement of vague light and dark and pressure signals as random light bursts, colors, and sometimes shapes. And because it's not tied to what you're actually seeing, your visual cortex doesn't offer you any good pattern recognition beyond, &quot;oooh shiny.&quot;</p>
<p>Now - hallucinations - this is an intricate topic. Medically speaking, hallucinations tend to be poorly defined in regards to what we care about (boils down to psychiatric, neurological, or other cause). However, I find it helpful to look at the anthropological literature when examining hallucinations further, as they have classed out phases of visual hallucinatory activity and it marries well with the neurobiological understanding of vision. And, weirdly enough, it ties in well with cave paintings. </p>
<p>There are really two big categories along a spectrum here, the first being relatively basic hallucinatory activity, where a person sees lines, shapes, colors, etc. There will be things like spirals, odd geometric patterns and the like. This describes that more distal retinal processing of information. The second category is more complex, seeing a person or shadow, interpreting stimulus as more complex objects and patterns, this is accomplished primarily by the occipital lobe and visual cortex. If you look at cave paintings and how shamans and the like of current hunter-gatherer type cultures, you see them purposefully trying to enter hallucinatory states, either chemically, through meditation, or other means, and they tend to draw out what they see. If you look at old cave paintings, alongside shadowy figures, you'll often see random geometric patterns, spirals, and other shapes and splashes of color. The thought being - hallucinatory activity, in this regard, tends to progress along that spectrum up more centrally in optical processing. Note, this spectrum doesn't progress similarly in psychiatric conditions, where auditory hallucinations are more common. </p>
<p>As for the other question from other commenters on blurred/grainy vision on standing - this is from a phenomenon of mild orthostasis, where it takes a few seconds for your venous system to appropriately contract to compensate for the pull of gravity acting in full force along the whole length of your body compared to a sitting position. The resultant very mild dip in blood pressure leads to the very high metabolic areas of the retina to briefly stop sending as many signals - and so less vision. Similar to how you get a dead leg sensation with following pins and needles if your compressing a nerve too long sitting, and it suddenly gets nutrient flow back when you stand up. </p></div>		</li>
