			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point, but a superconducting transformer would perform better without a ferromagnetic core, with the coils wound co-axially.  Ferromagnetic cores are used for traditional magnets to concentrate the field, but superconducting magnets are so much more efficient in terms of current density and field strength that ferritic cores are a drawback.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Sir, would you open that container so that I can check for the presence of liquids?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure thing, officer.&quot; (Nitrogen boils away)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for the airport security so I've played around with walkthrough metal detectors quite a bit. one thing I noticed that might lend insight into how this would work is that ladies wearing solid dense metal bracelets (not chains) would set off the alarm. but if they disconnected the clasp the bracelet would pass through just fine.  </p></div>		</li>
