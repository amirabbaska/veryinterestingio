			<div class="markdown"><p>In practical terms, Theravadin laypeople who actually meditate will tend to get stream entry through vipassana practice (or some combination of vipassana and samatha) after a couple of years of about two hours a day of quality practice and a couple of intensive one month-long retreats (it varies depending on the practioner, quality of instructions, etc.). At least that's the metric for Mahasi-style vipassana, which is one of the most widespread meditative styles in Theravada. Other paths follow after stream entry (first path).</p>
<p>As far as I've heard it reported, what actually feels like enlightenment tends to happen around third path, which is a lot more complicated to attain (despite the technique being the same), but mostly because it requires much stronger concentration than the first two (good samatha skills help a lot). The skills gained from this sort of practice are very useful for Mahayana practice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of dogma, the &quot;it takes aeons&quot; stuff is because people don't meditate. In a vipassana retreat of any kind, you'll regularly hear the teachers (especially if they're monks) quote the part from the Satipatthana sutta where the Buddha guarantees that someone practicing mindfulness meditation will attain enlightenment within at most seven years and as little as a week of constant unrelenting practice. To my knowledge (having practiced in the Nyingma branch of Vajrayana, plus a bit of Zen &amp; lots of Mahasi-style vipassana), all the branches of Buddhism that actually focus on meditation promise enlightenment in this lifetime if a student meditates properly, according to the instructions, every day and goes on regular retreats. It's pretty pointless, otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you're right that it take aeons because people don't meditate and that this can be sped up if one DOES immerse themselves in practice. </p>
<p>For the monks I interviewed, it is also true that many use the stories of the lives of the Buddha to cement the idea in a practitioners mind that enlightenment in this lifetime is unlikely, for set his intention to become a Buddha many many many lifetimes before he was born as Siddhartha. Of course for them, it came with the caveat of &quot;we can help you speed it up, though!&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What traditions are you referring to when you say &quot;most sects&quot; estimate that it takes 3 aeons for you to reach enlightenment. I don't believe this to be true at all. On the contrary, it seems those sects are in the minority. It seemed that Indian Buddhist estimated these, and before Tibetan Buddhism even existed, Indian tantra was taking this seriously and asserting innovations to overcome such periods of time, including that it is possible in one life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly I'm referring to Theravada traditions in south east Asia. </p>
<p>Indian tantra of course doesn't hold that assertion. And when you get out to Chinese and Japanese Buddhist sects, time to enlightenment gets a lot more complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So One has achieved Geshe status.  Now what?  At that point, you've immersed yourself so deeply, you just stay at a monastery, and teach?  Do others go out and get jobs teaching elsewhere?</p>
<p>Is there any stigma towards someone who does leave, to get a job teaching what they were taught during their long stay?</p>
<p>I've always been curious!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Monks can stay and teach others or do move between monasteries sometimes to instruct others. </p>
<p>I think the stigma around leaving is a tricky one. If you've become a Geshe and decide to leave, it can be taken in a less than favorable way by your peers. Some people leave to become teachers and don't stay monks, which is often the reason for people being uneasy when one decides to leave. Monks moving between monasteries isn't usually a big deal, but moving to take a job at university can be. </p>
<p>On the other hand, there are plenty of monks (Geshe and non Geshe) who compete for scholarships to study in the U.S. and leaving for these programs is quite prestigious even though they're leaving their community and whatnot. The expectation there is that monks will return and help educate their monasteries and community.  </p></div>		</li>
