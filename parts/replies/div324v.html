<p>No doctor, but someone who has taken a huge interest in it since I dislocated my shoulder.</p>
<p>This is a pretty good summary of all the stuff you will find looking around on the internet.</p>
<p>Key terms:</p>
<p>Myofascial release = applying tension as mentioned</p>
<p>'active stretching' = generally used to describe the using the opposite muscle</p>
<p>Biomechanics is the term often used for this whole thing of how it's interconnected and knock on problems</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Myofascial release usually yeah is just applying tension in certain anatomic positions to ease tension in others yes, what you call &quot;active stretching&quot; we (in the D.O.) world usually call muscle energy (i.e. if you have bicep pain, having you gently curl your arm using the bicep against gentle resistance), the scenario I described about using the quad to release the hammy is call &quot;recipricol inhibition&quot;, and the most widely known technique is called HVLA (high velocity low amplitude) which is &quot;popping&quot; something! just in case you wanted to read more :)</p></div>		</li>
