			<div class="markdown"><p>It does hurt, but I've not done it for ages, and I think it's to do with the way the back of the plug has changed. When I was younger in the '80s-'90s appliances were sold with no plug, and you were expected to attach your own. Because of this, plugs were made in a kind of clamshell design held together by a big screw between the three pins, and the back (opposite the pins) was flat, probably in order for you to be able to lay it on a surface while you screwed the thing shut or tightened the cord exit clamp. It's this stable position that they also rested in when you trod on them.</p>
<p>Nowadays appliances come with the plug already attached or they use separate IEC cords, and in pretty much all cases the mains plug is moulded permanently over the wires and is an ergonomic, rounded shape which makes it much less likely to stand directly pins-upright on the floor, especially when trodden upon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why the contacts on a USB cable are recessed somewhat from the shroud: the shroud (system ground) always contacts first and breaks last. It's a key element of why they are safely hot-swappable and so many other connectors are not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lego plug! Seriously tho, the uk plug has a lot of good features such as shuttered sockets on the wall and a built in fuse in the plug and that long earth pin and part insulated contacts</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh you can get shuttered US sockets too, they just are not typically mandatory, and the earth pin is also slightly longer than the others. </p></div>		</li>
