			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I think it’s partly that. I’ve not done any exterior maintenance to my house in more than 10 years (my roof and siding are fine), but if I did have a roof issue or windowsill issue or whatever, I’d fix it right away. Also as I said in another comment, the very basic maintenance we all do just by living in a house (mopping floor, dusting occasionally, washing linens, vacuuming couch, etc.) hinders a lot of bacteria and mold. The activity in the place makes it less appealing to rodents and insects.</p>
<p>Oh, and I also imagine people will know if a house is vacant, and start breaking the windows (or tagging it so EVERYONE knows it’s vacant). Once one window is broken, the interior of the house is outside. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a &quot;ghost&quot; neighborhood in a suburb outside of town.  The houses were all built in the 80s.  Something happened and everyone moved out in a hurry. I think the city built a water treatment plant next door.  Its about a dozen houses all abandoned.  A combination of remoteness and proximity of a police station have kept squaters and teenagers from destroying it.  I was last there about a decade ago with my wife.  She was taking pics for a photo project about urban decay.  It was kind of erie out there but not scary.  Its like you said, more modern construction has fared better in the elements. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe you mean a wastewater treatment plant? A (drinking) water treatment plant shouldn't cause any issues (to be fair, a properly built wastewater plant shouldn't cause issues either)</p></div>		</li>
