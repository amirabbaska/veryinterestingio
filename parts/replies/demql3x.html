			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight tangent on the OP:
Our bodies don't feel temperature as an absolute value though (compare touching a 200F book and a 200F piece of metal). We feel it as a heat flux essentially. I wonder what the curve of skin heat flux vs. air temperature (at a constant humidity) would look like. And if it would be possible to double or halve the heat flux accross the skin in temperatures we experience.</p>
<p>edit: in response to /u/o99o99 check out: <a href="http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28520/do-humans-perceive-temperature-or-heat-flux-or-both" target="_blank">http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/28520/do-humans-perceive-temperature-or-heat-flux-or-both</a> . Essentially, the receptors measure skin temperature, but skin temperature changes due to heat flux from surroundings, not temperature of surrounding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;feeling&quot; is in the comment above, although not highlighted as well as it could be. We feel heat Flux, the units of which are power per unit area, W/m2. So for example you can reach in a 400F oven and the air doesn't immediately burn your hand, but touching metal within the oven would not be advisable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I skimmed wazo's lengthy post butu didn't see the formula I'm thinking of. </p>
<p>Anyway, yes there's would be a 'clean'  factor of two used to relate molecular momenta and temperature, but I'm pretty sure there's a root mean square somewhere in there. </p>

<p><strong>Basically, to double the average velocity/momentum you need to quadruple the temperature.</strong></p></div>		</li>

<p>But if you look at Energy which is a scalar quantity, then yes, the particles in the 100K sample will have twice the thermal energy as the particles in the 50K sample.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Temperature is, in rough terms, a measure of the amount of random &quot;motion&quot; atoms and molecules have at extremely small scales. For a gas, this essentially means the average speed of a given molecule in the gas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been wondering this the last week or so, I'm with you so far. Now lets assume you have a gas at temperature T1, Pressure P1 and contained in a volume V2. if you very suddenly double the volume i would expect, due to experiment*, the temperature to decrease. But how exactly are the atoms slowing down? i understand the pressure going down, and the volume increasing. And given P1 x T1 / V1 = P2 x T2 / V2 then in theory a doubling of the volume could be cancelled out by a halving of the pressure. But as stated i'd expect it to be cold.</p>
<p>*things like fridges, air conditioning and even things like fire extinguishers get cold due to this.</p>
<p>Also by saying temp is the average speed of the molecules in the gas are you not linking very directly temperature and pressure? if pressure is how often and how fast a certain area is hit by molecules and temp is how fast the molecules move doesn't that mean temp and pressure are essentially the same thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The equation would be P1 x V1 / T1 = P2 x V2 / T2 = n x R, and like you hinted at, the the final state of the system requires two variables (in addition to the initial state of the system) to fully characterize the system. So you could double the volume, but keep pressure constant to double the temperature (T2 / T1 = V2 / V1). The final pressure and volume were specified and therefore the temperature could be calculated.</p>
<p>The process you are alluding to is an expansion through a nozzle (for a fire extinguisher) or an expansion valve (for a refrigeration cycle). In both cases the drop in temperature happens for two reasons, change of phase and expansion of a gas. I'll focus on the expansion of a gas. Here, the pressure is decreased (a lot), the &quot;volume&quot; increases, but overall the temperature decreases. How is this possible?</p>
<p>Above I said you needed to specify two properties at the final state to describe the system, and that's true. However, by assuming the process happens in a certain way, you can specify the the entropy of the final state (as opposed to the volume) and find the resulting temperature and volume that way. Here are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isentropic_process#Table_of_isentropic_relations_for_an_ideal_gas" target="_blank">isentropic relations</a> for a gas. It turns out the temperature drops even though the &quot;volume&quot; increases.</p>
<p>Edit: if you have any questions please ask, this stuff can be difficult even when you know all the definitions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Firstly thank you for getting back to me i appreciate it. </p>
<p>interesting how the examples i give are of of this process. (in an idealised, or &quot;work compensated&quot; state), although this is probably why i'm asking the question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Above I said you needed to specify two properties at the final state to describe the system, and that's true. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can't find it in the main comment you posted as the answer to OP's question, am i missing something? can you link me to it please? or are you talking 2 of the three properties (P,V,T), in your response to my original post?</p>
<p>thank you so much for your link (isoentropic relations), i had to do a lot of mental maths, logic and struggling to work it out but by looking at the second identity down it makes sense that this is true, kind of i think. </p>
<p>there is just one problem, and it might have to be some i just accept, although i agree the laws are correct, that i can work it out for myself etc; I still cannot intuitively grasp exactly what temperature is. I assume, its more complicated than that?</p>
<p>also follow up. how can i identify &quot;isentropic&quot; processes? when they are adiabatic only, with no other conditions placed on them?</p>
<p>again thanks so much for your help.</p></div>		</li>
