			<div class="markdown"><p>Engineer here.  Bullshit detector going off big time.  None of this story makes sense.  Energy appearing from nowhere to explode the water upward.  A delay with a low rumble.  That it had to be done simultaneously with military precision.  Even if they were pressure assist flushes, the total pressure in the system wouldn't go above its design pressure.  If OP said that boom, we cracked the sewer lateral that was made of vitreous clay, I could buy that.  But an explosion from the sinks and toilets ala Ghostbusters?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plumber here, looked up the high school in question and it appears to be 3 stories.  Depending on building dimensions and 2.31 ft head = 1 psi and the fact that your dealing with hydraulics the water could hit the roof easily in the lowest story depending on what was going on with the drainage in the building.</p>
<p>If you were there to witness some of the loaded clean outs I've pulled off due to clogged drains you'd understand.  Some of it is embellished for story telling sakes but a lot of it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Edit: there is also an equation for converting water velocity being suddenly stopped into pressure for water hammer purposes, but I've never used it before and it applies lightly in this situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya..and change rooms in basement as well....it happened....I ran from that washroom it was hilarious.  We were all a little worried about the consequences for a while but then realized that it was pretty hard to identify let alone punish hundreds of students for a prank gone bad.....well....good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Used to be a licensed plumber. He's full of shit. The only time over ever heard of something like this happening was when the city was trying to jet out sewer lines and attached the hose in the wrong direction. But even a poorly sized and vented drainage system wouldn't do this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like seeing how you are being abused here.  This is most certainly possible and likely. This exact test is done to verify large venues, like stadiums, where a very high amount of simultanous uses is not only possible, but very likely.  Think about visiting team batting (who cares), time-outs, and American football half-time.</p></div>		</li>
