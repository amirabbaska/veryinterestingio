			<div class="markdown"><p>The pathogens are entirely on the exterior unless the steak gets punctured or the animal is sick and shouldn't be used for food. Source: The Art and Science of cooking. Basically an enormously wealthy cooking enthusiast set up a kitchen lab with staff and created a fine dining molecular science cookbook. Basically The Mythbusters of cookbooks. It's why rare and blue steaks can be eaten and people don't get ill. Also covers the egg myth, meaning all eggs in the U.S. unless farmers market/farm procured have to be pasteurized which is why an egg with a clean shell used for cookie dough can be eaten and not make people sick. These are things readers shouldn't attempt without reading the book and have kitchen experience focusing on how not to cross contaminate or contaminate the food you're working with and knife skills though. Food handled improperly can be extremely dangerous. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modernist-Cuisine-Art-Science-Cooking/dp/0982761007" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/Modernist-Cuisine-Art-Science-Cooking/dp/0982761007</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you looking for the etymological root of the word &quot;rare&quot;? Sorry, I don't know. I will say that in the world of cooking, things are rarely named the obvious choice and terms come from multiple root languages and are super confusing. As for not answering your question correctly I apologize, I guess I was reacting to all of the responses that are now deleted more than I was to your original question. My sincerest apologies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth I found that very interesting.</p>
<p>Over the past few years I've gone from medium, to medium rare and now mostly eat rare. However, I've had a nervousness because I thought the middle bit of the meat when cooked less, as with rare, may be more prone to carrying bacteria.  However it sounds like that's not the case and it is just the outside I need to worry about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No need to apologize! I really appreciate what you wrote and I love hearing from chefs about food. I was just looking for more information as to how, culturally, eating steaks at certain temperatures developed and why they are labeled as they are. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I loved your response. Re the cantaloupes, what sort of wash do they need? A rinse? A scrub? </p>
<p>Also, have you thought of doing a LPT?</p></div>		</li>
