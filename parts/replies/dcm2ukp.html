			<div class="markdown"><p>As a follow up, I work for a credit fund, and I'm trying to imagine coming across a presentation of a porn company.</p>
<p>&quot;Company produces adult content, mostly of women from eastern parts of the world. Clientele is focused on 'creepy white males' between the ages of 20 - 50.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Company would like to acquire funds to move into the 'homoerotic' market.&quot;</p>
<p>Seriously, who invests in these guys?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Investors are definitely more scarce in the adult industry now than in the boom years, but that's much more duye to the fact that the internet has eaten into their revenue streams than anything else.  I've never met a money man who would turn away a solid ROI because of something as tame as the bizzare fetishes of the people of the internet generation. </p>
<p>But, without having actually seen one for myself, I imagine the company would present itself less with the actual focus of the fetish, and more of their brand image, advertising, merchandising, quality of talent, or the technology behind their programming if they're striving to become some sort of aggregator. </p>
<p>There's a wonderful scene in Silicon Valley that sort of encapsulates that strangeness in Season 2, when Richard goes to the meeting of Adult Industry executives, and a bunch of serious business people in suits with legal pads are sitting behind nameplates with business names like &quot;Anal Screamers&quot;, etc.  </p>
<p>One area where porn is crippled compared to other similar entertainment industries that have migrated online is that because of the stigma associated with them, they have a very difficult time attracting advertisers to their site, even if they have phenomenally high average monthly users (who usually stay on the pages for longer than your average web page). </p>
<p>If that weren't the case, however, investors would be lining out the door.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm now legitimately curious what the structure of porn investments look like. Do firms raise (ahem) funds from limited partners that are then allocated to individual projects? Do studios raise working capital from traditional sources, then shop for project-specific investments from people who are basically executive producers? Do a majority of investors wear track suits on a day-to-day basis?</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, if I am your boss, and you refuse to take an investment meeting with them, I would sack you.</p>
<p>No confirmation numbers are accurate but that's what due diligence is for. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Creepy white guys 20-50 sounds like a large demographic with plenty of disposable income. A project in which &quot;actors&quot; are basically commodities sounds like a project in which you can keep costs down. If they can produce a movie for $500k and has a track record of making $1-2mn on such a movie, then why not invest?</p></div>		</li>
