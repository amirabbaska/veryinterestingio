<p>giving people one week to deposit </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Horribly misinformed comment. People have 50 days to deposit and if they cant deposit in that time period, they have an option to deposit till march (filling up some extra forms).</p>
<p>Personally, I deposited all my notes two days ago and all in all it took 15 minutes and was painless. There were long lines at the ATMs for a few days but they seem to have reduced a lot these days (I can only speak for ATMs near me).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modi came back within a couple of days, stating that airports, hospitals and a few other agencies would accept the notes for a longer period of time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope, if you watch his nation-wide address this was said on the SAME day as the demonetization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Banks would accept deposits, but limited withdraws.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only cash withdraws. Withdrawal slips still work same as before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Merchants would no longer accept ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes, even within the legal period</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The legal period was only till midnight and the announcement was made in the evening. Crooked gold merchants were still accepting old notes at 20-30% premium though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>some companies forcing large payments via credit cards only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an extremely good thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think of how you would do so if you happened to be vacationing in another country at the time. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it was 50 days. You seem to be horribly misinformed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Imagine taking the two largest notes in your country and giving people one week to deposit them into the bank.</p>

<p>Nobody accepts the €200 and €500 in the Netherlands anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do realize the value of the currency right? 200 Euros would be like 14470 Indian Rupee. If a 15000 Indian Rupee cashnote would be made, shops wont accept it too. Imagine if you're a shop owner and someone is buying items worth 300 Indian Rupee and they pay out 15000.<br />
Same in the part of Netherlands where you are. It's hard to replace all your notes with a big note as it will be hard to give change to other customers. </p></div>		</li>
