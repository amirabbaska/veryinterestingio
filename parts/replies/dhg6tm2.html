<p>EDUCATION: Less education = more children</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd add a #5 to this:</p>
<p>5) People from poor backgrounds and families with low level of education are more likely to lack perspective of other options and social expectations that they'll stick with education instead of having kids. If you're a teenager from a poor family, where nobody has gone to college, and mom stays home with the kids, in a poor area where everyone else does the same thing, then churning out babies looks like a solid and viable choice - and more attainable than finishing school, going to college, spending four years studying, getting a start on a career, etc etc. If you're 16 you're looking at a 10+ year plan to fight your way out of poverty vs a &lt;1 year plan to have a similar life as your parents. Sure you're going to be grinding away for years trying to make ends meet, but if that's all you've ever known... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who grew up in poor neighborhoods, that was exactly the issue for the smarter or more motivated kids.  Hard to get into a college, get a decent job, or find an apprenticeship if you don't have access to any of those things.  </p>
<p>I walked down the main business corridor in my section of the city, in triple digit weather and after 5 miles of people either telling me no or simply refusing to acknowledge my existence I finally walked into an Army recruiter office.  For the first time since I started looking, I was treated humanely, given a cup of ice cold water and some conversation.  They didn't have to ask me to sign up, I requested a contract.  </p>
<p>I was 16, and going to be kicked out of my house the day I graduated early at 17.  The parental reasoning was that I was 'smart' and could work out how to sign binding contracts under age 18, find a great job, and get into college on a full ride- because smart people just get those things, right?  What I didn't know was that there was a union training center 12 miles away, which I would have crawled to daily had I known it (or even unions) existed.  Other options, like applying for a govt job as a file clerk were simply out of reach as well, due to both distance and my age.</p>
<p>Ignorance in poor communities is just crushing.  It took about a decade of serious re-education on my part to even begin to understand what middle class expectations are really like.  Until then, my life didn't move forward much, because I was like an ignorant immigrant in a foreign land.  If anything, I'd say that is why poor immigrants tend to perform better than the local poor; they know that there are some expectations that have to be discovered and learned before participating more fully in what a society has to offer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a very similar experience. I am relatively smart and definitely nerdy, but growing up in a poor community with little opportunity to develop my strengths was a huge factor into why I joined the army. It didn't help that I looked like I was there to rob the store or something. Even though I was able to get accepted at a state school and get some scholarships, I was going to have to get loans. And I saw first hand how banks and such screwed people over, so I refused to get loans. The army paid for my schooling and now I am not doing too bad.
I would like to point out that factors are just that, factors. I married at 20 and had my first son at 21. I now have 5 kids. My wife is finishing her PhD, and we have moved to middle-class​. Just because someone married young or had kids before 30 doesn't mean their life choices suck. I know I may be an outlier, but it annoys me every time people assume we are still poor and uneducated and are just pumping out kids and &quot;continuesly&quot; live on some form of welfare. The people in my new neighborhood are all very educated and look at me and my family like &quot;how are they living here?&quot; We are obviously early-mid 30's and have five kids and two dogs. I end up talking to them and it always comes to the same factors that people have been stating here: the poor marry young (us), have kids early (us), and are uneducated because of those &quot;horrible&quot; life choices (not us).
Anyway, I think I rambled on enough. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they just end up breeding. My husbands family is a bunch of breeders. 16 yr old niece gets pregnant an has a miscarriage. I told my husband's mom the it was for the best. She says &quot;awww, she wanted something to love so badly&quot;  and I, trying to keep calm say &quot; get her a fucking dog then!!&quot;  Doesn't even know who the father was of the next one she got pregnant with and had. Family get togethers were the worst! I don't think any of them graduated high school. They yelled at each other, they screamed at the kids; they'd have big bowls of candy out and ice chests filled with soda. No wonder the kids were running around like little banshees. Glad I got the hell out of there and am back with my family</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I've noticed as well. I know two women who had children at 18-19 (which is actually about 2 years later than the local average) and are actually good parents. I think it begins with a shitty, neglectful upbringing which usually ends up having the kids act out in school and place less importance on education. They are unfamiliar with volition, or trying anything difficult mentally, so they give up when they hit a wall in school. If they end up graduating, they'll get a local waitress or cashier job or just mooch off their boyfriend. Said boyfriend tells her he loves her two weeks in, she thinks it's real, and maybe with or without trying she'll get pregnant. Once she starts to show, baby daddy (who is probably significantly older than her, 24-26) leaves and finds another 16-18 year old to impregnate. </p>
<p>This is just what I've noticed in my bubble of the world though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. My husband's dad was 26, maybe separated with 4 kids, then gets my husband's mom pregnant at 14!!!  She has no education so doesn't instill it in the kids how important it is. Funny thing is that my husband and his 6 siblings ( not counting the first 4) don't do drugs but all their kids did. My husband is a shitfuck of a parent. They all passed down shit for brains. Glad they all live far away. You'd think they were from the back hills of Tennessee, dropped into LA by a tornado</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in a Texas city where our sex ed. was abstinence only. We were taught nothing about condoms, the pill, or any other contraceptive. Matter of fact we had some abstinence-only motivational speaker come to the school and did the whole promise ring crap “to save ourselves.” We were also shown awful pictures of STIs and told “this is what happens when you have sex.” So not everyone gets good education. Some of us get shafted. Thankfully, my mom is awesome and talked to me about safe sex and was always supportive about that kind of stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What was your day to day experience in high school? Did you hear a lot of misinformation from other teens? Like people saying you can't get pregnant if you are a virgin, or that women pee out of the vagina. I heard that kind of nonsense and my school in Southern California did have a sex Ed class in school. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Sex education​ depends on a lot of factors. Look at your district, city, neighborhood, and family cultures.</p>
<p>I also live in a conservative state and went to a high school that taught decent sex ed. I learned about contraception, STDs, etc. However, at home, my parents had a very... abstinence-inspired take on sex education​. I brought up the pill with my mom, and she told me that it's just like having an abortion (which is a huge sin) and has a VERY high risk of giving me cancer. Also accused me of wanting to be super promiscuous, despite me being a homely recluse (who preferred women anyway). I noped right out of that one. I didn't learn about the pill in an adequate way for years after that discussion because of how badly it scared me.</p>
<p>Guess who had sex with guys anyway, just without the pill? THIS GUY. Nothing happened thankfully, but yeah. It takes a village. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ya I dont know why this person mentioned Canada. Canada has a great program for sex ed. We started learning about sex ed in grade 5 and continued to high school. I remember grade 9 gym turned into sex ed for a few weeks that covered everything including delving into all the different options of contraceptives. </p>
<p>To add to that, I went to a catholic grade school and a public high school and both systems taught us a lot. </p></div>		</li>
