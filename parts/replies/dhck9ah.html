			<div class="markdown"><p>The Oscar process seems to be much more straightforward. There is a nomination round where voters give their top 5 nominees in order of preference. After nominations are determined by the preferential voting system, final ballots are sent out. Also, voters are restricted to nominating only in their respective fields and asked to only vote in their areas of expertise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You just said the same thing as the commenter above you: subcommittees select the nominees, but the entire academy gets to vote on the winners in each category. For example, directors only nominate directors, cinematographers only nominate cinematographers, etc. But once the nominees are decided, then everyone in the academy can vote on the best director out of the nominees, best cinematographer out of the nominees, etc. So the OP's question remains unanswered: why is there a preference for mainstream music at the Grammys while the oscars have a preference for prestige films?</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think it comes down to the reputation of the oscars, which was established almost a century ago as a prestigious of what industry members consider a highfalutin art form, and the fact that academy members are so brainwashed by that reputation that they perpetuate it year after year by voting for those kinds of films. Everyone knows what an Oscar bait movie is, including the academy voters, because they vote for them year after year!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the difference is that directors pick the original 5 directors being nominated and cinematographers choose best in their own field as you said, while in Grammys it's the same group of industry people choosing it year after year. </p>
<p>If Nas and Questlove were part of the group whittling the rap category down to 5 originally you better believe more experimental stuff would make the list.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, apparently oscars are extremely valuable capital in the industry for attracting employment and money.  They sustain reputation, increase wages and can even revive careers. </p>
<p>Grammy's are similar in some ways, but they are awarded much more plentifully; per artist and per ceremony. Overall flooding the talent market with recognition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't part of it that the Grammys are split by genre, but the Oscars are not?  You can win Best Rap Album but not Best Comedy Movie.</p>
<p>It's true that the Oscars are (almost) 100 years old, but almost all the winners were popular films until the age of the blockbuster in the 1970s, starting with <em>Jaws</em>, when voters started supporting less mainstream films.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I despise country music but I love Sturgill Simpson and Chris Stapleton, Jason Isbell and that whole group of musicians but I think it's more because they sound more like blues/bluegrass to me than they do anything I can imagine when I think of country music. </p>
<p>For instance listening to call to arms (the song you posted above), that sounds like a blues-rock band jamming to me than it does country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sturgil's first album <em>High Top Mountain</em> is a lot more country sounding than his last two albums, which feel more country influenced. I love what he's doing with genre even if it's pushing it a little bit. If the other two artists you mentioned are similar I'll give them a listen! </p></div>		</li>

<p>2nd album of all time with 5 number one hits. Only behind MJ's Bad. I was completely surprised it didn't win at the time. </p></div>		</li>
