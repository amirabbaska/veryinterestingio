			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand you correctly, in your analogy the grid of the LCD screen and the grid of the imaging sensor are the 'screens' and are creating an interference pattern which distorts the image <a href="http://www.carstennicolai.de/d/works/img/moire_film.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a> because they do not line up perfectly.</p></div>		</li>

There's no grid pattern to cause the interference.</p></div>		</li>
