			<div class="markdown"><p>Notably, vegetable is strictly a culinary term, while fruit is used in both culinary and scientific arenas. Thus, if you call spinach a vegetable, you should call a tomato a vegetable. If you call a tomato a fruit, you should call spinach a leaf.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because we're talking culinary terms, it's not that cut an dry. For example, peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, and pumpkins all bear seeds, but would typically be considered vegetables and not fruits (again, culinary definitions). It has more to do with sweetness and how they're used. </p></div>		</li>
