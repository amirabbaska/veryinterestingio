<p>you'd get a number that represented only a vanishingly small percentage of infinity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, because infinity isn't a number.  You can't compare a number to infinity with something like a percentage.  Infinity is a <strong>concept</strong> that is near-impossible for humans to conceptualize.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, in this context I find the thought of infinity to be much easier to grasp than gigantic numbers. It takes away a lot of the guesswork, ambiguity, and scale-induced vertigo. If you told me the universe was infinite, I could easily accept and understand that. I mean, there's really nothing more to be said. But if you told me it was, say, TREE(3) light years across, I would find that oddly frightening and dizzying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But in the context of this discussion, we're assuming there is no end. And no beginning either for that matter.</p>
<p>Furthermore, only for objects that are sufficiently far apart will the expansion of space cause them to become causally disconnected, and that distance is quite large.</p></div>		</li>
