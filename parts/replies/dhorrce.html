<p>Similarly, there are lots of indirect predictions of string theory that do not require enormous particle accelerators.</p>

<p>For example?</p>
<p>(not counting postfactum predictions like gravity)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, for one, predictions like that should not be blown off so lightly. It's a ridiculously nontrivial thing to do. It's so hard, in fact, that no other theory can even come close to doing it. Interestingly, before the mid '90s or so, there <em>were</em> competitors to string theory. They all seemed to be very different generalizations of relativity and of quantum field theory. They were all independently discovered by different people following different lines of thought. It turned out that they were all parts of string theory.</p>
<p>So, being able to reproduce not only gravity, but ordinary quantum field theories, is an extremely difficult thing to do.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the predictions are difficult to explain in a nontechnical way. Most of modern physics isn't really about what non-physicists think a &quot;prediction&quot; is. It's not about predicting a particular number that's measured in an experiment, it's all about very sophisticated structures that underpin our models of the universe. </p>
<p>Asking &quot;what predictions does string theory make about particle physics&quot; is kind of like asking &quot;what predictions does chemistry make about evolution.&quot; The answer is <em>a lot</em>, but the two topics are separated by many levels of very sophisticated abstraction that makes it hard for non-experts to understand the significance of the connections between them.</p>
<p>That said, the killer example, and one most amicable to hand-wavy pop-science feel-good explanations, is AdS/CFT, which is an equivalence between a particular kind of quantum field theory (which are known to be correct) and a particular class of models in string theory.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In what sense is CFT “correct”?  The standard model isn’t a CFT.</p>
<p>And what’s the reason to believe that AdS/CFT has anything to do with
physics and isn’t “just” math?</p></div>		</li>

<p>For completionism's sake, not everybody agrees with this.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point of scientific experimentation is entirely to distinguish between theories. One of the issues string theory may have, according to critics, is far too many degrees of freedom, such that you can match it to any data. This inherently means a lack of predictive capacity.</p>
<p>You have been sidestepping the relevant philosophy of science. String theory has advanced a lot, but it is not living up to the hype for good reasons, not just because it is hard. It was well motivated, and is still promising, but temper your expectations mate.</p></div>		</li>
