			<div class="markdown"><p>I've often wondered about the bail bondsmen. So if the person runs, then gets caught - the bondsmen gets their money back? Is that unique to bail bondsmen, or would someone who ran, then got caught later get their cash back as well? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah - so if someone did run, then gave themselves up, they'd get the cash back too. That makes sense. Thanks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In practice bondsmen get their money back no matter what and don't spend that much time hunting people down unless it's for a crazy high bond. Bond companies have some of the best lobbyists in the country. They also donate tons of money to judicial campaigns. Usually someone who skips bail is picked up by cops on a random stop and the judge just turns the bond money back over to the bondsman and sets a new one on the defendant.</p></div>		</li>
