<p>With trigonometric functions, they go even further to reduce the argument to a certain range, such as zero to pi. However, we cannot do this with square roots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You absolutely can. For non-negative a and b, sqrt(ab) = sqrt(a)sqrt(b).</p>
<p>So sqrt(50000) = sqrt(5)sqrt(10000) = 100 sqrt(5).</p>
<p>EDIT: In fact, this was the basis of log tables and slide rules, which typically gave results for arguments between 1 and 10.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The algorithms give a &quot;close enough&quot; answer using simpler math, which the calculator does a few more times for good measure. Even if the process is only accurate to one extra digit, you only need to run it on the result seven more times on your eight-digit calculator to get a decent answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh! This is my chance to shine! Alright let's give it a go.</p>
<p>Imagine you're driving down the highway. You want to know exactly where your car will be in 10 seconds. Well, you're going to have to know some things to figure this out. You need to know first where your car starts. We call that initial position. You'll then need to know how fast it's going at the beginning. We call that velocity. You'll need to know how fast that velocity is changing - i.e. are you pressing down on the pedal or the brakes? How hard? We call that acceleration. If I have those things, I can really well estimate where that car is going to be in 10 seconds. But what if the person isn't slamming on the gas, but rather pressing it down harder and harder in the 10 seconds? Then your acceleration would be changing during that time too, so you'd have to account for that! The idea is that a Taylor series allows you to get a really good estimate for what'll happen in the future knowing only the &quot;derivatives&quot; (position, velocity, acceleration, etc.) at the beginning by adding up the contributions of the position, velocity, acceleration, etc. </p>
<p>Fully understanding Taylor series requires calculus. But how does this relate at all to calculators finding square roots and other difficult to compute functions such as sine and cosine?</p>
<p>Well, just like the car example, let's say we want to find the square root of 3. Then the calculator basically says, &quot;hmmm, I don't know what square root of 3 is, but I know that the square root of 1 is 1, and that the slope at that point is about 1/2 (the &quot;velocity&quot; or rate of change), and I know its acceleration is about -1/4 (the acceleration). That should allow me to approximate square root of 3 pretty well!&quot; Note that the values I gave (1/2 and -1/4) come from finding derivatives in calculus. That's a whole other ELI5 lesson.</p>
<p>The calculator doesn't know what the square root of 3 is exactly, but it can get an arbitrarily good approximation using just things it knows about the square root of 1, for example.</p>
<p>If you're interested in seeing this in practice, check out <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/7qhu3rpomf" target="_blank">this</a> Desmos visualization. Try increasing the &quot;a&quot; value and seeing how the purple line better and better approximates the red line. The a value corresponds to how many &quot;derivatives&quot; we're using for the approximation (0 is just initial position, 1 is initial position and initial velocity, 2 is initial position, initial velocity, and initial acceleration).</p></div>		</li>
