			<div class="markdown"><p>Most hypotheses associate handedness with either the 1) evolution of bipedalism or 2) increased task complexity (e.g. tool use). Some also elicit language as a selective pressure. There is decent evidence for the first two hypotheses so it’s hard to tell which is better supported. </p>
<p>I should note that there is a slowly emerging consensus on a very old idea that handedness is probably not under direct selection pressure but is rather a byproduct of selection for other traits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible that handedness is simply the most efficient way to learn complex motor skills, since you don't have to build as many pathways for both hands (or however skill is acquired), and then some small anomaly made right handedness more prevalent, which snowballed since it was too hard for the left handed to pick up these new skills as the learning process was very different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be much easier to have great motor skills on one hand and adequate on the other. There aren’t too many times where that is a disadvantage compared to ambidexterity. Why would being able to throw a spear with both hands equally be an advantage vs only good with one arm? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of recovery time. Baseball is a perfect proof of this. Your arm is not made to throw heavy things over and over quickly. It breaks fast if you don't let it recover.</p>
<p>There are many baseball players that are ambidextrous in throwing and hitting. However, there are only a handful that have played in the MLB with both hands throwing. This is because maximum ability with defined rest is way more important than a higher overall median skill per arm. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth linking to several papers that indicate that there is a definite and strong handedness preference in chimpanzees.  It's not as dominant as it is in humans, but it's still a pretty high level of hand preference.</p>
<p>Indications are that handedness is a trait shared by great apes.  This suggests that it is an ancestral trait that predates humans by a long time.  Humans appear to demonstrate handedness to a greater degree than other great apes, but it is not unique to humans by any means.</p>

</ul>
<p>A larger look indicates that chimpanzees are largely right handed as are gorillas, bonobos do not show any significant degree of handedness (or only a slight right handed preference), and orangutan appear to have a left-handed skew.</p>
<p>The primary reason that there was an assumption that only humans showed handedness was due to lack of data.  Now that we are starting to have decent data on non-human primates we are finding that there is indeed a population-wide handedness bias in other great apes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In short, it looks like handedness has evolved in the last few million years of our evolution but is likely at least half a million years old.</p>

<p>How do you respond to <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/01/animals-pets-cats-right-handed/#close" target="_blank">cats</a> that show a dominant 'hand' preference? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say this - Virtually all higher lifeforms on Earth exhibit some form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laterality" target="_blank">laterality</a>.  That includes cats and dogs, horses and cattle, bats, kangaroos, some birds, even fish, toads, and fruit flies!</p>
<p>So the real answer to the OP's question is &quot;somewhere between having a single central ganglion, and having two+ of them&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
