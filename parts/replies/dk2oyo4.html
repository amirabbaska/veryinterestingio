			<div class="markdown"><p>I know black holes become bigger over time, but how fast does this occur? How big is the Kerr space that this would have to happen in? Would we have to simply add a centimeter of &quot;track&quot; (or whatever) every millennium or a few meters every day or what?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The size of black holes is entirely dependent on the mass and energy they consume, so the rate of growth is going to be different for each.</p>
<p>With Hawking radiation, it is even <em>theoretically</em> possible that they <em>shrink</em>, but I believe that due to the cosmic background being at it's current energy level, they will generally increase in size in the absence of any other input unless they have about the mass of the Moon or less.</p></div>		</li>
