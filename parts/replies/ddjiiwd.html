			<div class="markdown"><p>well they didnt have internet or shampoo bottles to read while going to the latrine.  as well as, for integrals and derivatives, it's easier if you think of it in big chunks as opposed to an infinitely smooth curve.  do the cone example with like 5 different sized rings and it might visually make more sense.</p>
<p>but i am terrible about visualizing geometry in my head.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You get the same volume, but a completely different shape. It took me a bit to understand that the ring of the &quot;bowl&quot; has the same area as the circle of the sphere at every height, thus making the volumes equal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the very early observations of spheres and how their volume relates to cylinders and cones is that you can fill a sphere with water and then empty it into a cylinder or cone, giving you an immediate impression of how the volume of two shapes compare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does this differ from calculus? You're taking the sum of an area over infinitely small steps, and that sounds like an integral. But it's almost 2000 years before Newton. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He didn't take the sum of the small steps.  He simply noticed that  the area of a cross section at any height was the same between both shapes.  By showing that's true, the volumes must be the same.  He didn't calculate the volume of a sphere.  He showed that the volume of a sphere had to be the same as the volume of a cylinder minus the volume of a cone.  Volume formulas were already known for the volume of a cylinder and a cone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd posit that today one would be asked to prove that if a body has the same set of sections it has the same volume. The proof is immediate with integrals of course, but without calculus?</p>

<p>How? I mean, how do you calculate it without knowing an area of a circle? Or was that known already? </p></div>		</li>
