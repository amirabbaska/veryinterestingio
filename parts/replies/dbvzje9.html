			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't.  You can transmit CVV but you cannot store it.</p>
<p>You do not need the CVV to charge a card.  Having it means you get a better rate.  I'm not sure if it is common or possible that there's a deal that they get a better rate without CVV if they previously charged the card with CVV.</p>
<p>Forcing first purchase to use CVV is a great way to reduce fraud.  Many customers will abandon checkout if they are prompted to enter information.  Due to this many companies will take a worse rate if it means an increase in sales.</p></div>		</li>
