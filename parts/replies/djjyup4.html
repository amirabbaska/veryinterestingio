			<div class="markdown"><p>The current record and most other dives of similar height use aerated water. They are hitting a mix of air and water, with significantly less surface tension and waaaaay less density. </p>
<p>Edit: apparently the minute difference in surface tension has little effect. It's all about the compressibility of the bubbly water. Like jumping 193 feet onto a block of polyurethane foam, vs a block of solid polyurethane. (Note: don't do that.) </p></div>		</li>

<p>Something like a jacuzzi/hot-tub?  More bubbles? Less? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More bubbles.  The amount of actual water in a cubic foot is less and makes it less dense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a common error, but surface tension is negligible when considering the effects of hitting water.  The reason water is damaging to jump into from a height is its high density, not its surface tension.  It takes tremendous force to move so much mass out of the way quickly - so when you hit water at high speed, <strong>you're</strong> subjected to tremendous forces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surface tension is the wrong word, though. ST could be destroyed by a bit of soap, but it's not significant in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's really just about reducing the inertia of the water. It moves out of the way easier because it is less dense, which means it takes longer for you to slow down (less g-force) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The official world record yes is 193 but there have been 2 people to jump off the golden gate bridge at 220' to survive. I would assume theres someone who survived even more but there's no proof.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm saying 2 people that came away completely unscathed with absolutely perfect body function. 30 something have survived but only 2 known cases where the person basically shook it off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the documentary &quot;The Bridge&quot; about suicide jumpers on the Golden Gate Bridge, they interviewed a guy who survived his jump.  He said the very last thought he had before jumping was that he was ready to die and the very first thought he had after jumping was that he wished he hadn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100/102 survivors tracked in one reseaech of Golden gate attempts didn't die of suicide afterwards.  2 did.   </p>
<p>So far, I believe 25 or so people have survived the jump (in the study above, this included jumps from other locations on the bridge or intervened jumps) and all 25 are still alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, when a person jumps off the Golden Gate Bridge (or any high height into water), often the cause of death is massive internal bleeding due to organs being ripped from their place by the incredibly abrupt deceleration.</p>
<p>Additionally, any opening (mouth, anus) can expand around water the same way a hollow point bullet expands around flesh, creating massive open cavities, and peeling/tearing of the skin.</p></div>		</li>
