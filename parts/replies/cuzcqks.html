<p>Imagine one sound of 10,000 times the limit of what we can hear. And another at 10 times. Wouldn't a 1,00 times differential burst our hearing? Despite not being able to hear the lower or higher end of the differential? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Inside the cochlea, there are hair-like members that vary in length. As they vary in size, their resonant frequencies vary as well, which lets us hear over a range of frequencies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In normal atmospheric pressure there is no sound wave with an intensity that high. The pressure differential can't be more than one atm, or it would require such a thing as negative pressure. This works out at 194dB peak volume. 250 dB would be an actual explosion, not a sound wave, the difference being that in a sound wave the air particles vibrate back and forth, while in an explosion they move outward from the source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. 250 dB is practically completely unreachable. 190dB would knock over a building, but there's just no known way to reach that amplitude.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's a fairly large assumption, what are you basing it on? We know the impossibility of negative pressure provides the lower bound, but why is the upper bound exactly 1 atm? Because it seems like you're asserting that it's not possible to create a pressure wave with greater intensity than that. </p>
<p>Also, pressure does equalize after an explosion, and while an explosion can generate a concussive wave, an explosion is not a type of concussive wave any more than a speaker is. Air particles move outwards from the source after an explosion, but it's not like the pressure never equalizes.</p></div>		</li>
