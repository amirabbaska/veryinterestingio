			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the &quot;grass-in-ear behavior,&quot; where one chimp started putting a piece of grass in her ear for some unknown reason (scratching an itch, saving it for later, a fashion statement, etc). Within a year of first observing it, 8 of the 12 chimps in the group were doing it (even though it had never been observed before).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems to me that I read that some Japanese apes were picking seeds out of dirt to eat them, then one discovered he could throw a handful into some water and the seeds would float and the sand and gravel would settle, then he could scoop the seeds back out of the water for much less effort.  Other apes learned the trick.</p></div>		</li>
