<p>There's a lot of conflicting evidence on how marine primary productivity will be affected, but the general thought is that with current climate change projections moving forward, there will be no net change or slight net loss of algae at lower latitudes (i.e., tropics/lower sub-tropics) and no net change or slight net gain of algae at higher latitudes. Bear in mind that most of these forecasts are strictly based on temperature and  atmospheric CO2 projections. It's difficult to accurately project changes in biological communities (e.g., trophic interactions and grazing pressure), hydrography (e.g., currents, mixing), acidification, and physiological responses. It's difficult to gather enough spatial data that nicely shows latitudinal gene expression and proteomics since most, if not all, microbial and phytoplankton communities are quite diverse. Another aspect is actual nutrient concentrations which are fundamental to primary productivity, such as the concentrations of bioavailable iron in the ocean, which is a critical micronutrient for many phytoplankton communities (e.g., high-nutrient-low-chlorophyll regions). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is especially true for the Carboniferous period, during which many coal-rich layers were deposited. It was during this time that trees evolved tough, lignin rich bark. However, the bacteria that now exist to break down the lignin did not exist yet, so when the trees died they did not fully decompose, eventually fossilising and creating coal.</p></div>		</li>
