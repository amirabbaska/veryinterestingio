			<div class="markdown"><p>Very similar to the view that music today sucks compared to the old days. Only the classics remain that you hear and no one ever listens to the old stuff that isn't any good. Also, I think people tend to compare &quot;2016&quot; cars/songs to &quot;70's&quot; cars/songs. A bit unfair to compare one or two year range to the best of a decade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That said, quantitative research has shown that over the past several decades we have lost a tremendous amount of harmonic, structural, and timbral variety in charting music. </p>
<p>So while we can't say that music has gotten worse (I would argue that the worst hit songs of the 1960s are among the worst songs of all time), we can say that the likelihood of getting a song that is both excellent AND novel these days is diminished. </p>
<p>Edit: y'all realize that charts measure SALES, not just radio play - right? Charts are the most powerful measure of roughly how many people are listening to a new track/album. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But who pays attention to music charts anymore?  The availability of music is vastly greater than it used to be.  The lowest common denominator is <em>truly</em> the lowest these days, since they're the ones who won't take advantage of today's incredible ability to explore and develop your own tastes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's also a result of the fierce uptick in digitalised algorithms used by marketing. It's <em>much</em> easier to see and calculate emerging trends, so many companies are able to capitalise on the lowest common denominator much faster, hence a lot of music sounds like the current most popular music.</p>
<p>That said, keep in mind that in the last, let's say five years, the songs that are really going to endure <em>are</em> the outliers. We're just too close to it right now, but give it a decade and the benefit of hindsight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can say that. But the logistics of the problem say otherwise. I know she's just another pop star, but Lorde is a great example. She came out with a very unique sound and an incredible album and she couldn't even play any instruments. She was able to use the technology available to just about every one with a computer and some passion and just used her voice to compose all the sounds, which later were instrumentalized into a full album. Back in the day, no one could possibly make music as easily, let alone record it (gated by the oppressive record labels of the time), and distribute it. </p>
<p>But you're right about the complexity of POPULAR music. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for overlooking the many horrible typos caused by writing that on my phone within minutes of waking up.</p>
<p>I know I only hinted at the stock analysis connection, so here it is in better detail.  If you look at companies on the stock market today, the list will be biased towards successful companies, because unsuccessful ones have gone bankrupt.  So if you take a set of 100 stocks today and analyze whether you should have invested in the past, (for example you are testing a new investment strategy on past data) the answer will always look better than it should, because the companies who went under are not part of your list because of how you picked the list.  In the real world during that time period you could have invested in some companies who went bankrupt, and lost money on those.</p></div>		</li>
