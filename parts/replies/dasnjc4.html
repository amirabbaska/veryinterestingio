			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the bilirubin, your body uses bile secretion (the stuff that comes out of your gallbladder) to excrete some other stuff it can't get rid of in urine.  Your GI tract also sheds dead cells from the surface lining, and additionally has lots of bacteria living in it that excrete, die, etc.  Even if you could eat some &quot;superfood&quot; that was completely absorbed, you would still need to poop all this other waste stuff.</p>
<p>As to urination, as /u/sonic_bum said making urine is how your body keeps things like electrolytes (salts) stable in your blood (and therefore your body at large).  Salts, broken down pieces of other biomaterials, urea (another by product of nitrogen metabolism), and more are all removed through urine.  Your body thus needs to urinate to restore balance because the foods you eat are not perfectly aligned with the exact combination of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and so on that your body needs to keep in tight tolerances to survive.  Without urinating the salt imbalances would kill you in a few days (which is why kidney failure patients typically need dialysis every 2-3 days). But even if you were able to consume only the &quot;perfect&quot; salt-balanced meals, you would still need to pee to remove urea and the other products of metabolism that urine removes.</p>
<p>Fun semi-related fact: a great deal of the food you consume is actually removed from your body through your lungs.  Your body converts sugars, fats, and some other materials into energy and carbon dioxide, so sitting around and breathing is actually a form of excretion!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps it would look like meconium. That's the first poop of an infant. Before birth mom's body took care of waste. MeconiumÂ is composed of materials ingested during the time the infant spends in the uterus: intestinal epithelial cells, lanugo, mucus, amniotic fluid, bile, and water. It is thick and black and has the consistency of tar </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is the problem.  </p>
<p>THEY ARE HIBERNATING!!</p>
<p>Which means they largely ain't doin crap metabolically.  Not much energy is needed.  So if a human could do this thats neat!  But they wouldn't be living their life at all.  They would just be asleep.  Everything I've ever heard or read about hibernation basically ties into the idea that for humans to use it they would have to be in some sort of induced hibernation.  Great for space travel!!  Very bad for day to day life.  =)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but bilirubins are produced from dead red blood cells, which only live for a couple/few weeks each. They don't stop dying while the beast is hibernating, right? So that chemical is still building up - I imagine the metabolic waste is not, and thereby maybe the first poop of spring is 95% dead red blood cells...</p>
<p>Unless the animal has a way to reduce the buildup, or if there is any process at all which could reduce the buildup (whether or not it needs hibernation). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe that excess bilirubin is a cause of hepatitis, but rather a symptom. When your liver is damaged (such as by hepatitis) it stops breaking down bilirubin. There can be other reasons for high bilirubin (Google Gilbert's syndrome) and it generally isn't too dangerous in and of itself. Of course, that's assuming that your levels are just high, not that 95% of the stuff is still hanging out in your bloodstream.</p></div>		</li>
