			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the areas that get built up in the sense that you mean are the low points on Earth which get filled with sediment - sedimentary basins. The sediment is eroded from the higher places which have been built up in a different sense by tectonic uplift, as seen in mountain ranges. </p>
<p>There is nothing to say that the two different sorts of landscape - sedimentary basins and mountain ranges - are exclusive through Earth history. Rock that was once formed in a sedimentary basin may become uplifted into a mountain range at a later point. There are plenty of marine fossils to be found in the Himalayas for instance, a clue to what plate tectonics can do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>somewhat related to the initial question - is the earth's surface trending towards a perfect sphere? Like are the high places continually eroding and the low places always filling up? Or is it still pretty random (due to plate tectonics and whatnot)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it were only for erosion, then yes, earth would be turning into a nearly perfect sphere. That was one of the reasons, why the &quot;crumpled apple&quot;-theory to explain the existence of mountains was thrown out at some point in history. If mountains formed by the earth shrinking, when it cooled, they would've worn away a long time ago, leaving flat ground everywhere.</p>
<p>The mechanism counteracting erosion is plate tectonics. Basically new mountains are thrust upwards at plate boundaries when plates crash into each other (e.g. the Himalaya in Asia, the Alps in Europe or the Southern Alps in New Zealand).  These mountains tend to be much more ragged and &quot;sharp&quot; (although that isn't the only reason), whereas older mountain ranges tend to be much smoother and more &quot;worn away&quot;. Think the rolling hills of Great Britain or most mountain ranges in Australia, which are quite old, as they are nowhere near a plate boundary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you describe here about uplift after being a sedimentary basin is pretty much what Utahv is (and the rest of the Colorado plateau). Unsurprisingly, Utah also has a lot of active and historic dinosaur digs. It also gives rise to the landscapes that form the several national parks in the state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never thought of it this way but it makes tons of logical sense as to why Mosasaur remains are so common. Does this mean then that our record of higher elevation dwelling dinos is going to be more scant by comparison? Do we know what that non low dwelling dinosaurs look like?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, fossilisation would certainly be less likely at higher elevations, as they are sites of erosion rather than deposition. I couldn't tell you any specifics on stuff that has been preserved though, I don't know much about palaeontology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also consider how unusual it is for an animal to be encapsulated in soil, or other material, in a way that allows for fossilization rather than normal decomposition. It makes me think of the percentage of creatures that have been fossilized, the percentage that have been found by humans, and even more the percentage of species that we have no clue about because of gaps in the fossil record. </p></div>		</li>

So do you feel better you made yourself right about something I wasn't even wrong about? Good job smart guy. </p></div>		</li>
