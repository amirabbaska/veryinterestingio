			<div class="markdown"><p>A counter I remember reading once to this evolution argument, that the world must be as we see it otherwise we would not survive so evolution must have led to us having the ability to perceive the world as it is:</p>
<p>Perhaps we only see the world as it is necessary for our survival. So an analogy for this argument would be imagine a desktop screen - you see a file on the bottom right of your desktop screen, you can see it, by clicking the bottom right part of the screen you can interact with it etc. However, that file doesn't truly exist on the bottom right of the desktop screen, you could say in reality its true nature is in the computer code, or even in binary form but we cannot perceive that. All we perceive is what we need to perceive in order to interact with it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a good point to consider. Seeing is perception, not simple reception. When we look at an object it is an active, participatory experience. Our expectations fundamentally alter how we believe the real world to be.</p>
<p>The classic example is viewing the &quot;same&quot; field of flowers at noon and dusk. In actuality the field is perceptually quite different: the flowers appear much more yellow at noon and much more red at dusk. But we assume none of the flowers have meaningfully changed since we embrace the context as we construct the scene in our minds. That's one way a physical difference in the real world is abstracted away during our perceptions of it, presumably with an aim towards what is evolutionarily relevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What will really blow your mind is that there is probably some alien species that evolved around a star that gives off a completely different energy of light ( like UV or Infrared).  They see a completely different universe than us, and vice versa. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I guess that gets to the heart of my question.</p>
<p>If we and they looked at the same thing, it would appear different to us both.</p>
<p>So what does it look like?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are species right here on Earth that can see different wavelengths of light.  Bees, for example, can see ultraviolet light because some flowers emit UV light.  As to what that bee &quot;sees,&quot; that is to say what experience the bee has, we really have no idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's incredible to think and wonder about. I use IR technology a lot in my line of work, and i still to the day find it fascinating how i can tell which cars have been driven most recent etc based on how bright they are in IR</p></div>		</li>
