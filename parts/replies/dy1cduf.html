			<div class="markdown"><p>Expanding on this a little, its not just a matter of buying any business and faking the profits, its the little details that get you caught.
To stick with the laundromat example, your business claims to have 50 customers a day but only legitimately sees 10 customers a day, one of the little details that will catch you up that the tax agents will look for, is how much laundry detergent does your business buy? Or how much water does it use?
Or the power bill to run all the machines?</p>
<p>If that doesnt come close to the 'expected' usage for 50 customers a day, that in itself is a big red flag and can get them looking a lot closer at you, including sitting someone nearby to physically count how many customers you have over a set period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why restaurants are great for laundering money. You can have an incredibly expensive menu. So if you need to launder $10K a week, you only have to buy a few hundred dollars of ingredients and claim you sold them for a hundred times their cost. Also, the fact that there is so much waste in the food industry makes it very hard to effectively audit a restaurant. It's not impossible but unless it will be a big win for the prosecutor, it will usually take forensic accountants and a lot of money to develop a case that will stand up in court to the burden of &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before video cameras were common, that's why casinos worked well, too. Give a man a few hundred in chips, swap him out later with a thousand in chips you slipped under the table. He can play roulette the whole time. The man gets his extra money and the casino gets a write-off. The man gives the money back to the casino another day. You can swap a lot of money this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that is the thing missing in many of these suggestions.  yeah in the old days a laundry mat or pizza place was enough.  but they're easy to catch because of the inputs required to run them.  but strip clubs, barber shops, video rentals- once they're set up, money comes in and there is no way to tell how the money spent was obtained, and it is easy to fudge the numbers with extra cash.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forensic accounting is fairly interesting, in a kind of nerdy way. I had a friend who worked in her aunt's accounting firm, and they did a lot of court related work, particularly with bankruptcies and maybe some litigation.   </p>
<p>I don't know what it is that <em>initially</em> tips off law enforcement, but once they get tipped off, it's pretty difficult to hide money laundering.    </p>
<p>Just for instance, let's take a Chinese food place, and to make it easy let's assume it's cash only.   </p>
<p>The naive solution is to just pad sales. If you sold 100 meals one day, you make receipts for 110, or 109, or whatever extra. That's your first (possible) mistake. There's a weird phenomenon where people try to come up with random numbers and end up coming up with patterns, or something that just isn't random enough.  </p>
<p>There's also a weird accounting thing where, apparently, certain types of numbers are disproportionately represented.<br />
I don't know enough to cite hard facts, but one forensic accountant I talked to said that she can often spot bullshit accounting just by looking at the cents column. If certain numbers show up too much or not enough, then it's a hint that someone is cooking the books.   </p>
<p>That seems like some math-voodoo to me.    </p>
<p>Even a regular person could easily spot cooked books if they actually stop to look though. Lets say that over the past year the Restaurant says the sold a perfectly reasonable amount of food. Did they says they sold 100 units worth of chicken dishes but only bought 96 units worth of chicken? That's an obvious hint that <em>something</em> is off, even it turns out that you're just under-portioning. Soda is probably going to be the most easily fudged number, the profit margins are high and the syrup is easily bought and disposed of. Gotta make sure you bought enough disposable cups though, and you can't really argue that you sold 2.3 sodas for every meal.  </p>
<p>Even just making too much money for your geographic location is a huge red flag. A statistically higher than average profit margin is a red flag.  </p>
<p>It turns out that laundering money is <em>very</em> difficult to hide if anyone who knows what they're doing decides to take a look. You basically just have to hope that no one ever decides to put the books under a microscope.  </p>
<p>Bigger companies can get away with it easier because they can hide transactions in the thousands and millions, and then there's the shell corporations and the schemes can get very complicated. </p>
<p>One of the silliest things that tips people off though, is spending <em>waaay</em> too much money. If you're supposedly only making $36k a year, there's no way you should be living in a mini-mansion and driving a luxury car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're searching for here is Benford's Law. The first digit in any real measurement is more likely to be a one than a two, a two than a three etc. It is like looking at half of a bell curve with one being the tall part and nine the thin part out towards the edge.</p>
<p>Why is this true? Think of the stock market. How long has it had a one on the front vs other numbers? If the Dow Jones grows at 8% per year and you start at 100, Benford's law will be expressed. It will spend a lot of time with a one, a little less with a two, and then very little time with a three The weird part is how broadly this law is expressed. Take any random measurable phenomenon (river flows in Alaska measured in cubic centimeters per minute) and you will find Benford's law.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's exactly how you think. If the laundering is done on a low level, with sums of money that don't raise eyebrows, it will go under the radar. Money laundering rarely gets noticed unless 1. It is uncovered during the course of an existing criminal investigation 2. Law enforcement get tipped off by somebody to the existence of money laundering 3. People laundering get greedy and claim profits that do raise flags</p></div>		</li>
