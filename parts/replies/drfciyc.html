			<div class="markdown"><p>Same on eye-dominance vs handedness. I'm right-eye dominant, and left-handed, though functionally ambidextrous for pretty much everything but writing and drawing. Everyone else in my family is right-handed.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder if it was because I had so much trouble with mirrored images for most of my early childhood - as in, I was mimicking everyone around me from a very young age, especially when &quot;writing&quot; (my parents kept some of the funnier examples of my attempts to write prior to learning to read, apparently I was obsessed with it) but didn't realize that they were using their <em>other</em> hand. </p>
<p>Edit: It just occurred to me, I do throw better with my right. &quot;Ambidextrous&quot; might not be the proper term for me.</p></div>		</li>
