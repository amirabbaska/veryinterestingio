			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm, I think of knowledge as the product of thinking. Information is gathered by the senses, analyzed by the mysterious process of thinking, and if that process is refined enough, turns into knowledge.
I think wisdom would be what you would call a very refined thinking process</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This will also help you avoid conspiracy theory bullshit. You know what the Earth is, governments, NASA and such. If you think about it the idea that NASA and the governments would get together and pretend the world is round for decades/centuries for reasons unknown without a single person breaking the conspiracy is laughable. </p>
<p>Unfortunately conspiracy theories arise because people believe they are thinking, when really they put 2 and 2 together and came up with &quot;potato&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the problems with CT is 'misattirbution of competence'.  </p>
<p>One of the best debunks of CT is to point out that there are potholes in the roads, visit the DMV, watch CSPAN for a little bit... then the idea of the Federal Government exploiting Alien Technology since 1947 and not having a single shred of evidence ever leak is, absolutely hilarious.  </p>
<p>Neither Trump <em>nor</em> Clinton could keep even basic OPSEC about their own damned affairs, with people who believed in their cause and wanted to win.  </p>
<p>Once you go into one big CT like that, they tend to glom on to each other because now you have to believe the cops are in on it, and there is an illuminati to prevent the Chinese from tipping the hat, and Shapeshifting Reptilians because all of that would require superhuman abilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It kind of frustrates me that flat earthers are taken at face value and often lambasted by science populists.  In essence I think it works quite well as a thought experiment that tests human reasoning.  There are some fun arguments people make in favor of it and it's quite interesting what could be considered plausible if we disregarded collective knowledge.   I for instance, have no clue if the earth is flat or not.  I've been told it's round, and I'm inclined to believe it, but I personally, could not say for certain.   That's a humbling realisation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If anyone wants to do more research into this way of thinking, constructivism is a great place to start. It's a philosophy of education influenced by Piaget and Vgotsky and explains learning as a person constructs their understanding of a subject based on previous experiences. Essentially, a person has a base level of knowledge and learns new concepts by refining that pre-existing knowledge. A child might learn what a bird is and think it's defined by flying. They then look at a plane and say bird because it flies. Learning takes place when that child is corrected and refines what they knew to now include planes as well. </p></div>		</li>
