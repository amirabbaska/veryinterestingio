			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes, but for the same reason: they are saying &quot;this is not that bad,&quot; and you might genuinely think it is that bad, so it feels like they're invalidating your feelings. What we laugh at is a reflection of what things we are trying to make &quot;not so bad.&quot;</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is why certain jokes are taboo, especially in particular contexts. Say I have a running joke in my friends group where we call each other stuff like &quot;bitch.&quot; It might be funny if I'm hanging out with those friends. It's inappropriate if I open my eulogy at a funeral with, &quot;My best friend, John Doe, was a trash whore.&quot; Not because calling someone &quot;trash whore&quot; is somehow inherently inappropriate, but because it's basically saying, &quot;Those sad feelings you have about John's passing? Not important.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on personal experience, I would agree. I had a friend that I lived with for three years and we fell out because he made some grave accusations about me being in a gang and vandalising our apartment for insurance money. Turns out he was incredibly insecure and I was just fascinated by his inferiority complex to the point that it made me feel like I was playing a role in his life as he would constantly try to one-up me on everything in attempts to feel better about himself. Interesting point. </p></div>		</li>
