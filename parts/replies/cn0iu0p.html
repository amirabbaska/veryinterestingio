			<p>You make some interesting points. Aren't housing prices in many cities many times more expensive then those the babyboomers were faced with (even adjusted for inflation)? It appears that (ok perhaps an extreme case) here in London, UK, young people can barely afford the most basic of accommodations, &quot;studio flats&quot; that are so small you can't fully open the door because the bed's in the way. In London, if you work an entry level job you spend some ridiculous amount like 60% of your income on living expenses, a further 20 on public transport. And like I said, London is an extreme case, but I feel that this rising cost of living (not eased by higher wages) is a phenomenon that is happening worldwide.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's a nice idea, but you go where the jobs are - or at least to somewhere within commuting distance of where they are. There's no point in moving to a city with lots of housing but no jobs or career prospects.<br><br>I moved to London because it was where the jobs in my field were. So did everyone else in my field who had moved there. We didn't live &quot;in the heart of the city&quot;, we lived on the outskirts and in the commuter areas. I actually lived in a different county for most of my time there, which meant four hours a day on trains and several internal organs handed over to Transport for London. My peers and I weren't annoyed because we couldn't buy flats in Zones 1 &amp; 2, we were annoyed because we were killing ourselves to pay rent on flatshares in Zones 5 and outwards- in areas that hadn't yet dreamed of being absorbed into the commuter belt in 1960. </p>		</li>

			<p>Fellow Londoner - same thing happened here. Moved to London because there were fuck all jobs where I was, ended up in a flat share in a shitty, brutalist housing development with every kind of damp &amp; leaking ceilings, working a job that paid below living wage and commuting three hours a day for the privilege of it.<br><br>Managed to get a new, better job purely through nepotism (company I now work for owed a favour to the company my partner's family own), and managed to move into a nicer place purely though very good luck and some very high familial mortality rates.<br><br>Anyone else in my previous position, without the lucky choice of romantic entanglement and the even luckier windfall of rich dead family, would be stuck in the horrible job and the horrible flat with the horrible commute. There genuinely weren't any prospects I could have had without that luck - I had no time, energy or money to even take evening classes or Open University study to get myself extra qualifications. Previous generations may have been able to work hard to get where they wanted, but we're stuck hoping we get lucky.</p>		</li>

			<p>I was shocked when I realised that not a single one of my London friends was managing to live there without family support. I'd never have been able to afford to live there, not even for the short time that I did, if my parents hadn't died young. They weren't rich, but they did have a bit of insurance and that kept my head above water for a little while. <br><br>When it eventually ran out I couldn't afford to be there any more, and I could see that it would take me another five years or so of entry-level bullshit before I'd get anywhere near jobs that would pay me enough to cover London life. I had to rethink my career path completely and move back to Scotland. Most of the people I knew down there have either done the same - moved on or gone back to where they came from, abandoning or drastically reshaping the goals that took them to London. The few who haven't are backed by serious family money. It's no coincidence that the most successful of my London peers is the one whose family bought him a house in a nice part of Zone 2 as a graduation present. Not a flat, a house. Outright. He can walk to work and never has to worry about rent. Small wonder he's in the best position to schmooze, network and put in extra time to advance his career... (Not to mention that his extremely wealthy family is also an extremely well-connected family, and it's slightly easier to get a job when the person offering it is your godfather and your dad's best mate. Like you say, luck is a necessity...)</p>		</li>

			<p>And this comparison shows that housing costs went up or down? Genuinely curious.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's even more complicated than that.<br><br>IMO, Urban real estate used to be cheaper(undervalued) because many cities were in a unique temporary state of decay, and were genuinely terrible places to live during the post war era. The reasons for this were complicated but by the 90's cities returned to normal, and the long term historical norm is that the nicer areas in a city are naturally going to be expensive. Those beautiful masonry row houses and brownstones that we popularly associate with poor bohemians living on a shoestring were originally built for the wealthy a century ago, and it's expected that they once again return to that group.<br><br>The suburbs are a different thing. I do think that it's absurd that  suburban housing in some cities like Phoenix or Las Vegas is so extremely expensive. I don't know why this is, maybe it has to do with subprime loans and a combination of bad behaving banks and well meaning but flawed government policy. <br><br>Or it's the side effect of inequality, where some people have the money to bid up the price of housing in an area whereas before that wouldn't happen.<br><br>IMO the solution for cities that can't build their way out of the problem(like Houston or Dallas, where you can still buy a new house for &quot;cheap&quot; if you live on the edge of the region) might be to change how we think about suburbs and urban planning.<br><br>I'd personally like to see a relaxation of zoning policies and a shift towards more diverse building types in suburban areas. Like we could build inexpensive 2-3 story apartments and allow accessory dwellings in particular areas to provide more affordable housing. However the ugly thing to me is that the suburbanization of the baby boomer era set in motion a trend where rather than living in full scope communities we live in a vast sprawl with no means of organization and no way of being tamed. More people have no choice but to live in a insular subdivision pod with a HOA, and you can't retrofit or change this kind of environment as easily as you can a city block where tearing down a house and building a multi-unit structure doesn't seem out of place.</p>		</li>

			<p>Houses are more expensive in cities basically, IMO, because there are more people vying for fewer houses. It's just a result of population growth. Suburbs in most cities are really affordable if you go far enough out.</p>		</li>

			<p>I agree with you, but this is still not entirely out of reach. I'm 23, own a house, a decent truck, and I'm currently going to school. I have a cell phone, internet, xbox, most things the average household has. I didn't come from a rich family. I started at the bottom and with a little work got where I am. <br></p>		</li>

			<p>Thank you for bringing up societal problems too. I agree that there are some problems with 'the system', but all too often Millennials are eager to blame everything on the evil Boomers, and deny that the situation might be <em>partly</em> due to consumerism.<br><br>People just need more shit these days. The newest, best phone. The biggest flat screen TV. Cable. Cell Phone plan with data, unlimited calling, and texting. A different outfit for every day of the week (month!).<br><br>And then the houses. Look at the houses they're building now (size-wise), and the houses that they were building in the 50s. Of course income hasn't gone up enough to fund a lifestyle that demands all these luxuries.</p>		</li>
