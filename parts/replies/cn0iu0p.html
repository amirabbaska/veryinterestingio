			<p>You make some interesting points. Aren't housing prices in many cities many times more expensive then those the babyboomers were faced with (even adjusted for inflation)? It appears that (ok perhaps an extreme case) here in London, UK, young people can barely afford the most basic of accommodations, &quot;studio flats&quot; that are so small you can't fully open the door because the bed's in the way. In London, if you work an entry level job you spend some ridiculous amount like 60% of your income on living expenses, a further 20 on public transport. And like I said, London is an extreme case, but I feel that this rising cost of living (not eased by higher wages) is a phenomenon that is happening worldwide.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's a nice idea, but you go where the jobs are - or at least to somewhere within commuting distance of where they are. There's no point in moving to a city with lots of housing but no jobs or career prospects.<br><br>I moved to London because it was where the jobs in my field were. So did everyone else in my field who had moved there. We didn't live &quot;in the heart of the city&quot;, we lived on the outskirts and in the commuter areas. I actually lived in a different county for most of my time there, which meant four hours a day on trains and several internal organs handed over to Transport for London. My peers and I weren't annoyed because we couldn't buy flats in Zones 1 &amp; 2, we were annoyed because we were killing ourselves to pay rent on flatshares in Zones 5 and outwards- in areas that hadn't yet dreamed of being absorbed into the commuter belt in 1960. </p>		</li>

			<p>Fellow Londoner - same thing happened here. Moved to London because there were fuck all jobs where I was, ended up in a flat share in a shitty, brutalist housing development with every kind of damp &amp; leaking ceilings, working a job that paid below living wage and commuting three hours a day for the privilege of it.<br><br>Managed to get a new, better job purely through nepotism (company I now work for owed a favour to the company my partner's family own), and managed to move into a nicer place purely though very good luck and some very high familial mortality rates.<br><br>Anyone else in my previous position, without the lucky choice of romantic entanglement and the even luckier windfall of rich dead family, would be stuck in the horrible job and the horrible flat with the horrible commute. There genuinely weren't any prospects I could have had without that luck - I had no time, energy or money to even take evening classes or Open University study to get myself extra qualifications. Previous generations may have been able to work hard to get where they wanted, but we're stuck hoping we get lucky.</p>		</li>

			<p>I was shocked when I realised that not a single one of my London friends was managing to live there without family support. I'd never have been able to afford to live there, not even for the short time that I did, if my parents hadn't died young. They weren't rich, but they did have a bit of insurance and that kept my head above water for a little while. <br><br>When it eventually ran out I couldn't afford to be there any more, and I could see that it would take me another five years or so of entry-level bullshit before I'd get anywhere near jobs that would pay me enough to cover London life. I had to rethink my career path completely and move back to Scotland. Most of the people I knew down there have either done the same - moved on or gone back to where they came from, abandoning or drastically reshaping the goals that took them to London. The few who haven't are backed by serious family money. It's no coincidence that the most successful of my London peers is the one whose family bought him a house in a nice part of Zone 2 as a graduation present. Not a flat, a house. Outright. He can walk to work and never has to worry about rent. Small wonder he's in the best position to schmooze, network and put in extra time to advance his career... (Not to mention that his extremely wealthy family is also an extremely well-connected family, and it's slightly easier to get a job when the person offering it is your godfather and your dad's best mate. Like you say, luck is a necessity...)</p>		</li>

			<p>It's even more complicated than that.<br><br>IMO, Urban real estate used to be cheaper(undervalued) because many cities were in a unique temporary state of decay, and were genuinely terrible places to live during the post war era. The reasons for this were complicated but by the 90's cities returned to normal, and the long term historical norm is that the nicer areas in a city are naturally going to be expensive. Those beautiful masonry row houses and brownstones that we popularly associate with poor bohemians living on a shoestring were originally built for the wealthy a century ago, and it's expected that they once again return to that group.<br><br>The suburbs are a different thing. I do think that it's absurd that  suburban housing in some cities like Phoenix or Las Vegas is so extremely expensive. I don't know why this is, maybe it has to do with subprime loans and a combination of bad behaving banks and well meaning but flawed government policy. <br><br>Or it's the side effect of inequality, where some people have the money to bid up the price of housing in an area whereas before that wouldn't happen.<br><br>IMO the solution for cities that can't build their way out of the problem(like Houston or Dallas, where you can still buy a new house for &quot;cheap&quot; if you live on the edge of the region) might be to change how we think about suburbs and urban planning.<br><br>I'd personally like to see a relaxation of zoning policies and a shift towards more diverse building types in suburban areas. Like we could build inexpensive 2-3 story apartments and allow accessory dwellings in particular areas to provide more affordable housing. However the ugly thing to me is that the suburbanization of the baby boomer era set in motion a trend where rather than living in full scope communities we live in a vast sprawl with no means of organization and no way of being tamed. More people have no choice but to live in a insular subdivision pod with a HOA, and you can't retrofit or change this kind of environment as easily as you can a city block where tearing down a house and building a multi-unit structure doesn't seem out of place.</p>		</li>

			<p>That point doesn't even make sense. Pretty much every city has increased in population since the 1960's that's worth living in. Also, you seem to ignore the fact that these cities are where most of the jobs are at. You can't just pick a tiny town and expect to have a job where no jobs exist in the first place. Sorry, but most cities have increased 6x in population since the 1960's, so why shouldn't a millennial be able to purchase a house when the population increase has nothing to do with how much things cost?</p>		</li>

Of course income hasn't gone up enough to fund a lifestyle that demands all these luxuries.</p>		</li>

			<p>Greatest economic boom?  I don't know about that.  The world operates in boom and bust cycles.  Here's an <a href="http://housepricesouthafrica.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/comparing-1980-property-boom-to-2004-boom1.png" target="_blank">image</a> showing the housing market boom and bust cycle.  As you can see the 1981 housing boom would have made housing completely unaffordable as it was even bigger than our current one.  1981 is significant because that's around the time the baby boomers are turning 30, which is around the time they buy a house.  It's them turning 30 and buying a house that of course drove that boom.  Following that boom was the 1985 economic disaster.  Two years later the stock market crashed.<br><br>As bad as things got in the 2008 election, the stock market did not crash.<br><br>Here's an interesting <a href="http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/shiller-nyt.png" target="_blank">graph</a> worth seeing.  If you match it side by side with the boom and bust cycle you'll see a huge problem.  That problem is, that housing values do not reflect their real economic values.  They are all overpriced.<br><br>If anyone squandered money it was &quot;The Greatest Generation.&quot;  It may be shocking if you were unaware, <a href="http://qz.com/290183/in-2014-countries-are-still-paying-off-debt-from-world-war-one/" target="_blank">but countries are still paying off their WW1 and WW2 debts</a>.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is a really good point and one that  is underrepresented in the thread. Every service we get is &quot;subscription based&quot; leading to paycheck in paycheck out syndrome. This is at all levels of income. As products are designed to fail within three  years,  they are also subscription based. Basically you never really buy anything of value that lasts.

			<p>Thank you. You brought up a lot of points I think people miss. Another point I'd like to add. In my city the houses were built at different times from the 50s, 60s, 70s, ect. House size correlates almost directly with age. 50s houses around here are about 600 square feet. 80s houses are around 1500 and new ones are 2500+. What constitutes a house has changed, and for that matter a car. Standard of living has improved so much that saying someone can't afford a house doesn't really mean a lot. </p>		</li>

			<p>This has a lot to do with available stock at the time, too.  Some towns were just &quot;made form scratch&quot; in the 50's, where huge farms were turned into subdivisions for returning GI's, and that's where we got the baby boom from.  They built small because they needed affordable housing quickly.  Today, though, in those same towns, if you are a young poor couple with 0-1 kids, you don't build a new 2500+ sq ft house, you buy the house that was built in the 50's.  If you are a wealth family with 4-5 kids, you need to build a new house because few existing houses big enough and nice enough are on the market.  <br><br>Anyone who doesn't see this pattern though might get discouraged seeing that average home prices (and sizes/amenities) has gone up, but cheap housing is still available if you look.  </p>		</li>

			<p>I completely agree.  I have been asking the same question for years to real estate developers without a satisfactory answer: Who is going to build the brick ramblers of today?  I'm starting to think no one.  Getting the largest, cheapest square-footage yields the best return by far.  This bloat has been going on for so long, the materials to build these cookie-cutter houses continues to go down, and the demand for housing prior to 2008 was so strong that there was no incentive to change course.  <br><br>The sad thing is after a financial collapse stemming from people buying more house than they could afford that left unfinished developments littering the nation, there still isn't any financial incentive to change course.  Home builders just bode their time and now look to keep building these cheap monstrosities again.  What can you do?<br><br>If the government were to say &quot;this is the affordable part of town&quot; no matter how nice it started out it would become a slum.  The only way I see to do it in a capitalist economy (and I am not well-versed in economic policy making) would be to make your average home buyer really feel the pain of a home purchase.  That is, your 30-year mortgage might have an attractive monthly rate, but what if you had to pay off a house in 10 to 15 years max?  I'm thinking people would scale down what they were looking for and over time home sizes would come back down.  Isn't an attractive option at all, I know.  But again, what can be done?</p>		</li>

			<p>I would tend to say the opposite, as far as expected average house sizes. It used to be that someone could afford a huge familiy house. Nowadays, due to the all the additional costs related to the housing industry, one can barely afford a 2-room flat in most cities and that has gradually lead to gentrification of cities.</p>		</li>

You are married.<br><br>Age 30 is when you really begin to earn money.  Being married gives you two incomes, less bills, and more disposable incomes.  And you own a car and a house is a byproduct of it.

Adding an extra income split that.  We were able to make our down payment on a house after only 3 years ($35k).<br><br>So maybe it's possible there are just too many single millenials.

			<p>Where I am, the only decent internet is through the cable company.  They're also the only option in town.  Bare basics cable - literally 12 channels, plus regular internet is $80/mo.  If we turn off the 12 tv channels, they'll raise the price of internet so the bill doesn't change.<br><br>2 phones with non-existent data (10M/mo on one, none on the other) is $24/mo.  Most people aren't that willing to live without their smart phone, so they're paying double or more that per month.  That's $1250/year for us, so for someone with a 2 smartphone using a real data plan, more like $2150/year.<br><br>I'm in a part of the country with a very low cost of living.

			<p>I use PagePlus.  It's an outside company using Verizon's network.  You can port over your existing phone and either pay as you go for talk/text, or do a package for talk/text/data.  My husband does talk/text only and has to refill it about once every 3 months.  I do a $12/mo plan that's 250 mins/250 texts and 10mb data per month, every month.  We both have smartphones, we just only let them connect for data when there's wifi.  The only time we're somewhere that doesn't have wifi is while driving.</p>		</li>

			<p>The big carriers in the US are terrible for costs but a lot of the cost is because people get subsidized phones for &quot;free&quot; and then pay out the cost in the length of the contract. My wife and I bought used phones and signed up with <a href="http://www.ting.com" target="_blank">Ting</a> (a non-contract mobile carrier.) Other cheap ones like Republic Wireless, Boost, Straight Talk etc. exist. /r/NoContract has a lot of good information about this. </p>		</li>

			<p>Ya, this is kinda bogus Maybe 120 for both every month of which 30- 40 would end up going to a land line anyway. Its also worth mentioning that Cable was a necessity like 20 years ago and now NOONE has it. That frees up at least another 50 a month(conservatively).</p>		</li>

			<p>Your parents shared a car because they could.  It was a 9-5 era.  <br>  <br>Your dad paid his own way through school because he could.  College prices were much lower in his day. <br> <br>Example: I went to a private, well respected college.  My tuition+room an board + meal plan for year 1 was just under $18k.  <br>  <br>Year 2 was even cheaper because I got an off campus apt and roommates (food costs went up a bit, but we mooches a lot off the kids with meal plans).     <br>  <br>My first real job payed $38k, plus the possibility of overtime.  Took me 6 months to land it.    <br>...  <br><br>  <br>I see kids today paying $40+k a year <em>just for tuition</em> plus another $10-15k in room/board.  <br>    <br>These kids are starting like with $200k or more debt, and when you are young and earning poorly, the debt+interest robs you of any real ability to get ahead.  <br> <br>Average salary of a college grad today? $45k/year.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>That's the big thing - they had job stability.  They could easily work their way up the ladder, just by being loyal to the company and being good at their job.  The other big thing was a college degree meant a lot more back that.  It's a lot different when a college degree is needed for even the most basic entry-level position, and you can't count on dedication to your job because you can't count on your job even being there next year (not to mention that the trend has been increasingly to get rid of people with experience, because the job pool is so much bigger, thus forcing everyone to keep having to start at the bottom).</p>		</li>

My cell phone bill is $145/mo for my wife and I with up front cost of $400 (say <strong>$2,140</strong> annually) vs the <a href="http://newsroom.aaa.com/2014/05/owning-and-operating-your-vehicle-just-got-a-little-cheaper-aaas-2014-your-driving-costs-study/" target="_blank">average annual cost of car ownership of $8,876 per car</a>, or <strong>$17,752</strong> for the two of us)<br><br>The car cost is about 8x the cost of the phones per year. Not a fair comparison <em>at all</em>. People have also been watching movies for less, gotten rid of home phones/long distance, and cable bills they used to pay. My internet is only $40/mo, which is cheaper than movies, home phone, and cable, so you're saving even more there.

			<p>At least for my wife and I, the decision to buy newer cars and a house came down to relative costs of doing so over the alternative, which was renting and driving older, crappier cars.<br><br>In the end it was pretty simple math. We were paying roughly $7000 a year to rent an apartment (we live in a down housing market, apparently). Now we pay $8800 a year to own a house. We're building equity now, and with Interest rates being where they're at we're in a good position. We have newer cars because the cost of ownership of the old ones was becoming too much, and it was easier to bite the bullet and get the new ones instead. Having decent credit helped. But getting 35 miles per gallon in a new car versus 15 in an old Jeep that constantly needed maintenance was a no brainer when I have to commute 130 miles daily.<br><br>That being said, we work hard for those things as well. For the last year and a half I worked two jobs, one of which pretty much was my car payment every month. The only reason we can afford anything we have is because it's two of us working and earning money, talking candidly about our expenses. We make a plan and we follow through. We have health insurance through our employers, we contribute to savings accounts and each have a 401(k).<br><br>Why have we made this work? Because we prioritized it before anything else. There are tons of things I've wanted. A new computer would be fantastic. Instead I'm making do with my five year old MacBook. We have a very strict grocery budget. Like those who did it before us, we will go without in order to build a better future. If everything goes right, we'll be debt free as soon as we're in our 40s. It's not because we make a ton of money, either. Two people working three jobs, and we brought in between $80,000-85,000. We're working like hell to increase that, but for now we're making it work.</p>		</li>

			<p>Hahahaha ow my sides. You're complaining about rent for an apartment being less than $600 so you made the jump to a home for $750 a month. That shit is comedy. A home in any major metropolitan area is three times as much and $600 might get you a studio in a neighborhood where you can't walk around after dark. <br><br>And before you say wages are different etc etc: $80,000 is considered a perfectly reasonable amount of money for two income earners out here in the LA area and I can only imagine that it's an amazing amount back where you live. </p>		</li>

			<p>Congrats on the hard work. I'm in a similar situation (except closing on a home in a couple weeks). My SO and I are 24 and 25 and both have student loan debt, but it's working <em>for us</em> not against us. We went to public schools (huge $$ savings) and got degrees that got us jobs (I have a masters and am an accountant, she's got 2 bachelors and is a teacher).<br><br>I have a 4 year old car and hers is 11 years old, but her commute is 5 miles so the old car doesn't cost her much at all. My car payment is relatively small (working through college + the accounting field bringing paid internships) and is by no means a burden on us financially.<br><br>We rent currently at 840 a month, whereas our mortgage will be 1050. We live on <strong>strict but realistic</strong> budgets that have allowed us to get where we are today.<br><br>For reference our joint income is just over $80k, which is with my SO being at part time and likely being increased to full time next school year. Our jobs provide benefits such as insurance and retirement plans. <br><br>All I see in threads like these is people complaining about their current situation instead of actually working to make it better. School matters. We are blessed to be in the situation we are in. Since the age of 15 we've both been juggling school and work, and we worked damn hard to get here.</p>		</li>

			<p>if your joint income is $80k then you need to instead think about BUYING a home OUTRIGHT or on a 2 or 3 year loan.<br><br>this eliminated the massive insane interest payment and your monthly payment becomes simply &quot;taxes&quot; (which can be quite significant so be careful)<br><br>NOW you can seriously save up for a &quot;nice&quot; house without the rent screwing you over. in 10 years you can simply BUY the house you want instead of paying through the nose for 30 years.</p>		</li>

Except in my case the second job is school. <br><br>But yeah, we budget before anything. <br><br>That said, I understand how easy it is to get sucked into the &quot;I don't have enough money to get to X so I can't possibly do Y which ironically would actually save me money allowing me to achieve X in the first place&quot; loop. <br><br>It's tough watching someone you love go through that cycle too. My extended family is a prime example. Mom and her sisters grew up in a culture where extended family looked out for each other, even at the expense of getting out of the slums because they believed the family unit was more important. My sisters and I saw through that and are working hard for ourselves and I believe better off than the alternative. I can't say the same for my cousins. <br><br>Tldr: it's not always about opportunity or education, but culture can be a big influence </p>		</li>

			<p>Like houses, new cars today cost more but are a lot better than they used to be.  While you hear stories from nostalgic older people talk about their 68 pickup running forever with only oil changes, that generally wasn't the case.  Cars back then weren't expected to make it to 100,000 miles without needing significant repairs or rusting out.  Also, a lot of cars back then were just poorly designed.  My uncle had a 1960 Ford that wouldn't adequately bring oil to the rocker arms due to a design flaw.  He had to carry around extra oil to pour on the rocker arms to get up big hills.  You don't have to do this with new cars.<br><br>So while a 17 year old kid today can't realistically save up enough money working at McDonalds to buy a new car, he can save up enough money to buy a half decent used car that will go just as far as a new car would have in 1970.  Additionally, it will be far safer and use half as much gas.     </p>		</li>

			<p>Yes.  The millenial term was crafted based on coming into being in the new millennium.  So the first breed would have turned 18 at 2k, and would be born in 1982.  The last batch would be 2002.  Cohorts aren't an exact science so Gen-X intermingles in with the numbers.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Millennials are on average wealthier than their parents were when they started (adjusted for inflation). <br><br>&quot;Wealth&quot; would include all that debt you mention they owe, and to <a href="http://blog.metrotrends.org/2013/03/lost-generations-wealth-building-young/" target="_blank">state they are wealthier is simply not true.</a> Perhaps you were referring to income?<br><br>It is true that the income of those with a college degree make more than their parents on average. The pay disparity is far greater though. Adjusted for inflation into 2012 dollars, a young boomer with a high school diploma would make in the low $30k's, while his neighbor with a bachelor would make a little under $40k. In the same inflation adjusted dollars, young millennials with only a high school diploma are making less than $30k, while those that have a college degree are making around $45k on average. So if you cherry pick college graduates, than yes they do make more, otherwise not so true.<br><br>While the percent of the population with a bachelor degree is going up continually, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">it is still only 31.7% today.</a> Thus, you are correct that a third of the population is better off than their parents, at least if looking simply at pay. <em>Edit, wrong place</em> <del>However, the percent of the population that are now well off is growing percentage wise.</del> This has led to a much higher poverty rate for millennials than boomers.<br><br>&gt;The appearance of being poorer is related to the rampant consumerism.<br><br>What is important to members of society changes constantly; implying negative connotations to someone with different opinions than yours is simply discourteous.<br><br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>I've bought 3 houses and NEVER had a &quot;city inspection&quot;. All there is are a couple of lines on a document asking if you of any unpermitted work and for you to disclose any known defects.

			<p>When new homes are built a city inspector is monitoring the process as the home has to meet all basic building codes for the area, the region, the state, and the country.  He's not hovering over the project but he's there.  When you buy a house the city inspection part of the house is done.<br><br>From then you probably get the house inspected for the purposes of a mortgage, but the city inspectors job is done.  Had the city inspector not been around some corners could have been cut to build cheaper homes.<br><br>Not all cities have inspections and small towns most definitely don't.  City inspections are specifically designed to raise the value of the property to its maximum potential while maintaining codes.  If a new sub-division goes up as part of a city-lease the homes going up have to represent X amount of tax revenues for the cities in terms of property taxes.  That is, if the city can make homes more expensive, they can collect more taxes.<br><br>The price of homes in rural areas and outskirts of cities is actually fairly reasonable.  But when you go into a center like Manhatten, London, or Paris you're looking at mostly million dollar homes.</p>		</li>

			<p>University is part of rampant consumerism.  There is a public university that will cost an American $50,000 after 4 years, or a private university that will cost $250,000 over 4 years.  Then there's also community colleges that cost anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 and offer starting positions that pay 2-3x as much as a university grad would make.<br><br>People are sold into that psychology degree from a private school because someone in a university marketing department created this dynamic where failures go to public schools and community colleges and winners go to high end private schools.<br><br>But I digress, the university debt is a story of some and not all.  University enrollment rates have been <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/files/2011/08/2011-education-03.png" target="_blank">soaring</a> with almost twice as many people going to university over 40 years.  But wait, look at that graph again.  The enrollment rate for people aged 18-24 hasn't gone up that fast, it's the post 25 enrollment rate that's skyrocketing.<br><br>Why is that?  Well, it's because we're living in a more technocratic world than ever before and skills need to be specialized.  The same people who didn't get specialized community college skills now need to earn a doctorate in the world to actually make any money.<br><br>That second part is never told.  People compare university vs non-university income and it always makes university look like a great investment.  When you compare community college to university.... community college comes up on top.<br><br>It's all just part of the marketing scheme of a university system that services 60% of the American population.

			<p>well you are hiding some detail. People don't want the jobs they can get a CC. The same marketing programs were used to disuade people from working in skilled positions. <br><br>Also university has more potential than say a CC. If I got to school at a CC to become an Operator I will have a job as an Operator. In 40 years I will be a more skilled operator. If I go to University to become a Business Major I may start out as an Analyst and then switch careers manage something or I can do X, Y, Z. <br><br>University is an attractive option because it is good if you don't know what you want to do right now (get a broad major and get paid poorly compared to the operator above) or someone who wants to have many roles over their life time.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think you are misrepresenting the kind of experience you get from a community college.  It's true a community college prepares you for a specific job but it gives you certifications and training to do multiple jobs.<br><br>An operator as you say actually relates to positions in hundreds of different fields.  You can work in mining, you can work in construction, you can work in demolition, you can work in transport, you can work in government utility.  With each field you have a career path in and of itself.<br><br>In the Albert oilfield your career path for an operator looks like this.  Operator 1 &gt; Operator 2 &gt; Operator 3 &gt; Safety Supervisor &gt; Foreman &gt; Operations Manager<br><br>Most people are happy just being that Operator 1 and won't move up.  But it's the same in the business world, most people try to stay in whatever job they first get.  People always talk about how certain things are not in their field and how restricted they are due to their experience.  If you were to leave your 20-year position as an Analyst and started work in an accounting firm, your experience would not be respected because it is not relevant.<br><br>University is sold on giving you a broad stroke, but when you look at the possible jobs out there it doesn't seem as broad as what a community college offers.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not saying being an operator is a bad thing just adding that people with no idea what they want to do will stray away.  I love the operators of the world they found something that fit them and went for it. But most operators stay operators. There are a few safety hygiene jobs, then you have a stillman per shift and a couple of technical advisor type 30+ experience. You needed at least ten years of operations until you can split out of that role. Compared to the engineer who will get a new job every few years. </p>		</li>

			<p>Let's not get it twisted either, my public state school that I paid in-state tuition for was still 25k PER YEAR, tuition and the room/board included which could not be adjusted since we were required to live in the dorms and have a meal plan for two whole school years. I have friends who had went to school with me and also paid in-state at a public state university with various levels of scholarships, got partial tuition reimbursement from their financial aide, etc.. and STILL had student loans that were close to 6 figures when all was said and done. All that extra help only helps so much and there are a lot of states where college in-state is obscenely expensive for almost no good reason. </p>		</li>

			<p>I can only speak for myself, but I also refuse to be as bad with money as my boomer parents were.<br><br>They were &quot;always broke&quot; when I was growing up. They couldn't pay for my schooling, or even to retire when they should. But yet they could buy a house that was so far out of their price range, that they lost it 5 years later. They were both so inept with money, they didn't even KNOW it was out of their price range.<br><br>So I refuse to be always broke. I refuse to pay for more house then what I need. I refuse to pay for a brand new car when I can get a perfectly good car that will cost 1/2 as much and do the same job just as well.<br><br>When I do buy a house, I want to be able to afford to put furniture in it, and do upgrades to it, and pay for electronics and toys and go on vacation later in life, and enjoy expensive hobbies. I want to send my kids to private schools and good colleges and even pay for their weddings so they aren't burdened by debt right out of the nest. I want to retire at a decent age when I'm still lucid enough to enjoy myself.<br><br>So when I do sit down and buy a house, I will make damn sure I'm not going to go to the most house I can afford route - I'll try for a 20 or 15 year loan. Or at least make extra payments as often as I can, while still maintaining a good savings and budget to make sure I'm not eating ramen for those 15 years.<br><br>My parents couldn't ever afford to do any of these things.<br><br>I see that a lot in my generation.</p>		</li>
