			<div class="markdown"><p>You make some interesting points. Aren't housing prices in many cities many times more expensive then those the babyboomers were faced with (even adjusted for inflation)? It appears that (ok perhaps an extreme case) here in London, UK, young people can barely afford the most basic of accommodations, &quot;studio flats&quot; that are so small you can't fully open the door because the bed's in the way. In London, if you work an entry level job you spend some ridiculous amount like 60% of your income on living expenses, a further 20 on public transport. And like I said, London is an extreme case, but I feel that this rising cost of living (not eased by higher wages) is a phenomenon that is happening worldwide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Houses are more expensive in cities basically, IMO, because there are more people vying for fewer houses. It's just a result of population growth. Suburbs in most cities are really affordable if you go far enough out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Millennials are on average wealthier than their parents were when they started (adjusted for inflation). </p>

<p>&quot;Wealth&quot; would include all that debt you mention they owe, and to <a href="http://blog.metrotrends.org/2013/03/lost-generations-wealth-building-young/" target="_blank">state they are wealthier is simply not true.</a> Perhaps you were referring to income?</p>
<p>It is true that the income of those with a college degree make more than their parents on average. The pay disparity is far greater though. Adjusted for inflation into 2012 dollars, a young boomer with a high school diploma would make in the low $30k's, while his neighbor with a bachelor would make a little under $40k. In the same inflation adjusted dollars, young millennials with only a high school diploma are making less than $30k, while those that have a college degree are making around $45k on average. So if you cherry pick college graduates, than yes they do make more, otherwise not so true.</p>
<p>While the percent of the population with a bachelor degree is going up continually, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">it is still only 31.7% today.</a> Thus, you are correct that a third of the population is better off than their parents, at least if looking simply at pay. <em>Edit, wrong place</em> <del>However, the percent of the population that are now well off is growing percentage wise.</del> This has led to a much higher poverty rate for millennials than boomers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The appearance of being poorer is related to the rampant consumerism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is important to members of society changes constantly; implying negative connotations to someone with different opinions than yours is simply discourteous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Median REAL (inflation adjusted) income in the United States is at the same level it was in 1996. No real growth for the median (read: common) citizen ... in nearly twenty years. It is our version of Japan's lost decades.</p>
<p>Capitalism has run to its logical limit. It was run on Excel, and the final output was either a divide by zero error, or #REF. </p>
<p>Thus we must invent a new way. And we must do this quickly. Time is of the essence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. You brought up a lot of points I think people miss. Another point I'd like to add. In my city the houses were built at different times from the 50s, 60s, 70s, ect. House size correlates almost directly with age. 50s houses around here are about 600 square feet. 80s houses are around 1500 and new ones are 2500+. What constitutes a house has changed, and for that matter a car. Standard of living has improved so much that saying someone can't afford a house doesn't really mean a lot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has a lot to do with available stock at the time, too.  Some towns were just &quot;made form scratch&quot; in the 50's, where huge farms were turned into subdivisions for returning GI's, and that's where we got the baby boom from.  They built small because they needed affordable housing quickly.  Today, though, in those same towns, if you are a young poor couple with 0-1 kids, you don't build a new 2500+ sq ft house, you buy the house that was built in the 50's.  If you are a wealth family with 4-5 kids, you need to build a new house because few existing houses big enough and nice enough are on the market.  </p>
<p>Anyone who doesn't see this pattern though might get discouraged seeing that average home prices (and sizes/amenities) has gone up, but cheap housing is still available if you look.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I completely agree.  I have been asking the same question for years to real estate developers without a satisfactory answer: Who is going to build the brick ramblers of today?  I'm starting to think no one.  Getting the largest, cheapest square-footage yields the best return by far.  This bloat has been going on for so long, the materials to build these cookie-cutter houses continues to go down, and the demand for housing prior to 2008 was so strong that there was no incentive to change course.  </p>
<p>The sad thing is after a financial collapse stemming from people buying more house than they could afford that left unfinished developments littering the nation, there still isn't any financial incentive to change course.  Home builders just bode their time and now look to keep building these cheap monstrosities again.  What can you do?</p>
<p>If the government were to say &quot;this is the affordable part of town&quot; no matter how nice it started out it would become a slum.  The only way I see to do it in a capitalist economy (and I am not well-versed in economic policy making) would be to make your average home buyer really feel the pain of a home purchase.  That is, your 30-year mortgage might have an attractive monthly rate, but what if you had to pay off a house in 10 to 15 years max?  I'm thinking people would scale down what they were looking for and over time home sizes would come back down.  Isn't an attractive option at all, I know.  But again, what can be done?</p></div>		</li>
