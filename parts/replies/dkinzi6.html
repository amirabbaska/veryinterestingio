			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this, because they're making it to your grocery store, there are also a few more levels of middlemen, and therefore more people wanting a cut of the final cost. Suppose that a producer sells the grocery store orange for 15 cents, and the ugly orange juice orange for 5 cents. Juice company probably produces the juice where the oranges are grown. They pack them in boxes which stack nicer than spheres of oranges, and ship them out in larger quantities, which brings their costs down. They paid less for the orange, and it costs less to get it from the juice company to the grocery store shelf. The fresh oranges go through a couple of distributors and have to be handled carefully on the trucks and don't stack nicely. Brings up the cost and number of middlemen that it takes to get to the produce aisle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like you are drinking the delicious juice of a perfectly good orange that the average consumer would ignorantly shun given it's appearance, or that wouldn't be hardy enough for transportation. This is done with a lot more than just oranges, and serves to reduce the cost of the produce you buy at the store.</p></div>		</li>

<p>it doesn't matter if the color or shape is irregular of if they get bludgeoned during shipping</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm going to say this is not the reason. One of the <strong>most</strong> expensive parts of the orange is the oil which is found in the skin. </p>
<p>Florida's Natural's processing facility in Lake Wales actually uses a wood 'assembly line' for the oranges to roll down before they get peeled to minimize losses of these oils caused by harsh transport. They'd be losing a decent amount of expensive oils if they were 'traumatized' in shipping.</p>
<p>EDIT:
In retrospect it's likely oranges are selected for juicing because they're <em>already</em> undesirable in the ways you mentioned. Though if I were a processing plant I'd pay less for oranges that arrive bludgeoned as opposed to oranges that simply aren't photogenic. </p></div>		</li>
