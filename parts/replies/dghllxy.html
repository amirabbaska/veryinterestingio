<p>Global warming is cause by the fact that the atmosphere is transparent to solar radiation, but not to the radiation that the Earth re-emits. The atmosphere then re-emits the radiation it absorbed in all directions, some of which goes back to the Earth surface. </p>
<p>If we could add more energy into the Earth, like you say, we would probably find ourselves producing more heat (a lot of energy losses produce heat). The heat is the re-emitted to the atmosphere as radiation and so on.</p>
<p>So, yes. But how big of a difference would it make? Hard to say, really.</p>
<p>Bonus, the greenhouse gases are such a problem is that they're excellent at absorbing the thermal radiation produced by the Earth's surface. So a greater portion of the energy radiating away from the Earth gets reflected back in, and the Earth warms up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thinking in the reverse, why wouldn't it be feasible to convert heat energy in the atmosphere (or ocean) to microwave and simply beam off Earth thru the clouds into deep space, and be rid of it?</p>
<p>should i start a gofundme?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would you do it? Heat is only really useful when there is a temperature differential.</p>
<p>Creating that difference in temperature is pretty energy expensive - more than you would actually get from that difference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of! While it would be difficult to convert long wave radiation (heat) back into short wave radiation so that it can be sent back out to space, we can just reflect incoming shortwave radiation out without absorbing it.</p>
<p>Basically, paint everything <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo" target="_blank">white</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A quick google suggests the earth absorbs about 1.2x10^17 Watts from the sun. A 1m^2 solar panel generates about 500 Watts, so to increase the energy absorbed by the earth by just 1% we'd need about 2.4 trillion square meters of solar panels, an area roughly a quarter of the size of the United States. </p></div>		</li>
