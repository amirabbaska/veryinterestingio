			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow I never knew that. This is an awful reality for fat people. It makes me extra grateful that I have one of those metabolisms and/or psychological profiles that causes me to remain thin. I always though it would change in my thirties though but it hasn't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fasting is SO popular and one of the things people like Dr. Fung says is it happens faster with fasting due to re-using proteins (sorry, that's so oversimplified but I'm pressed for time!). He also said many of his long-term fasters have not had issues with excess skin so I wonder if that's why? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it would be valuable to add that while the count doesn’t significantly decrease with weight loss, it also doesn’t significantly increase with weight gain, but is more-so set during childhood/adolescence (according to that article). </p></div>		</li>

It gets better, but will never be back to normal without surgery.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mini rant on my own weight loss experience, but first, congratulations on your achievement!</p>
<p>Extra skin and stretch marks that don't go away has been pretty demoralizing after weight loss (about 40kg for me, over the course of a few years). Some people are genetically predisposed to have elastic skin that doesn't develop stretch marks and therefore recovers well after weight loss, but for someone like me, I'll bear the scars from my obesity for the rest of my life unless I get highly invasive surgery (and even then, it doesn't fix everything). I'm proud of the fact that I lost the weight and have been able to keep it off, but it drives me crazy that my body doesn't look the way it &quot;should&quot; for my weight and fitness level. It's a common thought, but man, if I knew when I was younger what I know now, I would have taken much better care of my body at the time.</p></div>		</li>
