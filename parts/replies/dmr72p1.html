			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, there is essentially a lot of guilting. The &quot;God will bless you if you only gave enough money&quot; bullshit. I always thought God would do whatever the fuck he wants to for his own mysterious reasons, that one cannot buy God's favor.</p>
<p>My most annoyed tithing moment was when in the prayer before the offering, some guy talked about how donating to a charity doesn't count as tithing. It's about giving to the church and anything outside of putting money in the offering plate is not what God expects. Complete guilting bullshit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>she couldn't afford to pay her rent, or to buy food for her kids</p>

<p>I used to belong to the Mormon church and the leaders' official stance on tithing is to pay it before all other expenses, even if that means you can't pay rent, because &quot;God will provide if you're faithful.&quot;</p>
<p>Then lots of members end up having to go the Bishop (pastor) for help who often points them towards state programs like Nutrition Assistance/food stamps and to local food banks. Some bishops are much more sensible and tell their members (in private) to take care of their needs first because God will understand, but those kinds of bishops seem to be quite rare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Giving your money to a church alone isn't going to improve your financial life. I don't want to force my religion on anybody, I just want to throw out a different perspective.
I am pentecostal, we believe in the Bible(NIV &amp; KJV). Not only do you pay your 10% in wages, but you have to pray. Having a relationship with God is the important key. You can't just pay to have God give you a better life. God isn't a great lawyer that can get you off of charges if you throw money at him. Praying to him and believing in him, and following what he teaches in the Bible is what's going to improve your life.</p>
<p>That type of church you described that ask for more and more money, are taking advantage of people who are seeking God and good fortune, with false prophesy. My church never asks for money, because is you truly believe in the Bible and regularly pray, you will give because it's your belief in what the Bible tells you to do.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's based on an Old Testament idea - in essence that everyone should save 10% of their produce, livestock, etc to donate to the (comparatively) small group of people (Levites right, people who are smarter than me? From the house of Levi?) who were essentially the pastoral workers of the day. </p>
<p>All of this comes from the Pentateuch, or first five books of the Bible, in which God's (or &quot;God's,&quot; depending on how you feel about the Bible and whether it was inspired by a higher power) vision for Israel is laid out in laws and commandments (many more than the famous 10). </p>
<p>With that said, the 10% idea is so ingrained in Christianity at this point, no one working at churches seems anxious to ask whether or not an Old Testament idea that was central the functioning of a sort of utopian idea of community should still apply to whether the church can afford to print fliers for the next event. In case my bias isn't obvious, I think it's silly for anyone to suggest that God is &quot;commanding&quot; everyone to give 10%. That's dishonest and self-serving, imo, because the people saying it want to keep their jobs. Those same people DO NOT treat all of the &quot;commands&quot; mentioned in the Pentateuch as timeless concepts that must always be obeyed, or else they wouldn't ever wear clothes made from two different types of cloth or eat pork (to name just two of many). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Genesis we see a few times when people essentially said &quot;thank you&quot; to God by giving a tenth of what they had.</p>
<p>See Genesis 14:18-20, Genesis 28:12-22.</p>
<p>In a sense, people do that when they get married, or at least engaged. There's an expression of love, and the gift of an expensive shiny thing, and the promise to live together forever.</p>
<p>Do people get married A, because of the expensive shiny thing, or B, because of the love? The answer should be B.</p>
<p>That's something like what the tithe should be like: valuing relationship first.</p></div>		</li>
