<p>When you are following fan blades, you aren't using saccades, but an alternate form of visual attention called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_pursuit" target="_blank">smooth pursuit</a> - the same kind used when we track a baseball or a moving car. </p>
<p>I think the answer is closer to the fact that our eyes are very good at following moving objects continuously during smooth pursuit, and this allows the visual system to do its object recognition duties better. When we aren't focusing on a single blade, the blades are moving all around in our visual field, making it difficult to perceive objects.</p>
<p>Edit: just for more information - saccades are eye motions that are used to shift from one area of attention to another. If something scary appears in your periphery, you saccade over to it. Saccades are interesting because they are ballistic movements - your brain calculates the amount of muscle contraction needed to move the eye all before the movement. Smooth pursuit is continuous, controlled movement where the muscles are controlled by visual feedback to keep the target in the center of the visual field.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, maybe. But I'm concerned that it's not saccadic masking since your eyes aren't saccading when you are following the fan blade - only when you first shift from, say, looking from a chair to the fan blade would there be a saccade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My strabismus means I can definitely tell which eye I'm using.. my brain seems to prioritise one eye at a time and using the other as a sort of backup rather than merging properly, and I can 'switch' by changing eyes. Well, so long as my glasses aren't on. </p>
<p>I learned how to do this by looking at my eyes individually in a mirror and freaking out by the way it switched my vision and made me look cross-eyed if I used my left eye, until I realised I could switch them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I wear glasses and still prioritize one eye over the other. Might be related to the fact that my left eye has an issue not fixable with glasses, it's a muscular issue I think. I can see just fine through it, but not concentrate on it very well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How did you learn to switch them? I have recently noticed that I am very left eye dominant and now I can't ignore it. It's like I'm only looking out of my left eye at any moment even though I can still see the things on my right side, it's hard to explain</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I shouldn't admit this but I quickly glanced over to my bedroom fan after reading your comment and thought &quot;WHOA! I caught every blade as a still while the fan was in motion!&quot; </p>
<p>Nope, just forgot I'd turned it off an hour ago. I really need to go to bed. </p></div>		</li>
