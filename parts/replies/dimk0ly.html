			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey as someone working in cell biology I have a similar feeling a lot of the time. As if the systems we are working with are so unfathomably complex and utterly counter-intuitive that it often feels like some of the questions we are trying to address might be too complex for humans to fully comprehend, let alone understand. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm effectively dealing with these same scale problems, but I get the huge advantage of <em>we basically know how all of computer science works</em>, so my unknowns are mostly my own lack of training in that area and limitations of what is computationally possible today.</p>
<p>Screw even having 98 unknowns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahaha for sure. It was Wnt that did it for me, fabricated some gradient surfaces for my MSc thesis so delved into the molecular nitty-gritty of all the non-canonical pathways for the literature review. It's all <em>super</em> interesting but it feels like you could dedicate a lifetime to a single signal pathway and still not really be able to explain any of mechanics of it to a layperson.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't suppose you could expand on this?  I haven't heard of Notch pathways (or if I have, not by that name), and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notch_signaling_pathway" target="_blank">wiki page</a> on it is really pushing my limits.  Is this a cellular example of a &quot;why would anyone think this was a good idea?!&quot; system?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I hate the term climate change. </p>
<p>Every single organism is millions to trillions of molecular machines working in concert to maintain homeostatic balance. Each organism lives in a community of other organisms that are equally as complex. These communities of organisms form a biome, and the collective of these trillions upon trillions of organic molecular machines organize to exploit every available source of energy in the area to convert it into more molecular machines, thus changing the physical geology and chemical output of that area, and each of those biomes effects every other biome, forming a global biosphere of interconnected variables that both exploits the available energy on the surface of the planet, and changes the surface of the planet to better facilitate the existence and development of the global biomass. The biosphere is a massively complex interconnected web, with each organism representing a node in that web and each strand the flow of energy between them. </p>
<p>Anthropogenic damage to the biosphere cannot be measured in CO2. What is occurring now is not just damage to the climate as a geologic system, what is happening now is the collapse of the biosphere. What is happening is biocide. Generally if an excinction occurred, the web would reorganize and route around that damage, and other organisms would step in and fill the niche. What human industrial activity is doing is deleting nodes from the biosphere network faster than the network can reorganize and rebound from the damage. At a certain point the damage overwhelms the 'structural integrity' of the web and it collapses entirely. This is biome death. As biomes die, they don't do so in a vacuum, they pull down on the neighboring webs, putting undue strain on those biomes as well, which are also under assault from human industrial activity, so they begin to collapse too. </p>
<p>What we are seeing now is the start of a domino effect of biome collapse where entire communities of organisms are being wiped out of existence leading to negative feedback loops in geologic and climate activity that spread across entire continents. </p>
<p>We cannot remediate this network on our own, it is too complex, too interdependent. Altering one node, or group of nodes can cause a cascade of ecological damage. The only way to fix the damage is to cease interaction with the network, and allow it to rebound on its own. There is no other approach that can fix the biosphere damage.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, you think the term climate change isnt harsh enough, and we should call it biocide, instead?</p>
<p>I do not deny climate change, but your argument is stilted.  You claim that the network is too complex and interconnected for humans to understand and be able to remedy, and then you go on to basically blame the changes on industrialization,  as if you can actually understand the system enough to tease out the culprit.</p>
<p>You can't have it both ways--we either understand the system enough to know industry is the cause, or we don't understand it at all and aren't sure what is the cause.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know a lot about basic things in physics nowadays. If you ever want to delve into the &quot;No idea&quot; try plant biology.</p>
<p>There's not a ton of incentive or money behind studying it for anything other than crops. It's easy to start asking questions even in your very first plant bio class at university and get honest answers from the prof &quot;No idea, no one's studied that yet&quot;. Well that was true a decade ago when I was in those classes, but I doubt it has changed significantly.</p></div>		</li>
