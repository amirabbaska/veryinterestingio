<p>30 seconds is better since most people don't realize just how long seconds are, and so if they tried waiting ten seconds they might find they actually end up waiting much less than ten seconds.</p>

<p>So much this!  I used to work in IT support.  The number of times I'd ask someone to unplug something for 10 seconds while I'm on the phone and they'd really do an immediate unplug-replug in like 2 seconds or less was astounding.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mate, I can see the service has been in session for the last 45 days.  If you DID perform a power cycle, you did it on the wrong service.  Call us back once you've tried again and remember we can see this.</p>

It's like, what the actual fuck? In your many years on this planet, you've not taken the time to listen to the ticking of a fucking clock and remember how long a fucking second is?</p>
