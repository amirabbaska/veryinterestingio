<p>2) That Russia is not democratic is EXACTLY why US should not be friends. Small tyrannies like Saudi Arabia do not matter in the grand scheme of things. Letting Europe fall under the influence of a tyranny very much weakens the US for the very simple reason that a tyranny can start a major war a lot easier than a democracy. This is exactly the reason why the US did not want a nazi Europe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) I was talking about the Governement not necessarily the people.</p>
<p>2) I didn't talk about why the US should or shouldn't be friend with Russia. I talked about why they are not. If russia was a tyranny, but isolationist and a major trading partner with the US then the US would have a relation with them more similar to what the US since the 60s (even if that will change over the next couple of decade as China might become more interventionist). The US will always prefer a democratic friendly country, but if the country is going against their interest, the type of gouvernement they have won't be that important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US has a democratically elected leader and the US has certain interests. </p>
<p>Russia is a petro-state that is run by a former KGB agent who worked in East Germany and likely blew up Moscow apartment buildings and blamed it on Chechen rebels which turned around his approval rates. He believes that the USSR falling apart was one of the worst events in history.</p>
<p>The country is run for the benefit of kleptomaniac oligarchs.  And when he's not killing journalists with radioactive tea (plus good old fashioned gunshots to the head) he's presiding over a large propaganda apparatus that includes RT and hundreds of internet bloggers (read trolls). And the countries policies aim to control its near-abroad states and destabilize the West and its alliances. </p>
<p>But Trump seems to like him so maybe I'm all turned around on this Putin thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, this is just about right. Mix in some arrests for social network post, mass surveillance of such ambition NSA wets its pants on a thought of being allowed to do that, a guy being arrested for giving a yoga lesson (illegal missionary work), people being sentenced for 8 year old messages to their friends on accusations of treason and espionage and you have Russia right now.</p>
<p>And yes, all of those events actually happened last and even this year.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nice way to summarize, excuse, and sweep under the rugs your global butchery.</p>
<p>Yes. You have &quot;interests&quot;. Which just happen to not involve a whole lot of human rights, or democracy, or anything that you ostensibly defend.</p>
<p>You have interests. Very selfish interests. And that is the bottom line of the story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. It's purposefully perfunctory and lacks any criticism of the US system or policies. And it's meant to contrast with the long litany of negatives the Putin regime brings to the geopolitical environment. Any attempt at equivalence falls flat. </p>
<p>The world has benefited greatly from the post-cold war Pax Americana. And if there's a better exponent of democracy and free enterprise I'd love to hear it.</p>
<p>But hey, feel free to expound on your criticisms of America. And feel free to tie these criticisms to the current Russian/American international relations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure what the argument is here.
Is it ok for a superpower to destabilize other countries for the sake of influence?
No question that western countries like to influence other countries but the times have changed.
Ex eastern block countries are no friends of Russia because they now how Russia operates. And to be more specific. It's not Russia but putin where the problem lies.
I am astonished that people like to put both sides in the same basket but both countries have very different values.
If you like a country that oppresses and silences opposition, sure Russia is a great country. I prefer the west where I can voice my opinion without ending up dead.
If countries are denied self determination what world have we build? What are our values. Do we have any at all?
It seems the west doesn't believe in their own values anymore. And because of Iraq nobody believes in the western value system because aren't we all the same? So because of that is Russia allowed to kill thousands, level cities? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't talk about values or moral here. I'm canadian and pround to be in the west. I love the values or my country and our allies. That said, the question is why Russia and USA don't have a positive relationship and I simply answered that it's because they have opposite interest. I doesn't change anything who is more or less moral or in the right. The fact remain that the actions of the US and EU, even if they are the right thing to do or not, still threatens the Russian governement. And when Russia did thing similar like in Cuba, the US didn't bother with legality because they had to protect their interest. </p>
<p>For good or bad, for moral or immoral reason, country will do what they can to protect their interest. And great power have more means to intervene to protect their interest.</p></div>		</li>
