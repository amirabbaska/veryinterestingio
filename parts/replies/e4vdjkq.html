<p>Sailboats can do another thing called &quot;luffing&quot; which means putting the ship at an angle to the wind such that the wind doesn't push on the sails in any direction</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luffing all your sails will just cause you to drift downwind slowly, and can cause the boat to spin and eventually catch wind causing accidental jibes (where the boom swings across the boat taking out any heads in its way), or take waves to the beam (side of the boat) which is uncomfortable and possibly dangerous. You should never loose all your sails and hope for the best.</p>
<p>What you're actually thinking of is called &quot;heaving to.&quot; You sheet your headsail windward, your mainsail loosly leeward (downwind), and you steer all the way windward.</p>
<p>When the boat makes way, it comes about windward because of your steering, which causes the mainsail to lose power, which causes you to drift back leeward, all the while the headsail is fighting forward movement. So you sorta zig zag and the boat keeps a generally upwind heading which lets you take waves at a good angle and flattens out the chop. Your speed over ground will be a knot or two downwind but that's close enough to stopped for most purposes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this.  Im a USNavy Veteran (2005-2011).  I’ve had the pleasure of experiencing many swim calls in the middle of the Atlantic.  When we are just in the middle of the ocean, we don’t drop anchor. </p>
<p>If you use propulsion to bring a big enough ship to a complete stop, it take one hell of a current and big waves to get it moving again.  Small rotation may happen, but it’s nothing so drastic to ruin the fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also &quot;heave to&quot; by coming about,, letting the mainsail out all the way, and leaving the jib the way it was before you came about.  This is called &quot;backing the jib&quot;.</p>
<p>The result is that the hull ends up more or less perpendicular to the wind but you dont make any headway. Instead, you drift sideways. The keel offers a lot of resistance to the water so you don't end up too far off course.</p>
<p>This is a good way to wait out a period of particularly strong wind or if you want to stop bouncing around long enough to prepare a meal or make repairs.</p>
<p>Just dont do it near a lee shore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Military ships don’t have anything special to break anchor in a hurry. Just like normal vessels, the fastest way to de-anchor is a well trained deck force, or by releasing the brakes and letting the break away link that attaches the anchor chain to ship, break away. To be honest, it’s much more dangerous to cut a chain than taking your time and raising it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On large ships, there is usually a method of manually detaching the bitter end of the anchor chain from its securing point in the chain locker at sea, often involving sledgehammers and a big pin to knock out.</p>
<p>That would be far safer than just letting the chain run out freely and risking significant structural damage to the chain locker when it has to deal with the shock loading when the chain runs out.</p>
<p>It's also the only method available to shed an anchor chain that has been paid out beyond the anchor windlass' capacity to raise it in deep water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The length of the anchor line is called &quot;scope&quot; and is, as you say, usually expressed as a ratio between the length of the line and the depth of the water.  In a flat calm anchorage with good holding bottom, you can get away with 2 or 3:1 scope, though its riskier.  4:1 is a safe conservative number, and in bad weather in a shallow, roomy anchorage you might go as high as 8:1.  </p>
<p>More scope reduces the strain on the anchor and the cable, helps the boat ride smoother, and reduces the possibility of the anchor dragging, but it also means that the boat requires a lot of sea room to be able to swing.  Too much scope in a small anchorage means that the boat can be pushed up onto the rocks as the wind shifts around. It also means you have to carry more cable, and cable is both expensive and bulky (newer Spectra line is very thin, but a lot of people don't like it as an anchor cable because it has a sharp, snappy ride.)</p>
<p>Too little scope, on the other hand, increases the odds of the anchor dragging, because the pull is much more vertical, and vastly increases the strain on the anchor cable, making it much more likely that it will break, which in bad weather is a Very Bad Thing.</p></div>		</li>
