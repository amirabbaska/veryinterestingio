			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing I was wondering about was that if there is a rule you can't do something, what is the reason that someone couldn't just do it anyway.</p>
<p>Edit: Comment from /u/Ojos_Claros</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But seriously, why would a country stick to those rules if they are already in a war? If we take WWII as example, who would stop them if they don't play by the rules anymore? And how would they be stopped? I mean, if another country had the force and possibility to ensure the Germans were following the rules, why not stop them alltogether?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simplest answer is tit-for-tat.</p>
<p>If you start torturing our POWs and raping our civilians, we just might start torturing and raping yours.</p>
<p>If you give our captured officers nicer digs than enlisted men, we'll return the favor.  Officers tend to like this arrangement.</p>
<p>Also, the threat of individual prosecution should your side happen to lose.</p>
<p>Most of these rules are the result of combatant countries recognizing that even in times of war, they have a lot of mutual interests that can be jointly pursued.  For example, two warring sovereigns who agree to spare docile peasants insure that whoever wins will have an ample supply of docile peasants to produce taxes.  Win-win!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both sides are always raping and murdering civilians.  Whether it's an isolated incident or a brass-sanctioned activity is a matter of opinion.</p>
<p>Since you're at war, it's almost certain that your enemy will claim your men are systematically raping and murdering civilians everywhere.  On the other hand it's easy for third parties to dismiss such reports of rape and murder as groundless propaganda.</p>
<p>Yep we've have incidents in Iraq where our soldiers raped and murdered completely innocent civilians.  There have been both cover-ups AND massive prison sentences.  A cover-up is a form of compliance from superiors.  A prison sentence is not.</p>
<p>But, can an enemy say our soldiers are raping and murdering civilians?  Kinda.  You can argue the present-perfect tense is inappropriate, but that's a matter of opinion.  We did not order nor sanction it, but it has happened before, and will inevitably happen again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Say.... A country is at war and brakes the rules. If that country looses the war, the opposing country will absolutely annihilate that country in terms of harsh sanctions and blockades and might even split that country up among it's friends. If that country wins, they will have to answer to the UN but they can pretty much lie about alot of the atrocities and say the other did them first (the victor writes the history) </p>
<p>So it's pretty much out of respect,  nothing can stop a country from using banned weapons but if they do, boy there's hell to pay.
And if they don't,  then both sides respect each other after war and the victor won't split the other country and may even start helping with the clean up and first aid. </p></div>		</li>
