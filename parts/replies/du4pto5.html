			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there’s not much moisture in a burger and fries.  The fries get hard, then don’t do much of anything after that.  The bun gets hard, might get mold, but they likely contain preservatives from the bakery to reduce that.  The cheese and patty have little moisture in them, so they just sit there.  The condiments are the only real moisture.</p></div>		</li>

The McDonalds Burger myth is like a science experiment with only one data point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>good to know! Thanks for setting me straight!</p>
<p>It reminds me actually of the story of the woman who sued McDonald's because her coffee was too hot. Everyone assumes it's a frivolous lawsuit because coffee is supposed to be hot. What most people don't know is that the coffee was significantly hotter than it was supposed to be, that franchise had been cited for it before, and the woman sustained such significant burns that she was in a burn unit for a very long time (close to a year, if I remember correctly).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem! Yeah that poor lady's story was turned into a onion-esque joke. AFAIK that spin on the story was actually the work of McDonald's lawyers. It's crazy how disinformation can be manufactured and be so difficult to correct. </p></div>		</li>
