<p>&quot;oh no, he drank acid!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;yes... but that's not why it burns!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I always wondered what happens if you used cold substrates for an exothermic reaction. It'll probably just be cooler than a reaction taking place at room temperature, but are they all/mostly temperature dependent assuming they won't solidify below a &quot;threshold&quot; temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly what I was thinking, making salt water out of acid/base would work as they can cancel each other out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, you're actually getting table salt and any desalination process would work. The reaction is</p>
<p>NaOH (sodium hydroxide) + HCl (hydrochloric acid) -&gt; NaCl + H2O</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could probably distill it, depending on the acid and base in question (and their purity).</p>
<p>It isn't economical on a large scale, but might make sense if you lacked access to water for whatever reason (stranded on Mars?).   Water is cheap only because it is abundant.  With the possible exception of Oxygen, though, it is probably the most valuable substance in existence given sufficient scarcity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it's possible, but you have it backwards. Salt water is common, and you produce HCl and NaOH from it. Reversing this is just wasteful.</p></div>		</li>
