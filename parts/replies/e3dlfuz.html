			<div class="markdown"><p>Just that they can get really really hot. Not only is it a safety hazard (burning a person/pet/your house down) but also the interior can get hot enough that the lava spends most of its time less dense than the water, so it never really sinks correctly and doesn’t work like it should</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I set mine up on a timer so that it's on every 15 mins then off for 15 mins. The lamp  cools enough that all the &quot;lava&quot; drops to the bottom for about half of it's off time. Is this okay? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a bit of a &quot;Lava Lamp fanboi&quot; - and I have several that are on 24/7 for years.  The biggest issue is that eventually the interior of the lamp will reach equilibrium and the wax will just sit in the middle.  Honestly there is no safety reason not to leave them on - I think it was mostly a myth from the manufacturer to avoid people complaining that the lamps quit working. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the light bulb that is used as the heat source also heats up, and the heat dissipation is actually rather poor, due to the fact that the lava lamp container is on top of it as opposed to open air. So, if you leave a lava lamp on for too long, you risk the light bulb bursting, which can cause damage to the lava lamp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I have always wondered about lava lamps:</p>
<p>Why does an equilibrium never form? How come the wax doesn't just reach a point where it is roughly the same density as the surrounding water, and stop moving (or move very little)?</p>
<p>I am tempted to say that it is because the wax is more dense that water of the same temperature, but would that even work? Or is it because the water is also in a convection current?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s exactly that: it is more dense than the water when at the same temperature. That’s why the cooled lava sits at the bottom of the lamp when it is left off for long enough. When everything is room temp, the lava is more dense.  So, when the entire lamp reaches, say 50C, the lava falls, where it is heated PAST 50C, floats, then cools below 50C and falls again, all while water remains the same 50C (I have no idea what the actual temperature is, but it’s between 0 and 100 C, for sure, haha).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how would the wax get hotter than the surrounding water? If it is more dense than water of the same temperature, then it would need to get hotter than that water in order to rise. Is this accomplished just through displacing water away from the heating element (allowing it to heat past ambient water temperatures), or does the water move enough on its own that it is effectively isothermal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Equilibrium is actually reached eventually, depending on how hot the lamp gets.  If I leave mine on too long, it gets hot enough that the wax just stays on top.</p></div>		</li>
