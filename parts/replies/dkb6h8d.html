			<div class="markdown"><p>The battery is not connected straight to the USB/lightening cable. There is a circuit called a charge controller in the middle. Lithium batteries have strange behaviours and need to be looked after properly, so the controller makes sure that they are receiving the right voltages and not trying to output more current than they can safely. So when you leave you phone charging overnight, it'll charge up to full, then the charge controller sees the battery can't take any more, and stops drawing current (and will occasionally top up the battery once its been idle for a little while). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Charge controllers have existed long before the invention of lithium ion batteries. You can rest assured that almost all consumer electronics devices you are likely to come across containing a lithium ion battery and the ability to charge said battery have a circuit that regulates the charging of the battery. </p>
<p>To add to this, the charge controller doesn't just check to see if the battery is full or not. It decides on what &quot;charging profile&quot; to use such as rapid charge or trickle charge, it monitors the temperature of the battery, the state of the incoming supply and whole host of other things.</p>
<p>Also, the percentage indicator of the charge of your phone can relate to basically anything! Just because your phone says your battery is at 100% doesn't mean your battery is at maximum capacity. The phone manufacture might stop charging the phone long before it hits max and calls this 100% in order to prolong the overall life of the battery. Similarly, your battery still has loads of charge in it when the phone reports 0%. This allows the phone to &quot;shut itself down&quot; but in reality it just goes into a super low power mode. This helps keep the clock running, allows occasional communication with the cell tower and can show a brief indicator on the screen to the user that they should charge their phone now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not intrinsically. Lithium batteries are lighter than lead acid batteries, and are superior in most cases. Occasionally you'll come across ones which have a heatsink embedded with the battery and charge controller, but it is rare that that is needed. And when it is, the case of the device it is part of is usually good enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No charging circuit is 100% efficient, all of them without exceptions waste a little bit of power as heat. That's why your phone feels warm. Lithium batteries (and most others) heat up when being charged. </p>
<p>There have been a few cases where phones caught fire while charging, but those were just very rare manufacturing defects. Most phones will be perfectly fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's actually the charging circuit itself heating up that you feel? Or that in addition to the core of the battery itself? I always just assuming the heat was related to some chemistry going on in the battery itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you leave it plugged longer, you will notice that it cool down. A battery tend to heat up at the end of the charge. Once the charger detect a full charge then it will stop charging and the battery will cool down.</p></div>		</li>
