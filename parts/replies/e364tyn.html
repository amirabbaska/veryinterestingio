			<div class="markdown"><p>It came on full blown one night and the hours following just completely knocked me on my ass. The fever lasted for several days even on antibiotics...and all the flu symptoms that came with it.</p>
<p>Really more than any other painful/agonizing part of a kidney infection is that damn feeling like your organs that are bouncing off each other in the most painful way are just going to pop. Words cannot properly express what it is like to have a full on kidney infection. I'm glad I explained it well enough for someone else to agree!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That burbling sound from blocked kidneys is easily one of the weirdest sounds your body will make that high on your torso. Had hydronephrosis for almost a couple months from lymphoma growth and yeah, nobody wants to feel their organs in that way. It's no bueno.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curios now...what is hydonephrosis and what exactly is lymphoma? I've been meaning to look up the lymphoma recently but have no idea what hydronephrosis and now I desperately need you to tell me apparently, lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, hydronephrosis is a buildup and blockage of the kidney causing all that lovely fluid to sit and swell. Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. I had/have a few pita growing lymph nodes pushing on a few organs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been hospitalised from a kidney infection before, but...</p>
<p>I see your kidney infection and raise you <em>kidney stones</em>. Having a kidney infection sucked, but having kidney stones made me realize that if I didn't have access to immediate medical care, I might honestly just kill myself. I lacerated my liver once, almost in half. I would do that ten times again instead of having another kidney stone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first one wasn't as bad as the second one, but it was still the worst pain I had felt at the time. I needed surgery for both. The second one started as sharp back pain. The kind where I thought I must have slept really <em>really</em> weird. Within an hour and a half the pain got to the point where I realized I had a kidney stone. I was driving to school, and immediately turned around and drive home (I was about ten minutes away). By the time I got home I was starting to cry from the pain. I had already called my husband, and when I showed up I was bawling uncontrollably. The hospital was half an hour away and we got stuck in a little bit of traffic. I was writing and contorting in pain and trying not to scream. I remember telling my husband I couldn't handle it anymore and that I wanted to die. When we got to the hospital I was crying and screaming in pain. I don't know what was going on in the ER, but I had to wait in the waiting room for another half hour. I was sobbing and screaming. I felt so bad for everyone else in the waiting room, but I couldn't stop myself. After I finally got a room it didn't take them long to start an IV and get me hooked up with pain meds. I had surgery the next day because I was throwing up uncontrollably from the kidney stone and the pain meds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah no...I imagine the hierarchy of pain goes, Child Birth (experienced), Kidney Infection (experienced), Kidney Stones (need pain killers just imagining the pain that someone goes through when having one) </p>
<p>First being extremely painful and last being traumatic pain that is past any pain threshold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't experienced child birth yet, but I used to work in a hospit and all my nurse coworkers who experienced both said kidney stones were worse than child birth. I kind of take it with a grain of salt, they're just going to be two very different kinds of pain. </p></div>		</li>
