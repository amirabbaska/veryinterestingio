Normal browser like firefox or chrome or internet explorer cannot access .onion sites but the tor browser can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its not illegal to access. you just use a different browser which masks your IP address.  Its more so what stuff you can buy or view anonymously that is the illegal part. (kiddy porn, buy drugs, buy guns, buy hitmen, pay hackers, buy steroids, hack yourself...etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not illegal to access, it's even preached at being a good tool for supporting free speech that should be protected. Journalists and whistle-blower use it to publish information when they don't want to be tracked by the government and such.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are one day under investigation for anything, just the court knowing you &quot;went there&quot; (they can't know what you looked at, but can know you connected) might be a negative argument against you.</p></div>		</li>
