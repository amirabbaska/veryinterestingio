<p>I would have to say that short of craving water when you're thirsty, your body does a poor job of conveying that it needs certain nutrients urgently and a good job of encouraging general consumption so that it doesn't get to that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if that might be because we don't really have a way to monitor those levels within our body. Like you don't have enough calcium and you get problems, but there is no active signal sent to the brain like &quot;low on calcium need more&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I don't know about those direct signals, but death via nitrogen asphyxiation doesn't hurt because rather than monitoring the &quot;You are low on oxygen and about to pass out&quot; levels, the body measures the acidity of the blood which is a measure of the slightly acidic CO2 levels. In fact, the body is so poor at telling when it is lacking oxygen while being able to offload CO2 that nitrogen asphyxiation <a href="http://time.com/3749879/nitrogen-gas-execution-oklahoma-lethal-injection/" target="_blank">could be a more humane death penalty</a>. </p>
<p>I remember reading a story about a professor who required his nitrogen filled chamber to have a much higher than usual CO2 concentration so that it would feel like you were dying if you went in before they evacuated the nitrogen. </p>
<p>Edit: I know that there was a comment about this an hour ago in another front page post, but in certain circles, nitrogen asphyxiation is fairly common knowledge and &quot;killing with kindness&quot; is almost required reading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A diabetic person can come to recognize the symptoms of low blood-sugar levels, as can anybody, but I haven't heard anybody describe it as a craving.</p>
<p>It's more &quot;I'm lightheaded, irritable, and more easily confused than I usually am, I must need sugar&quot; and not &quot;I don't know why, but could really go for some apple juice right now.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not everything needs to be some special instinct. The simple answer is they seek it out for the same reason you or I would seek out potato chips: Salty things are tasty. </p>
<p>Also it's not even extreme behaviour? Goats climb sheer walls because they're goats; it's <a href="http://snowbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/goats_on_dam_03.jpg" target="_blank">kinda their thing</a> rather than any unsusual behavior. Elephants meanwhile are extraordinarily clever animals capable of passing down knowledge of places like far flung watering holes from generation to generation. The elephants who visit places like the caves on Mount Elgon do it because &quot;hey let's go to the place with the tasty rocks&quot; rather than &quot;gee my sodium levels are low, better go on a hike to those caves a rather long distance away and will only solve the problem temporarily&quot; </p></div>		</li>
