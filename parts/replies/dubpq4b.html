<p>EDIT Nevermind I can't read. This is about O2, not CO2. Carry on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The top answer (at this time) is about CO2 levels; it doesn't address the OP's main question about oxygen levels.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. They talked about CO2 and I talked about O2. Two completely different gasses. CO2 is relatively rare in the atmosphere and does fluctuate a lot. O2 is abundant and stable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the fact that this answer is about oxygen and the other about carbon dioxide, the graphic has a scale from 377 ppm carbon dioxide visualized as empty to 386 ppm visualized as bright red. This makes it seem like there are huge fluctuations in carbon dioxide between winter and summer, with large emissions from human activity. But the fact is that it's a tiny difference of 2.4% between the extreme high value and extreme low value.</p>
<p>So even though the carbon dioxide concentration isn't as stable as the oxygen concentration, it's still pretty damn stable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indoors yes, especially a crowded building with poor air circulation. But in a sparsely populated area like a typical home, it is still 20.94% oxygen anywhere except right infront of someone’s mouth or nose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With oxygen, confined spaces are a real danger.  So large tanks, deep holes, sewers, etc.  If something else has displaced all of the oxygen entering that space can cause a person to fall unconscious almost immediately and die within minutes.  </p>
<p>Perhaps even worse the natural instinct is for someone to rush to help someone having trouble so there can easily be multiple victims in these scenarios.</p>
<p>Houses are well ventilated so not really a danger.</p></div>		</li>
