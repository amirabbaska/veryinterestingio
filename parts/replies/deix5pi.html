			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  I was infantry and did two tours in Iraq.  The transferable skills part is mitigated by GI Bill and we also have a huge leg up with veterans preference in federal hiring.  I met a wonderful woman who helped me through PTSD (mine was mainly limited to bouts of immense anxiety over things that should not illicit that response).  I graduated college, somehow conned that amazing woman into marrying me, and am doing very well in a high paying job completely unrelated to my military job.  That said, there was a critical time after my first deployment that I could have gone the other way.  You feel so disconnected from the world and don't understand the anxiety.  People don't understand you either and due to the Army culture in my unit and poor decision making on my part, I lied to doctors in military at demobilization about mental and physical problems.  I had been in Iraq 18 months and fuck if I was going to stay stuck in medical for extra couple days when all my fellow soldiers were free (this attitude was common in my unit).  I disagree with the above poster that lack of skill transference and available care is the problem.  IMO, it is the lack of education and poor handing of the demobilization process and support network in that CRITICAL 12 months after the soldier comes home.  This is more of an Army culture problem, not the VA.  Care is available, but dont get caught taking advantage of it by fellow soldiers.  </p>
<p>TLDR: Plenty of help and skill acquisition resources are available.  Demob structuring  with a lack of focus on a support network in the first 12 months after demob combined with Army culture sends vets careening down a self destructive path.</p>
<p>Edit: I feel like I need to clarify.  Demobilization (demob) refers to the process that takes place the week after you touch down in the US from a combat deployment.  We were placed in lockdown until &quot;cleared&quot; a few days later.  I am not referring to exiting military service, that comes later.  This is why I said this is more of an Army problem than VA.  VA on average takes people who are already outside of that critical 12 month window.  I was in the army 4 more years and had one more deployment to Iraq after my critical stage (much more combat and shit happened first tour than second. 2008 Iraq was candyland compared to 2003/4).  That said, there is another very important window after exiting military service that is hard for us to get through as well.  Going from a structured environment to the outside world is very difficult for some as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not everyone gets so lucky.  Nobody helped me through my problems.  My family started to blame me.  I didn't know what to do and the world was closing in on me.  <strong>Then I needed surgery and I had no medical insurance.</strong>  Took me two years just to be able to get my life back together enough that I could start going back to school.  Family still doesn't talk to me.  Everything that I had from before they've managed to take from me:  tools, stereo equipment, china from a tour in asia, my entire childhood, pictures, and the holidays that I used to be able to spend with my cousins and grandparents.  My brother's wife, shortly before divorcing him, called me to come pick up everything (which still, wasn't everything).</p>
<p>I'm left feeling bitter and empty and barely hanging onto a world that continually shits on me.  I don't want to deal with people at all.  I close off.  I honestly don't see any sort of future for myself.</p>
<p>All I see is a world full of selfish, arrogant people.  Nobody wants to take care of each other.  Half the lot claiming that $200 a month is too much to give to those who cannot afford food.  Too stupid to understand that the problem isn't the fucking poor and problem-riddled.  It's the fact that they are exposed to the elements continually. And that there are vets that are broken, literally fucking broken, from their service in the military, physically and mentally.  You know it costs less to house someone that it does for the subsequent medical bills from them being on the streets?</p>
<p>MEDICAL FUCKING EXPENSES.
THERE'S THE FUCKING ANSWER.</p>
<p>THE ABSOLUTE BANE AND PLAGUE OF OUR CORRUPTED FUCKING SOCIETY THAT ARGUES THAT THEIR SHAREHOLDERS FUCKING RIGHTS <strong>TRUMP</strong> OUR BASIC RIGHT TO LIVE.</p>
<p>I CANNOT TYPE THIS BIG ENOUGH.
IF I COULD BE THE LITTLE FUCKING GUY IN ALL OF YOUR FUCKING HEADS TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO I WOULD BE SCREAMING.</p>
<p>FUCK.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tanker here who did two tours in Iraq, I'm in the same exact shoes. I'm a junior in college now, which is something I would have never been able to achieve without taking on obscene debt. I tell any servicemember I run into to somehow take advantage of that GI Bill when they get out. It's too good to pass up.</p>
<p>Like the thread OP said, I think the biggest issue is guys who fall into that pit of substance abuse to try and forget about things, and local VAs that have problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a problem when it comes to getting care.  I'm lucky I have a good job.  If I didn't I would be homeless right now waiting on the VA to make a decision.  When I got out I was a medical discharge because of complications from a herniated disk.  This all happened before 9/11.  So when it came time to get help from VA I didn't want to be a burden when there were people coming back from war.  Well the back went south again and had to have a second surgery.  Was out of work for 2 months.  (I went back as soon as possible because short term just wasn't cutting it).  During that time I got a 100% from the VA.  It took 6-7 months for them to pay that out.  The paperwork was filed immediately when my surgery happened.  I ended up asking for an appeal of a disability rating I had received the prior year.   I asked for the appeal in Oct of 2015.  I still have never received a single notification from the VA.  VFW and Senator Kristan Sinema have been the only ways I have gotten any news on where my appeal is.  If my back had put me out of work permanently I would be homeless.  </p>
<p>This is just my experience.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Source: I am a call center rep at the VA, telling people the status of their claims and appeals, all day long. Automatic for the people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's said to see how the USA sucks in this aspect. But it is also reassuring to know that lots of other countries many Americans joke about take care of their citizens way better. Sometimes it looks like you all live a do-or-die situation where either you're living the American dream or you're pretty much screwed up (homeless or, if you're 'lucky', min wage + huge hours + no security at all)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My personal experience was that of a lack of transferable training. I was a medic, never deployed, and worked at a hospital, I did the job of a nurse most days.</p>
<p>When I got out, all I had to show for it was a NREMT Cert, and a basic one at that. Suddenly I am not even able to qualify as a CNA in the civilian work force. The training and experience counts for nothing. In order to do the same level of work, I have to go back to school for four years and get a degree in nursing.</p>
<p>My issues with homelessness and addiction were mostly unrelated to my military service, but I still had help from various programs aimed toward helping Veterans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, the training as a medic is NOT equivalent to a nurse. Not even close.  In the army, a Nurse is an officer, and requires a minimum of a BSN, that does go with you back to the civilian world. (They have to pass the same boards, ect.)  If you get critical care experience, ect - it all transfers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mental health part is a big problem but the post 9/11 GI bill is designed so you don't have to work while going to school. Or at least help with money. You get paid to go to school. I was in for 5 years and it's insane the amount of people that didn't take advantage of it. I got out and went to college and was making around $2000/month from the GI bill. The point I'm trying to make is that the military offers a lot to help you went you separate but a lot of people don't take advantage of it.</p>
<p>I graduate in 2 weeks with my Electrical engineering degree. I also worked a full time job while finishing school. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the VA has some programs that are actually well designed and capable of success, if used properly by the vet. I'm talking G.I. Bill and vocational rehabilitation. I'm currently in voc. Rehab and you have no excuse to fail. They pay for every single school supply and help you find a job in a career field you're intellectually and physically qualified for. </p>
<p>Think of those people in high school who you knew were just destined to be failures. The ones that joined and had to get an ASVAB (aptitude test for military entrance) waiver because they were so dumb or lazy. Those are now the people who are whining and complaining on the Internet about how the VA is screwing them over or they're out there homeless saying that it's the governments fault. They're wrong. I have multiple service connected injuries including 4 bulging discs that cause daily pain. I utilize the system correctly and understand that there are established wait times and I have 0 problems getting into physical therapy or getting the help I need.</p>
<p>When you have an external locus of control like so many vets tend to have, someone else is always going to be to blame. And it is almost always the unintelligent ones that go out and whine or cry on social media. I chose a degree with a direct correlate for a job (nursing), not some obscure BS that leaves you unemployable and has an awful career outlook. The VA can be a mess, but it isn't always their fault. It's he morons who spent 12 years at a low rank, busy banging strippers and popping out too many kids (just like the movie Idiocracy) that go online and throw their fits about how vets are getting the short end of the stick. </p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>It isn't always the government's fault. Stupid people join the military all the time and fail when they get out, only to blame it on others because they don't have personal responsibility. </p></div>		</li>
