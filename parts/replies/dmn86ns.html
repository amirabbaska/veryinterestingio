<p>It had been thought for a while that the reason we tend to suffer willpower failure when we lack glucose was because the prefrontal cortex was a real power hog. If it didn't have enough fuel, it shut down.</p>
<p>That turned out to not be the case. It actually uses very little energy. What's happening is our brains apparently consider it a very &quot;low priority&quot; part of the brain. Even though it doesn't use much energy, once we start to run low on glucose, it's still one of the first regions to be shut down in order to prioritize other regions.</p>
<p>Not arguing with you of course. Eating a caramel when you're running low on willpower will help out. I just found the reason for it surprising when I learned what it was.</p></div>		</li>
