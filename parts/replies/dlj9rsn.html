			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone reading please pay attention to this redditor. This is the correct answer.</p>
<p>I work in the field of optometry and I was getting frustrated that all the other wrong responses were getting so much more credit. The thing most people don't understand is that vision related questions require a response beyond &quot;ELI5&quot; margins in order to be correct and not misleading.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, you explained this much better than my frustration-guided response would have been. I'm so glad that someone was finally able to post the correct answer and I hope you get more attention for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I work in theatrical lighting which is literally nothing but manipulating colored lights (sorry, lights of color). I thought I could answer something about this question. Turns out I absolutely cannot. It's just a completely different way and purpose of looking at the same thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit off topic, but it seems you may have the knowledge to help me out. I have never been able to handle being outside without sunglasses. Even in the rain. The sky hurts my eyes no matter the weather. I've always just thought my eyes were &quot;sensitive&quot; but it seems there may be more to it than that. My husband is constantly trying to help me &quot;adjust&quot; and &quot;toughen me up&quot; by getting me to take breaks from my sunglasses. It's always a failure. Do you have any idea why this could be?</p>
<p>*i do sometimes have issues with interior lighting as well, but I can usually avoid the associated pain by not looking into the light. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just straight photophobia i'd expect. </p>
<p>We have a negative response to intense light and ways to manage how much light enters our eyes it since  to much can damage our vision. Sometimes that those process goes haywire and won't work right, which can cause a person to be under sensitive or over sensitive to light. Maybe there's something that causes too much light to enter your eyes than should (think turning on a light after being in the dark, except all the time) or maybe there's something that just causes a really strong response to a normal amount of light like folks who are sensitive to noise or certain tastes. </p>
<p>I'd recommend poking your doc about it if you've not, since it's often a symptom of some other medical problem. Not like you're going to die type issues but if it's triggered by something that can be treated, it'll be a good idea. Medication side effects, some neurological stuff, you're eyes just being stupid, feel free to google on your own since it's a long list.  Although you may also just naturally be more sensitive.  You may just need to live with sunglasses. </p>
<p>However it's very unlikely you're going to &quot;toughen up&quot; and depending on the cause it may even be detrimental to your sight to try.  Even if it's not treatable, it'll be good to figure out if the cause is &quot;your eyes letting in too much light&quot; or &quot;your response to light is overactive&quot;. If it's the first case you'll want to know so you can be properly careful and avoid potential damage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I read back over this and realized you might have been asking why toughening up isn't working instead. </p>
<p>You can't work out the optic nerve. The only way for your eye to tolerate brighter light than it normally can on it's own is by a reduction in sensitivity. Which is just another way of saying &quot;going partially blind&quot;. That would solve the issue I guess, but I'm thinking you'll skip it as a solution? </p>
<p>Trying to toughen up to tolerate that is kinda like toughing up to tolerate getting stabbed. Even if you could improve your pain tolerance enough to deal with it, you're still getting stabbed and should do something about that instead of tolerating it. Even if you could improve your pain tolerance enough to deal with it, it's not gonna make the pain go away, and would be about as good an idea as trying to tolerate someone stabbing you. Pain is your body telling you to do something about it, which I guess in your case means wearing sunglasses, trying to move in with the mole people, plotting to blow up the sun, etc, etc. </p>
<p>Basically give you husband a kick in the shins the next time he suggests it. Tell him you're trying to toughen him up.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>That also why things like aircraft cockpits use red lights. Rods are not saturated by the red light and remain active thus allowing for night vision when looking outside of the aircraft, but the red light stops you vision from shifting entirely to scotopic (night) vision where the pilots would no longer be able to read their instruments. It's also good way to observe nocturnal animals who usually can't perceive red very well and are thus still in the dark as far as they're concerned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh interesting.  I was annoyed that my newish car has a tiny red light above my car that turns on when it is dark.  I had always wished it would have allowed me to pick a color for it.  But instead the red is of particular use!</p></div>		</li>
