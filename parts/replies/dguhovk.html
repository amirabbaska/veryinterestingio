			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for replying, but let me a bitch for a second and say you are contradicting yourself.
Here is why,
you said, 3 • 0 = 0, then it follows 3 = 0 • 0, but the problem is </p>
<p>3 • 0 = 0</p>
<p>(3 • 0)/0 = 0/0 (simple algebra so far)</p>
<p>But since we are assuming 0/0 = 0 ,</p>
<p>3 •(0/0) is actually just gonna be 0, you are crossing out the 0/0 as 1 and saying 3 =0, but in this case it will be just 0 =0</p>
<p>Again,</p>
<p>(3 • 0) = 0</p>
<p>(3 • 0)/0 = 0</p>
<p>3 •(0/0) = 0/0 </p>
<p>3 • 0 = 0</p>
<p>0 = 0</p>
<p>Hope you understood what I am trying to say. Thanks, I love you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given: <code>f(x,y) := x/y</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>lim(x -&gt; 0+, y -&gt; 0+, f) = 1</code></li>
<li><code>lim(x -&gt; 0+, y -&gt; 0-, f) = -1</code></li>
<li><code>lim(x -&gt; 0-, y -&gt; 0+, f) = -1</code></li>
<li><code>lim(x -&gt; 0-, y -&gt; 0-, f) = 1</code></li>
<li><code>x := 0, lim(y -&gt; 0, f) = 0</code></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/oVEDMD5.png" target="_blank">Graph of the equation</a></p>
<p>In English:</p>
<p>As <em>x</em> approaches zero from the right and <em>y</em> approaches zero from the top, <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) approaches one.  As <em>x</em> approaches zero from the left and <em>y</em> approaches zero from the top, <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) approaches negative one.  Then I list the inverses of those limits.  Lastly, if <em>x</em> is defined to be zero, the limit of <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) as <em>y</em> approaches zero is zero.</p>
<p>Zero divided by zero is undefined because there is not one distinct solution for the operation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The contradiction is the whole point. Division by zero, including dividing zero by zero, makes no sense precisely because it leads to the contradictions you've pointed out.</p></div>		</li>
