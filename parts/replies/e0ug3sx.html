			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I remember a British or German University doing a study about problem solving ability?, trying to figure out if it was the air, the exercise or both that would improve it. They did this by testing people in different states: walking outside, getting pushed around while sitting in a wheelchair outside, sitting indoors, sitting on a terrace and walking indoors on a treadmill.
As far as I remember there was only a small benefit from “outside air”, a slightly larger benefit from the physical activity but the by far largest positive effect occured if the physical activity happened outside.</p></div>		</li>
