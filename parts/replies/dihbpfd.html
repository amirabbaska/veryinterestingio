			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. In his 20s/30s, my father earned almost exactly what I do now. My mother went back to college in her 30s and got a diploma for around 5k (Canada). My parents bought a 4bdrm detached house for 60k. While they were saving (6-12k down lol) they paid 400 in rent for a palatial 2bdrm.
Fast forward- I'm in a union job, my wife is a Jr ad exec, rents in the city are 2500 for a 2bdrm and a detached 4bdrm house? Over 1.5 million.
We would love to move to a smaller community where houses are cheaper but there are no jobs there. Even houses a 2h commute from the city are going up like CRAZY.
..... and .. we want to have a kid :(
Not sure if we'll be able to make that happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Childcare costs are another insane cost. Where I'm at in the United States its easily $150-$250 a week per child at a 'real' childcare enter (unless you get government assistance to pay for it). For many people it's on par with their mortgage each month.</p>
<p>In the US, if you've got 2 or more kids in childcare you really need to look at your income and costs to see if one parent should stop working just to avoid the costs of childcare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not far-off from your situation, and one thing that drives me nuts about this messed-up housing market is that it stunts family growth and is completely stunting generations after previous generations profited immensely off of it leaving almost nothing left.</p>
<p>My parents' first house was ~20k in the late 70s and they sold it 20 years later for 700k. The problem with the market being what it was is that houses were extremely over-valued, so to maintain living conditions you have to use almost all that money on a new house.</p></div>		</li>

thank you.</p>
<p>i agree entirely with your comment and the top comment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6fcjyx/eli5_why_people_say_boomers_ruined_the_housing/dih96jp/" target="_blank">here, in case it moves</a> but it's really a combination of both:</p>
<p>the rebuilding after the war led to a massive economic boom across the western world, and social services were in place to provide both the lending <em>and</em> the secondary education oppurtunities that previously weren't available, while at the same time providing an extremely strong union-protected labor base of manufacturing jobs for about 30 years. </p>
<p>By the time the boomers came into their on in the late 70s/early 80s, they started systematically dismantling practically <em>everything</em> their parent's generation fought for that provided them such wealth, while reaping the short term (read: about 20 years' worth) reward for doing so in lower taxes and whatnot. So as Gen X/Y/Z start to hit, we are hit by a <em>triple</em> whammy of the costs of both housing *<em>AND</em> education growing <em>far</em> faster than inflation, while wages are stagnating in most fields, if not flat-out reversing. </p>
<p>If you live in the western world, unless you get an advanced degree in some form of engineering, a medical field, or in some cases a skilled trade, you can forget earning a living wage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>if you pay 25% average tax, 30% rent and are supposed to save more than 25% for 10+ years - how the hell is it supposed to happen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By not buying Avocado Toast /s </p>
<p>Seriousness aside an average home in my district is $800,000 - 1,000,000. At a 50k salary you get ~$3000 take home each month after taxes since this isn't U.S. and taxes are much higher. If 30% goes to rent that's $2000 left. Food, utilities, car insurance you have $1000 without money to go out or gadgets to buy.</p>
<p>So ~4 years let's say it takes you to save for a downpayment. </p>
<p>Problem is this isn't ideal. I pay $500 a month for my car insurance/gas and additional money for student loans. So this can become 10 years. I may as well just marry a real estate agent in my city and live rich for the rest of my life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And 50k deposit (~4 years at 1k/month savings) on a 1M home is only a 5% deposit. That's the bare, bare, bare minimum. Good luck getting a loan, let alone a good rate, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think it could ever be feasible for someone making $50k to afford a $1 mil loan your sorely mistaken.  With 3.3% on a 30 year loan your monthly payment would be right around 5k per month, not even possible to try to afford that in this scenario.</p></div>		</li>
