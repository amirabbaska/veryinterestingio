			<div class="markdown"><p>A self-sustaining reaction is self-sustaining due to the containment. If containment fails, the reaction stops. You can't have a self sustaining reaction that doesn't require containment unless you literally have a star. It'll still not be using more than tens of grammes at a time for GW-scale reactors (if I remember correctly).</p>
<p>The only danger is release of tritium or other radioactive substances, but that risk is lower than fission plants simply because there's less radioactive stuff. You don't have years of fuel in place. </p>
<p>Edit: Guys, can we not downvote the OP asking a question????? It's quite a legitimate question too, seriously.</p></div>		</li>
