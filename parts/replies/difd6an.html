<p>We're not going to station troops in a place like Bahrain and allow our troops to be subject to local laws. Can you imagine if our troops got in trouble for a local law only found in Sharia, like say pre marital sex? The SOFA provides legal protection in exchange for economic returns and other things for the host nation</p></div>		</li>
