			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone told me that the E85/E100 fuels will damage the hoses/fuel lines of a standard vehicle, and you'll have massive knocking as the timing for those vehicles is vastly different.   Anyone know if this is correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they will melt gaskets and hoses unless they are rated for it, also they need to adjust fuel air mix to run the higher ethanol mixes which is where you have a wideband fuel sensor on flex fuel cars, it detects and identifies the fuel mix and adjusts the fuel air mix at the injectors</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you took a standard engine, and replaced all the hoses and gaskets, could you manually adjust the fuel/air mix to let it run on E85 permanently?  (Assuming you could stop the onboard computer from messing with it once you set it)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, rubber will be destroyed by the alcohol content.  Also, it's bad for engines that are not ran for long periods of time (e.g. a lawnmower during the fall) because alcohol absorbs moisture from the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would definitely NOT have knocking running E85/E100; they have <em>higher</em> octane ratings than standard gasoline, making them more resistant to knock. In fact, the 10% ethanol added to standard gasoline is in part to raise the anti-knock index.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would if your engine is not tuned for it.  You need about 30% more fuel volume to be at the proper air fuel ratio and if your ECU is not programmed, e.g. you don't have a custom tune for E85 or don't have a flex fuel vehicle, your ECU will not compensate for it which will cause you to run lean and the fuel will prematurely detonate.</p></div>		</li>
