<p>Go see a pelvic floor specialist! Even if you're not having problems, or didn't have diastasis recti.. go anyway!</p>
<p>There is really good research for retraining your pelvic floor and abdominals. It's very safe and can help prevent future issues from happening as well. I forget the exact stat but one study found something like 50-70% of women had minor incontinence with working out or laughing - which can be triggered or made worse after pregnancy. </p>
<p>Things can heal on their own, but why take the chance? Do it!</p>
<p>Edit: I think I fudged the numbers. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4520337/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4520337/</a> here's one study that references previous studies on prevalence and backs up the number at ~25%. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I actually had a male patient with this problem, too. Factory worker lost ~100 pounds (previously a bit of a pot-belly) and then tried swinging a 1000 pound transmission onto a line (held up by a chain) by himself. Pop! Said he felt like he came &quot;unraveled.&quot;</p>
<p>That was interesting. Haha. Nice guy, though. I wrote a case on him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in Canada so it's no problem. I can't speak for the US which I'm assuming you're asking about.</p>
<p>Though I'm guessing once you start talking about incontinence to an adjuster they will immediately approve it (and a doctor would be on board).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im in the US and can answer this. I had a multi organ prolapse from childbirth (rectum and bladder). Both were moderate (as in nothing is actually sticking out of my body. The muscles were just damaged and everything sort of collapsed my vagina shut) and my healthcare plan covered physical therapy. I had to get a prescription from my obgyn first though. </p>
<p>It is also important to point out that I was the one that found it. I was checking my IUD string and realized my vagina felt strange. Many women have this and don't know it. Since the speculum pushes on the bladder and rectum, unless the prolapse is significant, ob's often don't notice them. I highly highly highly suggest that all women learn what their vaginas are like pre childbirth and check up with themselves post childbirth. If you have a prolapse, however minor, and you do not take steps to correct it through exercise it will get worse. You may end up needing surgery which can cause more problems.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I had diastasis recti with my last pregnancy, does that guarantee that it will be a problem after my next birth, too? I feel like last time I managed it pretty well with exercises, it was about a 1.5 inch separation at its widest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had it with both, it was worse the second time.  My pregnancies were 14 months apart (meaning my first was 14 months when I got pregnant).  This is just anecdotal, but every friend I know that had separation the first time had it with every pregnancy. Sorry!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't find a study for it (I think my search terms may be off), but I would think that it may increase your chances. It sounds like you handled it great though so I wouldn't worry! Just expect to do similar the second time around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanted to add that I had a friend who used a belly binder after her C/S delivery. She said she felt like her insides were going to fall out and used it for months and months. She then had a terrible back injury during stroller exercise group because she had weakened all her core muscles by using the belly binder too much.</p>
<p>I'm sure it can help women after birth - I've never used one. I would just caution women from this one crazy anecdote that overuse will lead to zero core engagement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea this seems to be something no one can agree upon because I see many sites saying they're great, but also a lot of sites basically saying exactly what happened to your friend will happen. I can't say I would trust using one myself. I've only learned about them recently. I had my second baby 6 months ago and have been trying to get fit again, only to find my upper abdominals are still separated and have been looking up how to repair those ligaments with exercises. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a chronic back condition, and I asked the doctor about a brace. He said that 98% they're used under the wrong circumstances and just end up making muscles weaker. Apparently our bodies are super lazy and if you give it a crutch like a brace, it'll stop doing the work it's supposed to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me, except in reverse.  I had back surgery and had to wear a brace for several months.  Destroyed my back muscles and strength, and the doctor didn't recommend PT.  Then I got pregnant a year later and further destroyed my abdominal muscles with pretty bad diastasis recti.  My whole core is just a shit show now, and trying to fix it has been a real struggle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a women that lives a few kms from me.  I've never met her, but I've seen her running so often it was hard to not observe her.  From all of the places along the main road I'd see her running, it looked like her daily routine took her over about 8-10 kms.  And it wouldn't be odd to see her out when I was on my way to work, and again when was on my way home.  The women was an absolute machine.  </p>
<p>Then, I started seeing her belly expanding as she ran.  Then, she stopped running.  A few weeks later I saw her out walking, pushing a stroller.  Then, a few weeks after that, she was running behind the stroller.  It wasn't even a year before she was going just as far, but now with a stroller.  I know nothing else about her, but I know she's got perseverance.</p>
<p>But here's the thing, she never recovered that tight stomach she worked so hard for.  I'm sure she had more reasons than that to be out running so much, and I'd never say she is unattractive now, but that had to be disheartening. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For 12 years I lifted weights but never had to do cardio and looked like a bikini competitor. I gained over 50lbs during my pregnancy due to a condition where I made too much amniotic fluid. I had to change my workout routine to lifting followed by spin five days a week but I got my abs and body back. It took over a year. I'm 39 and that was my first child. You might have to alter your routine or learn new exercises but it is possible to have abs after having children.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the determinants of whether you are likely to experience a diastasis after pregnancy is torso length - length from the bust to the hips. Women with shorter torsos should prepare to use the Tupler technique when they are cleared for exercise. Running does not help much with ab firmness. Squats, pelvic floor exercises, and the Tupler routine do.</p></div>		</li>
