			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems like a more correct answer than the one (currently) above that refers to depth perception. Your answer directly deals with the visible size of the object is. The problem with the other answer is that it doesn't really refer to size, just the ability to figure out which ones are in front or behind each other. Well done sir.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They build telescopes with bigger apertures to capture more light. Not to make the image sharper. If you change the aperture on a camera to be smaller, more of the image will come into focus and the image will get darker since less light is able to get in. I get that reflective and refractive &quot;photography&quot; are based on different principles, but larger aperture is always equal brighter image.

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, light gathering power is also increased when you increase the size of the aperture. But it is true that a larger baseline mirror or lens has a better angular resolution. </p></div>		</li>
