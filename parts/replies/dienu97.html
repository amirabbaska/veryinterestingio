</blockquote>
<p>this might be a logically correct way. But the most common way of meaning twice a month would be fortnightly. unless you're specifically requiring twice a month and because a month isn't normally 28 days you will get two months with a third even.t</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, perhaps if you're a proper English speaker...though I'd bet most people here in the US would have to have an explanation of what a &quot;fortnightly payday&quot; meant. I think technically, semimonthly is taken to mean that something happens twice in a month no matter the interval between the events within that month so something that happens on the 2nd and 21st of the month can still be called a semimonthly event...though that's starting to get pedantic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure there's a cool grammatical term for it, but &quot;bimonthly&quot;, &quot;semiannually&quot; and the like are all adverbs, though they are commonly detatched from the verb and used as an adjective modifying the noun. Adverbs can occasionally do that, though its not commonly obvious. The &quot;bimonthly report&quot; is the report that happens (implied verb) bimonthly. Breaking it down by root and pre/suffixes, bi=two, month, ly=adverb modifier, so its more like &quot;bimonth&quot; is its own entity meaning &quot;two months&quot; then -ly modifying it into meaning &quot;(verb) once in two months&quot; If that makes sense...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is bi- modifying the adverb or the noun? If we hang the bi- on the adverb, we get two per month; if we hang the -ly on the noun, we get per two months. </p>
<p>We commonly use the adverb (&quot;monthly&quot;) but not the noun (&quot;bimonth&quot;). </p>
<p>The twice per meaning has earlier usage, or at least bears an earlier source.</p></div>		</li>
