			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that really work for Argentina though? If you replaced Argentina with another country then reading the 40% thing you'd be thinking &quot;whoa that's crazy&quot; but with Argentina you barely lift an eyebrow. What good is 40% if you lose money when converting it back to hard currency, which I assume is a big risk with Argentina given its past history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the idea is that inflation stops and you get a more stable currency and better exchange rates. You are however right. Those 40% of interests wont help if you lose 60% value in the same time.</p>
<p>In the end it is a gamble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While your statement is technically accurate, this isn’t just an inflationary situation. This is a currency crash. </p>
<p>In this case, They raise rates to stop people from selling pesos into USD and fleeing the country with them. </p>
<p>If you can’t find buyers for your pesos. The value goes down.  At 40% interest rates, they have a much greater incentive to keep the pesos, and to buy more of them.  </p>
<p>Their (the Argentine central bank) options are this: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sell their foreign cash reserves to buy back pesos. Tried that... spent $5bln last week with no effect. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raise interest rates. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do nothing and watch the economy melt down. This is a typical response after failing at number one. </p>
</li>
<li>Call the IMF and prepare for years of economic trouble. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This crisis seems to have come out of the blue with the latest govt budget figures. I may be off on the current crisis but Basically they’re printing money with an overly inflationary budget.  Unlike the last crisis in 2001, they don’t have a hard peg now to the USD like they did then.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they’ve been printing money for years but the last presidential administration lied about it hid inflation figures. This one isn’t. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's similar to all crashes. Raising federal interest rates always precedes major crashes, <a href="http://www.mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Fed-Balance-Sheet-and-Rates-1980-2015-graph.jpg" target="_blank">look at a graph of federal interest rates and the Fed's balance sheet (aka the assets they buy to prop up the economy)</a></p>
<p>It's not just Argentina, all of the central banks around the world are playing this game. It's extremely important to gain some understanding of &quot;Quantitative Easing&quot; and &quot;Open Market Operations&quot; because all of the major central banks are doing it, and the reported inflation does not accurately reflect the sheer volume of currency pumped into the system. Real inflation is much higher, consider that the consumer price index does not include food or energy, the most important things people need to buy!!</p>
<p>Raising interest rates doesn't only cause people to save more, it actually raises the cost of taking on debt-which is great for creditors but not for people who need loans, so it causes prices to go up. When people can't get the loans they need, the system starts to crumble. We never really recovered from 2008, and now the alarms are blaring from every corner of the global market, it's happening again. The central banks either suck at their jobs, which I think is what they want us to think- they say the same thing every time the economy contracts, &quot;whoops, nobody saw it coming...&quot; Or they absolutely know what they're doing and are trying to crash the system. In case you don't know, all central banks are actually run by private shareholders, their connection to the government is a charade.</p>
<p>Look at Venezuela. When the contraction begins to slide out of control, the central banks start printing money like crazy. They think they can just print us out of the crash. But when you dump trillions of new money into the system, it just raises inflation and devalues the dollar. The dollar is the world reserve currency, and if you look at that graph I linked above, things are not looking good for the stability of the US economy. These little crashes around the world are symptoms of the crumbling global market system, the dollar is the true weakness. </p>
<p>The countries we're at war with see that, and want to get off the runaway train.</p></div>		</li>
