			<div class="markdown"><p>My question seems to be two-fold.  </p>
<ol>
<li>Do other primates have a position similar to humans that they hold while in the uterus?</li>
<li>Do they revert to that position during their lifetimes, either when sleeping or as a response to emotions (fear, sadness, hunger, etc.)?</li>
</ol>
<p>It seems the answer to part 1 is yes, but what about part 2?</p></div>		</li>
