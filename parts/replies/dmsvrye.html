<p>Wind shear is a totally different phenomenon.  Wind shear is a difference in wind speed and/or direction over a relatively short distance in the atmosphere.  Think of a fan in a room, where the air is blowing from the fan but moving much slower around it.  Where the fan blast meets the (relatively) stagnant room air there is the shear area.  This is wind action, where it's acting like a bulldozer pushing the water ahead of it.</p></div>		</li>
