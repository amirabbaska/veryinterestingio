			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever notice how you can see into an aquarium and it's not blurry (when wearing glasses)?</p>
<p>There's a transparent flat material and an air buffer between your eyes and the water inside the aquarium.</p>
<p>When someone wears goggles these conditions also exist and the water is as clear to them as it would be if they were looking into an aquarium from the outside.</p></div>		</li>
