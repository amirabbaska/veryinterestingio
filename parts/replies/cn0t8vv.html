			<p>yes, but I think that's less of an issue than oil. People really don't talk about oil enough. It's not a coincidence that right as oil peaked in the US that wages started to go down and manufacturing started to be shipped overseas.<br><br>I'm oversimplifying here too, there's a lot more going on than just oil prices, it's also how we are reacting to it. I do think however that if we we had never peaked, but instead had continued to produce more and more oil, we would still have manufacturing in the US and things would be very different.</p>		</li>
