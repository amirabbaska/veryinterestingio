			<div class="markdown"><p>Since no one else really has addressed it, maybe it's like when you make a really good pass in volleyball, or make a great shot in basketball. You know what it feels like to do it correctly, so when you do it you get a rush of dopamine. When you sluff it a bit it makes you kind of annoyed.</p>
<p>You know what a &quot;good&quot; high five feels like--when it makes the most surface area impact and makes a crisp 'clap' sound--so when it's a good one you feel satisfied and this releases dopamine.</p>
<p>I make things up that sound likely.</p></div>		</li>
