What there is not is much of anything that is nutritional to the animal that excreted it (that's why it is excreted), but other creatures have evolved biologies that can thrive on our waste.  Plants can also use that organic matter, that's why feces makes excellent fertilizer. One consequence of the interconnected nature of evolution is that hardly anything ever goes to waste. Where there is a resource, the stage is set for the evolution of organisms that can utilize that resource. </p></div>		</li>
