			<div class="markdown"><p>I've not seen it all the way through.  </p>
<p>I've been watching horror films since the 70's, I'm not squeamish in the slightest, I'm not bothered about gore, but I couldn't get past the rape scene.  </p>
<p>Might have been the sound design, might have just been that I know a couple of friends who've been raped, and possibly thinking that whatever message the film was going to try to tell me, it probably wasn't going to be worth it. I could be wrong, but I doubt I'll ever attempt to watch it again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anybody with a decent soundbar or a system that has a subwoofer should at least be able to get an effect from infrasound. The more powerful the system the better, but it doesn't need to be window-exploding power to feel it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m talking about cinema speakers. Infrasound works better at low frequency’s but it also works for higher frequencies. Even headphones can produce outside the human hearing range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anything can produce sounds outside the human hearing range. The question is how loud they can do that. Anything not coming in subwoofer size packaging will have trouble pushing any sort of meaningful volume sub-20Hz</p></div>		</li>
