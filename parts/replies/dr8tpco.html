			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Pure water is essentially non conductive. Just doesn't stay pure for long though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As a user with a custom water cooling setup I only use <a href="https://www.mayhems.net/collections/ultra-pure-h20/products/1ltr-ultra-pure-h20" target="_blank">ultra pure water</a> to avoid short circuits because of leaks(which happen sometimes).</p>
<p><em>edit</em></p>
<p>Guys, you don't have to explain water to me. I know water. I'm responsible for the automation controls and analytical instrumentation for water and wastewater treament for hundreds of thousands of people. Trust me, I know how it works. It's literally my job. I know the science and I know how it works in the real world. I'm describing the real world right now. I know that the second you move pure water into contact with anything metal it is technically contaminated from that moment but in relation to watercooling a PC it's going to take weeks, depending on your setup, for that contamination to be enough to affect the conductivity to the point of &quot;failure&quot;(ie springing a leak and the water being conductive enough to cause issues).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no such thing as &quot;non conductive.&quot; Just &quot;less conductive.&quot; </p>
<p>And using distilled water just postpones a problem. When it leaks onto the board any dust or flux that has water soluble particles will dissolve and become electrolytes that can cause shorts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pure water is always slightly conductive because of its self ionization making some H+ and OH- ions.  In its purest form at room temperature it has a conductivity of around 18 Mohm/cm.  If the water is left to stand exposed to the air it absorbs some CO2 which will dissolve and create some H+ and HCO3- ions increasing the conductivity to around 1 Mohm/cm.  This is still way less conductive than tap water (~10 kohm/cm) or sea water(~10-100 Ohm/cm).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The metals in your fittings, rads, and blocks end up contaminating the water anyway.  Good for disasterous leaks within the first few weeks probably but after that the water is most likely conductive again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've often wondered this - would the water condensed in my dehumidifier be sufficiently deionised to be non-conductive?</p>
<p>Somehow I've never got around to sticking my meter probes into a glass of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope.</p>
<p>We use a fairly high end DI system at work that maintains about 17.5 Mohm-cm and it requires special tanks that we need to replace on a regular basis as they wear out and lose their ability to remove ions from the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rain is not really pure water, it pretty much by definition cannot be as the evaporated water molecules need a nucleation site (dust particle) in order to form rain droplets. In addition a lot of CO2 mixes in to make it slightly acidic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rain isnâ€™t nearly pure enough for that - you need specialized filtration systems to achieve that degree of purity. </p></div>		</li>
