			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but the addition of sources usually assumes sources which are much closer to each other than to the measuring point. </p>
<p>In any case this assumes they all have the same source. If the sources are incoherent, the addition is 21db SPL. Coherent sources would give 41 db SPL. </p></div>		</li>

I think Gravitational waves are the only oddity because their equation is slightly different due to quantum effects? Not a physicist so I can't confirm, but pretty much everything that works as a wave works pretty much like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn’t really sure where to reply to with this. But back in the late 90’s when car audio was all the rage there was Alma Gates. Her “DB Drag” Ford Bronco contained 64 10” subwoofers.</p>
<p>This truck was revolutionary at the time because so much technology and theory went into it. They controlled the phase and timing of every soundwave from every subwoofer. Ultimately I think it finally hit 180db before being retired.</p>
<p>That truck was insane. But the end result was they did control timing and phase so that it all added up correctly. But then again that would still be considered a small condensed space. The larger the speakers are spread out the more difficult it would be to correct them all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In 2002 the shop car at the shop I worked at did 172.2 and set a world for 5-6 woofers. It was five 15's in a Geo Metro. In 2003 a guy beat us with just a single 10 in a Honda CVCC.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. OP did not specify what db scale but I'll assume they mean Sound Pressure Level since it is the most common scale. Sound pressure is not sound power. It is like voltage vs power in electricity. A doubling of sound pressure is a 6db increase. Adding sound pressure levels also depends on whether they are coherent or not. For in-phase coherent sources, 100 speakers of 1db SPL gives 41db SPL. Incoherent sources give 21 db SPL. </p>

There is an animation on that page, that shows how two coherent sources interact with each other.  The 0db areas are teal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incoherent signals can have totally different content, or the same content but out of phase. In the first case, they won't cancel because they are different. In the second case, they can cancel if they are 180 degrees out of phase. Any other phase shift will not completely cancel. </p>
<p>BTW, 0 db SPL is not the same as zero power. 0 db SPL is considered the threshold of human hearing, but it does not mean zero power. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone correct me if i'm wrong, but I believe it's because the waves create a basis and you can make a linear combination of them. From there it would have to be offset by just the right amount for the waves to cancel out. Think of sound canceling headphones. What they do other than using sound insulation material is take the wave coming in flip it and send it back out to help cancel.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Huh... Okay, I'm not sure what the difference between sound pressure and sound power is. Which one of them is &quot;loudness&quot;? </p>
<p>If vacuum cleaner &quot;A&quot; is 60db and vacuum cleaner &quot;B&quot; is 78db, then B is 3 times as loud as A? </p>
<p>I've always though it was &quot;a 10 db increase means that it's 10 times as loud&quot;, but I guess that depends on how you define loud and which decibel you use? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Loudness involves human hearing and is subjective. </p>
<p>Sound Pressure Level is an objective measurement. </p>
<p>Sound power is not usually measured. It can be calculated. </p>
<p>In general, a 10db increase in SPL is considered a doubling of loudness. A 78 db SPL vacuum cleaner is about a 3.5 times as loud as a 60db SPL. </p>
<p>10db is a 10 times increase in terms of power ratios, but acoustics don't usually use power measurement. A 20db SPL ratio is ten times. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually adding 99 speakers doesn't add 20dB, a hundredfold increase is the same thing as a 20 dB increase. Adding 100 speakers is calculated as 10_log 101 = 20.043. </p>
<p>Of course there is a difference between having a 100 times stonger speaker and 100 speakers, as sound also gets weaker the further away you are from the source. For example in an orchestra the sound level of a musician's instrument is just as loud as all of the other instruments combined at the point of musician's ears.

And any calculation on power needs to include amperage and if there is more than one speaker, parallel or series has to be taken into account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your last point is only relevant because it's the vibrations in the musician's body that cause the extreme sound in their ears, not just because it's close. If they were levitating their instruments and somehow playing without touching their lips or bows, it would be a different story </p>

<p>I don't understand what you mean. Your last sentence would seem to agree that adding n speakers is log_(10) (n+1) dB, which would be 20 dB for n=99.</p></div>		</li>
