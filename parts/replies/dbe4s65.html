			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely true. Science degrees teach you how to think like a scientist in your discipline, not the actual things you'll be researching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So true. Whatever you learn is nearly useless in a lot of jobs. Laboratory skills can help, but the key part is knowing how to think and research property. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. Science funding is not actually being cut. Sometimes it just seems like it is because the number of scientists is increasing rapidly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the structure of academic research which results in a glut of phd students and postdocs. Basically the money goes to creating job seekers instead of jobs. It's pretty complex (people have written books about it and there was even an nih workgroup on the topic), but I will explain a few contributing factors.</p>
<p>1) The best scientists can run very large research programs with lots and lots of grants (one professor can take up a lot of the NIH money before it's worth spending some on a less brilliant professor).</p>
<p>2) The research in these programs is mostly carried out by the phd students and postdocs. So you end up with one permanent professor taking a large amount of the money and producing a lot of job seekers (a pyramid like structure).</p>
<p>3) The visa programs are very lax in academia. Lots of postdocs from overseas (mostly china and india) come here, further adding to the glut. There are some bigs labs that are run entirely on chinese or indian postdocs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating. Thanks for the reply! Is there a place where I can learn more about this (e.g. the books and NIH workgroup you mentioned)? I'm a fresh MSc in biomedical research and very much trying to make sense of of this strange world called academia.</p></div>		</li>
