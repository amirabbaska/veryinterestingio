			<div class="markdown"><p>Most beer in clear glass is made with isomerised hop extract, which is not vulnerable to UV light. Some exceptions exist, and they generally taste like skunk after being exposed. Try it yourself. Pour two beers in clear glasses, keep one shaded and the other exposed to the sun for 20 mins then taste them both.</p></div>		</li>
