			<div class="markdown"><p>There should be a huge emphasis on the longterm effects of living at a higher altitude. Your body will have a slightly higher amount of red blood cells (polycythemia), which improves efficiency in transporting oxygenated blood to tissues up to a point (heart failure is the breaking point, due to increased blood viscosity). It is good to mention an increase in 2,3 DPG acid (found in the red blood cell), which enhances ability to release oxygen into the tissue. This enhances a runner's ability to maintain aerobic respiration and mitigate the effect of lactic acid build up. Small nudges like this equates to running slightly faster and/or ability to keep a pace for a longer amount of time (more efficient). </p>
<p>Addendum: This is anecdotal, but I always seemed to think Kenyan runners were slightly taller than their competition. Lung capacity (size) is based on height, sex, age, and race (NHANES III). In this sense, bigger lung capacity is better for running long distances once factoring in confounders like weight and muscle mass. African runner have ideal body standards for this purpose (running long-medium distances). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good point on living at altitude.  Not so sure about height affect - Ethiopians tend to pretty short and have a history of producing some VERY good runners. </p>
<p>Kenenisa Bekele, current world and Olympic record holder at 5000m and 10000m (and often considered the greatest distance runner of all time) is 5' 6&quot; (167 cm).   Haile Gebrselassie, the other Ethiopian sometimes considered the GOAT is 5' 5'' (165 cm) - he held world records at 5000m, 10000m and the marathon, and was Bekele's mentor. </p>
<p>Miruts Yifter (1980 double Olympic gold at 5000 and 10000) was 5- 3-1/2 (161 cm).</p>
<p>Kenya and Ethiopia are huge rivals in track. It's always seemed quite amusing to me to watch races and easily be able to tell the Kenyans from the Ethiopians even from 100s of meters away simply by the height difference, and the contrast in running form; the Kenyans are kinda &quot;gangly&quot;, while the shorter Ethiopians always have a perfect, symmetrical, flowing stride.   . </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, what I brought up is the US standard for pulmonary function tests. The NHANES III uses height, age, sex, and ethnicity BUT oddly enough only has Caucasian, African-American, and Mexican-American for ethnicity! Dafuq we use for everything in-between?! It's a shitshow at terms in the medical field, what can I say! Pulmonologists worth their salt request more personalized PFT standards because of this shortcoming. </p>
<p>I would like to see what the RBC count and 2,3 DPG level are for these specific at-altitude athletes. I would like to think Nike/Adidas/Etc aren't giving that huge of an advantage with their shoes, but then again I'm a golfer and technology have made things quite silly now! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the culture plays a bigger role than people give it credit for. I watched a documentary (can't recall the name) where two white teenagers moved to Kenya (I think) to train with the best long distance runners. The Kenyans trained extremely hard and after a time of training with them the visiting teenagers were close in ability to the Kenyans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, people are putting too much emphasis on genetics. It plays a part, but look at Jamaica. They turn out great sprinters decade after decade, while other islands right next door don't have anywhere near the consistency. It's not like Norway is the all-time medal leader in the Winter Olympics because they're genetically predisposed to jump off giant hills, it's because they <em>give a shit about ski jumping</em>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As for the genetics, people from the Horn of Africa are more likely to have less muscle and bone mass in their limbs. (Look at how skinny Morgan Farah's ankles are). </p>
<p>As a result it takes less energy to run, which means they can run longer, but they lack the raw muscle power that those from West Africa often have, so they cannot accelerate as well. </p></div>		</li>
