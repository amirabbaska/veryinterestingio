			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you be so kind to clarify the kinetic you're &quot;stealing&quot; from when you do this slingshoting? </p>
<p>Is it the planets energy for orbiting a star?  Does this mean you cannot slingshot round a stationary (relative) object like the sun? </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a massive part of astro-dynamics. You really need to specify the reference frame to understand what is moving where. </p>
<p>Today on the front page there was a video about boosting the orbit on the ISS and a bunch of people were arguing what was moving where without first establishing what the frame of reference was. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are actually taking energy from the orbital velocity.  Whatever velocity you gain falling in is lost in the escape.  But the increase in speed from the planets orbit is kept. Even a deceleration could be done if needed in the other direction.  Also even a stationery object can be useful as a method of changing direction.  Even a 180 turn can be done with no loss of velocity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, typically the change in direction is far more useful but the little boost can help as well.  The only fuel efficient way to get into a polar orbit around the sun is to use Jupiter for instance. Also due to the Oberth effect, it's more efficient to burn while you're moving faster and a gravity assist can help with that in addition to any speed boost from the planet itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It all depends on your perspective. In a slingshot using a planet, if you are following the planet, then it looks like the satellite just passed through. But the key point is that the planet itself is moving relative to the sun, so if you are following the sun, the satellite is exiting faster than it entered. In order to do this, the satellite and planet exchanged a slight pull towards each other, which slows the planet down a microscopic amount and sped the satellite up a whole lot.</p>
<p>The reverse maneuver is also possible, using gravitational slingshot to brake. You just enter faster than you exit from the sun's perspective. From the planet's perspective, however, it just looks like a typical flyby because the planet itself is moving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The spacecraft necessarily moves around a planet during the maneuver. So, while the planet is moving toward the spacecraft both before and after, it's moving away arguably during the bulk of the actual maneuver.</p>
<p>Possibly though I just don't know a good heuristic way to think about it without invoking (Gallilean) relativity ....</p></div>		</li>
