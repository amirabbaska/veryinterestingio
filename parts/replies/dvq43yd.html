			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your explanation and how everything we learn leads to other areas of discovery.  But I was wondering, when you mention wondering if they all spin the same direction:  Since there is no top or bottom, (or fixed point of reference) wouldn't that mean that there is no definite &quot;direction&quot; to the spin?  If you are on one side of the disk, it would be clockwise and if you observed it from the other side, it would be counter clockwise.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right you need a reference point.</p>
<p>That said if you were on one side and noticed it spins clockwise, do all others spin in the same direction (taking into account if their &quot;above&quot; or &quot;below&quot; you) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But again, above or below are not constants but only based on our own observations in relation to how we feel gravity. In space there would be no bottom or top as we currently define it because regardless of which direction we approach it from the gravity would be pulling toward the middle.
Now if we talk about the poles on which the galaxies seems to spin perhaps it gives off a magnetic field like our planet and if we will be able to determine which is positive and which is negative, we can use this to label one as up and the other as down. Then we could use above and below for this analysis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In physics there’s quantities called vectors. Vectors are used to define the magnitude AND direction of a quantity. This is useful for quantities like velocity, acceleration, position, and the corresponding rotational quantities!! </p>
<p>In order to find the direction of a vector for a rotating body, let’s say it’s angular velocity (velocity of rotation), we use a method called the right hand rule. In this method you curl your RIGHT HAND, align it with the rotating object, and rotate your hand in the direction of the rotation of the body. I’m sure videos online would be more useful, search right hand rule on YouTube if interested. </p>
<p>Anyways, the grandiose truth from this is the vector of rotation will always be in the same direction no matter where you observe the rotation from. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I guess you can think about it this way: things spin in a plane. If you color one star purple and watch it for a billion years, it should make a circle, and that circle is in a plane. So make a plane for each galaxy, and see if all the planes are parallel. Of course, you’d also need to know which direction they’re spinning (clockwise or counter). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep. The ones that look like they're going the other way are actually upside down ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I just read a comment straight from NDT, and I liked it. You didn't throw a lot of equations and technical lingo I would not have understood. You gave me the basics, explained how it might relate to other things, and did it all without hurting my head or boring me to tears.You have made me excited about boring old rotation.</p>
<p>I would like to know where I can send whatever pitiful funds I can scrounge together to fund studies in galactic rotation.</p></div>		</li>
