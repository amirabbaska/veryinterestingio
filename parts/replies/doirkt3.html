			<div class="markdown"><p>God that's so cool.</p>
<p>What percentage of mass of a star is lost during supernova? What size star would result in a 1.1 solar mass neutron star?</p>
<p>Edit: from neutron star wiki...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A neutron star is the collapsed core of a large star which before collapse had a total of between 10 and 29 solar masses.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know right! but remember neutron stars are like 20km wide, instead of however many millions of km the sun is.
It's suppose it's got more to do with the density than the mass</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  The density is what matters because gravity becomes weaker or stronger with the square of the distance.  If you push together <em>any</em> mass into a sufficiently high density, gravity will take over and generate a white dwarf, neutron star or a black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of piggybacking on this question, if you say collide two stars of 2 solar masses each, assuming that the gravitational wave losses are not that large, how long will it take between the collision and the formation of the event horizon?</p>
<p>ps: can you use gravity disturbances to see inside an event horizon?</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, but you can watch the shape of the event horizon.</p></div>		</li>
