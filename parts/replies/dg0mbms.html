			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, yes. They occur because energy would not be conserved otherwise. The same is the case for accelerating charges in Electromagnetism, except instead of a gravitational wave an accelerating charge will produce EM radiation (light).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Change in acceleration&quot; is correct. For EM, it is true for change in velocity but gravity between the Earth and Sun accounts for acceleration as well. Here's the relevant part from the source:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;An even more impressive example of the position-lag cancellation effects involves the &quot;force of gravity&quot; on a massive test particle orbiting a much more massive source of gravity, such as the Earth orbiting the Sun. In the case of Einstein's gravitational field equations the field interaction depends not only on the position and velocity but also on the acceleration, so the aberration cancels out not only to the first-order (as in electromagnetism) but also to the second-order. Thus the &quot;force of gravity&quot; on an orbiting body points almost exactly in the direction of the gravitating source at the present instant, even though the source (e.g., the Sun) is actually undergoing non-uniform motion. In the two-body problem, both objects actually orbit around the common center of mass, so the Sun (for example) actually proceeds in a circle, but the &quot;force of gravity&quot; exerted on the Earth effectively anticipates this motion (to the second order).&quot;</p>
