<p>there is no data compression between frames.</p>

<p>That's not very well put and it's certainly not true. The Gif format uses LZW compression and successive frames only carry the changes between the two frames when done correctly. </p></div>		</li>

<p>While you can have a gif that only sends what's changed, it's still an entire frame that's sent. You also lose a whole color to transparency to achieve the effect, of which gifs can have only 256 per frame.</p>
<p>Video since even before MPEG doesn't need to send the entire frame. Modern methods even allow referencing what's already on the frame and moving it without sending image data at all.</p></div>		</li>
