			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how I see it as well. It's all a bit self fulfilling. The barrier of entry to prestigious universities selects for people who excel. When paired with the better connections they'll make by attending, it only makes sense that they'll be more successful than average. The material they're presented wouldn't really even need to be better than other universities.</p></div>		</li>
