			<div class="markdown"><p>Pi has been calculated to over 13 trillion digits.</p>
<p>Mathematician James Grime (of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpyrF_Ci2TQ" target="_blank">Numberphile</a>) determined the first 39 digits of pi [3.14159265358979323846264338327950288420] are enough to calculate the circumference of the known universe to the width of a single hydrogen atom. </p>
<p>Just to put an example on your information there. A circle can't get much bigger than the entire universe, and we can use very few digits of pi to get very close to the circumference of everything that is. </p>
<p>So the number that has been calculated is far more specific than we will ever need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its also worth noting that we dont NEED to know all that many digits of pi for... much of anything.</p>
<p>Even with only 40 decimal places, you could calculate the circumference of a circle the size of the known universe to an accuracy of just a couple hydrogen atoms! Any additional decimal places beyond 40 is just superfluous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>people with no scientific background tend to underestimate the importance of significant figures.
whenever something is rounded, people tend to say &quot;but that means it's not accurate!&quot; - same goes for pi of course.
don't even get me started on probability, an austrian court revoked the last election because there was a nonzero probability the outcome could have been in favour of the other candidate.</p></div>		</li>
