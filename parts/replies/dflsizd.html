			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they wanted to focus on the GMO issues. But if you look at the links in the video description area, I offered links that explore the wider issues with herbicides, specifically noting that the issues are neither new, nor limited to GMOness. </p>
<p>The issues are so often conflated.</p>
<p>I do wish that people who want to reduce synthetic pesticides would understand how GMOs could benefit that kind of production system, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As acceptance in society, they should be regarded as organic foods are now as a means to better understanding of the science.  They are unjustly conflated as a weapon of corporate greed and not the incredibly powerful tool of modern science which they are.</p>
<p>Fear of the unknown, naturalistic fallicy, and a mountain of confirmation bias is the social obstruction to any progress within gmo science.  It's crazy to think how much more we can learn if gmo's we're regarded in the light of the &quot;organic&quot; label.  I would personally love to have a mutant watermelon sized strawberry and I would pay extra for a gmo label because it supports science and the betterment of human kind.</p></div>		</li>

<p>this is a big one to overcome. I know lots of the Organic crowd that always harp on about how they dont use pesticides or herbicides. To which I say they infact do, and show them. But they still stick to their Organic ideals because it fits into their world view. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that really a fair statement to make? We already have the abilities and methods to have spray-free agriculture, the issue is lack of incentive to change methods. Relying on GMOs to possibly force that kind of change strikes me as potentially trying to over-complicate something that should probably be happening on a grassroots level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we left agriculture to grassroots level, we'd have billions less people around because they'd starve and die if they were born. I don't see how an arbitrarily defined naturalism helps anything. Genetically modifying plants to suite our needs <em>is</em> natural. It's product of evolution, like everything else life does on this planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a sustainability scientist, I understand how using GMOs can lead to more intensive farming with less impact on the land, which could then lead to a rebranding of GMO as a sustainable alternative at your supermarket. But given human nature it is just as likely that people will continue to clear forests for farmlands anyway, using GMO crops instead of the modern ones we use now. </p>
<p>Environmental protection is a planning issue - it takes a lot of guts to tell your community to not cut down that patch of forest. Government regulations are a better vehicle of this idea than a hot new technology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's acting on personal incentive that's human nature, not the clearing of forest. If less land is required for food production, these people won't benefit as much from expanding their farmland as the market demand is already being met.</p>
<p>Decades ago, environmentalists dismissed nuclear energy because their idealism and irrational fears trumfed pragmatism. They might mean well, but this has still been disastrous for the world climate. Sure, the green industry have finally developed, but the vast majority of energy still comes from fossil fuels and even if it didn't, the past decades have caused irreversable damage.</p>
<p>We are over 7 billion people. We need to find the most efficient way to supply energy and food with the least negative impact or we will head for a disaster. Let me correct that: a bigger disaster than we already anticipate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually if yield per acre goes up, economics suggests that in general more land will be cleared for farming, rather than less. When the value you can extract from a resource increases, demand for that resource should also increase, rather than decreasing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that people are <em>less likely</em> to expand if can produce what they need on the smaller amount of land, but some people are greedy and would expand regardless. </p>
<p>I think if the government and industry work together to say, &quot;We are making regulations to protect area X over here and you can't farm there, BUT we are working with company Y to produce farming methods that can help you and we will help get you started with that&quot; then things would seem more palatable. </p>
<p>I think regulation to protect lands is important, and if I've learned anything from life, half the regulations/safety warnings in this world exist because <em>some people</em> not all are doing something that fucks over lots of people. So we regulate. But if we regulate and provide new opportunity, it's better. Regulation with no help = no no. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regulation and new tech are not mutually exclusive--on the contrary, new developments for tech (like higher yield/acre and less crop loss) could act as good evidence to convince gov't orgs to support more ecosystem protection. If you no longer need more space for farming, where's the incentive to clear-cut that forest?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can make <em>even more</em> food with that land, making the land the forest stands on more appealing for farming. Granted, there is a diminishing return on food, and I have no idea what the elasticity of food looks like, so it might <em>not</em> lead to that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why is it just as likely? The GMO crops will increase yield, hence increase supply. Thus there would be less incentive to clear forests unless demand rises to compensate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Demand would absolutely rise, the meatification of diets in rising middleclasses would create more massive markets for grains as feed. By increasing this sort of demand people would use GMOs, but the more nutrients that GMOs are using must come from the ground. More nutritous food naturally results in more nutrients taken out of the ground, which requires more fertilizer. GMOs are good at what they do, but they are part of the larger problem of industrial agriculture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's odd seeing people discuss herbicides only in the context of GMOs, when there's already dozens of herbicides in use that many species were already naturally resistant to. </p>
<p>Weed N Feed and similar products have a three herbicide combination that most lawn grasses were always resistant to. </p>
<p>Strawberries, sugar cane, corn, wheat, and many other crops were already resistant to many herbicides discovered decades ago. </p></div>		</li>
