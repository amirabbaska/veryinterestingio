<p>Equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of the same limits</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nitpick: it's actually equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences that are mutually Cauchy, since the sequences themselves may not even have limits! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once the real numbers are in place, those are the same thing. But I guess you can't use that because we're trying to construct those in the first place.</p>
<p>In a way, you're defining what it means for sequences to &quot;have the same limit&quot; since these might not have limits in <strong>Q</strong>, though they certainly do in <strong>R</strong>. Mutually Cauchy means that the sequence made by alternately reading from the two sequences is also Caucy.</p>
<p>I know you know this. This comment is for others who are as confused as I was 4 minutes ago. And also to double check that I'm interpreting correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that's the distinction I was making. The Cauchy sequences that you construct in the rationals may not have a limit in the rationals. You can't construct the equivalence class of, say, sequences that approach sqrt(2), because that would be circular--sqrt(2) is <em>defined</em> as this equivalence class!</p>
<p>EDIT: I should say &quot;You can't construct the equivalence class of, say, sequences that approach sqrt(2) <em>when we only have the rationals to work with</em>&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The definition of multiplication as repeated addition really only makes sense for natural numbers, so we need two more preliminary steps where we extend the multiplication operation to the integers by (-a)b = a(-b) = -ab and then to the rational numbers by (a/b)(c/d) = ac/bd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if there is a formal term for an element that behaves in the way that zero does with respect to multiplication, other than &quot;zero element&quot;. Anyway, my point is that regardless of what axioms you assume, it doesn't make sense to say that the product of two negative integers is defined by &quot;repeated addition&quot; simply because it doesn't make sense to repeat an operation a negative number of times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I skipped that step. For visualization purposes, I'd describe it as drawing a big rectangle <em>ab</em> on one side (so <em>a</em> units represent <em>a/b</em>) and <em>cd</em> on the other side. Then the product is the ratio of the small rectangle <em>ac</em> to the big one <em>abcd</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this really the answer? Imagine this simple question had been asked thousands of years ago when people multiplied? How did anyone even invent/discover it? When someone first decided to multiply length with width for an area, how did they convince others that it's true?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously, but my question is quite specific, how did they in history when multiplication was <em>first</em> done, convince themselves it's meaningful? In other words, suppose one of them asked in terms of repetitive addition, what if it's just a coincidence? And in terms of area, how can one be sure it's a meaningful truth, other than a pragmatic procedure that so far has not been contradicted by practical experience?</p></div>		</li>
