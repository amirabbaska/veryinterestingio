			<div class="markdown"><p>Snow is a lot more finicky.  Snow can drift, there's always some places deeper than others.</p>
<p>Most of what I heard is that meteorologists have a rod with markers they stick into the snow at numerous random places, somewhere with a good even ground underneath, and largely free of drifts.... then take the average.</p>
<p>But even then, during a large snowfall, they'll also measure the drifts to give a measurement for how deep it may get in drift, should you get caught in one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can maybe say it in a way that doesn't <em>sound</em> complicated, but concept itself -- that instead of measuring a volume of rain you can meaningfully give a depth (i.e., a volume-per-area) -- is actually relatively advanced.  Just look at some of the replies to his comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try explaining what a board-foot of wood is to some people...</p>
<p>In the simplest case it's a 12&quot; length of a 12&quot; wide by 1&quot; thick plank. Where it gets complicated is that it's a measurement of volume, so it's also a 24&quot; length of a 6&quot; x 1&quot; plank, or a 12&quot; length of a 6&quot; x 2&quot; plank, or...</p>
<p>I've seen great long threads on woodwork forums trying to explain it. Sometimes it just never clicks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it depends on your default intuition. To give rain in volume would be hugely confusing to me. Does it mean the entire volume of rain that fell from the cloud system as it moved over hundreds of miles? If it continued to drop rain hundreds of miles from here, how does that affect the rain here. Volume of rain just seems a useless idea.</p>
<p>What you want to know is, if you are standing outside, will you only get a few drops of rain on your head or will it get soaked through in seconds; will your yard be slightly damp or will there be water sitting on top of it, coming faster than it can drain.</p>
<p>For those types of answers what you need to know is the volume of rain <em>that falls on a given area</em> (head, yard) per unit of time. This is just the depth of the water per unit ground area per unit time. It's the same depth whether you put a bucket on your head or a bucket the size of your yard, because the space between raindrops is uniform. </p>
<p>That makes intuitive sense to me. Volume doesn't. The same volume falling on my head or my yard or my city means very different things. </p>
<p>My issue is that it typically doesn't give a unit of time. Sometimes you need it, like will your lawn or window wells be able to drain the water fast enough or will it start to fill up. And sometimes we get that by looking at hourly weather (so many millimeters or inches in that hour). Typically it is the total over the day. But, that doesn't tell you if it all comes in 1 hour or over 24 hours, which matters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's measuring a depth. Volume would be dependent on the surface area of the spot you're measuring, which changes based on what container you're collecting with or, on a larger scale, the shape of the cloud. Depth is irrelevant of area, it will be the same (or close enough as makes no difference) throughout.</p>
<p>Edit: if you put out a bucket, and measured the depth of the water in the bucket after with a ruler, that depth should be about the amount of rain that fell, e.g. if you were told an inch of rain fell, there should be about an inch deep of water. Regardless of how wide the bucket is. This is ignoring issues with rain hitting the sides and never making it in, or containers that don't have vertical sides, but it mostly gets the point across.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of rainfall, in terms of volume, is proportional to the land area over which it happens. Given equally intense rain, an acre of land might get covered with an inch of rain. Put a bathtub (with straight vertical sides) out in that rain, it will also fill with an inch of water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like snow. Snow doesn't typically get absorbed right into the ground, it kind of just stays there. So when you get 6&quot; of snow the snow is actually 6&quot; deep almost everywhere. There is some variance here and there, and maybe 10 miles away only 3&quot; of snow fell, and maybe 10 miles in another direction 12&quot; of snow fell. It's just that depth, and it's not measured in volume, just distance.</p></div>		</li>
