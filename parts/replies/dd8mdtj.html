			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually think this nonstandard time thing can be bad for a story. The example I always think of is S4 of Arrested Development. There was hardly any wasted space in the original run, and the tightness was one of the best parts about the show. In the Netflix season, there was no set time for the episodes so they'd drag tiny things out that prevented the show from being as effective. </p>
<p>I don't think it's true for every show, but I think some would definitely benefit from a hard line.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Amy Sherman-Pallidino, I know it must have been exciting to learn that you <em>could</em> put a 15 minute bizarre musical number into the middle of an episode, but did you ever stop to consider whether or not you <em>should</em>?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got mad watching that part. It was like they had Lorelai act how out how bored and annoyed they knew they were making the audience. If you knew we would react that way, why in the world did you force us to sit through that? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was also one of the earliest Netflix-produced seasons. I think they would have done a better job had they done it a few years later, honestly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the editor's job to fix things like that. The flexibility on time gives them more tools to work with, but it's down to the skill of the editor as to whether those tools are used correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hi- editor of Arrested Development here to clear up that misconception. </p>
<p>final cutting authority (and final say on final total running time) typically lies with the executive producer of the show and/or the network. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that in this case part of the blame goes on the writing as well. Like yes, the editor has to cut everything down and if they don't do their jobs well, but if the writing doesn't permit the same level of of tightness there's only so much that can be done. In the first few seasons of AD, there's very little wasted dialogue - even the setups to new jokes are themselves jokes. In S4, there were a great deal of lines that are just pure setup, and it seems to me that the freedom granted by the Netflix format added to this, because even from the writing stage, they knew that they could go longer than 22 minutes.</p></div>		</li>
