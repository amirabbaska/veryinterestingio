			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI, mouthwash with delmopinol hydrochloride kills plaque causing bacteria, but saves the good bacteria. For some, it can taste kind of funky and numb your tongue for a bit. But, I've taken to using it (I've got Invisalign currently and you have to keep super clean) and I got used to it. It's great stuff. GUM Perioshield is avail in the US and what I use.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Then switch to a brand of toothpaste that doesn't contain SLS. It worked for me.</p>
<p>You only need to avoid SLS in oral products. SLS in externally applied products (nearly EVERY product that foams up) is safe. I've seen lots of other products claiming to be SLS-free like it's some kind of selling point but there are no known issues with SLS outside of your mouth.</p>
<p>One other advantage of dropping SLS from your toothpaste is that SLS has a side-effect of making things taste odd for about 20 minutes. Ever noticed that orange juice tastes awful after brushing your teeth?</p>
<p>That doesn't happen with SLS-free toothpaste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to piggyback off this comment to say that your saliva is actually very protective. It contains a lot of proteolytic and antimicrobial substances like IgA, lysozyme, and secretory peroxidase. These molecules prevent infection, and this is actually why you see many animals licking their wounds! Patients with decreased saliva due to drug interactions, radiation therapy, sjogren's disease, etc. have reduced salivary flow and increased risk of infections by candida, etc.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol. As someone who's lived in several different mosquito-infested areas, I can tell you from experience that even a gallon of my own saliva would do nothing to stop the itching, even from a couple isolated mosquito bites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoever told you this was having a joke on you.</p>
<p>Mosquito bites itch because your body is mounting an immune response to proteins in mosquito saliva (their saliva is used as an anticoagulant—it keeps your blood flowing and prevents clots while they drink). Your body uses inflammation as a way of drawing attention and blood flow to key areas, and a key chemical in this process is called histamine.  This response is what causes the itching sensation, and neither your saliva nor a very slight bit of air will have any effect.</p>
<p>That said, scratching will make it worse (more inflammation), so if a tradition like a drop of saliva helps you feel comforted in doing something other than scratching, it could be a good thing.  I could see telling children this and trying to convince them not to rub off the saliva as a way of discouraging them from scratching it.</p></div>		</li>
