			<div class="markdown"><p>My thought would be that electrical current would run through the pipes to other people’s houses. Someone taking a shower or washing their hands. I don’t know much about electrical stuff so maybe there’s something grounding the charge before it could reach another house?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Welding current goes from a hot lead to a ground lead, it has to go back to the welder and complete the circuit for it to work. You can get shocked if you get in the way of that, like grabbing the ground in one hand and the pipe in the other. I build big aluminum boats with a dozen people welding on them and you don't get shocked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My rule of thumb is; every 3 feet add a week of temperature averages. So at 3' deep, you take the weekly average and you are pretty close. At 6' you use two weeks. At 12' you use a month. Pretty simple system, after 12' the rule starts to break down a bit, but it's a decent system. If you are using it for engineering calcs, throw margin on it and go find the geologist paper I am basing this off of for when someone tries to call you out.</p></div>		</li>
