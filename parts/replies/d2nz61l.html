			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, they do blow veins... all the time. You just have to try again in a different vein, no big deal.</p>
<p>Edit: This got a lot of attention for an offhand comment...</p>
<p>So, to clarify... mistakes happen. I don't care if you're a nurse for 40 years and are used to starting IVs on dehydrated infants with bleeding disorders... mistakes will still happen sometimes. And, people have to learn sometime. There is no mannequin that can simulate an actual vein, there is no computer program that can make you perfect at surgery, there is no classroom that can make you perfect at assessing and diagnosing patients. At some point, you just gotta start practicing while experienced healthcare professionals supervise and guide you. Healthcare is not a perfect science and we work with limited resources including limited time in many cases.</p>
<p>Here's my advice to patients who don't like being stuck: ask for an ultrasound assisted catheter placement and pray that they actually have one available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is part of the reason I don't give blood at the university anymore. It's hard enough for me to give blood but this one student had to stick me 4 times in the left arm and twice in the right before actually getting it. My left arm looked very bruised and was sore for about 4-5 days. I know they need to learn but I shouldn't need to suffer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Donating blood one time I had a tech who mush have nicked the vein just enough to trigger that push-back, but with every heartbeat or arm flex (that ball they give you to squeeze) the needle would move and the blood flow drop to a trickle.  Spent about four times longer than normal and had to hold the needle in place with my other hand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also hurts like a motherfucker when they blow your vein. The poor oncology nurses blew 6 of mine once and had to get the pic line nurse to come with her machine to place my iv. All the appts after that she was waiting for me. It's kind of funny because I'm pale as fuck so you can see my veins all juicy looking but they're also very deep and hard to use. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah,  I have so called perfect drug veins too but only because,  like you,  I am pale AF. In reality,  they are tiny and   I barely have a pulse when I'm cold because I also have low blood pressure. Fun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does hurt! The area stays limp and bruised for days. </p>
<p>When I had my first c-section, they tried to give me my IV in the side of my wrist.  Tried right side, popped the vein.  Tried the left side, popped the vein.  Finally put it in my inner elbow.  </p>
<p>Second c-section - I told them they can't put it in my wrist.  Nurse just thought I had a bad tech all those years before.  Nope.  Blew my left vein and then my right and ended up in inner elbow. I was so mad!   </p>
<p>My third and final c-section (six years later) I absolutely refused to let her touch my wrists.  It went in my inner elbow and the nurse was very annoyed with me.  I don't even care!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It shouldn't hurt when a vein bursts. But there are a lot of nerves and shit (&lt;- official biological term...) in there, so if you miss you could hit one of those. Which can hurt.</p>
<p>Edit: Normally it is easier if you can clearly see the persons vain, but far from always. There are so many things that can make it harder. Dehydration, thicker walls, highly mobile veins etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally once you've done several hundred to a thousand or more you have tactile feedback. You can FEEL the needle pierce the vein and you then know if you advance, say 1 mm, you'll be able to easily advance the catheter of an IV. </p>
<p>When you're a student you can barely feel veins, wearing gloves feels like performing tasks with oven mitts on. As you get more experienced you notice things that are far more subtle. </p>
<p>At this point I could place an IV in complete darkness and be confident it would work. So little of the task is visual for me now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of flash. One is the blood in the catheter and the second is blood in the chamber located in the plastic part of the needle assembly that we hold. In regards to going out the back of the vein. A person can get good flash but then push the needle to far and go through a vein. The key is to insert the needle see the flash and advance the needle about another millimeter, you then advance the catheter only. If the catheter advances smoothly without issue you are more than likely still in the vein. You then retract the needle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people are also freaked out that they must keep their extremity COMPLETELY still because the &quot;needle might poke through the other side&quot;. The needle is removed after the IV has been inserted. What is left is a plastic sheet (also called a 'catheter') that remains until the IV is remove or the site has changed.</p>
<p>If you're not in the vein, you typically know it pretty quickly. It hurts when you push saline into it, it's VERY hard to push, and the area will swell / become cool from the solution pooling outside of the vessel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely true for hospitals - the &quot;needle stays in the patient&quot; hasn't been around for decades in the hospital setting. Previously they also reused needles from patient to patient after a quick cleaning. </p>
<p>Plasma and blood donations are a bit different because it's a relatively short amount of time that the needle stays in (~ or &lt; 1hr) vs a catheter a physician or nurse places for an infusion can remain in place upwards, 3 days, and sometimes more depending on the types of dressings/care that is taken with these lines.</p>
<p>I gave the aspect of hospital setting / outpatient IV infusion because OP stated &quot;nurse/doctor&quot;. In a plasma/blood donation aspect, you don't have to be a nurse/physician to obtain access... The staff at these locations can be phlebotomists, or just lay people with on-the-job training. </p>
<p>To note, I'm absolutely NOT demeaning their work - They are typically leaps and BOUNDS better at poking patients than I am as an ICU/Intermediate nurse of nearly a decade, I'm was just giving a more narrow scope because that's what I inferred via meaning from OP's post.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this dangerous to the patient?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends...</p>
<p>This situation is called extravasation.</p>
<p>If it's just normal IV fluids it's not dangerous if it's caught relatively quickly. The normal course of action in this situation is to remove the IV, start a new one in another extremity, and elevation of the extremity. The body reabsorbs the fluids, but does so via the lymphatic system, which is CONSIDERABLY slower at its job than the circulatory system. An alternative to another extremity (or if extravasation occurs in multiple locations), is placing another IV in a more proximal (closer to core) site from the place of extravasation.</p>
<p>If it's a medication, this may change. Some meds are fine, others cause tissue necrosis. Tissue necrosis is where your skin/muscles/other body structures literally die and fall off. This is typically caused by the medication having a concentration of salts so great that it kills the cells, or (more dangerous) the medication causes localized capillary/blood vessel constriction to the point where the cell dies from hypoxia (not enough oxygen). There are reversal agents that can be injected into the area, but effectiveness is limited by the time that the solution is able to sit outside of the vessel.</p>
<p>Typically the latter fluids are the ones that are more caustic to the blood vessels themselves, so the chance of extravasation is much higher with these fluids. Many hospitals implement policies that say if these medications are used, they need to be placed in a catheter that is in a great vessel (central venous catheter aka central line), or can be placed in an IV line temporarily until central access can be obtained. </p>
<p>These lines / catheters typically are inserted in the neck, upper chest near your clavicle, or upper arms and then the catheter threads until it rests just above your heart. The reason for this is these vessels are MUCH larger and the volume of blood that flows past the catheter termination is much higher. This dilutes the medication considerably faster, so it spares the vessels.</p>
<p>Some of the latter fluids:</p>
<ol>
<li>High concentration dextrose solution</li>
<li>Vancomycin (antibiotic)</li>
<li>Norepinephrine </li>
<li>Phenylephrine</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ol></div>		</li>
