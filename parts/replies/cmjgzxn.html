			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your input. I feel like a civilized justice system is not well capable of handling rape. A justice system must be established in such a way as to protect the rights of criminals, and those accused of being criminals. However when it comes to rape that means that the victim has to relive her attack in front of a room of people who are judging weather or not she wanted it or made it clear enough that she didn't. I can completely understand why many women (or men for that matter) would prefer to just let the whole thing lie. </p></div>		</li>
