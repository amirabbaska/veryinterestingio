			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if you think of gravity as the bending of spacetime it makes a lot more sense than that light somehow feels a gravitational acceleration. </p>
<p>The shortest path between two points on a sphere is a curved line ( like the routes airplanes fly are not straight). Light always follows the shortest path and in warped spacetime that will be a curved line. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a quick and dirty version:</p>
<p>One of the predictions of Einstein’s General Relativity is that light will be “bent” in a strong gravitational field. To test this, we’ll first need a strong gravitational field. Conveniently, we have an object in our solar system that can provide just that: The Sun.</p>
<p>We also know the celestial positions of stars in the sky from repeated astronomical observations. So all we have to do is wait until the Sun is in between us and those distant stars, then see if the light from those distant stars still reaches us via bending around the Sun. Easy? One problem: The Sun is too damn bright, and our lenses will just be overwhelmed by the Sun’s luminosity. </p>
<p>So how did Eddington do it? He blocked out the Sun with the Moon (total solar eclipse), so that you can now resolve the light coming from the distant stars. And he measured that the positions of the stars were indeed shifted, which meant that there was gravitational lensing taking place, which was a prediction of GR, which helped cement the theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you measure such a thing? You need a photo where the earth, star, and camera are in the same position, and another photo where the earth, star, and camera are the former with the addition of the moon and sun... How did we get all this 'perfect' to distinguish a faint difference in how a star appears?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a great movie on Netflix called <em>Einstein and Eddington</em> that goes in depth into his confirmation of Einstein's findings. It stars Andy Serkis as Einstein and David Tennant as Eddington. It's surprisingly good and entertaining as well as informing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An important nuance of this is that the light does not bend because the gravity-causing object is pulling that object to it the way baseballs are pulled to the ground by earth gravity.  Light has no mass.  The light is traveling straight through space, it's just that space is warped by gravity, like the straight lines on a bedsheet are still straight even when the sheet is rumpled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sadly I had to scroll down here to find the correct answer. To answer the original question: no the gravity does not affect the light, it affects the space through which the light passes.</p></div>		</li>
