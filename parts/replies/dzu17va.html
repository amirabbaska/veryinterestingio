<p>They really should've given more info tbh...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems pretty clear to me. At some places, like McDonald’s, I don’t have to type in my PIN to pay with my debit card. At Walmart, I do. OP is asking why that is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but we don't have this issue at all in the UK (and other countries) since all our cards have chips.
It certainly sounds like a similar problem we have though - if you use a contactless card it will occasionally ask you to enter your pin to check it's still you that's using it.
This is where the confusion comes from </p>
<p>It's reasonable to assume OP is in the US but they haven't actually said they are...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but since it varies a lot between different countries it would be very beneficial to announce what country OP is in. I've read through the answers in this thread and can tell you that it doesn't even remotely work like this in the country I'm from. (I've been working in different banks for ~7-8 years)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No the OP asked: How come some vendors require my debit card pin but others do not?</p>
<p>Someone in the UK could have asked that same question and my answer could have been a valid possibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its different in Australia too. You can use paypass (no pin) if it is less than $100. You can always use credit though but if over $100 you just need to enter your pin. </p></div>		</li>
