If you wanted to design for the small amount of negative particles you could point it parallel with the wall of the spacecraft then it would deflect the particles up or down.</p></div>		</li>

Launch.<br />
Build tanker ship, fill with borosiloxane liquid.<br />
Meet in space, pump borosiloxane to fill space between hull layers.<br />
Multilayer hull is resilient to accidental puncture from inside.<br />
As cosmic rays are absorbed by borosiloxane, it crosslinks to form a gel.<br />
Gel is self-healing, provides micrometeoroid protection.<br />
Set ship on an Earth-Mars loop. It is too heavy to land or re-launch, but it is now a slow but safe ferry between the two planets.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Since the two planets are constantly moving in relation to each other, is this really possible? How will it work when Earth and Mars are on opposite sides of the sun?</p></div>		</li>
