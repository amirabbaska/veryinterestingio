<p>Does that ever happen? Like after you're convicted of larceny is there a stipulation that you can never do that again? Isn't that just a given for any crime you commit?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the great responses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Larceny is a crime to start out, so it's not really a good example. Here's a better comparison: living near an elementary school isn't a crime, but registered sex offenders aren't allowed to do so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There can be. One of the founders of LifeLock (Robert Maynard, not the guy who kept posting his SS# daring people to try and steal his identity) had been busted for credit repair fraud in Arizona, and one of the conditions of his plea deal was that he would not work in the credit repair business in Arizona ever again--and they did investigate if LifeLock violated that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what /u/Limitedcomments meant was that there was no stipulation that he couldn't solicit donations again. A similar thing would be if a sex offender isn't allowed to live within however many miles of a school, or if a guy who threatened someone with a knife isn't allowed to own knives anymore. I don't know if that happens ever.</p></div>		</li>
