			<div class="markdown"><p>As per Wikipedia, carbon dioxide is the main component of Mars atmosphere, so an autotroph could get its carbon source easily. Metals in different oxidation states could provide the reducing power and light or other chemicals could provide the energy.</p>
<p>So in theory a chemolithoautotroph or a photolithoautotroph could grow on Mars. I don't know about how easily they could get other elements that are essential for life as we know it, though, like nitrogen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds neat, is that uncommon for other kinds of bacteria? Is it &quot;just&quot; the presence of multiple copies that makes them more tolerant to radiation? Do the multiple copies check each other out and if there are errors/discrepancies, they rid themselves of it? </p>
<p>Or is there some other mechanism such as really amazing telomeres? That was the only example I could think of that helps to protect DNA, I'm totally ignorant here...</p></div>		</li>
