<p>It amazes me how much the founding fathers are revered and how ignorant many are to what they had to say.</p>
<p>The American system, <em>from inception</em> was designed with the express purpose of avoiding a 'dictatorship of the majority'. If you give every citizen one vote in a classed system, the numerous base will almost immediately vote to take wealth from the minority upper classes. The structure of our economic system requires that people who have more command of production have more control over the rules dictating that production. The representative system allows people to vote for which capitalist or group of capitalists they want to decide how to run things. It doesn't give you an actual one in three hundred million say in anything and its naive to think it does. </p>
<p>At the very least the modern situation may have been made worse by <em>citizens united</em>, but its just a continuation of something that is a <em>normal and purposefully designed aspect of the American political system</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The big thing about our democracy I see a lot of people missing is that local government does not operate the same way as federal (or even state, for that matter). </p>
<p>You wouldn't want a local government bought by the upper class, because the kinds of things they do are very much relevant for the people/culture of their area. On the same token, higher levels of government work with problems/policy that is much harder to explain to the common man. If the average person isn't informed enough (and they aren't) to make good decisions about how the economy, Healthcare, military policy etc should operate, then they shouldn't have disproportionate power over the people who do understand those things</p>
<p>The problem with the current election system is more about preventing people from being convinced that complex policies are 2 dimensional. This tends to prevent politicians from making decisions based on careful, real analysis of the issue and pushes then to vote in favor of one side or the other depending on what their electoral base has been convinced is right/wrong. </p>
<p>If we had a more debate driven campaign system, and a different voting method (along with reducing the number of political advertisements) , I think we could get to a place where people are able to elect candidates that reflect their actual interests better. Lobbyists and big donors are a key factor in getting comprehensive, sensable policies passed, but if the campaign system is focused on tricking people into thinking that policies are good/bad for the wrong reasons then those 3rd party groups have an easier time manipulating outcomes for personal gain rather than improving the robustness and quality of their industry. </p></div>		</li>
