			<div class="markdown"><p>Railroad guy here with a bonus fact. I just want to add that the flanges on the wheels are not what keeps trains on the tracks. The wheels, as well as the top of the rail, are tapered. When the train drifts too far in one direction, the radius difference causes the wheel in the direction of the drift to spin faster because it's riding on the smaller diameter portion. This means the other side is spinning slower and thus pulling it back. It's a constant push/pull.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both, the comical shape also helps auto correct the train for any deviation on the track. If it for any reason slides to one side, the larger radius of that sides wheels &quot;turn&quot; the train back into center.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little tidbit for ya as I used to work on locomotives...</p>
<p>Every time an engine comes in for an inspection, be it a quarterly, semi-annual, etc, they get a wheel report done on them. A machinist/mechanic has a gauge they put against the wheel in different spots to determine tread thickness and flange thickness and shit like that. It also has to meet a profile.  When they wear out, the flanges will get thin or long usually. If they get too long, they can derail going through a switch because the high flange can hit the frog (portion of the switch where tracks cross) and actually pop the wheels off the track in certain circumstances. </p>
<p>If the wheels are too thin to repair, the engine goes to the truck shop (truck being the front or rear assembly of 2 or 3 traction motor and axle assemblies) and gets a wheel change.  But if they're repairable, they go to the wheel machine where they roll the wheel over a machine in the floor and a cutter head comes up and they just machine the wheel back to a standard profile. Also, if they get a full traction motor and wheel change on a full axle, they may have to cut others to match because there is only so much of a variance you can have across a truck or across a whole engine, which varies depending on engine service. (Yard or road)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's standardized by train system, but not internationally. A great example of incompatible train systems were the 2 ones in the US around the time of the civil war. Different track widths would require different max turning rates which require different wheel designs. </p></div>		</li>
