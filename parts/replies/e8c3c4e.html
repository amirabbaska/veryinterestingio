			<div class="markdown"><p>Even that some places are coming away from. I know a few depts that do hands only cpr for 5 minutes then put in an advanced airway. If you are a bystander just do hands only. The theory behind it is the CPR will create a negative pressure allowing air to be drawn in. </p></div>		</li>
