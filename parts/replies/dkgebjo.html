			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually got to speak to Sally Ride in elementary school, I asked her a similar question, but about how astronauts were able to eat and drink in space if gravity wouldn't be there to carry the food down their esophagus to their stomach. I'd probably be wondering the same thing to this day if I hadn't actually asked a person who had been to space. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for someone actually answering the question. Yeah it helps to know they can stop their periods,  but you finally came in and told us that periods work the same without gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, your question says &quot;deal with periods,&quot; not &quot;how does gravity affect menstral flow.&quot; So if that's the answer you were looking for, you should update the question. </p></div>		</li>
