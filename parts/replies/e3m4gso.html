<p>Pro VS Recreational player = Not as entertaining, but profitable.</p>
<p>Pro VS Pro = Far more entertaining (therefore TV, sponsorship etc), but less profitable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I like watching the main event. You always have rec players that make it all the way to the final table. They still have to play good poker, but luck is also a factor. A rec player that is playing his best poker with some luck will make it further than the best poker player in the world with no luck. At least in a single tournament. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That can be true, but it requires the rec players to be of a certain style, and it also means the quality of play is lower.</p>
<p>I like watching a good mix. And when you're into poker, players like Doug Polk can be fun to watch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not necessarily correct. The top post has it. Especially in the higher buy in tournaments ($30k+) the majority will be “pros”, but you have enough wealthy people who are not nearly as good to make it profitable. The pros will even buy stakes in each other to spread out the risk. </p>
<p>Maybe it’s different for “pros” who are grinding out lower buy ins..but at there is no avoiding other pros at the higher levels including those on tv. </p>

<p>Huge part of how professionals mitigate risk and are able to make a living off of poker (even if it does snub their huge jackpot windfalls).</p></div>		</li>
