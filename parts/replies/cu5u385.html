<p><strong>It was only after a chance discussion with a consumer</strong> did they discover the oil change had altered the temperature curve</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've often wondered about this. Sometimes I don't buy a particular brand, or I switch brands , because of a definite issue.  I always wonder whether the company actually notices or cares. Do they regularly do customer satisfaction surveys and ask people if the product has changed , or what?</p>
<p>One particular case that comes to mind. I'm in New Zealand. In the late 90's / early 2000s, Bluebird salt &amp; vinegar chips were absolute perfection. The best food in existence.  </p>
<p>But then one day they just... changed.  More greasy, slightly less crispy , but just overall unsatisfying. I guess they changed the oil or something.  For about a 6month period it was a lottery - sometimes you'd get a 'old' bag and sometimes a 'new' bag but eventually the number of 'old' bags were so rare that I just stopped buying them.</p>
<p>Now my preference is Eta Spuds which are actually getting better and better  , occasionally I get a bag that reminds me of the halcyon days of the Bluebirds, back when as a student my diet was often just coke , those chips, and pies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most labelled food products have a Questions or Comments?  phone number on them. It's usually somewhere at the bottom of the label on the back of the item. Complain, or if you <em>really</em> like something, call and let them know. So few people use the number for positive feedback it carries greater weight. Especially when they're trying out a new product. Either way, they do pay attention to those calls. They'll do a brief survey if you let them.</p>
<p>Often they'll send you several coupons that offer significant savings for their products. I always ask them to keep me off their mailing lists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember those. I used to look for the numbers on any box I could find and call them when I was really small because I'd just discovered the telephone and dialling numbers to talk to different people was the coolest thing ever.</p>
<p>I used to ask about random ingredients, and never once did they seem annoyed with having to deal with a five year old. Being all grown up now, I marvel at how they stayed so patient and professional.</p></div>		</li>

As a male with chest hair, and a beard...but also long hair, it's unfortunate that my favorite shampoo smells more and more girly every year. The last two times they changed the scent, I called them. They sent me coupons for the shampoo I said I didn't like anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They've recently changed the formula to Diet Pepsi to include Sucralose,  as opposed to aspartame.  Despite the fact that aspartame is one of the most researched food additives in history, and has been proven time and time again to be safe,  they caved to the anti-aspartame crowd.  I've been drinking it for years and it now tastes like shit to me. Weird mouth feel and aftertaste. Overnight I was turned off my favorite beverage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I switched to Coke Zero because i hate the taste of aspartame. I did not realize that Pepsi switched, I might try it again now. I also drink diet ice tea, and 4C's is the only brand I can find made with splenda. Sucralose tastes so much better to me personally, aspartame has that chemical aftertaste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't drink anything &quot;diet&quot; because the sweeteners taste like ass, leave an ass-flavored aftertaste, and usually leave me with a headache. I'm not otherwise especially prone to headache.</p>
<p>That said, I don't doubt the chemical sweeteners are biologically and chemically safe for the majority of people. I also think Pepsi is foolish to change such a popular drink. Why not just make a new drink altogether?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When this happened with a bag of Miss Vickies, it didn't taste as flavorful anymore, I sent in a &quot;complaint&quot; on their website. It was less of a complaint and more of a comment (I asked if they changed anything etc).</p>
<p>They didn't really comment on my question but they thanked me for my feedback and sent me a coupon for a free bag. That was nice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually probably the best answer (or at least the type of person to ask) in that Pepsi has been playing catch up to coke since day one. I'd much rather hear why it's so difficult to copy from someone that worked for a company trying to do just that, rather than from coke who might just say &quot;er proprietary blah blah blah&quot; without a more in depth explanation. </p>
<p>It's like learning to do a snowboard trick from a guy who stomps it every time (&quot;brah, just gotta rotate and flip then look for the ground. Easy&quot;) vs someone who almost has it and remembers every little thing that has made him about to succeed. For a random analogy, I guess.</p></div>		</li>
