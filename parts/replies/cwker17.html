			<div class="markdown"><p>This.  I have the same toy and just tested it.  In the picture below you can see the flow.  The tube is so short that the ping pong ball is resting inside of the spinning turbulent section.  This is a low pressure area that is pulling the ball back in.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Works with the paper as well.  Same concept, the flow from the orifice hasn't filled out the tube resulting in a low pressure &quot;ring&quot; around the edge of the tube.  This holds the paper to the tube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad to see someone recreated my experiment and had the same results. When I first posted, I had concerns people were going to think that I was actually sucking in, as opposed to blowing out like I was claiming and you're graph is well done. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>
