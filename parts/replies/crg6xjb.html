			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, tooth decay wasn't as much of a problem until the introduction of refined sugar. It's my understanding that fossil record shows this. I mean, it's not even a huge issue in out domesticated animals. They have the rare problem or infection but definitely not as big of a problem as it is in modern humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a vet tech, I wouldn't call animal tooth infections rare. We see at least ten patients a day with some form of tooth infection. Crap builds up around the teeth and can lead to infection and abscess. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't necessarily HAVE to be useful.  If it's a trait that exists, but doesn't prevent the sharing of genetic information, it's not going to be phased out.  Bad teeth and tooth pain aren't going to stop most people from having kids, and many people had kids at much younger ages in the past.</p>
<p>Evolution isn't always useful.  Species preserve the traits that help them pass on their genes, and they typically only lose traits, however negative, that prevent this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the flip side, costly traits are more likely to be conserved if they have a positive effect on survival &amp; reproduction. For example, tooth sensitivity seems very useful for instantly stopping us from crunching down on anything hard enough to crack our teeth. This helps preserve our ability to eat and chew food nutritively. Sensitivity to infection pain might be a side effect. However, it seems is likely it can be useful in its own right if it means remedial action is taken (salt packing, tooth extraction, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cavities is just one thing that can go wrong with your teeth. Sometimes it's something as simple as a small grain of something hard in the stuff you're chewing that it might not be that smart to repeatedly mash between your teeth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People are thinking too narrow.  It's not just cavities and infections.  It's literally anything that can cause damage.  Hot shit, cold shit, sharp shit, overly acidic/alkaline shit, annoying shit stuck in your teeth than cause infection.  Having bullshit like that going on in your mouth can directly impairs your reproductive fitness.  If your mouth gets fucked up and you can't eat/breath properly, you die.  Don't think of this in terms of modern humans.  Think more like the early mammals.</p>
<p>Putting bad shit in your mouth or doing bad shit to it hurts.  Pain keeps you from doing it more.  This improves your reproductive fitness.  It's the reason we feel pain in most of our body parts.  To prevent us from causing damage.</p></div>		</li>
