			<div class="markdown"><p>To compliment this great explanation. It may seem like having a bus stop #10 is a necessary condition to make this all work and the question would be, why would we ever allow stops #10?
The thing is, each of these stops could be any computer. Some are special services like proxy, VPN or TOR in which discarding tickets is sort of their job. We could pass a law for all such services to keep the tickets, sure. But then anywhere in that path, you can have a custom bus stop, which doesn't comply with this law. That custom bus stop would be just some random computer where hacker was able to install his own program that receives packets and re-routes them.
Even if you are able to trace the attack to such computer, there is no history of where it came from. And requiring all computers to keep records of all packets is not feasible.</p></div>		</li>
