			<div class="markdown"><p>The neurons that normally turn REM on (conveniently called REM-ON neurons) are inhibited by neurons that secrete serotonin. LSD decreases the activity of these and thus allows REM-ON neurons to be un-inhibited, making us have a waking period of dreaming. Sorry, don't have source I'm just going off my notes from lectures.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>We found that under LSD, as compared to placebo, disparate regions in the brain communicate with each other when they donâ€™t normally do so. In particular, the visual cortex increases its communication with other areas of the brain, which helps to explain the vivid and complex hallucinations experienced under LSD, and the emotional flavour they can take.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this in line with what you were taught in your lectures? This is the first I've heard of LSD hallucinations being caused by the brain thinking it's in REM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for replying. Seems like a plausible explanation it's just also the first time I've ever heard anything regarding this particular one. I am aware that since lack of 5HT is vital to REM sleep that LSD's inhibitory effect on 5HT might resemble a REM type state, but could it really be called tricking the brain into REM sleep, since the brain is still in it's wakeful state? There are also far more pharmacodynamic mechanisms at play when it comes to hallucinatory perception on psychedelics that are currently understood so it just seems like a vast over-simplification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the assumption that the brain just gave lsd a priority to seratonin receptors. And that once it was active it would enable parts of the brain to talk to each other that normally wouldn't causing the hallucinations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you cut off all access to natural light and other indicators of time (like clocks) and instead turn on lights in a 40 hour cycle you would be able to disrupt your circadian rhythm and make your day longer. One scientist did lock himself away for a month or so and had a one way radio which he conveyed information to his research team with. He lost many days because his day became longer than 24 hours. </p></div>		</li>
