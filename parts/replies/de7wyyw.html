			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like bullshit and if even true almost certainly a coincidence rather than anything else. I'd love to see a source if I am wrong.</p>
<p>edit: I took a look at the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Genesis-Truths-Chinese-Language/dp/0570037921" target="_blank">book</a> that he references - it is absolutely bullshit, not academically rigorous in anyway and borderline Christian religious propaganda.  Totally full of shit and not supported anywhere else from what I can tell.  This dude needs to stop spreading religious propaganda as if it is actual science or well researched historical theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay - this is not academically rigorous study or anything that should be taken seriously at all.  Looking at your post history you believe in creationism which I think you should be upfront about when you start spouting facts about linguistics and religion.  I respect your right to belief, but please don't present it as historical fact without qualifying it with what it actually is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bet to disagree, 帝 doesn't really mean god unless you add Shang in front (上帝).</p>
<p>&quot;帝，周朝以前 (3000 years ago)，天子或最高君主的称呼，例“帝辛”，自“王”称号出现之后，便与王字混合使用。&quot;</p>
<p>And is it ever pronounced &quot;Ti&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wonder if related languages have it. Or if Hawaiian used to have it, but lost it. Probably no way to know.</p></div>		</li>
