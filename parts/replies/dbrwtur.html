			<div class="markdown"><p>Some stars' radii have been determined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stars_with_resolved_images" target="_blank">direct observation</a>, but with others, you need to know the temperature, luminosity, and distance. Temperature can be determined through spectral analysis, and if you have a distance estimate, you can use the observed brightness to calculate the luminosity. Since luminosity is a product of surface area and temperature, you can use the information you have to solve for radius.</p>
<p>There are other, more precise, methods, but you can use this equation for the luminosity of a black-body, which is a decent approximation for a star:</p>
<p>L = 4πR^2 σT^4</p>
<p>where L is luminosity, R is radius, σ is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_constant" target="_blank">Stefan-Boltzmann constant</a>, and T is temperature. (This is just surface area, which is 4πR^2 for a sphere, multiplied by luminosity per square metre.)</p>
<p>You can then rearrange that to get the squared radius:</p>
<p>R^2 = L/(4π σ T^4 )</p>
<p>And just take the square root of that to solve for radius. The value I calculated for the Sun (695,887.5 km) from that equation is a bit larger than the IAU's definition of the solar radius (695,700 km), but it's only about a 0.03% difference, which is a good fit if you just want a general idea of the star's size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would unusual sun spot activity or other events have an effect on the average luminosity of a star over the measurement periods? </p>
<p>And how do they determine the mass of nebulae and other less coalesced clouds of space stuff?(gotta be a better phrase) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best astronomical interferometers can get to resolutions of about a milliarcsecond. That's like reading the date off a coin at 100 miles. Resolutions like that allow for direct measurements of nearby or extremely large stars, like Betelgeuse.</p>
<p>Astronomers also use occultations, where a nearby body (the moon, another planet) passes in front of a star. Using sensitive photometers, you can measure the amount of time it takes for the star's light to be completely blocked and calculate the star's apparent diameter using parameters of the moon's motion. From there, if you know the distance (more tricks involved there), you can find the actual diameter with trig.</p>
<p>Further, many of the theoretical models of stellar dynamics can also allow rough diameters to be calculated and these models have been calibrated to stars with directly measured diameters, allowing for somewhat decent estimates of stars too distant for direct measurement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For stars we can use their luminosity and spectrum. </p>
<p>If it's red, but really bright, we know it has to be big. If it were dense and burning that bright, it would also be burning hotter, and therefore bluer. </p>
<p>Of course, there's actually a whole slew of techniques to estimate what the real spectrum is and real luminosity is, since it can be changed by doppler shifting, by red-shifting caused by the expanding of the universe, by extinction (being obscured by dust clouds), etc.</p>
<p>That can be by looking at absorption lines in the spectrum, since we know that certain types of absorption lines should be specific distances apart, that can be by looking at neighbouring stars to get an idea of the age of the star which would tell us it's possible positions on a luminosity vs. spectrum chart, (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram" target="_blank">A HR diagram</a>), if they rotate, we might be able to see the doppler shifting from the half of the star heading towards us and the half heading away, and the period of rotation can tell us things about the star. </p>
<p>In the end, it all comes back to different ways to find the brightness and colour. </p></div>		</li>
