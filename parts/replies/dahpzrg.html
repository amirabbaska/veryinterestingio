			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. So is this then caused by a specific chemical response in the brain from overuse/lack of sleep that would not normally occur, possibly as a way for the brain to keep itself active until it's next resting period?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep deprivation is more about systems breaking down or becoming disorganized. Under normal circumstances, the brain is pretty freaking good at coordinating the different parts involved in thinking and feeling to process information and come up with an appropriate emotional response. That's why you feel sad when something bad happens or happy when something good happens. When you sleep, it's theorized that any breakdown in those communications are reset, so you're back at full capacity when you wake up. When you don't sleep, those connections start to come apart and your emotions go a bit haywire. This is just one explanation--sleep still isn't very well understood--but it's likely that multiple systems and processes are involved. Lack of sleep can have pretty devastating effects all over the body.</p>
<p>Your brain just wants to follow its circadian rhythm and it doesn't like change. If you force yourself to stay awake, you can start to have microsleeps, where your body is more or less awake but the brain &quot;sleeps&quot; for a few seconds to a couple of minutes. You might not notice them in yourself, but they can really screw up the way you deal with problems. It's thought that the Chernobyl disaster was caused when a staff member experienced microsleep and reacted poorly, so maybe don't start operating a nuclear power plant until you get some sleep!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Haha. I believe I have heard that theory before though, now that you mention it. Very interesting stuff, especially the fact the whole process is still somewhat open to interpretation. Kinda makes me wanna break out my old cognitive psych books. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was recently diagnosed with hypersomnia/borderline narcoleptic.  Basically I feel super sleep-deprived and have to function like this on a daily basis. I can sleep anywhere from 8 to 15 hours and I wake up feeling like I've only slept 2, no matter what. I have extreme difficulty thinking, remembering, concentrating. Sometimes while talking, I literally stop in the middle of my sentence and can't remember what I was talking about.  Sometimes while driving I get lost and forget where I'm going. Or I get somewhere and literally can't remember anything in between that, like a blackout. Sometimes I feel like I'm inside of a dream.... like I can't figure out if it's real life or a dream.  My brain just does not feel the same anymore. </p>
<p>Started Adderall but haven't noticed much of a difference.  Even took 2 pills  yesterday and I still fell asleep 1.5 hrs after taking it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question somewhat related. When laying in bed falling asleep, I'll go through a trance where I'm not asleep, but I'm definitely not awake either. Like, my eyes are open and I'm thinking, not sleeping, but my thoughts start to turn more and more into a dream. If someone were to walk by or a light were to turn on, I'd consciously aware of that situation and come out of the trance. If someone said my name, I'd say, &quot;Yeah?&quot; As if I weren't asleep.</p>
<p>What is this stage of falling asleep? Is it awake or asleep? Is it some weird trance like middle ground? Does everyone experience it or just me? Because sometimes in this trance I'll respond to texts or carry a conversation, but have no recollection the next day, and often the texts are fully constructed sentences that don't make sense. And family members will say at about that point I stop making sense. Am I sleep walking or does everyone do this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to give another example, how it changed me, if I may. When I was in the militairy, we had sleep deprivation trainings where we were taught to (somewhat) function during times of ongoing, fullscale war, with a minimum of sleep. If I am correct, I had a total of 8 hours of sleep during a period of 5 days. In the beginning people just became agitated easier, but later on there were full scale hallucinations. Me not excluded, as on day 4 I saw a leprechaun in full militairy gear including NBC (Nuclear, Biological and Chemical) mask sit in my manhole during a shift change. After I ran at it Rambo style, to try and tackle it from behind, it just vanished. Like poof. It was then, when it hit me I was hallucinating. During the whole week, I did not really change my behaviour except for being more irratable though, and maybe my thoughtspan was shortenend, as I did not feel like contributing to solutions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an anesthesiologist and I, like many of my other colleagues such as surgeons, are on call 24 hours. I take call for trauma and have done calls where I am up the entire 24 hours without even a nap. While I totally believe that being sleep deprived can be as bad as alcohol impairment especially when doing something monotonous like driving, I feel like during surgery there's some adrenaline and I don't feel impaired at all. But once the patient is stable and the surgery draws out I do feel some sleep deprivation kicking in. It sucks but this is how doctors in the operating room have done things forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say it's even more than that. I've gone five days without sleep. I wasn't &quot;drunk&quot;. I was borderline psychotic.</p>
<p>I heard voices... <em>felt</em> things... I felt utterly disconnected from reality and my body. It didn't feel real. If I did something... it wasn't real. None of it was real.</p>
<p>I wound up  collapsing in a heap begging for medicine to knock me out. I've never begged for anything in public before. I begged the people at the health center then. Just give me something. Anything... .</p>
<p>There's a reason they use sleep deprivation as torture. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whooping cough. It was riiiight before it became a huge deal so my slew of vaccinations before moving into the dorms didn't cover it.</p>
<p>Whooping cough is no joke. Coughing fits so violent they quite literally threw me to the floor. </p>
<p>I got used to taking little tiny kitten breaths because stretching my lungs out fully would trigger a coughing fit. Of course, when you start to fall asleep, you begin to breathe deeply.... Aaand a coughing fit would tear me awake. </p></div>		</li>
