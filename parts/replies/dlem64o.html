			<div class="markdown"><p>After reading all the comments here I agree. I have the equipment to photograph it but I think the experience is way more worth it. I might try to do a wide angle time-lapse which might come out cool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Timelapse are the best for these kinds of things. I did one during the bloodmoon a couple years back, just compose the shot, set it and forget it. You can grab your pictures and still enjoy every moment with your own eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We should definitely put up a photo/video dump thread to help collect the best captures of the eclipse. I'm not taking more than one picture myself, and my biggest worry is that it will take forever to find the best images others have taken. Such young content can be difficult to find via Google searches. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why we have setup a set of scripts to run the cameras from a computer (yes, we're geeks). The computer will set the exposure based on pre-calculated values and take them at the appropriate times. That will free us up to actually experience the event. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My school atmospheric flight team is launching cameras on weather balloons on the 21 directly in the path. As well as some other extremely important particleâ€‹ sensors and ozone equipment, you bet your ass we have been stressing about cameras and camera stabilization on weather balloons. I know this has nothing to do with what you posted, I just wanted a place to share this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really cool. I'm sure y'all are gonna have amazing shots. May I inquire what y'all are looking for exactly with the particle sensors? I'm just really curious about stuff like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm taking two of my kids up to see it and my plan is to just set the camera on a tripod pointing at us and our viewing area. That way we can enjoy it, and record our reactions and the environment around us. There will be tons of photos of the sun available, but this way we can view it ourselves while recording something unique to help us remember it. </p></div>		</li>
