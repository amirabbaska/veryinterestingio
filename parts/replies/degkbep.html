			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are asking about a Hydrogen bomb.</p>
<p>That uses &quot;fusion&quot; to release huge amounts of energy. This is also the process going on in stars. You basically take Hydrogen atoms and fuse them together to form Helium atoms.</p>
<p>Both fusion and fission bombs are called Nuclear bombs. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A small note to add: fusion bombs utilize a fission bomb as their core. The fusion part just increases the yield. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Because the explosion is caused by intentionally manipulating the nucleus of atoms, either splitting the atoms or fusing them. You literally change one element into another.</p>
<p>This is different from a &quot;chemical&quot; explosion like dynamite where all the elements are still the same, but they just kinda react with each other like when you put mentos in coke. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Noob at chem. Why would fusing atoms release energy? I thought only breaking them apart did. And it took energy to fuse? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no difference. They're the same thing, just called differently. Like Pineapple and Ananas</p></div>		</li>

<p>The neutrons are fired from a small cell within the bomb, via electricity (or magnetism)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually they are usually a combination of beryllium-9 and polonium-210 which are crushed together via shockwave to produce the neutron burst to start the fission reaction. Another alternative is gas boosting with tritium or deuterium gas which is induced to fuse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is embarrassingly inaccurate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A neutron is fired into a cluster of unstable radioactive particles. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, I guess. Worth noting that only a few types of atoms will work for this. Not just any &quot;unstable radioactive particles.&quot; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>HOWEVER it must go at a certain speed; too slow and the bomb won't explode, tok fast and the particle will go right through it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What? Shooting neutrons at the right speed is not the issue. You are confusing bombs with reactors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The amount of energy released will split the rest of the particles in the reaction, causing the huge energy released. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No! Wrong! Agh! If a fissile atom is split, it will release neutrons (along with energy). These neutrons can split other atoms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The neutrons are fired from a small cell within the bomb, via electricity (or magnetism)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WTF. No. This is so confused.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is what prevented Germany from figuring out how to make the bomb and the US being successful; Germans fired the neutron as fast as they could while the US figured out it has to go at a certain speed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is completely incorrect.</p></div>		</li>
