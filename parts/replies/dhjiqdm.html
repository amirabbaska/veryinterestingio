			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on a liquid diet once when I had a broken jaw. Even though I was getting all the calories I needed I still always felt hungry. My aunt, who is a nurse, said it is because chewing food sends signals to your brain or something like that. Another time, I was on IV for 3 weeks and couldn't eat food. I have less of a memory of that but man you really start to notice how much food is in commercials when you can't eat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe that's why I don't eat very much. I eat very slowly and I take a long time to chew my food. Does my brain trick me into thinking I've eaten a lot when I really have just been gnawing on the same piece of steak for five minutes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a study claims we will <em>never</em> do something, I already read it as &quot;not in the next 20 years&quot;. There is no fundamental barrier that would stop us from putting fibers and whatever else is needed in supplements (which stop being supplements if they supply everything).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Calories. That is the fundamental barrier. Calories are based off of mass of the associated macros: 1g fat = 9 calories, 1g carbs/protein is 4 calories each. In order to have the correct amount of calories in a day, it would also need the associated mass from the macros we require. If only using fat, that it 222g (for 2000 calories), which is about 237ml of some oil like olive oil. Of course we need protein so the balance would shift, but 237 ml is almost 16 tablespoons. So this would be a very large pill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP indicated already that it can be large. Oil is something you can drink (at least in principle), same with some carbohydrates that can be dissolved in water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course. It's not like every statement is rock-solid.</p>
<p>However, I can understand that. Eating supplements when you're craving for food and just want to binge on some pizzas and/or ice-cream would be more underwhelming than most others</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is alot of stuff in food that we don't know about, and we don't understand it's function. Best bet is to try and replicate the ancestral diet as best as possible. Science is always an inadequate and partial explanation when it comes to biology.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Shall we replicate ancient medicine as well? Or do you think we understand some things better than stone age people did?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Eating not only satisfies your palate, but also gives you a sense of emotional satisfaction and fulfills your desire to eat.</p>

<p>I don't understand. If your blood sugar and hunger hormones are satisfied, you won't feel hunger anymore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humans are primordially just social animals; and secluding their meals and limiting the time spent cherishing, admiring, or appreciating &quot;good food&quot; can actually seriously undermine your mental health.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How much of that time eating with someone else is significant? There's plenty of other shit to do and more enjoyable ones that are social activities as well. You can very easily replace the social aspect of eating with others with something else. I enjoy any activity more than eating. Even if it's the most delicious food, how long that satisfaction lasts? As soon as you're full you will not be appealed looking at the plate</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most people do, buddy. It's not just about filling yourself physically. Just spend 10 days surviving on just breads or fruits, that much would be enough to make most people crave for a &quot;good meal.&quot;</p>

<p>That is very different for each individual and generalizing it would be inefficient.</p>

<p>It's not just about you, is it? :I</p>
