			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. They also have the ability to transfer heat from the blood in the veins going to/from their feet, so the warmth cannot be lost through the feet as it never makes it there in the first place. </p>
<p>And they also take it in turns to be on the inside and the outside when they all huddle up during extremely cold weather. </p>
<p>Really well designed animals!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A variety of factors are involved.
If you've ever felt a penguin's foot, especially from a cold climate, you'll feel <em>very</em> thick skin. Their feet are primarily skin, bone and tendons which makes dealing with the cold easier for them - think of the parts of your face that hurt the most during freezing weather: it's always the fleshy parts like the cheeks and lips rather than parts like the ears, which don't have much actual flesh hanging around, just skin and cartilage and some thin blood vessels.</p>
<p>Some of the warmth from the heat exchange I mentioned before does actually go to the feet, maintaining a safe temperature. It's a very small amount but the blood always enters the foot warmer than it exits, so the feet will never have an opportunity to actually freeze. Imagine filling an ice cube tray, putting it in the freezer and then every few seconds replacing the water with slightly warmer water and giving it a mix... it would just stay as cold water. </p>
<p>Also, the dual-layer of feathers and thick blubber extend all the way down to the bottom of the legs for some cold-climate species, classically the Emperor. The important muscles allowing movement of the feet and legs are actually located higher up than other animals, meaning these muscles are protected by even more blubber and feathers as they're closer to the warm core of the body. Penguins probably never experience that 'oh shit it's -20 and my legs hurt so bad' feeling that we humans get because they have their muscles kept in what is basically ski pants all the time.</p>
<p>Finally, during the extreme cold of Antarica, Penguins are almost always moving their feet about. When they huddle up in large groups they spend a lot of time shuffling around between the centre and the outer layer - when they're on the outer layer they tend to rest on their heels and their tails (protected by feathers and blubber) which allows their toes (the most sensitive part) to have a break from the ice. I'm pretty sure Emperors can actually tuck their toes into their feathery/blubbery parts whilst doing this too. </p>
<p>So yeah, that's basically how they stop frostbite. May be a few bits I've missed but I'm super tired. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also add that the temperature on the inside is likely to be quite a bit higher than on the outside, so it's not really -70.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why it's a shame there's no giant penguins.</p>
<p>Inuits could live inside them like Luke Skywalker inside a tauntaun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So realistically the outside is that temperature but the actual penguin is no where near that temperature? </p></div>		</li>

<p>So back to his original question,&quot;He could keep some penguins livin in his freezer if he left food in there and cleaned up right?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for that explanation.  I recently spent a winter in a cold climate for the first time, and I found out the hard way that an extra layer only buys you a few extra minutes of warmth.  It also doesn't help being skinny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd be surprised what a fur lined coat will do to keep you warm. I'm not one to wear fur all willy nilly but when you live in extreme temperatures it seems it can't be beat. I used to have a   big leather coat which was lined with thick fur( can't remember what kind) and I could go outside in the coldest of temperatures and not feel a damn thing. I walked home 40 minutes in a snowstorm once wearing snow pants ,boots,belaclava,hat etc etc and the only part of me that didn't feel cold after awhile was the part covered by the fur. Someone stole it years ago ,I miss it. </p></div>		</li>
