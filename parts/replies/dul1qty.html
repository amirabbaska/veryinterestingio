<p>I do check, usually once every few weeks, but not religiously. I’m very worried I’ll find something as it does run in the family on both sides. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My doc told me to get a real good feel after I had just had a breast exam, so I would know what “normal” feels like. Then once a month right before my period to do my self exam so that I’m constantly feeling for any changes. You get pretty used to what your own breast feels like, and then you can catch stuff early!</p>
<p>Edit: a couple of people mentioned it should be after my period - you might be right. Regardless, do it at the same time each month so you know and can feel for changes!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breast exams should be performed AFTER your cycle has ended because this is when breast tissue returns to “normal”.  Hormonal changes cause  breasts to swell just prior to and during your period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right before the period? Never heard it be that specific before but it makes a lot of sense. I play with/mash/poke/grab my boobs all the time anyway though so I don't necessarily plan a check at a specific time each month. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many women have cystic or dense tissue breasts. I happen to be one of them. It’s a whole different experience for us to check our breasts. Looking for changes is a great suggestion, but also check in with your health care specialist and ask about checking cystic breasts if you find you have them. There’s ways to determine whether it’s a cyst or a nefarious lump. (For example, cysts move while lumps tend to be stationary, cysts tend to be softer, etc.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My doctor started me on annual mamograms and breast ultrasounds when I was relatively young (around 38) due to this problem.  I have no family history of breast cancer, but it was increasingly difficult to tell what were the anomolies.  Sure gives me peace of mind.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. My doctor makes me get them once a year, then the mammogram doctor sees an anomaly, wants to do an ultrasound, then recheck in 6 months with another ultrasound. It was costing me an extra $700 a year, not to mention the time it took. I haven’t gone for a couple years because of this. I asked my sister, who’s a medical pro, and she said ask for a doctor who’s an expert in dense breast tissue next time I go. I’m going to a new clinic next week. As always, though, better to be safe than sorry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for posting this! Gosh I feel like I've learned so much from this thread. I've never had a good doctor to explain to me what I'm supposed to look for. They just always say &quot;well you have lumpy breasts, so it's normal you'll feel a lump&quot;. But breast cancer runs in my family and I want a real answer on how I know what's a normal for me lump and a lump I should be concerned about. Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking top comment:</p>
<p>You want to be looking for other things which could go alongside the lump:</p>
<p>A lump plus skin changes should prompt getting checked. Puckering of skin, dimpling that looks a bit like orange peel, redness of inflammation of skin, inversion of the nipple (if it hasnt always been inverted). These should all make you take notice.</p>
<p>How a lump behaves is important too. Is it getting bigger? Does it swell and shrink according to your menstrual cycle (if so this could be a normal lump), can you move the lump freely under the skin (possibly a good sign) or does it feel tethered to underlying structures (possibly a bad sign).</p>
<p>Is there any discharge (blood, chalky material)? If so get it checked. </p>
<p>The long and short is that there are so many possible changes and factors that anything which doesnt feel normal TO YOU should be checked for reassurance. Learn what is normal for your breasts by checking them at regular intervals. If you kniw your breasts when they're normal you'll know when they're telling you they're not.</p>
<p>EDIT: As the mods are worrying about non-medical professionals giving advice I will highlight that I have not yet qualified, but am in the latter years of medical school and Have completed a breast rotation. As I always say, my advice is one thing, but always see a doctor if you're worried.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is meant by inversion of the nipple? Like how a pregnant woman’s navel may go from being an innie to an outie for the duration of the pregnancy? Only in reverse, I suppose...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Google inverted nipple. It can be perfectly normal, but if a nipple starts to invert when it never has done so before, that's worth taking seriously and alerting your doctor. This was one of the signs when my wife had cancer. After the lumpectomy, the inversion ended.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the breast can expand outward if something is growing beneath the skin. However, certain parts of the skin are tethered to other structures deeper, including the nipple. So this causes the inversion of the nipple and dimpling effect described above. It’s called Peau-d’orange. </p></div>		</li>
