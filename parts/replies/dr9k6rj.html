			<div class="markdown"><p>No, a regular rock would float around quite happily! It's just that you can't make something like sandstone in the conditions you'd have in the asteroid belt. Once the sandstone is made, it won't disintegrate when you bring it to space. (Though it seems possible that the surface of some rocks might have some chemical reactions happen upon being exposed to the radiation from the Sun and cosmic rays that are blocked by our atmosphere, I don't really know - that's a question for someone with this specialty)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that some do contain fairly high concentrations of precious metals, particularly platinum group metals. Which is why people are looking at asteroid mining despite the outrageously high cost. Some asteroids are estimated in the trillions of dollars of platinum and palladium. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's because those are &quot;siderophile&quot; elements. They dissolve in iron and end up in the core. </p>
<p>So while the earth is technically just as rich in them as the asteroids are, most of them ended up in the core where it's kinda hard to get to them. Asteroids don't have a molten iron core, so their siderophile elements are still available on the surface. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012Sci...336..684R" target="_blank">Large asteroids such as Vesta are thought to have a metallic core</a>, and although not molten now, they certainly were early in their history.</p>
<p>Also, to be clear here, <em>some</em> asteroids are very rich in metals because they're thought to be the remnants of the core of a failed proto-planet.</p>
<p>During Solar System formation, something in the Main Asteroid Belt got large enough to start the differentiation process. The interior grew warm enough from short half-life radioactive elements (e.g. aluminum-26) to begin melting and separating elements by density, and a metallic core <em>did</em> form. </p>
<p>This object then broke apart - possibly from collisions, possibly from proto-Jupiter's tidal forces - and the remnants scattered. What was formerly the core ended up as almost pure metallic asteroids, the largest of which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_Psyche" target="_blank">16 Psyche</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if you brought it all back at once. Realistically, individual missions would only be able to extract and return billions or tens of billions of dollars of metals at a time. But if this sort of thing became common it would, of course, drive down prices of those metals. But many of them have broad industrial uses, which would open up as prices fell, helping to avoid a total collapse of demand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my biggest problems with Expanse comes with how they handle asteroid mining and the scarcity of water and oxygen in the show. Why in all that time has no one sent any maned or unmaned ships to the kuiper belt. And their must be a lot less water in their universe to be having so many problems with it on their stations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly a question of fictional economics. The solar system as a whole still has plenty of resources, but not a lot in the inner solar system that haven't been bought up by Earth or Mars.</p>
<p>The Epstein drive is good. It's about as good as any nonfictional fusion rocket can ever hope to be. However, delta v budgets still exist and even fusion has some limits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't known. The one thing that is generally accepted is that it had levels of Iridium far beyond what is normal on Earth, as evidenced by layers of Iridium found in rocks that appeared there very close to 66 MYA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>my understanding is that higher iridium content is normal for all asteroids, not specifically the dinosaur-killer. the earth technically has the same amount of irridium, but it's believed most of it ended up in the core (it'll bond to iron easily), so the earth's crust is low on iridium compared to most rock in the solar system. </p>
<p>My point is that the dinosaur-killer probably wasn't rich in iridium, it just had the normal amount of iridium, compared to earth's iridium-poor crust. </p></div>		</li>
