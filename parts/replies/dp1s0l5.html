			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good answer and suited for the question. It is worth adding though, that with the use of electric current (electrolysis), Cl- can be converted to both Cl2 (using DC) and ClO- (using alternating current AC) which are processes relevant to water treatment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Free chlorine in water is not so dangerous, as the levels required are generally very low to achieve the desired disinfectant effect, as it is so reactive.</p>
<p>Generally required in cooling towers to prevent the growth of bacteria, specifically those that will cause legionnaires disease.</p></div>		</li>
