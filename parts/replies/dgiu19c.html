			<div class="markdown"><p>What was tripping me up is exactly <em>how</em> organisms break down N≡N. u/uberhobo explained it well. I never knew about nitrogenase or antibonding orbitals. Now, if I understood him properly, it seems that throwing electrons at N2 can destabilize the N≡N bond, breaking the N2 apart and rendering it susceptible to bonding with hydrogen....? ^(I tried.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty much it. This comes from molecular orbital theory if you wanna look more into it. The basics of it aren't too complex, and you won't need to dig too deep into it to really understand his answer. Calculating what is going on is pretty simple. There's a property called bond order, which in essence is the strength of the bond. It's just half the difference between electrons in bonding and anti-bonding orbitals. Stable N2 already has 8 bonding and 2 anti-bonding electrons, so (8-2)/2=3. When you add 6 electrons, you begin filling the next orbitals with pairs of electrons. Since the next 3 orbitals are anti-bonding, that gives you 8 anti-bonding electrons total. (8-8)/2=0 so the bond becomes too unstable to exist, freeing the Nitrogen. What is actually happening physically to make the bond unstable is pretty neat, and you seem interested in reading up on it, so I'm gonna let you look into it more on your own.</p></div>		</li>
