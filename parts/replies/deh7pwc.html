			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't exactly wrong, but it's a bit of a misunderstanding of the origin of the dollar in North America.  It was popular <em>before</em> the United States!  That's why the US adopted it.  The Spanish dollar (the British term for the Spanish-American peso, i.e.: piece-of-eight) was in widespread use in the Americas well before the War of Independence simply due to its prevalence and the widespread use of Spanish silver (minted in several locations throughout the Spanish Empire) in the British (and French) colonies.</p>
<p>So the reason that the dollar became prevalent in North America is simply because it was a safe and readily accessible international standard in a time when Spain was still one of the dominant powers.  Before the Spanish dollar the Dutch daler was also widely used in New Netherland/New York.</p>
<p>The dollar was well established at least 100 years before the Declaration of Independence and was widely used in both colonial and international trade in a manner quite similar to the way that the US dollar is today.  When I was looking up a couple of dates for this post I read that the Spanish dollar was even legal tender in Virginia at one point.</p>
<p>So you do see pounds/shillings/pence in many former British colonies and countries influenced by the UK, but these tend to be places that were colonized during the period when the British Empire was at its height and Sterling was the strongest international currency.  In places like the Americas which were colonized much earlier the Spanish currency was still very common and thus circulated beside other currencies in day-to-day commercial transactions for centuries prior to independence and slowly went away as Spanish wealth and influence eroded over time.</p>
<p>In the case of Canada we were largely self-governing well before Confederation and we consciously chose to have a decimal currency modelled on the US dollar, replacing the Canadian pound in 1858 (8 years before Confederation) and the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick pounds in 1860, in order to simplify trade with the United States.  Early on different provinces had their own dollars which traded at slightly different rates.  When former British colonies adopted decimal currencies, much like Canada, many of them changed the basic unit and denominations to match the American model.  In other places like the UK itself, they kept the pound after decimalization and just changed the value of the penny in relation to the pound and officially dropping the shilling.</p>
<p>But all in all the use of the dollar instead of the pound tends to follow with the move from the traditional English system to decimal denominations, as part of a larger trend much like the metric system.  Just like the metric system it happened in a bit of haphazard manner as a result of local conditions and politics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another big issue that I'm surprised you overlooked: for a long period during this time, it was illegal to export specie (precious metal currency) from Britain.  The Crown feared a drain from the mainland of all its currency.</p>
<p>This lead to a monetary crisis of sorts in the early American colonies.  Merchants had to do business in a large number of currencies backed by a whole slew of commodities, not just precious metals, but also agricultural goods like tobacco and even beaver pelts.  If you're a 18th century merchant, how do you determine the exchange rate of a Pennsylvania Pound to a Virginian tobacco-pound or to a beaver pelt?</p>
<p>Another big reason why the Spanish dollar became so prevalent was because New England had nothing to offer in trade with Britain, so merchants there needed to find another market for their wheat, fish, and iron, which they found in the Spanish Caribbean where sugar plantations largely replaced food production.  (This is also why molasses is a stable of New England cuisine).</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is true, but glosses over the fact that the Spanish dollar continued to have currency in the Canadas and other British North American colonies despite the 'official' currency being in pounds. Accounts were kept in dollars and pounds simultaneously, and people still mostly dealt in dollars as they had been doing for a century or more by that point, so it made little sense to adopt the pound entirely. As /u/TurboFucked pointed out there was very little British coinage in North America anyway. </p>
<p>Also, the original denominations of the Canadian dollar coinage didn't match the American dollar's: they used 20¢ coins instead of 25¢, since Spanish dollars were valued at 5 shillings under the Halifax rating, thus 20¢ = 1s ($4 = £1). The Canadian 25¢ coin was introduced in 1870 because the 20¢ was about the same size as an American quarter dollar and thus easily confused for it, and American coinage was far more prevalent than coins of the pound sterling or Canadian pound ever were.</p>
<p>When Australia and New Zealand introduced their dollars they were introduced at a rate of $2 = £1, thus 1s = 10¢ and 2s = 20¢. They still use 20¢ coins rather than 25¢.</p></div>		</li>
