			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: metal shavings and grinding &quot;dust&quot; (just tiny shavings, really) also become magnetized during cutting. I regularly remove grinding dust from my phone case simply by dragging a piece of steel wire over it. Although the attraction is small it still causes some inconveniences when particularly fine grinding dust becomes airborne and then settles onto high steel walls or even clings to drywall at the nails.</p>
