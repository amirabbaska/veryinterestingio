			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding to this: If you are on mobile you are reading reddit through a metal: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indium_tin_oxide" target="_blank">Indium tin oxide</a> is a metal that is used as the transparent conductive film that makes the capacitive touch screen work.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene" target="_blank">Graphene</a> is a literally one atom thick layer (semi) metal that has seen a lot of research and development in the last 10 years and real world applications are not far out in the future. A single layer absorbs &lt; 3 % of the light - actually quite a fraction considering the thickness. This actually makes it possible to see the material by the naked eye in an optical microscope even though it is so thin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indium tin oxide is not a metal the same way a chunk of iron is a metal.  The term &quot;metallic&quot; can be used to indicate it's an electronic conductor.  Indium tin oxide conducts electrons, is optically transparent, and is pretty hard and stable - super win for touch screens! Here's the wikipedia link: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indium_tin_oxide" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indium_tin_oxide</a></p>
<p>(FYI, it's transparent and semiconducting because when visible light hits ITO, the light doesn't have enough energy to make electrons conduct.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, its non-metallic. We generally refer to it as an amorphous solid. Ceramics generally imply solid state bulk oxides. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not 2.3% of all light all the time. The trick to seeing it with an optical microscope is more subtle than pure absorption. It takes some careful doing to get it to work.</p>
<p>You can only see graphene with the naked eye if it is on a silicon wafer with either 90 nm or 300 nm of SiO2 grown on it (you can use similar thicknesses of Si3N4 too, but most labs use oxide). At this thickness, the oxide layer makes the wafer appear purple. Slightly thicker and you get blue, slightly thinner and you get reddish purple. If you're quite a ways off you get yellow.</p>
<p>When it's at one of the correct thicknesses, an interference condition is set up for green light (what we are most sensitive to) between the air-SiO2-Si-SiO2-air path and the air-graphene-SiO2-Si-SiO2-graphene-air path that results in an overall ~2-3% contrast difference.</p>
<p>If you try this on SiO2 that is a bit off from one of those thicknesses (too blue or too red), you won't be able to see the graphene at all.</p>
<p>So most of the time, a single layer of graphene is completely transparent. It's only under very special cases that you can see it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but at the beginning of the internet graphene was still mostly theoretical. Now that it can be reliably produced, the practical research is making much better progress. My guess is that some products will contain graphene without us realizing it. It will simply become part of screen or processor technology in a flagship phone, then thousands or millions of people will be using it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Determining such a small thickness using microscopy is actually quite tricky. In the <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/content/306/5696/666.abstract" target="_blank">first paper</a> that definitely showed single layer graphene, they used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_force_microscopy" target="_blank">atomic force microscopy (AFM)</a> to make this determination. The way the technique works is that you have an extremely sharp tip attached to a cantilever <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/AFM_%28used%29_cantilever_in_Scanning_Electron_Microscope%2C_magnification_1000x.JPG" target="_blank">as shown in this picture</a>, which you can drag along the sample and then measure the deflection of the cantilever using a laser beam, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5czJq8JpG4" target="_blank">as you can see in this animation</a>. Even then, when they tried to measure the height of the graphene layers using AFM in that paper, the number they got an apparent height  that was too big (&gt;1nm vs. the true value 0.35nm), which was due to certain experimental complications (including at times the presence of water between the graphene and the substrate). Fortunately, they saw that that many flakes had <a href="http://i.imgur.com/kGCkby3.jpg" target="_blank">visible folds or kinks</a>, and they were able to measure the <em>step size</em> of each layer as 0.4nm, from which they concluded that the thinnest layers they could see had to be single layers of graphene.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several ways. AFM is one, where you actually measure the thickness physically.</p>
<p>STM is another (similar to AFM really).</p>
<p>Raman spectroscopy is another, where you shine laser light into the sample and see how it responds - single layers have a very different response than dual or more layers.</p>
<p>You can also attach wires to your flake via lithography and measure quantum hall and other electronic properties - single layer flakes have different properties here too.</p>
<p>But really, once you have looked at thousands of them, you can just tell with your naked eye.</p>
<p>Most of the time you get chunks where you can actually see a section of bare wafer, and then a section of monolayer, and then a section of bi-layer, and then three, and then four, and then a very thick chunk. The brightness of the flakes goes down in very regular steps.</p>
<p>Here's a decent example of bare -&gt; monolayer -&gt; bilayer</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TEM as well - you can take a cross section, or depending on the microscope and the skill of the user, and make a phase reconstruction that tells you the potential the electron passed through, and from that determine the thickness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done thin metal coatings before.  1 atom thick is pretty hard to measure, because they don't fill in evenly.  Some spots won't be covered, some will be.  Kind of like spray paint.  It is usually a random process.  But I have done coatings 10-100 atoms thick.  There is a crystal inside the vapor chamber that vibrates at a certain frequency, as metal vapor condenses on the everything in the vapor chamber evenly, the crystal frequency changes and you can determine how thick the coating is if you know what metal is being deposited on the crystal.</p></div>		</li>
