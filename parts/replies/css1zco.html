			<div class="markdown"><p>The skin effect is not relevant with lighting as the currents involved are merely unidirectional, non-oscillating discharges.(DC, if you will.)  The skin effect is a phenomenon that arises from increasing AC frequencies and their corresponding eddy currents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lightning is the equalization of differences in charge between [clouds/atmosphere] and the ground. Increasing and decreasing voltage or amperage doesn't change the <em>direction</em> the current is flowing, which is what defines a charge as alternating or direct.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current" target="_blank">&quot;Direct current (DC) is the unidirectional flow of electric charge.&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>rate</em> of the flow (current) may change, so an argument could be made that it's a <em>variable</em> current, instead of DC, but it's certainly nowhere near AC (the current never actually changes direction and certainly doesn't alternate in direction). </p>
<p><strong>TL:DR;</strong> If varying draw qualified as alternating current, most batteries would be considered AC. What makes something AC is the current (flow of electrons) <em>changing</em> direction, not simply speeding up and slowing down.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How dangerous is it to be on a boat that's struck by lightning? Are larger boats (like tankers or carriers) safer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I find myself on a metal boat, at sea in a storm, I shouldn't worry? As a layman I find this fascinating because while I understand that lightning is electricity and will follow the path of least resistance, I still fear standing on deck and getting hit by a lightning strike â€” it just seems like if I'm holding onto something on a metal boat I'd get zapped.</p></div>		</li>
