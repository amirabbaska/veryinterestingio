			<div class="markdown"><p>If it’s tracked in 5mph intervals they want the cutoffs to not be a multiple of 5. If their cutoff was 40mph for tropical storms and they measured 40mph winds they wouldn’t be able to definitively say if it’s a tropical storm or not</p></div>		</li>

<p>34 knots = 39 mph (Beaufort Force 8, Gale)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume they set the cutoff at those levels because, once they reach one mile an hour faster (in the case of tropical depressions) they become tropical storms, then when they hit 75 it's a hurricane, and once they cross 110, they're major hurricanes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the names are indicative of the region the hurricanes are expected to hit. This is why SE US hurricanes tend to alternate between Spanish names and English names, because they impact areas like Puerto Rico, Dominica etc. </p>
<p>Edit: sorry guys! I was mistaken about the typhoons. As others have pointed out they’re more local names. I had seen a special on the news a few months ago that discussed how hurricanes/ storms get their names and I must have remembered that portion incorrectly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typhoons in the Western Pacific have names from those countries, so their naming scheme differs from the Atlantic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, you're not as wrong as you seem to think. The lists use names from the languages most commonly used in the areas around the basin. So you're not going to see names from Asian languages or Arabic or whatever in the North Atlantic basin, for instance. The idea is that it should be pronounceable and familiar. But the whole North Atlantic (North Atlantic being the Atlantic north of the equator) has the same list for all storms, whether they are going to hit a certain island where Spanish is spoken or they're a fish storm, like Leslie has been so far. (Fish storm = storm that stays over open water, affecting, generally speaking, only fish). </p>
<p>But yeah, typhoons are weird and there's multiple lists that the northwest Pacific works off of, with each list being a different language/set of languages or dialects. That's why you see typhoons sometimes have multiple names. As a personal gripe, it's really obnoxious when I go searching for videos on certain storms to show trainees to illustrate certain phenomena and it's like three separate searches for some of them (I'm the one person in my office overly fond of tropical weather, so I usually handle training on that with new hires).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not true at all, all Atlantic hurricanes have the same naming convention, and pacific have another. </p>
<p>*Edit - Someone pointed out that there are difference in the pacific naming between Central, North, and West, so maybe that's what he was referring to, in which case sorry I misunderstood.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(skipping Q,U,X,Y, and Z) </p>

<p>Why do we skip those? Not enough names?</p>
<p>I guess we'll never see a Hurricane Quentin, or Hurricane Quinn, or Hurricane Ursula, or Hurricane Xavier, or Hurricane Xenophon, or Hurricane York, or Hurricane Zach, or Hurricane Zebadiah, or Hurricane Zoltar. </p>
