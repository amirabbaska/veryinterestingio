			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty fascinating. So the sludge that's left over at the end, what finally happens to it? Does it disappear or does it get burned or what? Or is the entire process a closed loop? Sorry if I don't fully understand you used a lot of technical terms I don't fully grasp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Left over sludge at the end of the wastewater treatment process is typically sent to landfill or is used as fertilizer. The waste sludge from the secondary clarifier that isn't recycled is thickened and sent to anaerobic digestion. This is where the solids are destroyed and stabilized and eventually produce gases (~65% methane and ~35% carbon dioxide) . These gases can then be utilized to generate electricity or used as other fuel. This is where the inactivation of pathogens takes place.

<p>After anaerobic digestion the remaining sludge is dewatered and then sent to disposal. Dewatering is typically used to reduce the volume of sludge that must be transported to final disposal.</p></div>		</li>
