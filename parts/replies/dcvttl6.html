<p>ID also has to be obtained at specific locations which means those who are not living near one of these locations must find a means of travel to go get an ID.</p>

<p>Honestly, I feel like the actual process involved with voting (having to physically go to the polls) is more of a deterrent than getting a valid ID. I feel like the people who don't have the resources to get a valid ID wouldn't have the resources to drive to the voting location, stand in line for (potentially) several hours, etc. in the first place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Voting locations are legally required to be accessible. Many states legislate that you cannot be required to travel more than X number of miles to your polling place. There are not always similar requirements for DMV's. Additionally, DMVs may only be open from 9am-5pm, i.e. when most people are at work. Polling places I've seen nominally close at 7pm, and are required to stay open until everyone in line at 7pm has voted.</p>
<p>But your overall point is still valid, the process of voting is a barrier to some. And in fact, some polling places have been intentionally understaffed as a method of voting suppression, by making the lines longer. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Thankfully, my boss is understanding and knows voting is important, but we had tons of people bail mid-line because they had to get to work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Arguing to the point; however, you need to disregard those that drive since they already have ID and there is no barrier. In those cases, it's the people that don't drive and therefore &quot;X number of miles to your polling place&quot; is certainly a barrier to voting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) ID is required for most things and is certainly needed for day to day activities.</p>
<p>2) Most proposals for voter ID laws included a provision that makes the ID free.</p>
<p>3) So are ID for every other type of license, what makes this one different? There is zero evidence to back your claim that they are unable to get to the DMV (or state equivalent) and people have to travel to vote to begin with.</p>
<p>4) All theoretical with zero empirical evidence. India has voter ID law in place as does almost every major democratic nation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my day to day interactions I need 4 ID on me at all times:</p>
<p>1) Drivers License (this is used for much more than just driving)</p>
<p>2) State ID (I contract work with the State and frequently go in state/federal buildings)</p>
<p>3) Student ID (Only twice a week)</p>
<p>4) CCW (I conceal carry)</p>
<p>All of these ID were easily accessible by bus with the exception of my CCW. For the CCW the county clerks office was only open a few hours a day, a few days a week, and it cost me over $100. I also had to schedule a separate appointment to have my fingerprints taken, which also cost me money, before my state would issue me one. All of that on top of the mandatory class I had to take that cost me $80. If getting an ID for voting is as difficult and convoluted as getting my CCW, I am with you and I will protest such a system on the grounds it is supressive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, bullshit. Only if you never:</p>
<p>• Buy alcohol </p>
<p>• Drive or rent a car</p>
<p>• Stay in a hotel</p>
<p>• Open a bank account </p>
<p>• Cash a check</p>
<p>• Use a debit or credit card</p>
<p>• Apply for benefits </p>
<p>• Buy a gun</p>
<p>• Pick up a prescription </p>
<p>• Apply for a job</p>
<p>• Fly on an airplane </p>
<p>I could go on. We are one of only a handful of industrial nations that don't have voter I.D. laws. Fucking <em>INDIA</em> with their poverty and massive population has it worked out. The left, in a blatant attempt to keep the flow of questionable voters flowing, has stretched their thin excuses to the point of utter transparency. It's a poor excuse to keep illegals and dead people on the rolls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are absolutely right. I'm surprised more people aren't mentioning &quot;applying for a job&quot; in this thread. US employers are required to have every employee complete an I9 form and it's submitted through E-Verify. This requires a passport or photo ID and another form of ID, such as a birth certificate or SS card.</p>
<p>We have to use our IDs all the time to function in society. Why shouldn't voting be the same way? If I don't have to show ID, what's stopping me from voting several times under different names and in different states?</p></div>		</li>
