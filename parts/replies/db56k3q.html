			<div class="markdown"><p>Logic puzzles and riddles are some of the worst interview questions you could ask. For many reasons but not least because many are well known and you could very well be hiring someone that has heard it before over an extremely intelligent person that is not good at riddles.</p>
<p>Anecdotal example: The company I work for had two candidates. I was present for both interviews. The hiring manager (my department supervisor) asked both of them the same riddle, which one solved and one did not. The candidate that solved the riddle got the job but was overheard bragging sometime later about being lucky he heard it before. That employee ended up terminated within six months for being a terrible engineer and burden on his team. The candidate that did not solve the riddle is now a Sr. Engineer at Amazon. We passed up a valuable candidate because of three light-bulbs and one switch. I am sure you have lost some over two pitchers of water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The people who know them usually play these kinds of games all the time. </p>
<p>Either way, knowing how to solve the riddle says nothing about your real world performance. </p>
<p>Unless you live in some place where they have buckets without measurements and enjoy wasting water.</p>
<p>It's like programming competitions, many I've seen do the same old repetitive tasks that, while challenging, will never ever come up in real life unless you're in a very specific field. </p>
<p>Meanwhile those same people who excel at academia and those programming challenges, write the most short sighted code, with the inability to even know to research and read the docs are source code accordingly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So,much of an interview is shit covered in shit where my experiences and what have you means far less than my ability to bullshit the interviewer. I've seen enough hires at places I've worked that are borderline retarded but managed to get through an interview. And the opposite is just as prevalent. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The point isn't to know them. The point is to be capable of the kind of novel logical thought that lets you figure out these kind of puzzles on the spot. Of course, a lot of people aren't capable of that thought and try to fake it by knowing the answer, but a well-chosen set of logic puzzles will not be easy to answer on the basis of memorization.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It says something about a certain kind of intelligence, which is correlated with various aspects of real life performance. Logic puzzle performance shouldn't be the only metric for hiring candidates, but it's normally not: generally it is used by companies selecting from pools of very impressive candidates, as one of a number of metrics to assess them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the puzzle. One puzzle I tend to ask in my interviews starts simple and gets more complicated as it goes along, causing them to have to adapt at each step. Also each step requires some explanation about how and why they would do things that way.</p>
<p>Explaining the entire thing in this post would take too long, but a high-level summary of how I would interview the person for the question might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you accomplish X?</li>
<li>Are there any downsides to that solution? Let's discuss those. How could it be done better?</li>
<li>Is there a more efficient solution?</li>
<li>Ok, if we add some new variables to this puzzle, how would you adapt your answer to handle those? Does your original solution hold up as the puzzle gets more complicated? Is there something more extensible that would work well for the simple situation and the more complicated one you're now presented with?</li>
<li>Repeat these steps a few times as the puzzle gets more complicated. See how they react to the increased difficulty and pressure. Listen to their thought process, encouraging them to think out loud.</li>
</ul>
<p>The &quot;bucket puzzle&quot; OP mentioned is too easy for sure, if someone's heard it. If I was going to ask short puzzles like that, I'd at least have multiple of them ready to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't this oversimplify the issue though? While your academic tests do not measure you as a worker, neither does your ability to walk through a series of logical questions. They're both simply signals.  </p>
<p>Obviously academics matter much less overtime (and dramatically less after your first job), but they're still a signal just like everything else in someone's Resume/CV/Portfolio.</p>
<p>The entire employer/employee relationship boils down to a hidden information game. It isn't even [that] important that someone is a good worker, they simply need to signal it. I'd limit this discussion to fresh college graduates as this is where the most hidden information is, and coincidentally where GPA/Pedigree of University are most important. But there are many different ways potential employees can signal they will be an asset to your company.</p>
<p>You mentioned interviews; interview performance may not even be indicative of job performance down the line. Some people simply interview well (yet another signal). I'm sure you've hired people that interviewed well who turned out to be lousy workers, just like I'm sure that you've passed up excellent workers because they did poorly in the interview.  </p>
<p>GPA does not indicate you will be a good worker. It indicates that you performed well in your academic classes (you can look at transcripts, so this basically removes the &quot;padding the GPA with easy classes&quot; argument). Given that you have to decide if someone will be valuable to your company in a limited amount of time with limited information, and given that most people are trying to signal that they are good workers, I'd take into account every bit of positive signaling I could.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, college degrees punish people who are actually good workers. Now they have to go get a degree to signal they're good workers, because all of the underperformers can also go get a degree to signal that they're good workers. Many people here are arguing that grades/GPA are completely unimportant and they don't look at them. This argument easily extends to ignoring whether or not a potential job candidate has a degree at all.  </p>
<p>*Edit: I'm not trying to argue that an interview is worthless or qualitatively worth less than what is signaled with a degree or GPA, but they're all still signals and people are very capable of indicating that they will be good at a job whether or not that is actually the truth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that (like in the internship :P ). This is why this type of process can offer much more qualitative information about a candidate than a college transcript.  </p>
<p>It still doesn't remove all of the hidden information, nothing by itself does. That's why I'm saying it's best to make use of every piece of  information a candidate provides the employer with to remove as much hidden information as possible. So dismissing GPA seems as silly as considering it the most important factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, and I'd say contrary to the general direction of this thread, that GPA certainly can and should be something employers pay attention to. However, <strong>nothing</strong> about a candidate profile should be looked at in a vacuum, and GPA by itself obviously says little about work performance.  </p>
<p>The employer perspective is precisely why I think these signals matter(including GPA). The employer invests a lot in anyone they hire, so narrowing down the candidate pool as much as possible to reduce risk of hiring lemons is paramount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the logic puzzle: You have a 5 gallon bucket and a 3 gallon bucket. You need 4 gallons of water from only using these two buckets.</p>
<p><em>Bonus</em> You can obviously google the question and apparently this is actually from Die Hard itself. I don't want to spoil the answer too much but I've learned a little more about the question itself.  So if you thought it was too easy here's two things to note. There are two solutions available for the initial question. Additionally if you want to adapt the puzzle to higher difficulties you can change the size of the jugs.  Try eleven and four jugs to make one gallon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure why you would think 11 and 4 to make 1 is harder. To make the question harder you'd ask for a generalisation given any values for the large and small jugs, and if there is any caveat on the amounts that can be measured (ie. You can't produce odd numbers of liters of water if both your large and small jugs are of even size). </p>
<p>The point of the question is to see how a person might cope in an unfamiliar and possibly stressful situation (being asked to solve a question beyond your competence in an interview). If the interviewee gets the question right quickly then you ask another question entirely. The one that stumped me several years ago is:</p>
<p>You have block of gold and a job that needs doing. You decide to hire someone to do the job for you and will pay them the whole block of gold for the job. The job is going to take a week to  complete. However, there is a bit of distrust between you and the employee, so you decide to pay him 1/7 th of the gold each day. How can you cut the gold such that you can pay the employee 1/7th of the gold each day. You are only allowed to cut the gold twice and each cut must be a straight line. </p>
<p>This is a slight clue, but I've asked this question to many software programmers and computer scientists. No one has ever got the answer without a substantial amount of help, and usually look a little embarrassed when they figure out the answer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's what I came up with:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hire a different employee that trusts you better and pay him the full block at the end of the week without cutting it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the condition that the employee cut off the 1/7 of the block each day as a part of the job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay a 3rd party with a small portion of the gold (or separate money) to cut the block for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reevaluate why you are paying someone with a huge block of gold and instead pay him with money.</p>
</li>
<li>Probably the right solution (already almost solved by /u/UseOnlyLurk): cut the block into three blocks of sizes 1/7, 2/7 and 4/7. Pay first with 1/7. Then, trade for 2/7 on day two. Give him the 1/7 on day 3, trade him both for the 4/7 on day 4. Pay him the 1/7 on day 5, trade his 1/7 for your 2/7 on day 6. Return the last 1/7 on day 7. I guess the binary nature of this is what the comp. sci. people were embarrassed about.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cut into 3 pieces, one 1/7th, one 2/7ths, and the last one 4/7ths. You can combine these pieces to make 1,2,3,4,5,6, and 7.... so if you're allowed to make change with the guy, e.g. &quot;give me back that 1 and I'll give you this 2&quot;, you can increase the value he holds by 1/7th each day for all 7 days.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So after thinking about it a bit, you can cut the block twice to get 1/7th of the block, 2/7th of the block, and 4/7th of the block. Then from here it's just a series of trading these pieces back and forth.</p>
<p>Monday he gets 1/7th.  </p>
<p>Tuesday you take back the 1/7th and give him the 2/7th.  </p>
<p>Wednesday he gets both the 1/7th and 2/7th for 3/7th.  </p>
<p>Thursday you take them both back and give him the 4/7th.  </p>
<p>Friday you add the 1/7th on top for 5/7th.  </p>
<p>Saturday you take back the 1/7th and exchange it for the 2/7th for 6/7th.  </p>
<p>And finally on Sunday you give him the 1/7th to complete the bar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So from an interviewing perspective I'd point out that you can't eyeball the amounts in the buckets. </p>
<p>So if a person poses a response that &quot;isn't correct&quot;, in this case eyeballing the amounts, you work with then to see if they re-evaluate their conclusion.</p>
<p>I think most people are inclined to take facts at face value in an interview situation and don't think to ask follow up questions. So when I pose questions I intentionally leave out details and keep questions open ended.  The idea is that more open ended questions will lead to more follow up and discussion on the part of the interviewee.  More discussion means more chances to see how a person thinks and reacts.</p>
<p>So to initially answer &quot;eyeball it&quot; isn't technically incorrect. Concerning is a person who doesn't modify their answer in light of new information, or on later questions repeatedly doesn't ask follow up information after it's clear they can and should be asking for it.</p>
<p>Say they had the answer memorized and rattled it off once they heard the question. This didn't create a dialog in the interview so in a way despite having the correct answer to the question without that dialog they failed the interview.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>What conclusions can you draw from This?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can't draw many conclusions without further interrogating the thought process behind the answer. The point of these brain teasers isn't really to get the answer right, it's to prove that you can think in a creative and logical way.</p>
<p>So in your case, I would ask &quot;but what about the inaccuracy of eyeballing it?&quot;</p>
<p>And a reasonable answer to that might be: &quot;any other approach will require multiple pours and refills, and at the scale of a 3 gallon bucket - this isn't a volumetric flask or anything - the accumulated error is quite likely to be of similar magnitude to the error from eyeballing&quot;.</p>
<p>It might not be correct that multiple refills will cause an error as big as eyeballing, but it's at least a reasonable possibility, and shows that you considered the concept of precision in a detailed enough way.</p>
<p>That's an example of how one might get the &quot;wrong&quot; answer in a way that still demonstrates the kind of thought the question is looking for.</p></div>		</li>
