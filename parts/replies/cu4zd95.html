			<div class="markdown"><p>But you don't get thirsty. You're thirsty for a bit, then it stops. Yeah, the symptoms are awful, but thirst isn't one of them. I know when I'm dehydrated from the headache, concentrated urine and such, but it's an intellectual realization. By the time I'm dehydrated, I don't want to drink anything, and have to force myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only relatively recently started taking particularly good care of myself, and part of that is learning to listen to your body. Lots of things can screw with your ability to listen to what your body is saying. In particular, many people can not tell the difference between thirsty and hungry. At first when I was hungry for what I thought was a snack, I would drink a glass of water instead. Now it is easier for me to tell the difference. Similar, Feeling hungry and lazy are very similar. Sometimes just a little yoga to get my heart rate up will cause hunger to pass, and typically if it hurts to try and warm up my muscles, it is because I am thirsty. </p>
<p>I think it is fairly typical to do things to intentionally screw up the communication with our bodies; alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, pain killers. And then we are confused about what our bodies are doing. </p>
<p>If you don't put unnecessary things into your body, and putting the right things in to your body, sleep well and reasonably active but having this problem, I would be very curious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it's because I sit at a desk all day not exerting myself in the slightest. I've had to install an app on my phone to remind me to drink water or else I'll forget :-\ When I worked as a barback in college I was on my feet for 5-6hrs a night and was drinking water most of the time because I was running around changing kegs and cleaning up after people. Now I sit and waste away at a desk in the basement of an old office building with an app on my phone reminding me to fucking drink water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get dehydrated like that, too, and I neither work out hard nor drink excessively.</p>
<p>I do have a very fast metabolism, though. I've always blamed it on that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, i cried once out of thrist. After a week of super intense training camp where i was already pretty worn out, culminated into a 4am half marathon with no water the entire time, around mile 8-9, tears came down because how bad it was. This coming from a former XC/track guy and former marine. </p>
<p>Never cried out of hunger</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did a wilderness therapy and was told how much I had to drink, drinking water so much made me nauseous and not able to eat the food I had to eat because we hiked 8-12 miles a day and accented 3-4,000 foot peaks once a week for 8 weeks, well one day I dumped one  of the 6 nalgene bottles i was supposed to drink based on my weight, next day I wake up with the worst headache I have ever had, had lower back pain, pee was brown, felt really close to passing out and I couldn't sweat but was so hot and thirsty.</p>
<p>That hasn't happened again but I have been close in the summers at my job as a line cook where it can get to 110 in the kitchen when not even hovering over the burners or grill, had brown pee a couple times, I usually drink about 3 liters in a 7-9 hour shift.</p>
<p>Being dehydrated is hell though.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What the hell? That sounds incredibly irresponsible and poorly planned. What institution administered this training camp? Every military training I have ever attended has required drinking water to the point where you are sick of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, was a week long running camp, because its so short they cram in so much shit. From 4am-9pm you are rushed from one thing to another. Usually has two 7-9 mile runs, one first thing in the morning, the other at night. Rest of the day is classes and competition shit. Hydrating was very important, but i guess I let it slip. From the night 8 mile run to the 4am half marathon no one had any time to hydrate. They had water being handed out by people in a truck. I was pretty well in the front and they came from the rear, they drove up and i waved them down to ask for water, they said they ran out already and drove off. I was alone, no one in front or behind as far as i could see. I just kept moving, i was also pushing for a solid PR to size myself up for the Boston marathon i was training to qualify for. I just ran as hard as i could and never had felt that thirsty in my entire life and hope i never do again. Nothing hurt worse than seeing the truck and wave it down knowing it was the water truck and they say they are out and shrug. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's 7am and we've been up all night using some wacky research chemical. My companions haven't been peeing as much as I have all night (it seemed like every 30 minutes, but there was some time travel involved). By this time the other two have passed out for sleep but I'm still awake and &quot;with it&quot; enough to recognize that I am <em>desperately</em> dehydrated. I flop out of bed and crawl across the hotel room to our stash of Pedialyte. I unscrew the cap but can't manage to break the foil seal for how weak I have become over the past 10 or 12 hours. I begin to cry. My cries wake one of my companions and she breaks the seal and I have a drink of glorious grape Pedialyte. I was so grateful for her to be there to help. I lay in bed with a bottle of the stuff unable to sleep because my muscles randomly contracted (this is remarkably hard to sleep through).</p>
<p>I was no worse for wear in a day or two.</p>
<p>I <em>hate</em> grape Pedialyte and hated it before hand. But when you're dehydrated the stuff that is rehydrating you has a habit of tasting like nectar from the gods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a doctor, nor an expert about this subject, but my best guess is, that since your kidneys can't function properly without water, your body cant get rid of poisonous substances as effectively anymore, and leaving those in the body might end up being even more lethal, so the body gets rid of them by expelling them the quickest way possible, usually the anus or the mouth. Dispite the fact that this will obviously require water. But I might be very wrong on this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, for starters, your body is not some omniscient thing, and it certainly has never encountered that situation to be able to know what to do. And as far as evolutionary pressure goes, it's pretty light -- dehydration is not a particularly common way of dying.</p></div>		</li>
