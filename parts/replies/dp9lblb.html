			<div class="markdown"><p>No. All of my comments above are specifically on canned foods. Items like frozen meals, frozen pizzas, fish sticks, etc <strong>may not all be ready-to-eat.</strong> Some frozen meals contain raw meat and it is up to the consumer to ensure it reaches the appropriate temperature. Food in this format may be salted to extend the shelf life. </p>
<p>Also, I think there's a general misunderstanding of how much is a lot of salt. A quarter teaspoon of table salt has 575mg of sodium. I know people who constantly try to buy low sodium stuff and then salt it themselves, but do so with such gusto that they're adding more than would have been there in the first place. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm.  Odd.  I eat frozen stuff with a high sodium content all the time, and pretty much can't taste the salt at all, but if I sprinkle a tiny bit on some vegetables or something, it's instantly noticeable.  And I rarely salt things.  Just pepper.</p></div>		</li>
