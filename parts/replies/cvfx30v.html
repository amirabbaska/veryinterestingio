			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you breathe pressurized oxygen to a certain extent? And if so what would be an acceptable difference in pressure between what you breathing and ambient pressure? Im assuming if i were to breathe air that was pressurized to 40-45mmhg at sea level the pressure difference wouldnt be harmful. Would it be possible for one to breathe pressurized oxygen at 15kpa on mars which you mention is the minimum survivable?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, the high end of positive pressure ventilation done in hospitals is <a href="http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/101/4/446.full" target="_blank">15 mm Hg</a>, and there are problems keeping that up in the long term, but it's fine for many hours.</p>
<p>The typical safe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing_gas#Partial_pressure_of_oxygen" target="_blank">minimum oxygen partial pressure</a> is 16 kPa.  That's 120 mm Hg, about what you get at 10,000 ft altitude.</p>
<p>Put another way, that's 2.3 PSI.  If you have 2.3 PSI inside your chest, and your chest has 1 square foot of surface area, your chest muscles have to generate 144x2.3 = 334 pounds of force to exhale.  Every time you want to take a breath.</p>
<p>How long can you keep that up for?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've breathed from a positive-pressure oxygen mask in an altitude chamber and it is extremely hard to exhale.  It feels like you're being suffocated because you can't breath out.  Even with the maximum pressure differential between your lungs and the atmosphere, positive pressure oxygen only works up to about 50,000' on Earth.  Above that, even 100% oxygen will not have a partial pressure high enough to oxygenate your blood.  A pressure suit is required.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldnt the higher pressure inside your lungs force the air out of your mouth or nose into the low ambient pressure woth out any effort from your muscles? Assuming the airflow from the respirator stopped so you didnt have to exhale against it.
Edit: this seems to be a moot point given that this arrangement is unlikely to help you survive but just curious about it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by breathing? An oxygen delivery system that supplied 'pressurized' oxygen would only result in increased flow at the mouthpiece. If you somehow managed keep the mask/mouthpiece on you'd be risking a lung overexpansion injury, and breathing out would be close to impossible. A pressurized suit is basically the only way to go, keeping the pressure outside and inside lungs the same. And that's just the breathing mechanics part - the body pO2 would probably be dictated by the ambient pressure, if it were by some means different from the inspired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that medical respirators operate at higher than atmospheric pressure and stop airflow to allow a body to naturally exhale and then reapply the pressurized air to put air in the lungs. Also this may be an option but during certain thoraxic surgerys blood flow is diverted to a machine that oxygenates it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you kidding me? This problem was solved in the 30s. How do you think a scuba regulator works?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There was a similar question here some time ago, actually, and I remember what I did to answer it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1501025/" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1501025/</a> says that in the males used in the experiment the maximum expiratory pressure was about 97 cmH2O or about 9 kPa (or 0.09 atm). And that's at the maximum lung volume, apparently your ability to exhale against pressure decreases about twofold as you do exhale.</p>
<p>Which means that if you are not in a pressure suit but use a pressure mask, the difference between the ambient pressure (acting on your ribcage from the outside) and the pressure of the air you're inhaling and exhaling can't be more than 9 kPa, and even that... would be extremely painful... for you.</p>
<p>So yeah, no going commando on Mars where the pressure is about 0.6 kPa.</p>
<p>By the way, this also answers a question you didn't have (unfortunately, but I'm not judging!): if you're a ninja attempting to breathe through a straw while submerged in a toilet or something, you wouldn't be able to do it your chest is below 1 meter of water. <strong>edit:</strong> except in that case it would be the inspiratory pressure that is relevant, but the numbers are roughly the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on the discussion, it sounds like oxygenating the blood with some kind of prosthesis so you wouldn't have to exhale would enable survival. A vapor barrier suit that allowed free movement could keep the skin hydrated. The big problem would seem to be the eyeballs. Pressurized goggles maybe? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are way more problems that that.  To start with, remember that the lungs are gas exchange mechanisms.  If the partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs is too low, <em>oxygen will leave the blood to fill them</em>.</p>
<p>The pressure of oxygen required for life is not enough to explode your body in a Hollywood gore-fest, but it <em>would</em> feel like you're trying to hold your breath with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peine_forte_et_dure" target="_blank">very heavy weight on your chest</a>, and there would probably be unwanted physiological effects (meaning injury) that are more subtle.</p>
<p>Another series of problems is the gut.  Your blood might not boil, but what about the contents of your gut?  Can you clench your throat and ass tight enough to prevent your guts from freeze-drying?</p>
<p>Human bodies aren't strong enough to support the kind of pressure differential you'd need.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the lungs as a gas exchange membrane is a problem; didn't think about them backing up in the other direction and pulling oxygen out of the blood. Having the natural gases pulled out of your GI tract at both ends would be an odd sensation...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since the air pressure is so low, even if you inhale, you're barely getting any actual oxygen molecules into you. That's what you're saying?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Pure oxygen at martian atmospheric pressure is 1/27 of the oxygen your body requires.  Even of you add the maximum pressure a strong person is physically capable of exhaling (once!), it's <em>still</em> not enough.</p></div>		</li>
