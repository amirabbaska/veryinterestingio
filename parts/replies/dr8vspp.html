			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a side sleeper too...or so I thought.  You probably move more than you think you do.  A sleep study diagnosed me with positional obstructive sleep apnea when I rolled over onto my back.  I didn’t believe them until they showed me the video taken with infrared camera.   I had no idea I moved that much.  Later I had to train myself to become a side sleeper after I was unable to be CPAP compliant.   A watch like a Fitbit will give you a rough idea of how much you move in your sleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait.. So u have sleep apnea when youre on your back but not on your side? Is it caused by a physical obstruction when u lay on your back and if so do u have it when your awake? </p>
<p>I actually run Sleep Better on my phone every night and it shows activity when I activate it and then all deep sleep until about half an hour before I wake up.</p>
<p>-EDIT
Well after checking the app, there are more spikes then I remembered. Guess I do move around a bit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is correct, only when I’m on my back.  No problem when awake.  Told it was an anatomical problem.  I’m not even close to being overweight.  I’ve used Sleep Cycle on phone but Fitbit is more convenient for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am in the same boat. I have obstructive sleep apnea that gets exponentially worse when I'm on my back, but I'm not overweight at all (was first diagnosed at 16 and 140lb soaking wet, now I'm closer to 180 but still a healthy weight for my height). </p>
<p>I also had a hard time with CPAP. My sleep doctor referred me to a dentist that built an oral appliance for me. Very simple device, it's like a retainer that holds your lower jaw forward and keeps your throat from collapsing. It is <em>amazing</em>. I highly, <strong>highly</strong> recommend you ask your sleep doctor about getting one. I paid about $900 out of pocket all said and done, and it has been worth every penny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll look into it.  I tried one device years ago, but my sinuses swell due to the dryness caused by Sjogren's Syndrome and I couldn't mouth breath with it, so I'd wake up feeling like I was suffocating.  After reading comments maybe it's time to revisit this and go give sleep clinic a try.  It's been a few years and the problem has changed since then I think.  An off button for my brain would be nice.</p></div>		</li>
