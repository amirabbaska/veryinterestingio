			<div class="markdown"><p>To date, there are no known galaxies moving away from us at greater than the speed of light. This would actually require that they be so far away from us that the intrinsic expansion of the universe between us and them is faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>The speed of light is <em>c</em> in all reference frames. No exceptions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I seem to remember seeing or reading something that the oldest galaxies are so redshifted that they appear to be moving faster than light.  I get that they cannot actually be moving faster than c.  Maybe I misunderstood what was going on, but it was something like the light from those galaxies is so redshifted that it could not be the case unless they were traveling faster than c (which is impossible) or the universe's expansion was accelerating.</p>
