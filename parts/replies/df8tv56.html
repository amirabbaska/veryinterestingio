			<div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons:</p>
<p>Women have breasts. Men don't (well actually they do, but they don't have the same structure, and don't lactate, so I'm lying a little bit here). Because having healthy breasts is good for raising children (healthy breasts -&gt; milk -&gt; holders who aren't starving), men are biologically programmed to be attracted to females with healthy breasts. Thus, they're sexualized. Like another commenter said, if you saw breasts hanging out all the time, you'd get desensitized.</p>
<p>Men and women both have ankles and earlobes, and they don't really play a part in reproduction or child raising, so they're not really sexualized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so this means that as a male, the biggest reason i have a fascination with breasts besides the fact that its been sexualized by our culture is just because of biological programming?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gonna have to stop you right there. There are many breastfeeding animals in which females do not have large breasts, so no, it has nothing to do with babies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Under some forms of Islam, women must cover everything except their eyes when out in public. The cultures where women's breasts are not sexualized were not influenced strongly by Abrahamic religions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Massively this.</p>
<p>Ask a Victorian if ankles are &quot;risque&quot; and they would say yes, we would say no.</p>
<p>This is primarily because Victorians didn't have hot pants and sling bikinis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't put too much stock into abrahamic religions being a source, I would guess people already dressed modestly by covering breasts in the areas where Christianity and Islam first orginated from. Practically all of East Asia developed modest dress culture completely independent of any western influence, I would guess many other cultures developed that way too but I don't know enough about the subject. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, on one hand that makes sense, on the other hand when you walk down the street in Denmark during the week you can see women sunning their breasts in the park during their lunch break... European culture is based on Abrahamic religions isn't it?</p></div>		</li>
