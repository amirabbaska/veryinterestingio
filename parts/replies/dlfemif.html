			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially the protein acts in forces that maintain water pressure across a permeable boundary such as vasculature. These are called Starlings forces and include things like hydrostatic pressure and oncotic pressure. Your liver generates albumin which is a blood protein from many amino acids so I think in response to your question it is a general lack of protein and not specific ones. This albumin helps essentially retain water into the correct compartments of your body via these starlings forces. In starved mammals/humans the water balance becomes disturbed from low albumin (this can be detected in blood tests) and the vasculature can essentially &quot;leak&quot; water into these spaces that the lymph system can't keep up with. </p>
<p>The fat deposition in the liver is an issue of metabolism and the malnourishment itself not the protein in particular. This fatty liver just interferes in the livers production of everything it generates- so albumin, enzymes, other proteins. </p>
<p>Long story short: starved state leads to fatty liver and liver dysfunction. Lack of protein intake and therefore albumin levels increase permeability of blood. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On beer guts- People with advanced liver disease often do have ascites and this may be secondary to alcohol. However your average joe walking around with a gut does not have ascites! This is most definetely visceral fat around their abdominal organs. People with ascites are rather unwell! They either have such a damaged liver that it becomes difficult for blood to flow through it creating a high pressure system in the blood vessels that go from your digestive system to your liver leading to increased fluid outside of the blood vessels (due to hydrostatic pressure pushing fluid out of the vascular space). This is called portal hypertension. Another way to have ascites (as in protein deficiency) the person has less protein in their blood. Protein is osmotically active (or draws fluid across the cell walls that make up the blood vessel and into the vessel). This is called low oncotic pressure and leads to less fluid wanting to be inside the vessels and more being outside the vessels i. E. In the abdominal space. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beer belly is basically a myth. Men mostly accumulate fat in their stomach area first, which is why you often see otherwise thin looking people with a fat gut - it starts there first.</p>
<p>Beer is high in calories though, and someone who drinks a lot of it probably has an above-average calorie intake which can lead to fat gain. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19550430" target="_blank">There are studies that correlate heavy beer drinking with larger waist size</a>, but nothing that shows causation. In other words, beer is just another calorie-heavy drink - you'd get the same effect from drinking too much coke or greek yogurt kale smoothies if calories where equated.</p></div>		</li>
