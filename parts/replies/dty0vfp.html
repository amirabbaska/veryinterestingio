			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems like a false dichotomy, no? You're artificially saying there's some super duper deeper meaning to a pain reaction, but if you check the brains of each, it's the same sort of work as in ours. Thing bad, avoid. This seems like you're arguing there must be some ghost in the machine, but no, there doesn't have to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More relevant is the neurology.  Neurons are a case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution" target="_blank">Convergent Evolution</a>.</p>
<p>We share the same neurology and neurochemistry with all vertebrates, but there were something like 9 different independently evolved neurological systems that were detected on earth last I heard, with mollusks having a different system.  I don't think they even included insects in the study.</p>
<p>Them being different scientifically means we don't actually know how they feel about their experience - it becomes a guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's a valid point in 2 ways. 1 - Anderson isn't necessarily the result of pain. You can about something without feeling pain from it. Avoidance could be the result of stress response or fear of pain.</p>
<p>2 - even different organisms of the same species experience pain differently. If you selected a group of humans with high pain tolerance, the would misrepresent what causes us pain and what does not. For instance, take a few people that eat spicy food. From that you may falsely conclude that putting peppers in a human's mouth does not cause pain. When, in fact, it does for many.</p></div>		</li>
