<p>My father went to an Indian village at the base of the Himalayas last year and the hotel he stayed at had a pulse oximeter to play around with. </p>
<p>The atmospheric pressure there was low enough to cause his resting spO2 to 80-82% despite being fit and healthy. Needless to say he got altitude sickness!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that's what I mean. In the general population that is true. My patients have 'normal' saturations in the 70s and sometimes 60s. That's just how they are plumbed, for the moment, so until they have more ops (months, sometimes years in the future), that's what they are going to read all of the time and not be 'compromised' by it acutely because that is their norm. We are often given 'acceptable limits' by our doctors which can often be 'anything over 75%' or sometimes even lower, I'm just wondering what the accuracy of those numbers/limits are when I've heard the pulse ox isn't too accurate in those ranges. Hence we often just ignore the thing altogether and just go by how the patient looks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They <em>could</em> put effort into calibrating it, but there's not much point given that at some point you reach values that are all bad. </p>
<p>Also: even with the data they have, the manufacturers deliberately calibrate the numbers to have them underestimate the actual spO2, to minimise the risk of false positive (so to speak) normal range numbers. </p>
<p>Glucometers are calibrated the same way for the same reasons as well!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When they initially developed the calibration tables (ie this percentage of light absorption means a saturation of x%) they only had access to healthy medical students. They made some of them hypoxic down to a SaO2 of around 80 but extrapolated the data from 80% downwards. </p>
<p>Therefore when it's reading below 80 it's essentially following a line of best fit as opposed to some actual measured results. It gives you an idea as to whether someone is seriously unwell or not, but whether there's any real difference between a reading of 60% and 65% is up for debate. </p>
<p>Having said that I've seen pulseox monitors reading 100% with an excellent waveform on the monitor when the probe was dangling in mid air. Not very reassuring!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clinical question..</p>
<p>So you have a patient that short of breath. You place the spo2, and it reads 100%. But the patient tells you they're anemic. And so you know that this must be a situation where the hemoglobin is low. What is the proper treatment? Does it help if you apply oxygen at a high fio2 to them? I know that plasma can carry some oxygen, but will it really help in oxygenating the patient if all the available hemoglobin molecules are bound? Curious paramedic..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Does it help?  Yes, but not much.  If a patient was symptomatic from anemia you would apply 100% oxygen as a first line immediate treatment, but the actual treatment would be transfusing them (and figuring out why they are anemic to begin with).</p>
<p>Longer answer: The oxygen carrying capacity of blood is expressed by the equation CaO2 = (1.34 x Hb (g/dL) x SaO2) + (0.003 x PaO2), where Hb is the hemoglobin level, SaO2 is the oxygen saturation, and PaO2 is the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood.  The first part of the equation represents how much oxygen hemoglobin is carrying in the blood, and the second part represents how much oxygen is dissolved in the blood.  In the example you gave, the SaO2 is fixed at 100% and the hemoglobin is low due to the patient's anemia.  By applying 100% oxygen to the patient, you are influencing that last variable, the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood and the amount dissolved in the blood.  But, as you can see by the factor you multiply the PaO2 by (0.003 -- which represents oxygen solubility in blood), the contribution of the PaO2 to the total oxygen carrying capacity is small relative to the oxygen saturation and the hemoglobin level.  So, applying 100% oxygen to the patient is a temporizing measure which would be done because it's fast and readily available.  The definitive treatment would be transfusing the patient (and raising the hemoglobin level), and of course figuring out why they're anemic to begin with! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! Prehospitally, I cannot infuse blood products. But I was wondering if the oxygen I apply would be a stop gap or futile measure. I forget right now, but if I push the PaO2 above normal range would the cells be able to utilize that oxygen? </p></div>		</li>
