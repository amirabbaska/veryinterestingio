			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point. I was just watching a lecture talking about color perception and they cited the example of Russians having more words for &quot;blue&quot;, rather than just calling it &quot;light blue&quot; or &quot;dark blue&quot;.</p>
<p>Which word is used to describe mental exhaustion? Like after a long test or long days work</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean mostly shades of blue, while Russian has a word for light blue and a different word for navy blue and they are perceived as different colours, like in 7 colours of the rainbow, there is no &quot;general blue&quot; that includes both shades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general, <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/words/does-english-have-most-words" target="_blank">English has more words than many other languages</a> due to its Germanic-Latin heritage and its worldwide presence. The <a href="http://www.languagemonitor.com/number-of-words/number-of-words-in-the-english-language-1008879/" target="_blank">number of words in its vocabulary is estimated to be about 1.025M words</a> and growing at a consistent pace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In English, we often use a variety of words to describe both.<br />
Exhausted, worn out and knackered would refer to physically spent. Sleepy, shattered and drowsy would be sleep deprived. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fine. Drowsy is rarely used, but we still have the word.<br />
I've never had doubts over whether someone was physically drained or sleep deprived. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest, most of us English speakers hack our way through our speech. It would be more appropriate to say fatigue for exhausted from exertion.  I don't see how one can confuse the two. One is a mental state and the other is a physical stress felt in the muscles lungs and heart. They don't feel similar at all. </p></div>		</li>
