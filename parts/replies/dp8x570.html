<p>Primarily, the main reason is because it's the laminar flow of the water over the surface that provides a thin layer of water that is carried along with the boat, and so the primary friction layer is water-water, not water-boat surface. </p>

<p>One of my racing (sailboats) buddies swears that wetsanding the hull to remove wax and leave a matte finish is faster, because of this effect.  He thinks it allows more water to stick to the hull and that water-water layer is smoother.  I don't know if that's right; I've always been skeptical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's wrong, although not for the reasons you're thinking.  As long as he uses sufficiently fine sandpaper the end effect is really no change from a glossy bottom, however he's degraded the gelcoat and now it's going to get dirty faster, and that dirt is definitely slower.  On foils wetsanding actually reduces lift (rudder and centerboards) and makes them less efficient.  Frank Bethwaite proved this in his book High Performance Sailing. </p></div>		</li>

<p>back in the 80s or 90s, there were a few boats that used a stippled tape made by 3M to help improve their friction surface, and this actually DID measurably improve their speed and reduce friction. It was quickly outlawed by FISA, and the reason today that FISA boat manufacturing rules specifically dictate that no extraneous coatings or coverings that serve to reduce friction aside from the natural surface of the shell are permitted was because of this early experimentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, what?  Does it harm the structural integrity of the boat or something?  Why on earth would it be made illegal if it works?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FISA generally is against anything that gives a significant equipment advantage in rowing competition since boats are so expensive- the cost of buying new faster boats would be prohibitively expensive for smaller clubs, while larger clubs could turn their boathouse over in a year or two and gain an advantage fairly quickly.</p>
<p>The same thing happened in the early 80s with the sliding rigger- in 1981 Empacher (a big boatmaker) put a sliding rigger system where the oar pivot moved instead of the rower on a single scull. It won the world championship that year pretty convincingly. The next year, 6 of the 8 boats in the finals had sliding riggers (and came in 1st through 6th). FISA banned sliding riggers at that point for the reasons listed above- big clubs could afford to switch out all their boats for the new riggers, but smaller clubs couldn't, thus bifurcating the sport into haves and have nots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is also one of the reasons there are weight limits on race bikes. you would end up in a position where people are racing with bikes so light and expensive that they are unfair and/or a serious danger to the rider (and the people around them) because they have such high failure rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For similar reasons why the sliding rigger was disallowed in competition - FISA figured it would be too complex to get all boatbuilders to use the same innovation, and it was patented - FISA requires that no builder use &quot;exclusive&quot; patents on any of their boats since that would make it impossible for other builders to make a competitive alternative product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify FISA is the international body governing rowing. And the tape/film made by 3M was marketed as Riblets. </p></div>		</li>
