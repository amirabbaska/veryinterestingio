			<div class="markdown"><p>My parents just had to &quot;go it alone&quot; for a Class 1 Criminal Misdemeanor case, not because they fell into either of those categories, but because they couldn't afford to pay $2000 EACH for a lawyer to represent them. The state would not provide them with defense attorney's because they were &quot;only&quot; facing up to 6mo in jail. They actually won the case and were found not guilty, but I was pretty nervous because they were not following any of my advise (asking for chain of custody for video evidence against them which was unavailable for 4 months, etc). They didn't do that because, &quot;I'm not a lawyer, and nobody will tell me how to request such a thing.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Jurisdictions have a cut off for when you can have a free lawyer. Most places it is like where you are: under six months in jail, and no free lawyer. </p>
<p>Interestingly, for anyone out there facing a similar conundrum, there is a motion you can file in most jurisdictions that will get you a lawyer for a minor crime, even though you're not normally entitled to one. The motion basically says there are complicated legal issues in the case, and it just straight up wouldn't be fair to expect a lay person to handle it. Pro tip: one thing you can claim that almost <em>always</em> get you a lawyer, is that there is state evidence you would like to try to &quot;suppress.&quot;</p>
<p>I can flesh that out if anyone is interested. </p></div>		</li>
