If he simply forgot that he met with the Russian diplomat twice (once at a conference and once at a private meeting in his office 4 months prior to his confirmation hearing) then its not perjury. Perjury has to be proven the he knew he was lying.</p>
<p>Yes senators meet with ambassadors all the time but Sessions was THE ONLY senator on the Armed Services Committee to meet with the Russian ambassador at the height of the Russian hacking allegations.</p>
<p>Its possible he knowingly lied because his original comment to Congress was &quot;Senator Franken, I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn't have — did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it.&quot; but weeks later after being called out on it his comment is &quot;“I never met with any Russian officials to discuss the issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.” </p>
<p>This is a remarkably misleading non-denial denial. Sessions, in the course of three sentences, manufactures a straw man, props him up and then knocks him down. He is denying a report that doesn't exist.</p>
<p>The fact is The Post never reported that Sessions and the Russian ambassador discussed “issues of the campaign.” The report was that he met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, period — apparently despite the Trump campaign's repeated denials of contact with Russian officials and despite Sessions's own apparent denials during his confirmation hearings.</p>
<p>It's a statement that suggests Sessions is on his heels and needs to obfuscate. But just how much trouble is he in? It can range from nothing to being fired and jailed for a maximum of 5 years for perjury. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks so much for replying. It's really interesting. I would have thought that alternating statements would automatically count as perjury, but I see what you mean about it being hard to prove. His second statement itself just feels false and contrived, the wording is so calculated and chosen specifically for its ambiguity. Having said that, what do you expect from a lawyer?</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was a lie of commission. </p>
<p>Sessions could make a credible argument that, because Franken's question was in the context of campaign contacts with Russia, that he just didn't consider the meeting with the ambassador relevant because it was a routine contact given his role as a member of the Armed Services committee. Perjury would require that Sessions knowing mislead the c'tee, and a reasonable story could be made that he just didn't think of it given the context. However, if Sessions were being truthful, we might have expected him to &quot;correct the record,&quot; which is what you do when you review testimony you gave under oath and realize you mistakenly said something incorrect or misleading. The fact that he didn't suggests quite strongly to me that he hoped the meeting would stay secret. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a thread on /r/NeutralPolitics about it right now. Short answer is: Likely not, perjury is extremely hard to prove.</p></div>		</li>
