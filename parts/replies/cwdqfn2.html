			<div class="markdown"><p>You are certainly correct. They are synonymous.
Pretty common nomenclature for amino acids; I assumed that the same was true for nucleic acid chemistry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think &quot;concentrated&quot; is a misleading way to describe it.  You could just as easily say table sugar is &quot;concentrated&quot; sweet taste.  It's not wrong, but the whole &quot;concentrated&quot; part conveys a connotation.</p>
<p>The flavor of MSG (Umami) is tasted by specific receptors and is its own &quot;pillar&quot; of the five tastes.  These are glutamate receptors, and there are many many foods which naturally contain a form of glutamate which triggers these receptors.  MSG is just a convenient way to add that flavor to a given dish.  It's delicious (subjective :P)!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taste is not likely as simple as popular media describe. I think it is hard to say 'good taste' is universal. Umami flavor is a signal that you are eating protein, which is historically a highly desired calorie source.<br />
There is an episode of the Gastropod podcast (the bitter truth) that give a very broad overview of taste, and spends some time with the history of the 'umami' flavor. StuffYouShouldKnow also has an episode on Umami, which has good history and safety overviews. I think that the consensus is that there is nothing inherently wrong with it, except that chemical names creep lots of people out.
Also, check out the faculty pages at Monell.org for a look at the breadth of taste (and smell) work that they do. It is astounding, and very cool!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since the unhealthy part about MSG really is the sodium, why isn't just either the pure glutamic acid or a glutamate with another base that only shows harmful effects in higher concentrations used?</p></div>		</li>
