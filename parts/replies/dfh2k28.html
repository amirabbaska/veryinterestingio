			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your good explanation, I think it is also worth mentioning the body-mass-to-power ratio,</p>
<p>A factor that helps in these creatures is the fact that their weight is very low. An easy, practical way to illustrate this is comparing a full size car to a bicycle or go kart. A bike/go-kart is highly maneuverable because the mass is low and there is not much energy required to get it in motion or change its direction whereas a car takes a LOT of power (hence rating vehicles in horsepower or pounds/ft torque) and by extension is heavier and less manuverable.</p>
<p>In childhood we were able to change directions quickly and reach full sprint just as fast where as full sized adults take more time. We require loads more energy to burn and energy <em>is</em> weight. So, our bodies not only have to carry their &quot;dry weight&quot; but also their energy sources such as fats. All of that adds up to more power being required to move and as a result it takes longer to get up to speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! This is why we call those fibers &quot;Slow&quot; vs &quot;Fast&quot;. Examples being the patellar reflex of the knee - a quick jerking motion, vs. the movements involved in walking. Much slower motion but far more control. </p>
<p>Thank you for adding this in!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not hemoglobin. MYOglobin. Hemoglobin is specific to blood. Myoglobin is the one found within myofibers (individual muscle fibers).</p>
<p>To my knowledge glycogen does not have color. Both red muscle and white muscle have glycogen. It is the primary storage fuel for skeletal muscle. The color difference between the two muscle is related to myoglobin content, mitochondrial content, and amount of small vasculature. </p>
<p>Also, red muscle is not stronger muscle. It's peak tetanic force is usually much lower than white muscle. A large part of this is due to mitochondrial density. The &quot;redder&quot; the muscle, the more mitochondria, the less space there is for the myofilaments needed for force production. An example would be a hummingbird. A lot of red muscle and mitochondria, but very low force output. You can watch videos of hummingbirds getting caught by mantis(es?). The hummingbird is much larger than a mantis, but because their muscles are built for duration and not force, they can't escape. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may annoy you but the evolution/predation argument has merit. Its easier to detect things in motion. The less time an animal takes to get from point A to point B the less time it is exposed by motion. The musculature/mass argument is valid but certainly not the whole story. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really correct. Eg a tiny chihuahua doesn't move with small jerky movements. </p>
<p>The real answer is to avoid detection by predators. Predators often spot prey visually by looking for motion against a stationary background. Think of all those &quot;can you spot it&quot; videos of some camouflaged animal in its natural habitat - they're hard to spot until they move, at which point they're impossible to miss. The quicker and jerkier your movements are, the less cumulative time you spend in motion. Thus a predator has less opportunity to spot you if your movements are quick and jerky. Going back to the chihuahua example, the reason their movements are not quick and jerky is because they are descended from predator animals. If we released a bunch of chihuahuas into the wild and let evolution have its way with them, their small size would make them easy prey, so they would probably quickly evolve to have more side-wards pointing eyes and jerkier movements (assuming they survive at all, as mentioned below).</p>
<p>Why don't large prey animals move like this? Because they're usually easy to spot regardless of how they move, and because the forces required at larger sizes become too large. The forces required for a horse to jerk its head around like a squirrel would damage its spinal column over time. Larger prey animals adopt different strategies like living in herds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with most of this. Except I'm certain if we released a seemingly sustainable chihuahuas into the wild they would be extinct within a year or two. Chihuahuas basically live on human life support. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>First of all, it's surely more complicated than that. For example, smaller animals may have differing metabolisms, abilities to store energy, or mechanical improvements over larger animals simply due to volume/surface area considerations. There are proximate and ultimate causes, chemical, mechanical, developmental, phylogenetic constraints to consider. Trying to boil everything down into a neat and unsubstantiated claim is folly. </p>
<p>Secondly, you can't unilaterally dismiss all other reasons in answering a 'Why' in biology without cause, no matter how convinced you are of your reasoning. If your theory is unprovable it needs to be stated as such, not 'this is the correct answer', but 'The conclusion of most evolutionary biologists is that fast movements evolved in prey animals to diminish exposure to risks'. And then give countering or mitigating evidence as well.</p>
<p>Thirdly, if you'll notice how the post you're disagreeing with is introduced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>factor</em> that helps in these creatures is the fact that their weight is very low.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author doesn't claim to be presenting the whole story and excluding every other factor. You are doing that. It may be counter-intuitive without a lot of experience doing science, but an argument presented with proper caveats and context is far more convincing than unsubstantiated truth claims.</p>
<p>Not convinced? I'll give a counter-explanation (with a poor conclusion) that is as equally compelling as yours:</p>
<p>Story-time: <em>The real answer is that fast movements are more energetically efficient in small animals than slow movements would be. Movement speed is inversely proportional to size across species for a whole host of reasons, from mechanical (power, acceleration) to chemical (releasing chemical energy quickly across a number of cells is more efficient than the loss that occurs if released evenly over a longer period of time). Because of this the post above is not correct. I have a good reason ergo all other reasons are superfluous.</em></p>
<p>I hope that illustrates the problem well enough.</p></div>		</li>
