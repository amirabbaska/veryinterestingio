			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, I love it. Sneezing feels amazing (especially when you need to), and being able to cure that &quot;itch&quot; by looking up is great. It wasn't until I was in my 20s until I realized I was a part of this special group of people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found out when I was a kid. There was this episode of Pete and Pete where little Pete didn't like his bed time being so early, so he got a bunch of kids to not go to sleep with him so they could stay up and hang out. One of the girls would stare up at the sun to not fall asleep, when I tried this, it just made me sneeze.</p></div>		</li>
