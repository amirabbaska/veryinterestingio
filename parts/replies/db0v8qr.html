			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question.  I was struck by lightning when I was 16 years old.  Two other friends and I were hunting gophers in a field with our compound bows. The bows had metal handles.  There was only one cloud in the sky.  It was a roll cloud that came over the hill.  It started to pour,  and we started running to the car to get out of the rain. About 10 seconds later, I was struck by lightning, or more accurately I could say the bow I was holding was struck by lightning.  I could see the lightning bolt enter into the metal handle of my bow but instead of going through me, it then went through my friends bow, then his bow, then into a barbed wire fence that the last friend was next to.
So, my question is... Since lightning takes the path of least resistance, why didn't it go through my body (or my friends bodies) into the ground and instead went through the air 3 separate times to get to the fence?</p>
<p>None of us suffered any injury, though I fell down (loss of muscle control).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had lightning strike right next to me, and I thought I went deaf. I could feel it in my bones and it was like someone lit up a light in my brain from within. </p>
<p>The flash and sound were tremendous and it took me a long time before I could get my senses back. I was seeing light spots for hours and the ringing took a long time to stop. </p>
<p>It's a hard memory too explain simply because of how disoriented I was. </p>
<p>I've always wanted to know if a Flashbang compares to a lightning strike. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading the other replies here it seems YMMV.</p>
<p>I had lightning strike close to me while hiking in the mountains.  The guy I was with said it hit about 20 metres in front of me.  I had my head down and didn't see where it struck, I just saw the entire universe go bright pink, and my metal watch strap started tingling.  It should have been deafening but I don't remember any sound at all.  We were able to talk about it immediately afterwards so our hearing didn't seem to be affected (our conversation was mostly along the lines of &quot;SHIT! We'd better get off this ridge quick!&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was loud but not loud enough where my ears were ringing or anything.  Think like if you took two pieces of wood and slapped them together.  It was more of a crack then a boom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the previous story was a simplification for the sake of ELI5. It basically told half of the story. A lightning strike consists of two parts, a streamer, which flows from the cloud to the ground. This part ionizes the air (breaks the electrons away from the atoms in air) this creates the free electrons that in the end allow the current to flow. This current flowing (so the second part) is what we see as lightning and is where the real power comes in. However this lightning always follows the path created in the streamer phase. </p>
<p>The streamer is created like an avalanche. Free electrons from an initial ionization accelerate, bump into other atoms and thus create more free electrons.</p>
<p>If you have a sharp surface like a bow or a fence there's a lot of air around it, which means a lot of free electrons can be formed around it, which helps the initialization of the avalanche and thus the creation of a streamer channel. This is why lightning often goes to sharp metallic objects, even when this might not be the path of the smallest resistance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The streamer phase, question. Have you ever seen the gif of lightning striking in slow mo? You kind of see the path that the lightning ultimately takes, form before your eyes. It looks very similar to how they burn wood with super high electricity. Is that the streamer phase?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not the right explanation. Sharp surfaces are dangerous, because the electric field (kV/cm) there is very large and ionizes the air. It has nothing to do that there is much air around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldn't be the end destination of that lightning, it would only travel through you to reach the ground. The resistance you have to the ground must have been higher than the air between you and your friends bow wich might have been caused by something like wearing rubber boots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing I don't get about the whole &quot;electricity is lazy and will take the easiest path&quot; argument is how does it know which path is best before it goes down it? That's like me just &quot;knowing&quot; how to get from London to York without me even having to think about it... Or does it get it wrong occasionally? I'm guessing not. I'd also understand it if there were for example two paths without any breaks etc and it was just a simple 50m vs 10m sort of scenario but the fact that this bolt of lightning decided not to go through the human and his shoes to the ground and instead jumped through the air 2/3 times because there was less resistance in the final stretch is bizarre.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should note that you're entirely correct, but most people (or at least a huge portion, idk the number) don't die by their heart stopping from the initial incident, they die from the burns. </p>
<p>Unlike normal burns which are relatively superficial, electrical burns destroy the tissue underneath too, like the muscles and fat. The problem is that even if you survive, all of those dead cells release potassium ions and that can cause your heart to stop, basically like a giant arrhythmia (commonly referred to as hyperK). </p>
<p>Also, your body begins releasing fluid into the burned area, which causes low blood volume, then shock (your organs become oxygen deprived and shut down).</p>
<p>That's not to mention further complications like infection which is common with burns. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FA=first aid?</p>
<p>Make sure the scene is safe, that's the most important. </p>
<p>Assess if a fall was involved (powerlines for example)</p>
<p>Assess pulse, breathing, and airway. Perform CPR there is no pulse.</p>
<p>Assess entry and exit points and control excessive bleeding if present (unlikely)</p>
<p>If you're not a paramedic, wait for an ambulance to arrive while rechecking vitals. </p>
<p>Get IV access ASAP and put on an EKG, staying proximal to the burned area if possible (forget limb leads). Give normal saline if the burns are not extensive, hyperK cocktail if they are or you see signs of hyperK (high T waves). Defibrillate if necessary, treat for vasogenic shock if indicated. Manage pain and/or anxiety</p>
<p>Rapid assessment of other inquiries and transport to the ER</p>
<p>Basically the first aid goal is to keep the person alive until they get to the ER, where shock and electrolyte imbalance can be managed in depth. Then down the line surgery to remove dead tissue + soft tissue grafts </p>
<p>Edit: oh and try to keep the wound clean if possible</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add to your comment and also say that a high current flowing through you is not enough information to say whether it will be lethal or not, the key is how long the current is allowed to flow. If a cosmic ray that is charged goes through your body at a fraction of the speed of light, technically that particle is a huge current flowing through your body as I = Qv/d</p>
<p>This happens quite often, but it never hurts you because a) it's a single particle and b) the current lasts a very short amount of time (your height divided by the speed of light is the time scale). </p>
<p>Lightning has less potential to do damage because it is a short burst of charge flow, if it were sustained longer the same parameters would probably kill you.</p>
<p>People often cite a static charge not hurting as evidence of &quot;it's the amps not the volts&quot; since these are thousands of volts. They fail to realize not only is the shock brief, but there is little to no charge build up so no damage is done. A 10000 volt shock over a second will most definitely hurt you.</p>
<p>If we allow some calculus, the reason is that current is actually the time derivative of charge. The total energy transfer is related to the integral of the current with respect to time; this gives the total charge. So if there was little charge to begin with, or the circuit only lasted a brief time, then little charge and therefore little energy was transferred.</p>
<p>This of course was assuming a DC setup, AC is quite different analytically since there are things like impedance and reactance.</p>
<p>Edit: fixed the expression for relating current to velocity of charged particle</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I completely agree with your response,  but I have a small nitpick about the cosmic ray. Im not sure where you got the formula I = q/v. I havent seen that before, and Q/v is usually equal to capacitance in Farads. It doesn't make sense that the current would be inversely proportional to the charged particles velocity. </p>
<p>I have always seen I = Q/t in which case Q would be on the order of 10^(-19)  (assuming its an electron or proton) where as t would be, like you said, your height divided by the speed. For simplicity if we assumed a height of 3m and the speed if light (3x10^8), we would have 10^-8. So the current would be on the order of pico amps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my mistake, you're right. I meant Q•v/d I wanted to highlight the time scale is related to the velocity but fudged the relationship. </p></div>		</li>
