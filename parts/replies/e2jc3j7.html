			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at an animal hospital that had a shop cat with Klinefelter syndrome. &quot;His&quot; name was Crazy Kline, and had male genitalia, but tortoiseshell coloring. Only 1 in 3000 male cats are tortoiseshell, and most of them are XXY. That cat was a nut bar, but really sweet. He was sterile, so never got neutered, and never did any territory marking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to your point, actually about 80% of developing fetuses with an extra 21 chromosome die during development. If born, only 13, 18, 21 X and Y extra chromosome are compatible with life.  An extra 16 chromosome is the most common trisomy but always results in death in utero. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding a comment not worth top-level:</p>
<p>Humanity has evolved to use a pair of 23 chromosomes, 46 in total. <strong>Any</strong> abnormality here causes problems. The question &quot;why does an extra 21 cause Down&quot; is sort of like asking &quot;why does having a third leg cause my pants not to fit&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I guess you're right.</p>
<p>I didn't even think of that, and went straight to explaining the 'how?' instead of the 'why?'. And they didn't even ask for the 'how?'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what makes me wonder how plants and other creatures managed to undergo full genome duplication <em>and have it be a beneficial thing</em>. Not only that, but a genome duplication precludes that individual from reproducing, so how does that kind of thing even stick around past the first generation?</p></div>		</li>
