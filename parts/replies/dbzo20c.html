			<div class="markdown"><p>Thou and thee were actually informal pronouns in the old English language. Whereas you was the formal pronoun. You addressed people, who were superior to you, with you and inferior people with thou. Records show that thou and thee were also used as insults during some time. </p>
<p>When it became unclear who belonged to an upper class and who was actually addressable with thou, people stopped using thou and thee as a try to not accidentally insult anyone. </p>
<p>I'm not too sure about German. However, in German we use the formal form (Sie and Ihnen) for superiors and older people, who are at least 16. It is not in any form restricted by classes. Mostly, there isn't any confusion on whether or not to use it. If the person is over 16 and you both haven't agreed to address each other informally, you use the formal pronoun. Thus, a confusion is seldom and there is no real chance to insult the other person with it, making it easy to distinguish between informal and formal. </p>
<p>Hope that I was able to help. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Around the time of the King James Bible and Shakespeare. </p>
<p>For King James Bible, 'thou' was used for God to emphasize that God is singular and personal.</p>
<p>Religious groups like Quakers called each other &quot;thou&quot; to show their familiarity/brotherhood/lack of respect for class distinctions.</p>
<p>But at the time, the tide was turning against this informal/singular term of address. Maybe having religious folk pointedly using an old-fashioned phrase is a good way to rush a word into the past!</p></div>		</li>
