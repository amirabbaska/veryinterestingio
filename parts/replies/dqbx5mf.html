			<div class="markdown"><p>i feel the same. the number of questions and things turned their head upset me when the concept of emergent consciousness dawned on me, but the more i thought about it the more amazing it (and we as conscious beings) became. also given the evidence for evolution souls just don't fit. i think one has to be able to prove when souls evolved or, perhaps, attached.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that the model for emergent consciousness was universally agreed upon by pretty much everybody when I was in middle school. At the time, though, I believed that there was something called “life” which I guess was some sort of spiritual energy that could be measured with instruments that haven’t been invented yet. “We’re detecting two life forms on the planet captain.”</p>
<p>Then in college I realized rather suddenly there is no need for such animating energy; that life is just chemical activity in cells; that our lives end when our consciousness does because our neurons can no longer function.  It seemed so simple and obvious that I felt foolish for believing anything but. It’s been twenty years and I can’t find another solution to the mind/brain problem.</p>
<p>However; there have been several clear incidents in my life that I can only explain with the presupposition that the mind can exist without a physical brain or the equivalent.</p>
<p>I cannot ignore this evidence, and I have been struggling for many years to justify these conflicting points of view.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The non-existence of free will actually makes more sense than any kinds of souls or spirits. But for survival, i think it's better that people think they have agency over their actions. We're very likely to be in some sort of simulation anyways. </p>
<p>Even though it seems like we are doing free decisions, those decisions are still the result of us taking in information, processing it within our own frameworks and acting accordingly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue for a middle ground, which is that we lack free will but possess agency. As creatures, we are free to exert our will on the environment. I am free to choose to eat ice cream for dinner. This is agency. If I decide to do something, I am able to execute the thought into an action. </p>
<p>However, I lack the ability to actually make the initial decision. I can eat ice cream for dinner (agency), but I didn't actually choose to choose ice cream (free will). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great question I think. I think you are getting close to a thing called panpsychism. The belief that everything no matter how complex is somewhat conscious. I have a few problems with that belief. </p>
<ol>
<li>If all blood cells neurons and electrons are conscious than what makes my whole brain band together as one conscious thing. Like shouldn't my neurons all have their own separate consciousness. Maybe both systems and the objects making up systems are both individually conscious, and I just happened to be the consciousness of the system. But that brings up my second point.</li>
<li>If all things are conscious than what is the likelihood that you/I would be the consciousness of the most complex species on our planet. There are so many times more bacteria than us. There are like an infinite amount of electrons out there. What is the likelihood I would be the consciousness of one of the most complex data processing machines within the solar system.  </li>

<p>Yes. This is one of the reasons AI is such a hairy topic, morally (once you stop the simulation, have you killed a sentient being? is that morally right?)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if I created a physical computer that operates by me moving physical stones around to represent the operations the computer runs? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still yes, but it would be a really goddamn slow computer.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>If you can create a computational system, you can simulate consciousness.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>No, I don't think so. I'd say you have to execute the algorithm to create consciousness, just like a brain has to be alive to do the same. I'll also add that I don't think consciousness is the result of a single algorithm, at least not in the manner that I understand the word 'algorithm'. It's the result of many processes, but not the result of <em>an</em> algorithm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This line of thinking is totally fascinating to me. The universe is clearly a big computer doing stupendously complex math at every instant. This computer may not have been made by an intelligence set out to make a computer. It may just be the way things are.</p>
<p>Your suggestion that consciousness, and by extension, all of creation, exists because such an algorithm is possible is something I’ve been thinking about a lot and would lend a lot of merit to the postulate of infinite universes. </p>
<p>But who or what is doing all of this calculation? Why does anything exist at all?</p></div>		</li>
