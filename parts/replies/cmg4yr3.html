An ambient temperature of 37 C or lower can feel hot because we need to shed a certain amount of heat at all times, being warm-blooded. Reducing the rate of heat transfer <em>away</em> from our bodies is enough to make us feel hot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that the rate of heat transfer depends not only on the temperature difference between your body and the outside but also the medium that you are touching.</p>
<p>An easy way to grasp the concept is to ask yourself why water around 20C (70F) feels very cold, while air around the same temperature feels comfortable. Further, you stay fairly comfortable for quite a while immersed in water that is just a little below your body temperature, but you would feel hot in that same temperature of air. You can even eventually get hypothermia in water the same temperature as air in which you might overheat on a calm day.</p>
<p>The key to the difference is how good a <em>conductor</em> of heat the medium is. Your metabolism releases significant heat (in fact, the chemical reactions in a given volume of your body release substantially more heat than the fusion reactions in an equal volume of the Sun's core).</p>
<p>Water is a much better conductor of heat than air. Still air in particular is a good insulator.  If you are in microgravity, where warm air doesn't have a particular direction to &quot;rise&quot; in, you can <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=astronauts+sleep+air+warm" target="_blank">get quite hot just by being still</a>. Your body warms a bubble of air around you that takes a long time to diffuse into the wider environment. You do the same thing when you put on clothes or a blanket: you're placing a barrier between the air that you have heated and the rest of the air.</p>
<p>By contrast, in water -- even fairly still water with a fairly modest temperature difference from you -- heat will be rapidly wicked away from your body. That's why you can eventually get hypothermia in water that is 20C / 70F -- your rate of production can't match the rate of loss.  A high enough loss rate will give you the &quot;sensation&quot; of cold, so touching 17C air and 17C water will give you different sensations.</p>
<p>Most metals are also very good conductors of heat. This also helps us understand why touching a metal object in a comfortable room feels very cold. The metal is at room temperature, so it's the same temperature as the wooden table it's sitting on. You're significantly hotter than both of them. But when you touch the table, the rate at which you transfer heat to it and warm it up is quite low, and you are mostly just heating the surface where you are touching. But when you put your hand against the metal, your body heat is quickly conducted all the way through the object. So not only do you initially transfer more heat, but also the surface you touch stays at the same relatively cool temperature as the rest of the metal object, so it continues to be &quot;ready&quot; to accept more heat from your hand. </p>
<p>It's kind of like someone giving you a bunch of boxes to hold. If you're some atoms at the surface of a block of wood, you kind of just have to pile them up in your arms, and eventually the person has to give up trying to stack more on you.  If you're some atoms at the surface of a hunk of metal, you can quickly take the first box and pass it back to the guy behind you, then accept the second box and pass it back, and so forth. It's only when everybody behind you has several boxes in their hands already that it starts to become difficult for the &quot;donor&quot; to put more in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mechanical Engineering PhD student here with a concentration in heat transfer.  This post is full of some really glaring mistakes.  It is not a simple conduction problem.
When you are in a room full of air or a pool full of water, the dominant mechanism of heat transfer off the skin is (natural) convection.  When you are in contact with a solid such as a metal or wood table, the dominant mechanism is conduction.  Conduction can be roughly characterized by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_diffusivity" target="_blank">thermal diffusivity</a>, which a higher number equating to more heat being pulled from the surface.  Copper has a value of about 111mm^2/s, and wood just 0.082mm^2/s, which means a copper table will pull heat away from your hand significantly faster than a wood table, making it feel cold.
When it comes to convection, whether in a room or pool, things get a bit more complicated.  Assuming forced convection dominates, the governing constant would be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusselt_number" target="_blank">Nusselt number</a>, which is the ratio of convective to conductive heat transfer at the boundary.  The constant for convection (h) is generally pulled from a table of experimentally determined values.  For a given flow velocity, the value is much higher for water than air.  This is due to the higher specific heat, conduction, density, and viscosity of water.  So given the same conduction value at the skins surface, the Nusselt number and convective heat transfer coefficient will be higher.  Note this is for forced convection, where as natural convection relies on a totally different set of constraints to find the Nusselt number.<br />
So to answer OP's question, it depends on several different characteristic differences between water and air, but the largest would have to be density and specific heat.  Because water is so much more dense than air and can store more heat per unit mass, it is able to pull more heat away from the surface of the skin.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>In practice, that would not be what happened. The evaporation of the sweat on the skin surface would keep the skin temperature below ambient, while maintaining heat transfer from the person to the environment.</p>
<p>Only high humidity or excessive temperatures would overcome this system.</p></div>		</li>
