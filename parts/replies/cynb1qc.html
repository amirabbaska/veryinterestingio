<p>A webpage is actually hundreds of websites that needs to be accessed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, not really hundreds of websites, but hundreds of different resources. I don't think the usual website uses anywhere near 100 other websites. Most likely it'll use some librairies of code from Google and stuff like that, but most of the resources are from the same 'website'. </p>
<p>It's more like:</p>
<p>Your browser: &quot;Hey web server, give me the home page&quot;</p>
<p>The server: &quot;Here's the HTML of the home page&quot;</p>
<p>Your browser, while reading the HTML: &quot;Hey website, I need this CSS file&quot;, &quot;Hey website, I need this picture&quot;, &quot;Hey website, I need this JavaScript file&quot;, etc etc... Each of these is a different request / connection to a web server.</p>
<p>Then, it's possible that the browser will need other resources coming from the CSS and JavaScript execution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been wondering about this... Wouldn't it be faster for the server to send every file used in the requested home page along with the home page? The server knows what the home page requires, so why would it wait for things to be requested one by one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the best response in the thread so far. The basics of it are that web browsers and websites use a connection protocol called TCP, and most games use a connection protocol called UDP, and there are certain benefits of each that make them well suited for different kinds of uses. If anyone is interested in doing a little further reading, HowToGeek has a pretty good article on how they work and the differences between them: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/190014/htg-explains-what-is-the-difference-between-tcp-and-udp/" target="_blank">http://www.howtogeek.com/190014/htg-explains-what-is-the-difference-between-tcp-and-udp/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to really geek out, there's <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131781/the_internet_sucks_or_what_i_.php?print=1" target="_blank">this</a> long article by the <em>X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter</em> multiplayer programmers. Basically, they tried originally using TCP (protocol used for web pages) and found that it was too slow to work. What was happening was that if the player didn't get everything <em>exactly</em> how the server sent it (and vice versa) the whole package was dropped and they would try again. </p></div>		</li>
