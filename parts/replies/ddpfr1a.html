			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty much the same as having someone do your taxes though, and the IRS/State Agencies from my experience prefer to spend time collecting debts. The revenue officers are unlikely to do any form of tax prep (although I had one experience where one prepared one of their past clients they already closed) as most seem to be wanting to clear their case load asap.</p>
<p>The State though? Fuck them. They really enjoy just collecting money without following through on anything. I've worked on a few cases recently where we would send in an OIC and they would just start garnishing wages. </p></div>		</li>

<p>They wouldn't have to have a person do it though, it can be pretty much all automated.</p>
<p>Here in Canada they've introduced an auto fill option for taxes where whatever program you use will sync up with the CRA website and view what forms are on file and fill your tax return that way</p></div>		</li>
