			<div class="markdown"><p>No, its that way by definition. When we say the size of the <strong>observable</strong> universe, we mean the farthest we can <em>see</em>. The farther we see, the more back in time we look, and the fartherst we can look back in time is to shortly after the big bang.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What does that have to do with the mass of the observable universe though? </p>
<p>Edit: I think you confused the radius of the Schwarzschild radius of all mass in the observable universe with the radius of the observable universe itself. However that isn't even correct, the radius is 45.7 billion ly because of the expansion of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The observable universe actually has a radius currently which significantly exceeds 13.7 billion lightyears.  This is because objects which we.  The real radius of the <em>observable</em> universe is 46.6 billion lightyears.  However, this only sets a lower bound on the size of the universe.  It's only the part that we can see from our vantage point.  It could in fact be spatially infinite. The Schwarzschild radius calculation is based on the observable universe, however.</p></div>		</li>
