			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's still an active area of research, but it's possible that both reactions are going on.</p>
<p>Milk has proteins making Maillard possible (unlike plain sugar) and the cooking happens at a low temperature (optimal for Maillard, low for caramelization). But there's a chance that both reactions are happening simultaneously.</p>
<p>Anyway, I did mention that simultaneously you can get both reactions with similar colour/flavour results on the same base. My hunch is that Dulce de leche is one such case where both happen.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for plain sugar, there is a clear distinction which has to be maintained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no easy way to do this because the top comment is wrong. Browning of meat doesn't happen because of the same reason as the browning of sugar.</p>
<p>It's better to be right and descriptive than wrong and simple. Maybe the snarky commenters here could actually help instead of being snarky.</p></div>		</li>
