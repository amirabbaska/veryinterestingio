			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! This is for my daughters 5th grade science fair project.  We have been reading and there are so many scientific articles on ocean affecting the weather and weather within the ocean and we think the air current compared to water currents is really cool and it being affected by the temperature near the poles and equator is really interesting. We are trying to figure out how to gather as much information as possible about it and put it as simply as we can for her presentation.  We will continue to read up on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you can compare some of the major ocean currents like the Gulf Stream to major air currents like the Jet Stream? How these are important to Earthâ€™s climate, travel, etc? Would make a nice visual if nothing else.</p>
<p>I hope someone else here can offer you more details!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to see the importance of the GULF STREAM ....you can just compare the average temperature and weather from the UK with that in Newfoundland.        Both at almost the same latitude... getting about the same amount of sunlight.....</p></div>		</li>
