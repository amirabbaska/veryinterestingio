There was rifting, as evidenced by Valles Marineris, but not much evidence of subduction zones AFAIK. It's possible that Mars never had enough hydrous rock, even back when the interior was hotter and more active, to have had much tectonic activity. Perhaps it's smaller size meant it didn't have enough gravity for there to be enough pressure for subduction, especially without a hydrous mantle. It's possible Mars' interior just wasn't ever hot and wet enough.</p>
<p>Other posters have pointed out that while an ocean by itself doesn't mean plate tectonics will happen, hydrous rock has a lower melting point and can't support as much stress as anhydrous rock. Both of those help with melting rock in subduction zones and keeping the mantle molten.</p>
<p>It would make sense that the presence of long term liquid water oceans would help, or at least be an indicator that a given planet has a lot of water in the mantle and crust.</p>
