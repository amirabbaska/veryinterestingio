			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the occipital cortex needs to have vision input early in life to organize correctly. Hooking it up later would be like expecting a person to understand a foreign language with no instruction, and no way to learn it (yet).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well to be fair when you first open your eyes after being born, your occipital cortex also hasn't exactly been organized yet. The question is - is it harder to organize the occipital cortex later in life, and if so, what makes it harder? For example, is it possible that after years of little use, parts of the cortex have been co-opted into processing other functions, leaving less of the cortex available for visual input processing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, the OC starts organizing even before the eyes open. With MRI studies it's shown the brain produces waves of activation to start to organize the area.
Neuroplasticity decay will definitely make organizing it harder with age. Definitely regions will have been assigned to other purposes, often auditory if I remember right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that is exactly what happens. We are born with all the neurons we will ever have – in fact, more than we require. The current dogma is that the infant brain is characterised by remarkable plasticity, which allows it to adapt to any environment in which it may find itself – e.g., infants' ability to pick up multiple languages, etc.
As the child grows, the synaptic connections which are not used will degenerate, while those which are used strengthen (pruning, or &quot;experience-dependent plasticity&quot;, which underpins Hebbian theory). But we are not programmed with the need to learn how to adapt our brains to our sensory world later in life – ideally this should have been done in our developmental years. Nonetheless, an element of plasticity remains and is demonstrable in later life, particularly in those notable studies mentioned above emphasising the role of fluoxetine and BDNF (e.g., Vetencourt et al, 2008).
This applies to the visual cortex too. The visual inputs occurring early in life determine the use-dependent organisation of our visual cortex, (1) firstly to ensure that both eyes have equal contribution to the inputs, which is important for depth perception, etc., and (2) to ensure that the visual cortex functions properly! This underpins why doctors are so obsessed with making sure that we correct congenital cataracts and strabismus (lazy eye) where possible, to avoid the risk of amblyopia (&quot;brain blindness&quot; despite a normally-functioning eye, due to loss of the brains' receptivity to inputs from that eye)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes what makes it harder is that it hasn't been sitting around doing nothing in the meantime. It will have been co-opted for some other task and/or pruned away due to inactivity.</p></div>		</li>
