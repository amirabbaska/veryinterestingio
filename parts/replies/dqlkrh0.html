			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had a thought about time dilation. Let's assume a person lives their entire life in extreme gravity, and another person on earth. I understand that the person on earth will die earlier assuming both persons were born at the same time. However, the person living in extreme gravity won't live to be older in years, right? The &quot;biological clock&quot; is the same no matter where you are, it's just that relative to earth, time goes slower im extreme gravity? These 2 persons would have zero difference of the human experience assuming every other factor than gravity was the same? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. You always experience time in your own reference frame the same way. Only when relative to another does their time appear faster or slower </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what would happen if you have a small concentrated field of extreme gravity that dillutes the time near it, what would, for example, happen if you put your hand in it. The hand would experience time in a different reference. Would your blood start to get stuck or what could be the consequences? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ants look like they're always moving fast. If we were the same size as ants and we still saw time pass by as normal, if we came across giant people, would they experience time the same way as us and see us as running around quickly and will we see them move slower?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the person living in extreme gravity lives in a Hyperbolic Time Chamber on earth with a window that looks into &quot;normal&quot; earth spacetime. He would see that time moves faster on the outside. If there was a clock on the outside he would see it tick faster. While the people outside of that chamber would see that time in the chamber passes slower.</p>
<p>If there was no window that person in the chamber wouldn't know that times passes slower relatively to earth time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they are causally disconnected from our universe. Comparing rates of time requires something with which to compare. Beyond the event horizon (and certain basic properties like mass, charge, and angular momentum) there is nothing we have access to with regards to the black hole for us to use as a comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What we know of as &quot;time&quot; ends at the event horizon (&quot;schwarzschild radius&quot;) of a black hole. As you travel further and further towards it, spacetime gets warped more and more due to its gravitational effects, slowing down time and ultimately bending spacetime so stark that time stops progressing at all. This is the exact point from whereon you cannot escape a black hole anymore; because you'd need time to do the work necessary to move yourself away from it - but there is no time for you to do that work anymore.</p>
<p>Everything that happens inside the event horizon is unknowable to us. We have absolutely no observation/evidence for what's happening in there due to obvious reasons. Some theories even go as far as saying that time and space is reversed inside, but those are unproven (and probably unprovable) and mind-bending thought experiments.</p>
<p>But I'm very much looking forward to studying black hole mergers. That will probably be the most we will ever be able to find out about these things, at least in the foreseeable technological future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You said that time ceases to exist inside a black hole. I wonder if black holes are literally the end of our universe or the edge it since time ceases to exist inside of black holes. Kind of like how some people say the universe might be donut shaped. Perhaps the black holes are the holes in the donut and the donut has billions of holes (from billions of black holes). Hope that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another question, when approaching a black hole, the rate at which time progresses approaches 0. So if a reference frame approaches a black hole the external universe would begin to progress extremely &quot;fast&quot;. However it's predicted most forms of matter will decompose in the far future, what would be observed near a black hole as the external universe rockets into the relative future and decomposes?</p></div>		</li>
