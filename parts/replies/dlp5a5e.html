			<div class="markdown"><p>From our current perspective, a small fly is quick and difficult to snatch out of the air. But what if we shrunk ourselves down the the size of the fly? Would we still perceive the fly to be moving very fast? Or would our perspective of the fly change and seem to move slower? From this new perspective, would normal sized people seem to be moving in slow motion like giants in a movie? </p>
<p>Since photons are massless, does this mean that the photons don't experience any time? If you're a photon observing the world, you're so small and moving so fast that everything is almost at a complete stand-still, right? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photons are just particles, so they can't &quot;experience&quot; anything (yes, I'm being shallow AND pedantic).  That being said, time doesn't really exist for a photon.  From the photon's perspective it is absorbed as soon as it is emitted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Are you able to give me an explanation of how from the photon's perspective it is absorbed as soon as it is emitted? Sounds fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We see flies as moving quickly because they move very fast relative to their body size/mass. But they still move about the same speed as most other things in the world. Once you really get down to it, most things in the world can move somewhere between 3 and 15 metres per second, and that is a pretty big difference, one is 5 times the other, it's still pretty close considering that some things can move as fast as a car, or as slow as a snail. Hans can move as fast as a fly, faster probably, but we don't have the same relative speed as them, moving at exactly the same speed, let's say 3m/s, a fly might move over 300 body lengths, whilst we're in the order of ~15 (assuming  a max of 20cm chest depth)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually a photon would exist sans time. It would experience it's entire existence at the same time, so to speak.</p>
<p>I heard a theory that every photon is just the same photon at a different point along it's lifetime. Or maybe I made it up years ago, since I can't find the original source. If anyone could, I would appreciate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great reply, and thanks for the link! Whether or not this is what the OP meant by his/her post, this is certainly how I interpreted the title and what I came here wanting to find out!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for posting this. Literally yesterday I was wondering if part of the reason dogs get so excited when their owners come home from work could be that time &quot;feels&quot; slower to them, so a normal work day is really long for them.</p></div>		</li>
