In video form you take on the view of an outsider to everything happening and lose some of the details that may have been noteworthy. Your brain doesn't have to work hard or use any imagination. Since the video keeps playing it also leaves you with less time to process what happened mentally &amp; emotionally.
I think books are like life in slow motion where you can see what is going on better to predict future actions in real life.</p></div>		</li>
