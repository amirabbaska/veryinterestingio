			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe that's why it's also helpful to understand something  when you look at it from different angles. Having multiple views would allow us to single out discrepancies and have a larger view of what is actually true about the situation. Definitely something for me to think about. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I'm having trouble understanding a concept, I often seek out different articles about that concept, because I find that, by looking at different points of view, I'll find that somebody will have described something in just the right way, or used the exact sort of analogy that matches my methods of thought and just blow the concept wide open for me.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Learning is all about context, really. We love to spot patterns, and to relate new information to old information. Which is why we like daft analogies. &quot;You understand how X works, now Y works in the same way, but with wires instead of blood vessels&quot;. It makes more sense to us with that explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense. It's losing the assumption and recognizing a pattern. It applies in music, math, linguistics and art. Once you see the pattern you can't unsee it. But to do that you need to start by looking at it all and seeing nothing. </p>
<p>I speak several languages, and the aha moments in putting together your own sentences and recognizing them is not assuming or imposing your own set of rules, and just see what's there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No no this makes a lot of sense. As a musician who has suffered writers block for years. I finally found out how to get around it. You just enter the &quot;flow&quot; state and let the music happen. It's hard to explain but when I'm &quot;in the zone&quot; it's almost as if I turn off certain parts of my brain and just stream my consciousness into the music I'm making.</p>
<p>What you've described is exactly what I've suspected for years. Cognitive &quot;Obstacles&quot; are basically nothing more than preconceptions and expectations. </p>
<p>I'm glad you pieced that together like that. I always knew that...but never actually knew until I read that. Like I always had the pieces of the puzzle but you put them together.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for posting that. </p></div>		</li>
