<p>If you smell a campfire, you are then in turn breathing in large wood particles which are sticky?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you breathe in particles of smoke when you're near open fires. It is hazardous to health but the amount of time most people spend breathing in smoke is negligible in relation to a lifetime. But people who spend a lot of time around open fires or indoor fires which are not flued correctly do end up with higher risk for breathing or other lung problems long term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incidentally... that might have been a bit of the component of sapiens wining out over neanderthals. <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/modern-humans-had-evolutionary-edge-over-neanderthals-because-gene-mutation-helped-us-2397971" target="_blank">Modern Humans Had An Evolutionary Edge Over Neanderthals Because Of Gene Mutation That Helped Us Deal With Toxic Fumes</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Modern humans are the only primates that carry this genetic mutation that potentially increased tolerance to toxic materials produced by fires for cooking, protection and heating,” the researchers from the Pennsylvania State University said in a statement. “The mutation may have offered ancient humans a sweet spot in effectively processing some of these toxins — such as dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons — compared to other hominins.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really wood particles as much as it is a bunch of random chemical compounds that were created due to incomplete combustion. Some of them smell delicious to us, some smell horrible. But there are tons and tons of them as burning wood, or really just about anything, in a natural way like a campfire, is extremely inefficient and results in a lot of different intermediate compounds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There really aren't that many different chemicals when it is wood. However, most of what you smell IS small wood particles that haven't burned. Start burning anything else though and you are 100% correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. It's a product of partial combustion and the un-combusted material vaporizes, but only due to the high tempst of the fire. When they cool down (on you and your clothes) they stick bc they are large greasy hydrocarbons.</p></div>		</li>
