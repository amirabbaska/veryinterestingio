<p>Pre and Post-Industrialization, Slavery and Immigration - This is controversial, but the use of slaves on a <em>massive, commercial</em> operation was something that almost all nations in question enjoyed, but one nation excelled at it.  The level of innovation and institutionalization of slavery in the US was second to none.  While it is a particularly sensitive subject, it is without a doubt that the contribution of slave labor placed the US at an incredible competitive advantage, coupled with our isolation from Europe and Asia.  Further, the industrialization that occurred in the US was, and still is a marvel.  However, just like slavery, it was done at the expense of the poor and immigrants.  Yet, in spite of all of this, the US would eventually become the number one economic force thanks to all of the above factors.  </p>
</li>

<p>Science and Technology - The advancement of not only education but also the establishment of regions of the US as technological centers has been and continues to be one of the most critical driving forces in our economic might.  Europe had the monopoly of academic prestige for far longer than the US had even existed at the time of our great academic boom.  Other nations had realized the same advantage, however, authoritarian regimes are naturally ill at ease when it comes to having an educated public.  Also, it is no secret that US technological advancements were enhanced by foreigners who were looking to make it big here in the US.  This trend continues to this day.  Our focus on innovation is, as with many of these other aspects, enhanced by our geography, natural resources, and much more importantly, our education system.  If we want to continue our dominance, we absolutely have to focus on the latter two things, which we have enjoyed in far excess of what our neighbors have.</p>
</li>
<li>Military Presence - Contrary to popular belief in the US, our military was not the massive juggernaut it is today.  In fact, for the majority of our history, our military has simply paled in comparison to the European Powers.  However, we enjoyed something that was much greater than what any military could provide (at that time), geographic and political isolation.  However, the one constant in our militaristic endeavors was our sense of innovation.  The American Civil war was a brutal wake up call not only to the US but to the world.  Foreign (European) observers failed to convey the sheer magnitude and gravity of &quot;modern warfare&quot; and were doomed by it in their regional conflicts leading up to and including the early years of WWI.  While it isn't true that the US stayed on top of innovation throughout that time (we were arguably under-prepared for WWII), but rather our ability to innovate <em>during</em> warfare and our massive industrial might ensured that we could not only win, but we can project our power during peacetime to pursue our own economic interests.  Meanwhile, regional fighting in Central and South America prevented such a military-industrial complex to emerge on anywhere near the same scale as in the US.  For example, (not meant to be mean in any way), the US has a tank force of around 8,000 M1 Abrams variants, whereas Paraguay has 8-10 M4 Shermans as their tank force.  The disparity is an indicator of just how all of the above factors can catapult one nation so far ahead of another.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these explanations I have listed are incredibly superficial and sugar-coated.  In reality, the US dominance compared to our neighbors and the rest of the world is a mix of natural properties, exploitation, progress, regression, culture, counter-culture, and most importantly, luck and the wisdom of our leaders and the general public to understand the differences in the above.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>  US started with immense natural resources and a great strategic location.  It was capitalized upon by socioeconomic ideals that promoted growth, often at the expense of exploitation of others, protected by its location and subsequently powerful military projection, in the midst of a malleable political ideology (representative democracy) from very early on in our national history.  Compared to the rest of her neighbors and despite incidents such as the Civil War, the US has enjoyed a stable but also explosive rise during industrialization and arguably even during the slavery era.  In modern times, the US is a beacon that draws technological experts from around the globe and is a hotbed of innovation.  The contribution of immigrants, including the initial colonists, cannot be overlooked as a factor in the US's ability to understand, manipulate, and ultimately control many aspects of not only her governance, but the world around her.  </p></div>		</li>
