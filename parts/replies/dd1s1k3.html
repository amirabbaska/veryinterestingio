			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a specific scene in the T-Rex attack that is a perfect illustration of the mix of CGI and puppets.  Within the same shot without cutting away, the puppets head is seen from looking out the front of jeep.  The puppets head is lifted out of the shot, and the CGI Rex body is seen walking away from the jeep.  Your eyes tell you it's tangible when it's up close, then your mind is taken seemlessly into the CGI body.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for post this. I was aware of what was happening in the T Rex scene like I explained. But I hadn't actually noticed that particular transition before. It's super subtle. The camera dips right below the frame of the car and insert CGI T Rex. They worked so hard to make sure you wouldn't notice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except raptors! They had people in raptor suits. Extremely complex, detailed raptor suits. If you can't see the raptors' feet (which didn't work well in the suits) it's probably a human. (Details may be off, I learned this forever ago) </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact it worked wasn't down to the fact they were dimly lit, that was just a good decision, the real dealmaker was that they used puppetry where it produced the best result, and CGI where that was the best . If you've got a close up, or a physical interaction, do it practically and that <em>impression</em> of reality lingers in the mind across to the CG shots (which you can dimly light to help further).</p>
<p>The CGI depended upon the physical puppetry and vice versa to sell the overall effect. If it were either one of them throughout, it would not have worked. Your suspension of disbelief would have been broken on either a close up interaction, or a far off action shot depending on which you didnt use, and the whole movie would have been tainted by it.</p>
<p>TLDR: its not techniques used on either that are the main effect, its where and why you use one to help the other.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I dunno, in Superhero movies you can usually tell when they're suddenly 3D animated, even if they were physical a moment before &amp; after.</p>
<p>e.g. In Spiderman 1, the Goblin jumping off his glider thing right near the end, after throwing Spidey into a building.</p>
<p>Or X Men Apocalypse, where Leggy-McLegs runs along a building and is caught by Angel.</p>
<p>Or Avengers 1, where Cap is suddenly jumping around kicking things and then Ironman reflects a beam off his shield.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a problem with this answer: the very first reveal of dinosaurs in the movie, where Laura Dern's jaw hangs open because she can see what we haven't yet seen. It's in broad daylight, the dinosaurs are on screen for a long time so you can just gape in wonder at them all you want, and it's all CGI.</p>
<p>And it's still excellent 25 year later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but when you want to cheat CGI to hide imperfections you have a lot of options.</p>
<p>Besides using the dark, some of the most common ways to mask details are to add fog / mist: <a href="http://edwardbruce.com/gotbreakdowns/109_024_bf_3262.gif" target="_blank">http://edwardbruce.com/gotbreakdowns/109_024_bf_3262.gif</a></p>
<p>Or some blur mixed with rain / snow / heavy weather (like the T-Rex car scene): <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/af/73/de/af73de25d34046576acfee800f832bd6.jpg" target="_blank">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/af/73/de/af73de25d34046576acfee800f832bd6.jpg</a></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJlmYh27MHg" target="_blank">the first scene that we see dinosaurs</a> the light is almost directly above and being filtered in through the trees. It gives everything a soft and slightly unnatural glow. If you compare [the shot with only the peoples' faces] vs [the shots of the dinosaurs], the faces are crisp but the dinos are always in soft-focus. Soft focus + glow can make anything look more believable if you compose the scene well. (See also the &quot;Barbara Walters soft focus glow&quot; AKA &quot;Gaussian Girl&quot;.) When you get to the shot of the lake, everything is as soft and blurry as a watercolor, and that's more than just atmospheric haze. Nothing in the shot is in focus.</p>
<p>You can spot CGI most easily when you can compare two things directly. But the first dino shot was staged deliberately in a way that doesn't allow that. The characters walk in from the shade of the sparse row of trees, which separates the foreground from the midground, and so any lighting differences between them and the Brachiosaurus are not comparable. The objects are separated by space, scale, and texture too which makes a comparison even harder. </p>
<p>One more thing in Jurassic Park's favor is that nobody had a solid picture in their heads, before the film, of what dinos looked like while moving. Having one CGI human in a room with 5 real humans you'll be able to tell them apart relatively easily. It's not super hard to learn to make a pencil drawing of a human face that looks realistic. But once you can do that it's REALLY REALLY hard to draw somebody famous and have it look realistic. We all know what Tom Hanks looks like so we can spot a bad version of him easily. But would we be able to tell what a slightly wonky dino looked like at the time of JP's first showing?</p>
<p>If you actually just look at the bottom of the dino's back feet the whole time they look a bit awkward. And you can see pretty clearly that the CGI of the front feet doesn't mesh together with the grass. And if you listen to when the dino crashes back to the ground after getting up on its hind legs the sound isn't even synced to the visuals. But these are tiny nitpicky things that I doubt anyone in theaters ever noticed and are still hard to notice. The scene was composed to show that we're dealing with a different scale. We see and hear and feel the scale. And there's so much going on that's done right that it's hard to notice the little details that aren't.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think that's an intentional choice to accentuate the sense of scale. Because light moves so much faster than sound, our brains interpret out of sync sounds in interesting ways.</p>
<p>If you show someone a video with unsynced sound, there's a threshold for how far out of sync it can be before they will notice. If the sound precedes the visual, the threshold is very small, IIRC 5ms. Your brain immediately thinks &quot;there's something wrong here.&quot; But if the sound lags behind the visual cue, the threshold is much larger, something like 150ms before you will even notice. And even if you do notice, it might not seem so egregiously &quot;off.&quot; This is because your brain sees this in nature all the time. If a tree falls in the forest and you watch it from 200 yards away, you'll see it hit the ground before you hear whether or not it makes a sound.</p>
<p>So by lagging the audio for that effect, Spielberg is tricking your brain into thinking &quot;this thing is so far away that the sound takes a noticeable time to reach me, but still big enough to fill this entire movie screen... it must be <em>huge.</em>&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to be watching a different &quot;first reveal&quot; scene! I see no cop-outs or trickery to disguise limitations.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PJlmYh27MHg?t=1m13s" target="_blank">This shot for example</a> seems to me to be beyond criticism. The real actors in the foreground and the dinosaur in the background are not being treated any differently, they're composited into one shot in broad daylight, and it looks perfect. The dinosaur isn't blurred at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PJlmYh27MHg?t=1m24s" target="_blank">Moments later</a> we get another gorgeous composite, dinosaur with trees behind it and in front, and people on the ground overlapping.</p>
<p>It's like they were deliberately giving themselves no room for mistakes and saying &quot;Look how good we are at this shit!&quot; and they really were good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The storytelling here is beautiful.</p>
<p>At this point in the movie,you like the rough around the edges, skeptical archeologist and his sweet wife, you like the rockstar chaos theory guy, you want them to be astonished, YOU want to be astonished, and then the musical score, which has been building throughout starts swelling (ba ba ba bum bmmm) and your heart swells along with it as the impossible dreams of the people we like come true in the most grandiose way.....</p>
<p>This scene works incredibly well on an emotional level. As long as the cgi is not jarring, we will go wth it and let the music float us through. </p>
<p>You are not gaping in wonder at the dinosaurs, you are identifying with the characters you already love (after only 5 minutes or so into the movie). You are cheering them on as they get their hearts desire, as their dreams come true. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is stretching it a bit. Maybe I was already a cynical 20 year old in 1993 but the characters and dialogue in JP always seemed a little cardboard, especially by Speilberg's best standards. Jaws, it ain't.</p>
<p>And that scene really milks the build-up way too long. To the point where Dicky Attenborough whispers &quot;I'll show you,&quot; as if he's about to sensuously whip it out, it's a little nauseating.</p></div>		</li>
