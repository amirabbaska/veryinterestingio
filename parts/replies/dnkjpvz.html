			<div class="markdown"><p>I was taught that decay is probably due to vacuum fluctuations occuring at the boundary of the nucleus; this boundary providing the necessary condition to keep the fluctuation from annihilating itself before it interacts with the nucleus state and catalyses the decay. Of course vacuum fluctuations are truly random, so therefore the decay also is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm, so the second paragraph in the introduction here for spontaneous emission cites the zero-point energy (which is closely related to vacuum or quantum fluctuations): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_emission" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_emission</a></p>
<p>Then if you go to the zero point energy wiki you'll get a bevy of contemporary thinking regarding these things, or, go to the quite unfinished quantum fluctuation wiki page (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation</a>) down the bottom at interpretations you can see it's not uncommon to kick the can down road a bit and make these fluctuations the actual source of quantum 'randomness'. </p>
<p>It was awhile ago, and it's not my field, so I'm unable to point to any specific the-frothing-sea-of-virtual-particles-causes-atomic-decay but it is certainly filed as such in my head. :)</p>
<p>Edit: oh, okay, yeah actually right in here (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay</a>) under 'Theoretical basis of decay phenomena' it talks about quantum fluctuations. Okay cool, so I wasn't going crazy.
