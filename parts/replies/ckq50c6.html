<p>I honestly don't know what I'm talking about, so bear with me when I ask: Isn't there a whole lot of <em>nothing</em> in space? Does that exist?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also a very excellent question.</p>
<p>It is true that space is mostly a vacuum.  But it is not <em>completely</em> empty.  Between the galaxies, the average density is somewhere on the order of one proton (and one electron) per cubic metre.</p>
<p>The thing that puzzles me, though, is that i don't know whether or not space (and/or time) can be said to <em>exist</em>.</p>
<p>An analogy might be the electric field.  There are at least some people would be happy enough to consider the field as an abstract fiction, which is introduced to describe the dynamics of charged particles.  It is a construct; it is disembodied; it does not really 'exist', in the same way as a electron or a photon.  </p>
<p>I do not know whether spacetime should be thought of in the same way: as a useful construct for describing the relations between things.  I am genuinely confounded by the very question!  What would it mean if space <em>really existed</em> compared to if it did not?  I just don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a follow up point on that question, assuming we've decided the electric field exists for our purposes (countervailing philosophy aside), does the field still exist when its value drops to zero.  That is, if matter in the universe has a finite spread (there is some last proton you would pass if you keep flying away forever and some last EM ripple still propagating out from the big bang) does the electric field exist beyond that if its values are all zero.</p>
<p>Alternatively, is it possible that there is a point beyond which the fabric of the field itself doesn't exist? Where its values would simply be undefined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wowowow. I completely disagree with you on the electric field. It isn't just an abstract construct used to make calculations simpler. A couple of examples why not:</p>
<p>Poynting vector which represents the flow of energy in the fields. If the fields are just abstract constructs, how is that energy flowing?</p>
<p>If you have a bunch of E and B field in space, then that space contains energy (as per the E^2B^2 energy density formula). Who says energy says mass - objects will undergo gravitational interaction with it.</p>
<p>Photons are just excitations of the field.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Guys, don't ask questions like this, my brain melted. AGAIN. Does the chair i'm sitting on exist? Intuitive answer is easier than for spacetime. But does the bazillion fundamental particle making up this chair exist ? I mean, beyond the concept of particle ? Then, does the chair really exist beyond the concept of chair ?</p>
<p>IMHO (shouldn't write that here) in science, the main question is: &quot;is it a useful concept?&quot; I think spacetime is a useful concept.</p>
<p>Regarding philosphy, whatever the definition of existence, either spacetime exists or we live in a collective illusion and the question is a nonsense.</p>
<p>But wait, does this illusion exist ?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you define nothing as the absence of everything, than I don't think we can measure &quot;nothing&quot;. Everywhere we look, micro or macro, there is something. In order to measure nothing, there would have to be something, so it's not nothing anymore. It's a container for something.  I'm inclined to say nothing does not exist in the true definition of the word, but also that I have no issue with the concept of nothing, if I just imagine removing everything. That is a very intangible thought, though, and I'm not sure it makes any sense to think it. Seems paradoxical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To people believe they are arguing about whether or not unheard, felled trees made sounds. One contends that the vibrations in the air would carry some distance with or without some sentient observer to take note of them; the other contends that sound is an experiential phenomena which occurs in the brain of sentient creatures with the right machinery for it. If you asked either if there were vibrations in the air, they both agree that there were; if you asked either if there was no experience of hearing by any sentient creature, they would both agree that there was not. And so they are arguing solely about definitions—about language, not the nature of trees or sounds.</p>
<hr />
<p>At one point in our history, great men of thought were very, very concerned over whether or not zero was a number.</p>
<p>The wisest have since come to the conclusion that these great men were caught in a trap of language, arguing about how to reconcile the inconsistencies of their intuitive maps, without ever bothering to consult with the actual terrain of the territory.</p>
<p>The question &quot;does it really exist?&quot; usually <em>isn't</em> meaningless. It has the opposite problem: it aliases together so many different meanings that untangling them can be a great challenge. At root there is no one true meaning to privilege above the others, so the only thing one can do to avoid the trap is to ask what is the hidden query actually being presented (and if there is none, to stop discussion immediately).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome answer, great read. </p>
<p>I tried to ask a question /r/askscience earlier, but never got a reply. I don´t know if this was because the question was too stupid or what, but I´ll try again since you seem to be able to answer a similar question very well.</p>
<p>Are we (or any observer) in the middle of the observable universe? </p>
<p>And some follow ups: Is the redshift equal in all directions? Do we have any clue of wish direction the big bang occurred? Would it be totally wrong to imagine a &quot;event horizon&quot; for the observable universe? Do objects expand outside of the observable universe over time? Can we talk about an edge of the observable universe and if so how far away is it?</p>
<p>Sorry that these questions are kind of bad/dumb, but I think you (or someone else) can still give great answers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just quickly, because i have to go and pretend to do some work for a bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are we (or any observer) in the middle of the observable universe?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Go back to the bit where i talk about two hypothetical clocks.  Recognise that both of them will see themselves to be in the centre of their own observable universes.  Their observeable universes will be slightly different.  </p>
<p>(But what's cool is, because information travels at no faster than the speed of light, no one observer can tell another about anything that lies outside of their own universe -- before the information can travel from one person to another, the previously unknown region will become observable to the second observer.  I may not have explained this super well, but think about it; it's awesome.)</p>

<p>The cosmological redshift is the same in all directions.  There is also a Doppler component to the redshift, which comes from the fact that our galaxy is moving with respect to other local-ish structures, and with respect to the CMB.  Reading the wiki <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift" target="_blank">entry on redshift</a> might help make this clearer.</p>
<p>The big bang was not localised.  Take the current expansion, and play it backwards.  Consider the distance between two points; it will get smaller and smaller.  Keep playing the expansion backwards.  All distances continue to get smaller.  Eventually, the distance between any -- every -- two points becomes zero.  This is what we refer to as the singularity. It is the situation where the concept of space ceases to have meaning: all matter in the universe occupies the same space.  </p>
<p>This is what is meant by 'the big bang happens everywhere'.</p>
<p>Hope that helps?  I will try to check in again a bit later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>could it be that, that since the singularity, galaxies have been shrinking instead moving away from each other? that the overall space that the observable universe occupies hasnt been expanding since the big bang, but has remained constant and only seems to be expanding due to us shrinking? and that the singularity was when everything was so big nothing could move and what we have conceptualized as the big bang was actually just the beggining of motion due to enough shrinking creating at least a little room to move. and since everything would have been rubbing up against each other there woulda been tremendous friction which would explain why we've conceptualized the beggining of our universe as a very volatile time and that lasted i guess until everything was small enough to move freely without bumping each other. or at least less and less as &quot;time&quot; went on</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in other words, there is no point of origin in space where the Big Bang started because that singularity was never &quot;in&quot; any space of it's own. The singularity <em>was</em> space, which now makes it difficult to imagine what is beyond our universe because there is no thing or &quot;space outside of our space&quot; that we can measure or know about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But we have assumed the universe is infinite.  So with the big bang theory, the universe must be finite because at some point between being infinitely big, and immeasurably small to the point of a singularity, it must have had a finite size.  How can it go from finite to infinite?</p>
<p>It has been previously said that all space is expanding at the same rate.  Are you implying that this includes or excludes the space outside of the observable universe?  If it does then we can logically say that even the space outside of the observable universe was so contracted during the big bang that it was also included in the singularity, thus measurable at some point.</p>
<p>This leads to the question of how did this space outside of the observable universe expand after the big bang exist without any observable matter in it?  Or can we conclude the space outside of the observable universe is actually a void with nothing?  But then how can the observable universe expand into nothing?</p>
<p>Love these topics.  Makes me really think.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We are, <em>by definition</em>, at the centre of the observable universe. The observable universe is defined as &quot;the part of the universe we are able to observe from Earth&quot;. </p>
<p>An analogy would be to stand on an open flat piece of land and look around. Everywhere you look, you see the land stretching out to the horizon, beyond which you can't see any more land. You're at the centre of a circle of observable land. </p>
<p>Now, move 1 kilometre in any direction and look around again. What do you see? The same thing: land stretching out to the horizon. And you can see the same distance to the horizon as before. You're at the centre of a circle of observable land. But... it's a <em>different</em> circle of observable land, because what you can see is always centred on where you are. </p></div>		</li>
