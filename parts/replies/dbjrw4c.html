<p>Film doesn't have a fixed resolution like video does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More specifically, the resolution of film is determined by the grain-structure of the photochemicals embedded within the strip.  These grains are an order of magnitude finer than the pixels used in digital video display, which means they scale up to larger sizes with less granular distortion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't--that's probably the result of either a bad print, and some films only survive in prints that are in pretty bad shape. Or it could possibly be a cinematographic choice on the part of the filmmakers, such as using a netting or glimmer glass filter on the lens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always interpreted the resolution of analogue formats like film to be the smallest size of object or detail (in mm or whatever the appropriate unit would be) that can be resolved in the image - much like how resolution works in microscopy, rather than simply the amount of pixels like in a digital image. Never came to the thought that this would be governed by how coarse/fine the grain structure of the film material is. Very interesting titbit, Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a mixture of both.  Any high-quality films produced this side of ~1960 will be available in sufficiently fine grains that you run into diffraction limits with the optics before grain size becomes a serious issue.</p></div>		</li>

<p>ISO value used (the lower the number, the better)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good explanation, but one minor clarification on this line.  The ISO value is basically the speed in which the film can capture the image.  The lower the number, the slower, but better quality.  So this only works when there is LOTS of light (outside in sunlight or a brightly lite soundstage) and slow moving action.  Once scenes get dimmer and/or faster, a higher ISO is needed, but that comprises image quality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.  I wouldn't go as far as to say &quot;look like crap&quot;.  Early digital film was 1080p only.  In fact, Episode 2 was the first major film to be entirely digital.  The best digital camera at the time could only do 1080p.  So, we'll never see a &quot;proper&quot; 4K release of Attack of the Clones.</p>
<p>Doesn't mean we won't see 'em, though.  They can still upconvert the video to 4K and possibly produce a better result than what home equipment will when upscaling a 1080p bluray at real time.</p>
<p>e: Also, I'd like to add, resolution is probably one of the least important aspects to video quality with digital video.  The codec used to compress is far, far more important when it comes to buying a retail disc and bit rate is equally important when you're considering streaming/downloading (Netflix and the like often bit-starve their videos).  DVD and BluRay use two entirely different codecs.  All else being equal, the codec on BluRay (h264) will beat out DVD (MPeG2) anyday.  h264 is on its way out the door in favor of h265.  So there's still technically room for improvement when it comes to quality until they just give us the raw video.</p>
<p>In other words, I would probably take an SD resolution video in h264 over an HD resolution video of MPEG2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently watched Blu-ray of Yojimbo and Fistful of Dollars. Yojimbo had no artifacting or grain at all, Fistful had tons, especially in the sky and solid colors like buildings. I actually was so impressed by the quality of the Blu-ray master of Yojimbo I am thinking of finding some other B&amp;W films to watch on Blu-ray.</p>
<p>If any of the older stuff is released in a 4k format, I will watch those too. I have a 4K monitor that I bought for gaming, and I still haven't seen a single 4K feature length film on it.</p>
<p>Then again I have 5mbit, so there is probably content I couldn't watch right now</p></div>		</li>
