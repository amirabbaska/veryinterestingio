Anxiety does not remodel the cardiovascular system, it only increases perfusion pressure. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd measured my heart rate during a panic attack and it's somewhere between 65 BPM (so at rest) and 150 BPM, but typically above 90 BPM.  Given my resting heart rate is 50 BPM, that's kinda high.  It's not at rest though; it should be at rest.</p>
<p>There's a reason people tend to fall asleep after a panic attack.  It's exhausting.</p></div>		</li>
