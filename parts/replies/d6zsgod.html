<p>I watched the entirety of the &quot;Gravity is an Illusion&quot; video, and god damn, do they butcher the science on it.  If you already have a half-decent understand of what they're talking about, you can piece together what they mean to say, but it's such a poor presentation that I'm sure most people viewing it come away with more misunderstandings than they had before hand.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  No, gravity is not an illusion.  <strong>Frame of Reference</strong> is an illusion.  Those are not synonyms.</p></div>		</li>
