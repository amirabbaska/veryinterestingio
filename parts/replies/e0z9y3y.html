<p>A huge cause of headaches is sleep apnea due to a reduced ability to supply the brain with oxygen while sleeping. Is it possible you have sleep apnea?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to add to this, when you are extremely sleep deprived (such during something like finals weeks), you can experience REM Rebound and enter REM sleep (deep sleep) not just immediately, but also have longer REM cycles than normal. When your body is deprived of sleep, it will try its best to restore chemical balance in the brain the moment it can and as quickly as it can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how sleep-deprived new moms manage to function. Seriously, my fitness tracker claims that I spend ~40-50% of sleep time in deep sleep. AFAIK it's ~20% for normal adults.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>rem is not deep sleep, it's more similar to light sleep with respect to brain activity it's actually even closer to wakefulness than light sleep, so if you wake from a rem phase you're usually not groggy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but there's no harm in taking a longer nap if you have the time and aren't going to immediately need to do anything.</p>
<p>That grogginess is sleep inertia. It's harmless and goes away. You still got your REM and should be better rested. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering about this because I have narcolepsy so I hit deep sleep extremely quickly. Naps still help me though after the initial grogginess wears off. </p>
<p>Is the &quot;avoid deep sleep&quot; just to avoid that grogginess when you wake up? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many times, if I take a nap I'll wake up on my own about 1.5 hours after falling asleep without much grogginess.  If I wake up in the middle of a dream, or something wakes me, I'm groggy for 20 minutes or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, your right but I guess in the context of talking about naps we’re assuming that people don’t want/don’t have the time for a nice long nap. </p></div>		</li>
