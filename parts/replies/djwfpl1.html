			<div class="markdown"><p>the two plates of India and Asia collided and pushed up the Himalayan range - including the tallest mountain on earth Mt Everest. The India plate was 'floating around' and 'bumped' into the Asian plate. The indian landmass folded under asia causing the asian landmass to buckle upwards creating the himalayan range in the process. It all took quite a while. They collided about 50 million years ago and Himalyan growth is still happening. Mt Everest grew by 1cm or so this year. But this is considered pretty snappy for mountain range 'building'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>India broke off from Madagascar and moved North toward Asia.  Along the way it went over a mantle plume which triggered massive volcanism about 66 million years ago.  The release of volcanic gasses changed the climate and began the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction event.  As India continued its Northern journey the Tethys ocean was closed and the Himalayas were built.</p></div>		</li>
