			<div class="markdown"><p>This behavior isn't uncommon. Cats, if seriously wounded or dying, will find some place secluded to go die. I don't know about the animal psychology behind it, I just know that it happens. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>well, some minute number can beat the spread to die of old age no doubt. Some things don't really have to worry about being killed before they die (except from humans, cuz we scary), like apex predators. They are like us in that they might take a bad fall</p>
<p>While others happen to have no natural predators due to circumstance (living on an island, for instance).</p>
<p>Until some crafty apes started shipping shit all over the world, there were lots of animals that just kinda coasted through life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but mostly from things where its a man-made issue. </p>
<p>If you happen to die in the middle of a freeway, another animal has to be pretty fucking desperate to claim that meal, whereas animal control/DOT can throw on their hazard lights and 30 seconds with a shovel later, thats dealt with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer that as I don't actually live in NYC and the job of animal control varies from place to place. For instance, where I live in Florida animal control won't deal with alligators. You have to call a private trapper to come and get live ones, and if there's any evidence of foul play (poaching, mostly), Fish and Wildlife comes out to investigate. </p>
<p>Not sure what the job description for animal control is in the city, though. </p></div>		</li>
