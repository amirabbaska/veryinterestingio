			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably a combination of efficiency of ingesta breakdown, colon/rectum shape, and what they are being fed.  For foregut fermentation, the rumen microflora do a great job of almost completely breaking down the cellulose structure and converting it to useable form (either for the host or the bacteria).</p>
<p>Hindgut fermenters (cecum is between the small intestine and large intestine) ferment a lot later on in the GI tract and the bacteria have much less time, space, and mechanical efficiency to degrade it properly.  This results in inefficient breakdown and incomplete ingestion, therefore more solid stool with incompletely digested forage in it (under normal circumstances anyway).  Horses really are super inefficient animals; they kind of won the artificial selection lottery when we domesticated them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Horses poop &quot;pellets&quot; because the distal colon at the end of their digestive tract has very prominent muscular rings that separate it into segments called <a href="http://img.tfd.com/mk/H/X2604-H-04.png" target="_blank">haustra</a>, which are little sacs that contain the fecal balls. The feces gets squeezed out sort of similar to a pez dispenser. Ruminants like cows on the other hand have less prominent haustra and a smoother colon so the feces is not separated into little balls. The rectum/anal sphincter and diet also contribute but to lesser effect, hope that explains it ok.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does that explain ruminants like goats and sheep who poop pellets?  Do they just have a more prominent haustra than other ruminants?  I keep thinking there must be something additional that has to do with moisture extraction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, it's al much simpler as you might think. Ruminants and horses just have a different way of digesting cellulose (foregut vs hindgut fermenters), how that came to exist evolutionary-wise is difficult to answer and needs looking up which animal they respectively evolved from.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! cows are more efficient in extracting energy from cellulose. Most bacteria that breaks this down lives in the foregut in cows - the four stomachs. The cow will regurgitate and swallow (called rumination) to increase the surface area for the bacterial fermentation. Then the intestines will absorb this broken down material. </p>
<p>Horses, on the other hand, have this bacteria in a very large caecum. (The appendix is a remnant of the caecum.) They do not ruminate. The caecum is between the small and large intestines, making it less efficient in terms of absorbtion. But, it also means that they are faster eaters. </p>
<p>In dire circumstances, horses will eat their own poop (called caecotrophy) to increase the quality of protein they get. Rabbits, also hindgut fermenters, will do this regardless of the situation, as long as you don't take their poop away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rabbits only eat their night stools, also known as cetotropes. This helps keep their cecum populated with the proper flora. It also helps them obtain certain nutrients they are unable to produce, but that the bacteria is. They don't typically eat the 'bunny bullet' type of poo. </p>
<p>Adult horses will rarely eat their own stools. In fact, they will often pick a particular part of the stall or pasture to defecate in as to not contaminate the rest of their food source. Some particularly picky eaters will refuse to eat hay that has touched feces. </p>
<p>Though, I do agree that cows are much more efficient in extracting nutrients. Often old or ruined hay is fed to them when it wouldn't provide enough nutrients to horses. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wonder why English has so many complicated words when it is about biology and anatomy. In German we use the word for rumination which literally means &quot;chew again&quot; (wiederkäuen), and every 5 year old child knows it, so you would not even need to explain it. The class of animals who do this are then &quot;chew againer&quot; (Wiederkäuer).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because English really is a clusterfuck of different languages. Everyday words tend to come from Old English and other Germanic languages, while words related to law and medieval noble life tend to come from French, while scientific words tend to come from Latin, because why not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even though ruminate has another meaning, it is used in different contexts. The scientific term for ruminate, originating from Latin, probably set the base of it's term for its other meaning, thinking about something.</p>
<p>Even though ponder and ruminate are synonyms, you don't have to use them in the same context. Both have different feelings for the word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rabbits don't actually eat fecal material, they are eating cecotropes which happen to come out of their rectum. It's kinda like a little bacterial pellet they produce to keep their own GI tract healthy.</p></div>		</li>
