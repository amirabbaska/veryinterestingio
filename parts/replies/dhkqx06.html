			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. I definitely feel like it's creepy that I can pretty much look anyone up in the US and know just about anything they like to do, where they live, telephone number, email, etc. But then again, you and anyone else gives that info away. It's not like it's being stolen. If someone hands me a picture of them it is mine to have if they gave it. </p>
<p>If you put your info online or in  public documents, you gave it to me and it is mine to have. It's just a matter of having the manpower to accumulate it all and turn it into profit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess that's what I'm getting at. If I didn't intend for it to be yours, do you feel bad taking it without my knowledge. </p>
<p>If someone gives a picture of themselves to a friend, and that friend gave it to you...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say your team combs through PDFs of personal info. Are these PDFs that individuals put their information and then posted online, or is PDF just the format in which you receive all the personal data, that the individuals probably didn't know would end up in your hands? I ask this because you make it sound like people are just posting their personal info deliberately and not just signing up with a service that buries the fact that they will sell their customer data behind legalese and huge service agreements. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to play a game. Anytime someone i don't know calls me (legit wrong number stuff, not telemarketers/scammers) I go into action. I'm going to find as much info as I can about this person basically just using Google. Step one: Google that phone number. Usually you can find the person associated with this phone number. If it's a cell phone, you can sometimes get a name, if a landline, easy to get the name and address of the owner. </p>
<p>Once you have a name then go to step two: Google that name. With a name, and the area code of the phone number, you can usually figure out exactly who just called you. </p>
<p>Now step three: find out more about that person. There's a lot of info you can get about someone from public records and social media. I just do it for fun.</p>
<p>I had someone text me a while back wanting to know what my rates for incall were. Had no idea WTF incall meant so I googled it. Turns out the guy was looking for an escort he found on CL. in about ten minutes I was able to figure who he was, where he lived, who his wife was, and what he looked like. I really thought about extorting this guy in return for not telling his wife that he's soliciting hookers off CL, but I just let it be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It already is..register with various online companies. Teams of agencies and companies have access to you CV and details as they have paid for access to the portal,and watch your in box get spammed by certain job agencies and CV writing companies. As they scrape the job portals for information. Even though the original site says they will never sell your data etc. I've requested many times from a couple of UK based companies where they got my info from. I've never heard back</p>
<p>Never include address, have another mobile/email address solely for job portals online.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear a lot about how people's personal data is for sale and such, but something I don't understand is where the marketplace is. If I'm a company and I'm interested in a dataset for some kind of targeted project, where do I go to purchase this data? Do companies that have potentially valuable data just sell it to lexis nexis, and LN is big brother?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right now I just want to better understand how this all works. Let me invert the equation: let's pretend I start some new social application, a component of which is collecting data that could be valuable across a large userbase. How do I sell this? I'm sure sites like OKCupid and facebook sell their data, but there isn't exactly a link on their websites saying &quot;click here to buy user data!&quot; </p>
<p>Help me understand how these marketplaces work.</p></div>		</li>
