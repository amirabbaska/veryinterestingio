			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah sadly it requires a loooot of background knowledge to understand it completely. I tried to explain it as simple and short as possible. I’m aware that it might not be entirely clear so that’s why if you have any questions feel free to ask and I’ll try to not confuse you more. I’m by no means an expert but I did work on exactly this question and know fairly well how it’s done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah another reason I didn’t link it is because yes, I have the original I and the friend that worked with me wrote. It is supposed to be uploaded to the website of the institute my tutor works for as some detailed notes for anyone that wants to do something like that or wants to know how it’s done. I could upload a pdf to drive and link it here but I’m not sure if I should rather wait for the “official” one to be ready hahaha</p></div>		</li>
