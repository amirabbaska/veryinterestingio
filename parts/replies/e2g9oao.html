<p>It's a lot easier to just roll the Shuttle in flight than it would be to rotate the launchpad.</p>

<p>Fun fact - the Soyuz rocket, until its most recent version, actually <em>did</em> require the entire launchpad to be rotated based on the desired launch azimuth. It wasn't until the Soyuz-2 was introduced in the mid-2000s that the rocket could roll (due to a new digital flight control system).</p></div>		</li>
