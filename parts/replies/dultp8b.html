			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there!  This is an interesting topic that is increasing in popularity but so far scientifically, there isn't a lot of &quot;there&quot; there.  The &quot;science&quot; is currently in a very soft state (i.e. psychological hypotheses, small study groups with no control, little in the way of biological investigation).</p>
<p>With one major camp studying it and little in the way of hard science, it's hard not to look at this phenomenon from a strong scientific place right now.  The studies are going to be prone to a host of biases due to expectancy and confirmation.  I suspect it will be a long time until definitive science comes out on the topic.</p>
<p>Examples of what's out there and has good review would be :</p>
<p>Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) and frisson: Mindfully induced sensory phenomena that promote happiness. Marisa A. del Campo &amp; Thomas J. Kehle, International Journal of School &amp; Educational Psychology Vol. 4, Iss. 2, 2016</p>
<p>Fredborg, Beverley, Jim Clark, and Stephen D. Smith. &quot;An examination of personality traits associated with autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR).&quot; Frontiers in psychology 8 (2017): 247.</p>
<p>Personally, I think this is more of a social fad and phenomenon than anything related to health and wellbeing.  But I'm sort of skeptical by nature and this position is informed by the structure of how ASMR currently is being presented.  There may be something to it that impacts health and well being, but I suspect it's very minor and likely will take a long time to tease out.  In the mean time, be prepared for lots of &quot;ASMR associated with [x]&quot; studies!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Yeah, I imagine any health and wellness claims by people could easily be in peoples minds. I'm more curious if they'll figure out why some people claim an experience and others do not. Hopefully something will come along sooner than later. Thanks for the response!</p></div>		</li>
