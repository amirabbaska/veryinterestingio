			<div class="markdown"><p>China <em>has been</em> colonized. Multiple times. By various nations and cultures. Especially European powers. </p>
<p>To make things less complicated, I'll list places where Chinese people had contact with the West.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Germans controlled Tsingtao(not island despite name) until the end of WW1. This is why there's a famous beer brewery there. ^(Anecdote: Taiwan Beer is better)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UK administrated Hong Kong (an actual island, but <em>not</em> China) until it was returned to Mainland China. Likewise they administrated the area that became Singapore(also island, but also not China), which has a lot of ethnic Chinese. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taiwan(definitely island) was under Japanese colonization until after WW2, where it was given to the ROC. They had close relations with the US until Nixon. But the US still has a strong presence in Taiwan. For a brief time, Taiwan(then called Formosa) was also under Dutch control. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a huge influx of Chinese immigration in Vietnam when the French ramped up the Indochine. Many of these folks picked up French styles just like the Vietnamese. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soviet Influence on China also brought suits and neat military uniforms </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>French controlled a piece of Shanghai</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't forget Portuguese Macau (for sure, island)</p>
</li>
<li>A lot of Chinese traveled, lived, worked around the Bay Area during the California Gold Rush</li>
</ul>
<p>Japan on the other hand saw massive industrialization and modernization efforts in the 1800's. One of the moves was abandonment of traditional hierarchy and lifestyles in favor of western styles. The Empire also made effort in exporting students to various Western nations for higher learning. This made many students adopt Western fashion. </p>
<p>I pissed people off, various edits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Macau</li>
<li>beer place isn't an island, even though the name in Chinese means &quot;island&quot;</li>
<li>The French were in Shanghai</li>
<li>beer joke inserted</li>
<li>There's Singaporeans that are offended that I listed them as a place where Chinese people met with Western ideals. There's nothing to be offended about here. Time to pick up your Hainan chicken rice and go home. </li>

We used to wear these wierdish bright cotton clothes and even during the 500 year ottoman rule continued to wear them. Then for some reason we &quot;modernised&quot; and changed clothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japan actually let itself become extremely westernized, causing conflict between those who wished to conserve traditional values and those who wanted to take part in an ever-advancing western world (industrial revolution era), the conversion to  19th century western culture was so intense and polarizing that, in my opinion, it may be the reason contemporary Japanese culture seems so formal.
Japan became a leading ally in the 1st world war, both physically and financially.
During the 2nd World War, Japan was of course an axis power, and their occupation of China caused the Chinese to look west (and north, hint hint) for support.
As for China's most initially influential contact with the West? The Opium Wars truly bound the fate of western and far-eastern culture. However more recent exchanges between China and western cultures are a-plenty. When Mao Tse-tung forced Chiang Kia-Shek into Taiwan and conquered mainland China, he converted it to a socialist-communist oligarchy with the support of the then Soviet Russia, whom if you would remember, were also 'western.'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that divergent ideologies of how a socialist revolution was to occur in China separated Mao from the Soviet's. Mao was trying to start revolution with use of the large agrarian population that China had, whereas the Soviets believed in traditional socialist revolution that placed responsibility of an uprising on the urban proletariat, which can only happen following a bourgeois revolution. The soviet's helped facilitate the creation of the United Fronts, which more or less put the CCP and KMT (or GMD) on the same side. The thinking behind this is that it would allow for a bourgeois revolution, which hadn't yet occurred in China. Many events helped Mao to gain the support of the agrarian peasant population such as the Long March, good treatment of the Chinese by the Red Army (protected them from Japan and KMT), and the failure of both United Fronts. Soviet support, however, was still behind the KMT (still needed a bourgeois revolution) and did not help Mao to consolidate communist control over China.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a very interesting thought, but I have to admit I don't quite see how you got there. I'd love to hear you break down the cause/effect relationship for that, if you don't mind explaining.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Mao suit is still popular with older people and has evolved to the tastes of younger audiences in ways unintended from it's origins by Dr. Sun Yet Sen. It started as a proletariat unifier, I now see it tailored in fine materials, with less utilitarian cargo pockets. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The suit isn't just European but English. Developed on Saville Row in London. And it can be found in places that were never colonised, like Japan.</p>
<p>The rest of Europe had their own traditional dress, and in some places it is preserved, like Bavaria. But the English suit proliferated throughout Europe too. </p>
<p>Frankly, I think it's because the English one is better. It looks great to almost every person. Some of the others are a joke, let's be honest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>England was one the largest colonial power, so it still makes sense. Places like Japan probably thought they'd be taken more seriously by the west in business and politics if they adopted western attire. Before all of the nationalism surrounding WWII, there was a big push for modernization there and quite a bit of it involved westernization. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason it spread to allot of uncolonised areas is mostly because of Westernization and modernization. Nation states who successfully modernized almost always also westernized, this can for example be seen in Turkey and Japan. This means adopting western customs, norms and culture; including dress codes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably true, but they also look good because the suit is specifically designed to emphasise attributes of the wearer. The cut of a suit can work to make short people look taller and fat people look thinner. The breadth or length of lapels has a large part to play in this too. Even the thickness or length of a tie can affect a wearer's perceived size. </p></div>		</li>
