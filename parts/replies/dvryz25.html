<p>The wires have currents in different directions so the fields repel. The same principle drives a rail gun projectile. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>just some clarification, technically the currents go in the same direction but are phase shifted 120 degrees compared to each other, which causes the magnetic fields induced to be opposite to each other.</p></div>		</li>
