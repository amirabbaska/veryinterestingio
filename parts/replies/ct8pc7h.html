			<div class="markdown"><p>I bet this has a lot to do with how modern chickens are raised, because if you have a good farm-raised chicken, you realize that the white meat actually tastes like something. Your average grocery-store chicken doesn't get the varied diet and exercise that help to create more flavorful meat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's potentially the way it's being cooked and that it is being over cooked, If you get a roast chicken from the local deli and it's cooked well, it tastes amazing(with or without seasoning) but you go throw a chicken in your oven at home and leave it on element heating till it's cooked, it's dry and bland.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel as though this begs the question: because people who find energy dense food more fulfilling are just statistically more likely to develop some form of addiction or problem and suffer the health troubles this brings, won't those who find energy dense foods less fulfilling eventually outnumber those who find them more fulfilling?</p></div>		</li>
