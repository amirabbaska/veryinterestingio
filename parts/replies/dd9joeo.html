			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. That task still involves complex integration of visual information (how far the receiver is and in which direction) with motor systems, vestibular systems, etc. There is a whole field now of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_physics" target="_blank">naive physics</a> that deals with the ability of the brain to rapidly make calculations about physical interactions, and a lot of this work and work in other areas of neuroscience point towards the brain doing its own calculations of features relevant to actions we want to take. That is, the brain has been shown to be capable of making all sorts of complicated predictions,not just using a sort of mapping of past successes and failures onto future situations, but by building what we can call generative models that are actually capable of handling new scenarios. Sure, it would be naive of us to think that this involves the exact same math as doing something 'on paper,' but it likely involves some sort of learned but subconscious knowledge about physics.</p>
<p>To read more of the empirical work that's been done on this, look into the implementation of generative models in the brain, intuitive physics, and other related concepts. <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/144b/a57d7ce5d3b50bc28479070e039962618d0f.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is one paywalled paper on the topic; Josh Tenenbaum's papers are a good place to start, though they can be highly technical.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a very cool experiment setup, and it actually showed a decent correlation between the model and heuristics, despite it being a complicated scenario. Very nice read.  Thank you for posting.</p>
<p>Something that really interested me in college, when I took a course 9 class on a related subject, was how much of this physical understanding is learned, and how much of it is hardwired. I never had time to follow up, since it was just a reqd humanities class. I think a less complicated scenario could be done in toddlers (e.g. prediction regarding material vs sound it makes upon fall, while measuring a toddler's 'surprise' level). I would appreciate if you could steer me towards some good papers, since this quite far from my field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right that (some) developmental psychologists have been interested in exactly how much of this stuff is hardwired and how much is learned through exposure. Obviously, it is very difficult to pick those things apart because we can't raise a child in an alternate universe with different physical laws. But we can try to measure infant behavior as early as possible and see to what degree they appear aware of physical rules. Elizabeth Spelke would be one person to look into, specifically around the phrase &quot;core knowledge&quot;. <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f307/cd02c3e9bea2321fe2887fdc63590f1be83a.pdf" target="_blank">Here's a review article from 2007</a> that kind of gives an overview of their basic hypotheses. Susan Carey is another good name to look into if you're interested. Her book The Origin of Concepts is a good review of that general area of dev psych.</p>
<p>I'm not up to date on the intuitive physics of infants literature, but people started looking at this kind of stuff in the late 80s, early 90s. Baillargeon did a bunch of experiments showing <a href="http://internal.psychology.illinois.edu/infantlab/articles/baillargeon1987.pdf.pdf" target="_blank">object permanence in young infants</a>. The logic of the experiments was basically show an object, hide the object, and then either you move things around in a way that is physically possible (given the hidden object) or which is physically impossible (given the hidden object, which you cleverly moved out of the way while it was not visible). Infants seemed to notice when you did something physically impossible, even though the reason it was impossible was not directly visible. Typically the physical rule being violated here is that solid objects cannot pass through one another.</p>
<p><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.439.8628&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">This later article by Spelke and crew</a> attempts to tease apart different aspects of physical rules regarding paths of motion for inanimate objects, things like inertia and continuity. They argue 4 month olds appear to expect continuity, but that inertia is not learned until 8 to 10 months. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Or said another way:<br />
Our brains are good at figuring out stuff, but we haven't figured out how yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Science asks, &quot;how do I describe what I see in a language that is not ambiguous&quot;. So, we pick math to describe the arc of a thrown ball. That's not the same as asking the question, &quot;how do you throw a ball&quot;, or &quot;how do you learn to throw a ball&quot;. This requires a different language than math to describe the answers to these questions. </p>
<p>&quot;like subconscious physics&quot; is an appropriate description of throwing a ball. It's rather poetic, which is a bit ambiguous, isn't it. We have deep troubles defining in unambiguous terms exactly what consciousness is; never mind subconscious. We know what we mean because we learned to throw balls, but we can't describe it without some vagueness creeping in.  In other words, &quot;subconscious physics&quot; is another way of saying &quot;I have no clue how to describe the act of throwing a ball&quot;.</p>
<p>Notice that we didn't need physics and math to describe how to throw a ball until we invented cannon balls, something our bodies could never throw in an effective way. Once things scale beyond the reach of our bodies, we need machines, and machines seem to lend themselves very well to math descriptions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doing something over and over until your mind can do it without conscious input. Take breathing for example. You are always doing it but very rarely have to think about it. Even better, stop and think a minute about all the muscle movements involved in taking a single step.</p></div>		</li>
