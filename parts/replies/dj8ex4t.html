			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent answer!! Worked on oil rigs for years. When I first started I always wondered if there was a possibility of there being an empty cavern down there that could potentially collapse. Until I voiced my concern and was systematically cut down and made fun of (would not have had it any other way haha). The consultant then explained the &quot;sponge&quot; metaphor and we all had a good laugh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly man you just need to call around find out who is hiring and send in resumes. I had zero experience and I went and worked my bag off and kept my mouth shut was a Derrick hand in a few months, and in 3 years was full time Driller. If you don't mind working and have a sense of pride/humour the sky is the limits on an oil rig (unless of course the price of oil is super low)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also of note, a lot of people don't know that wells for water work in the same fashion.  Water is in every nook and crack between all of the non solid rock underground after you go down so far. When you drill down to create a well, you're just giving the water a larger void space to settle into.  Many people think wells just dig down into vast open pools of water, but this in virtually never the case. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I just remember that from geology class because the professor ended the sentence by saying &quot;cone of depression&quot; so I could say &quot;waaa-waaa!&quot; real loud. As you can tell, I'm proud of that and maybe learned something?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not usually, but they used to sometimes.  Removal of surrounding fluid to force resivour migration is only really possible at shallow depths where the confining pressures are low and therefore the hydrostatic effects are limited.  That is to say: pumping out nearby fluids to create a &quot;cone of depression&quot; only works in situations where the resivour rock is fairly close to the surface AND has a very high porosity.  Most of the petroleum-bearing strata with these characteristics were depleted a century or more ago, so this technique is very rarely used nowadays.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I haven't heard this term in regards to oil recovery. But there are enhanced oil recovery techniques which allow companies to get more hydrocarbons out of the reservoir. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_oil_recovery</a>
There are a wide array of techniques. The choice depends on the reservoir properties and what resources are available to the drilling team at the time. My favourite is CO2 injection. You take captured CO2, inject and sequester it in the reservoir, it gets stored geologically underground and you recover more oil and gas.</p>
<p>Additionally, although not technically EOR, fracking is currently a favourite way to recover more oil from tight reservoirs otherwise unable to be drilled by conventional vertical drilling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK they do not &quot;create&quot; it. As you pump liquid out, it's natural that the liquid from the &quot;sides&quot; would go towards the &quot;center&quot;, so the cone of depression exists and helps with extraction, but I don't know how effective that actually is.</p></div>		</li>
