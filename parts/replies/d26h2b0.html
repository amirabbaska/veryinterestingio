			<div class="markdown"><p>But wouldn't it fall at an ever so slightly slower speed?</p>
<p>Ex. Say I shoot a fast enough bullet and a certain angle to cause it to circle the earth. I know the earths gravity would keep the bullet in orbit and eventually freefall, but shouldn't the angular momentum of the bullet keep it in the air longer? Much like the ISS is essentially in freefall, but it's speed counteracts that.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just dumb :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In your example, the bullet is still falling at the same rate as if it were holding still, but the earth is falling away as well (so to speak) due to its curvature, so the bullet never meets the earth. Follow the link for a diagram:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok this makes sense now. Didn't think about the earth &quot;falling away&quot; from the bullet as fast as the bullet is falling towards it.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct but the effect is negligible. The earth is really really big compared to the distance a bullet can travel before it hits the ground, so it's basically as if the world were flat for the purposes of this question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the gun actually. Some guns need to account for the curvature of the earth.</p>
<p>Of course, these are generally naval arms, but still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So a bullet moving forward would have the earth slightly fall away from it as it falls, okay, then in OP's scenario it would actually hit the ground faster than if shot from a stationary gun. The speed of descent doesn't change. The curve of the earth is no longer in the equation in OP's scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard to imagine, but if you've ever shot a big gun long distances, you see how much you need to compensate for gravity. Watch some dog fight videos from WWII, those tracer rounds curve around.</p></div>		</li>
