			<div class="markdown"><p>Are we really &quot;reasonably certain&quot; that the universe is infinite? I feel like there is very little evidence to support that considering infinities do not exist in any other occasion that we know of. I think practically and even mathematically wouldn't it make more sense that we are reasonably certain the universe is not infinite? Btw I'm not attempting to be condescending or catty in any way just confused as to if this is really the going theory or just a common misconception. Sources would be appreciated! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. May I ask why you think it is practically and mathematically unlikely or infeasible for space to be infinitely big? Infinities of various types certainly do exist; the natural numbers are infinite, and the amount of real numbers between 1 and 2 is also infinite and in fact <em>bigger</em> than the amount of natural numbers on the entire infinite number line.</p>
<p>Of course, space and math aren't the same thing, but there observations that lead us to believe the universe may be infinite. First, we are quite certain the universe is flat. By flat I don't mean flat like a piece of paper. &quot;Flat&quot; in this context means the universe has the same geometric properties as a flat Euclidean plane. Infinitely long parallel lines will never meet or diverge, a cosmically-sized triangle will have inner angles that sum to 180 degrees, and just as a plane can be tiled into squares, space can be <a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/gr/public/images/flat.gif" target="_blank">tiled into cubes</a>. (Other universe shapes are tiled differently; for example a hyperbolic universe can be tiled into <a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/gr/public/images/hyp.gif" target="_blank">regular dodecahedra</a>, which looks rather interesting.)</p>
<p>We believe the universe is flat because images taken of the <a href="http://sci.esa.int/science-e-media/img/61/Planck_CMB_Mollweide_4k.jpg" target="_blank">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> by both the WMAP and Planck probes show a density that is <strong><em>very</em></strong> close to the level necessary for the universe to be flat. If the universe was open or closed, we would expect the patches in the image to be either <a href="http://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/media/030639/030639_1_640.png" target="_blank">smaller or larger</a>, respectively, which is not the case. Not only is the density of the universe incredibly close to the correct value, but the universe also shows incredible smoothness and homogeneity. This is considered to be strong evidence for Inflation, which also supports a flat universe. </p>
<p>Now, just because the universe is flat <em>does not</em> mean it is infinite. A flat, finite universe is entirely possible. <em>But</em>, since we know the universe <em>isn't</em> closed, this means infinity is now on the table, because flat and open universes <em>can</em> be infinite, but a closed universe is necessarily finite. If the universe were finite and shaped in such a way that traveling in a straight line for a long enough period of time would bring you to the opposite side of the universe, we would expect there to be multiple images of deep-sky objects from different points in time due to light traversing the entire universe and coming back around. You'd definitely expect the CMBR to show evidence of such a thing, but as far as we've been able to measure, this isn't the case. </p>
<p>This means we have two options now. Option one is that space is so incredibly huge light can't, or hasn't yet had time to do a round trip. Considering how long the universe has existed, for this not to have happened means the whole universe must be <em>very</em> huge indeed. Option two is that space goes on forever in every direction, so naturally we would never see multiple images of deep-sky objects or distortions of the CMB indicating multiple traversals of the universe. </p>
<p>So which is it? Technically, we can't prove the universe <em>is</em> infinite. The only thing we can do is continue trying to find evidence that would indicate it is <em>not</em> infinite. Currently we have yet to find any hard evidence that indicates the universe cannot be infinite. Since an infinite universe doesn't disagree with any of our findings, nor is it impossible mathematically, the current dominant models for describing the shape of the universe have come to assume infinite-ness. (Although I cannot be certain of this, as it is far beyond my current knowledge level, I would imagine that a geometrically flat, infinite universe is simpler to work with, mathematically and conceptually, than a finite universe that is connected to itself in some way).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it possible for the universe to be flat and also be closed as in the case of a torus? I meant that in the observable universe we've never actually encountered anything physical that existed in infinities. I'm not aware of anything that we have found that we couldn't actually quantify and the fact that we've never found an infinite number of anything before would make it more reasonable that infinities likely did not exist in a physical sense. Of course as soon as I thought of this I was also reminded that infinities, at least mathematically, can exist within a finite closure... obviously I'm way out of my league on this from a scientific point of view but I'm happy to play devils advocate even if my understanding of the concept is rudimentary at best haha. </p></div>		</li>
