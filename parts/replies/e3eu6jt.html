			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you!  I have noticed many #2 Philips screws will start to cam out with a regular hand screwdriver well before they're even halfway screwed in, even in relatively soft wood.  Like there's no way that was their design intention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah not true. That is the main difference between JIS and Phillip's. They look almost exactly like one another but one will not cam out. There is a slight angle difference in the depth of the head. JIS is super common and has replaced Phillip's for most applications with critical torque... that for some reason didnt go with torq or Allen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So a torx bit, yes they are generally an improvement, but one tradeoff there is they are sized where phillips is mostly one size fits all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use Robertson for most construction purposes here in Canada (square head).</p>
<p>The two main benefits of that are that you can put a screw on the end of your drill and it will stay there so you can use both hands and they don't strip as easily as Phillip's.</p>
<p>Every screwhead has it's benefits and drawbacks, which is why we have so many.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: a fair number of Philips screws are NOT Phillips, they are JIS, a slightly different standard that Phillips head screwdrivers do not fit worth a damn. </p>
<p>JIS are designed not to cam out in factories and is a very secure drive.. unless you use a Phillips screwdriver on them, then its 3x worse then Phillips.</p>
<p>JIS screwdrivers however do fit Phillips very well. That said the JIS screwdrivers I bought cost $60 for a set of 4. </p>
<p>Most things from Japan (Such as yamaha motorcycles) use JIS. Sometimes they will have a small dot on the head to indicate its JIS but not always. I HIGHLY recommend buying JIS screwdrivers. (I have the Vessel JIS set from ebay, VERY good quality)</p>
<p>Between a good set of JIS screwdrivers and a manual impact screwdriver (Did I mention one of the Vessel JIS screwdrivers is a manual impact driver+regular screwdriver?) and penetrating oil, I have not stripped a JIS/Phillips head screw since buying them.</p>
<p>That said, I also reach for the manual impact screwdriver as the very first thing whenever I meet any large head JIS screws... and replace them all with SHCS (Socket head cap screw). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another problem is that while Phillips looks a lot like JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) a Phillips driver will chew up the head of a JIS screw. The JIS takes a '+' point that goes a bit deeper at the edges, a Phillips driver will need the point ground down 1/8&quot; or so to fit properly.  </p>
<p>You can tell a JIS screw by a little dot indentation on the head - really common in Japanese motorcycles' carburetors and such. It's pretty common these screws get stripped out by those trying to do their own repairs. Frustrating, because no hardware store readily sells a JIS screwdriver set. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious if there's a good reason that JIS screwdrivers aren't very widely sold (seemingly both online and in stores). I would have thought screwdrivers are one of the cheapest tools to make, so would be easy profit and not the crazy prices a google search shows for the tools online.</p>
<p>Is it solely out of concern that nobody knows about this (I didn't till now)? Or is there some kinda licensing issue? So much stuff is made in Japan that it seems like there <em>should</em> be demand for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I pulled a bunch of wall-mounted shelves out of a room recently.  They used PH3 Tapcons in cinder block.  They had slightly stripped them putting them in, so getting them back out was a bear.  Had to put a lot of weight on the drill to keep it from stripping more, and I still had to cut some off.  I expect when they put the shelves in they never thought they'd be taken out, but the entire time I was thinking how much better it would have been if they were normal hex bolt heads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's what most people call stripping the screw. Phillips head screwdrivers are supposed to slip before it destroys the metal. However with screw manufacturers making the screws out of softer and softer metal they strip out the screw instead of slipping. </p>
<p>That's why I personally prefer the Japanese Phillips head screws as they are designed to not slip so you can get a more controlled application of torque.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just a FYI, all patents are by design, easily searchable</p>
<p>Also the Robertson is a Canadian screw head that not only predates the phillips, it does everything the phillips claimed to but better. Square heads for the win</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard it in an engineering class years ago. The wiki article mentions it and has some citations: </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Phillips" target="_blank">The design is often criticized for its tendency to cam out at lower torque levels than other &quot;cross head&quot; designs. There has long been a popular belief that this was actually a deliberate feature of the design, for the purpose of assembling aluminum aircraft without overtightening the fasteners. Extensive evidence is lacking for this specific narrative, and the feature is not mentioned in the original patents. However, a 1949 refinement to the original design described in US Patent #2,474,994 describes this feature.</a></p></div>		</li>
