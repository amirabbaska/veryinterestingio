<p>CO2 is primary driver of breathing, but that’s only because it will accumulate quickly and causes acidosis.</p>
<p>Oxygen is a driver of well, and is the secondary driver.  In people who are chronically used to high CO2 levels, like COPD, oxygen will become primary driver.</p>
<p>So, low oxygen will 100% increase your drive to breath.  And you will feel short of breath and it is a very uncomfortable feeling.  It will wake you up.  People in the ICU who are struggling to maintain their oxygen saturation are VERY uncomfortable, they are wide awake, and their hearts are racing and they’re sweating and their anxiety is super high.</p>
<p>Low oxygen will 100% wake you up if it’s low enough to cause you to not be able to saturate you’re hgb.  </p>
<p>Am physician and have seen lots of people who are struggling to breath in the ICU. </p>
<p>Edit:  video of somebody in respiratory failure.  Somebody in hypoxic respiratory failure or hypercapneic (high co2) respiratory failure look the same.  As you can imagine, you can’t sleep.  They’re using accessory muscles to try to breath as their diaphragm is wearing out</p>

<p>Edit 2:  I’ve seen the astronaut training videos where they pump out O2.  Not sure how they make it so people don’t feel air hunger, maybe they do it super faster?  Maybe a pulmonologist can weight in.   Or maybe they give another gas that gets rid of the hypoxia feeling. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Inert gasses should still prevent the 'I can't breathe' reflex even if you aren't getting enough oxygen.</p>
<p>Slowly lowering the O2 <em>can</em> be noticeable, which explains your ICU patients, but if you just go from normal air to a double lungful of Argon, you'll be unconscious in seconds with no symptoms leading up to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Watch hypoxia videos from the airforce/nasa training, you don't realize you are dying even when you're awake, even if they tell you to put the O2 mask on or you'll die, nothing registered cause you can't even perform simple tasks like what's 2+2.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right? I got to experience hypoxia in an altitude chamber. The progression of symptoms is neat. None of us were off of oxygen until unconsciousness, but you could definitely see people's motor skills and speech abilities fade.</p></div>		</li>
