			<div class="markdown"><p>So, one of the parts of chronic tension is that it's self-sustaining to a degree - if a muscle gets too tense and starts to hurt, it can cause an injury reaction, which makes the muscles around it 'splint', getting really tense, and then the excessive tension splints the muscle around it, etc etc. This can even become supported by connective tissue forming in the area to try and hold things together so that it'll stop hurting and can heal - but by this point the muscle is actually physically incapable of relaxing on its own, especially all tied up in excess connective tissue. This is how you get those 'knots' of muscle.</p>
<p>Massage acts on that by physically breaking up that emergency connective tissue and soothing the muscle back into a state of relaxation through a variety of possible methodologies and techniques.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as a couple other commentors here are noting, there's a big problem with some therapists using too much pressure for a person(it's incredibly subjective) and the client not wanting to speak up. If you're using too much pressure on a muscle that's already overly tense and hurting, you're just going to exacerbate it - causing that same over-tightening splint reaction because you're aggravating an already injured muscle - which can partially or completely negate the possible benefits of the massage.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am currently in PT for compression in my neck, among other things  the PT dude had me lay down on my back and he gently massaged my shoulder about halfway in between the neck and socket.</p>
<p>I thought he was slacking off, not really doing anything. It barely felt like anything at all.</p>
<p>When I got up from the table my neck and shoulders had never and I mean NEVER felt so relaxed. I was pain free for two full days.</p>
<p>PT people are GODS to me.  I might have to look up MT's next.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when my massage therapist does work on my back, it hurts like fucking hell. i’ve had tears leave my eyes before. she always asks if it’s okay, and i always tell her it’s fine. when i leave, i feel sore at first and then absolutely great after that. the change is undeniable. so, is the method of ‘getting it till it hurts’ effective for some people?</p></div>		</li>

<p>They just aren't relaxing to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Learn to massage yourself. No, you won’t be able to do perfectly, but i find that I can get a lot of relief by massaging my own muscles when i need it. Plus, I know exactly what needs the pressure and what doesn’t. It’s not perfect but It helps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends what the problem is. For me it's actually dangerous bc the tension is holding my loose joints in place. If I get a really satisfying massage I'll be majorly dislocating shit in a few hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but there’s a little more to it as well. The fight or flight response causes your breathing rate to increase, and become more shallow. </p>
<p>This means you use the “accessory” muscles of breathing much more than you would do normally. Overuse of these muscles can then cause them to become right and sore(a few of them are located in the neck. But what also happens is that these muscles pull you into the slouched posture I’m sure you’ve seen. And that in itself is another contributor to neck pain. </p>
<p>Massages help to release the tension in these muscles and also to get you to revert back to a rest state where you’re not experiencing the heightened levels of stress hormones. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah. Neither of you addressed the second part of the question. How does a massage relieve the tension.  </p>
<p>You both just said, &quot;massages relieve tension&quot; which is really just begging the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another MT here, what I haven't really seen here is the emotional aspect of massage or how it relieves tension. As humans, we're hard wired to crave intimacy. By intimacy, I don't mean sex, but just touch from another human being. It can go a long way toward helping with emotional health. Though we may not be able to explain exactly how manipulating tissue relieves muscle tension, I can say that I've seen and even experienced how much caring human touch can mean to a person's mental, and therefore physical, health. </p>
<p>If the mind can tell the body to relax, that they are safe, and their immediate emotional needs are being met, you're going to see an effect in muscle tension. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thought is that these are focal points of muscle contraction, if you press on the knot, it can cause it to relax due to a mechanism in the muscle.  That is why acupressure is thought to work for knots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How I see it, is imagine your muscle fibers &quot;pilling&quot; and contracting way more than the rest of the fibers. You massage it to smoothen and straighten them back to the group. Is that a fair comparison?</p></div>		</li>
