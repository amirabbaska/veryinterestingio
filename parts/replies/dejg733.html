			<div class="markdown"><p>So the solar core has a density of about 1e26 particles per cc while fusion reactions here on earth are about 10 orders of magnitude less. Hovering between 1e12 to 1e17 depending on the device. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not used to thinking in orders of magnitude; is it accurate to rephrase that as saying it's 1 ten-millionth the density?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also important to remember that the sun is running on 'normal' hydrogen while fusion reactors usually use deuterium (&quot;heavy&quot;) hydrogen. The latter is much, much more reactive. With normal hydrogen we'd not stand a chance to create a power plant whatsoever. Even replicating the conditions in the sun wouldn't be sufficient. The sun emits only about 5mw of energy per kg. It's obviously more in the core, but even with a ton of sun core you'd not reach the energy output of a candle. </p>
<p>This is good thing btw. If the sun were more reactive it would just explode. And since it's so big the reaction rate is more than enough to keep us warm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About 1000x mass, in the core of an H-bomb. But that compression pressure is achieved by a primary A-bomb. But that is <em>uncontrolled</em>, we want to be able to control the rate of energy production. The closest that we might be able to mirror that in the lab, is with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fusion+temperature+versus+pressure&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8#q=hyper-dense+deuterium&amp;*" target="_blank">hyper-dense deuterium</a>.</p></div>		</li>
