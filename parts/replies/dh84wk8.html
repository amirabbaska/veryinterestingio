			<div class="markdown"><p>He's right, the plank should have a thickness on the same order of magnitude of a visible light wavelength to be seen.</p>
<p>Visible light wavelength is, roughly, around one micrometer (10^-6 m). An atom is on the order of one angstrom in diameter (10^-10 m). Therefore, the plank should be at least ten thousand atoms thick.</p></div>		</li>
