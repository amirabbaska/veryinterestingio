<p>This is particularly noticeable near the mouth of the Amazon, which spews enough fresh water into the ocean that a sailor on the surface could drink straight from the ocean out to sea for about 200 miles!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gives us the plot twist of a lesser known Jules Verne novel, where seamen are stranded somewhere in the south Atlantic on a raft, and just as all hope seems to be lost, the narrator is thrown to the sea, accidentally takes a gulp of water and sees that it is freshwater, and realizes they must be approaching the coast since the Amazon is the only river capable of spreading its waters so far.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is, salinity gradients can be harnessed to generate energy. I worked on a small scale fuel cell type system that was in its very early stages. I haven't really kept up with the research as I switched projects early on, and I don't know if scale up was at all successful, but salinity gradients can be very efficiently harnessed, and with almost no emissions.</p>
<p>As far as just kinetic energy harnessing, large scale wave and flow energy are being utilized, but there are a ton of challenges. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The currents that come from the poles (much cooler water) also sink and ride along the bottom of the ocean because of their density</p>

<p>Why is that? If 4C is denser? Is it because it's saltier?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, yes! I should've mentioned this too because it's really important. When water freezes at the poles it squeezes salts out of the ice. It creates a brine that's really salty (and dense and cold) that sinks. It takes several hundred years (yes, centuries) to dilute the salt in the oceans from these currents, which allows the polar water to stay on the bottoms of the oceans for a long time.</p>
<p>Here's some further reading: <a href="http://oceanmotion.org/html/impact/conveyor.htm" target="_blank">Ocean Motion</a> that talks about the Ocean Conveyor Belt. You can look at the picture on the right of the site, the rest of the site talks about how global temperatures could stop the conveyor belt. Interesting, nonetheless, but not really on topic. :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because the water is saltier, which actually brings us to one of the main fears of climatologist: when the Greenland glaciers melt, the water will be less salty, meaning it won't stink to the ground anymore, stopping the gulf streams supply of water, hence weakening our stopping it completely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antarctic scientist here to make some important clarifications.  The view given by Regel_1999 is common, very outdated and wrong.</p>
<p>The bottom water of most of Earths oceans is created at the poles.  If you were to google &quot;Antarctic bottom water (AABW)&quot; or &quot;North Atlantic deep water (NADW)&quot; you could learn a great deal more about why this water forms and where it goes.  The water at the bottom of Earths oceans is not 4<em>C because where it forms the surface water temps are less than 4</em>C and when salinity is taken into account bottom waters below 0*C becomes possible and are common.</p>
<p>There is a great paper that explains this quite well: DOI: 10.1038/NGEO1391</p>
<p>If you don't have university access to papers search for &quot;Closure of the meridional overturning circulation through Southern Ocean upwelling&quot; by Marshall and Speer (2012)</p>
<p>NEVER TRUST SCIENCE FROM A WEBSITE LIKE THE ONE LINKED ABOVE!</p>
<p>Sorry Regel, not trying to be a dick, but there is a lot of good science available on this topic and people should get good answers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by, &quot;is created&quot;?  Is it melted from the arctic ice?  If so, why?</p>
<p>I dunno, I guess I thought that all the water in the oceans is more or less recycled by the rain / cloud cycle.  Never really thought about what happens at the bottom though, other than it being churned up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember right its created by seawater T the poles freezing in winter. The salt doesn't stay in the frozen ice so ends up making the surrounding seawater more salty and dense. Then it sinks drawing less dense seawater in above which does same so causes a cycle current. </p></div>		</li>
