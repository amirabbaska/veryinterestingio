Most theorize that there is a vast quantity of liquid metallic hydrogen in Jupiter, which, in my mind would be strongly reflective to radar, and you could see the planet in reflection. Now, if this is not the case, it means one of a few things : </p>

<li>
<p>Jupiter is not transparent to radar, but instead absorbs or scatters the radiation.  This seems possible due to strong magnetic fields.  Can you see through Jupiter if there is something behind it from the line of sight of the telescope?</p>

<li>
<p>Metallic hydrogen is not reflective to radar.</p>
</li>
<li>There is not metallic hydrogen in Jupiter.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am very curious about this, so if anyone can guide me where I can read more about this, I would appreciate it. Thanks! </p></div>		</li>
