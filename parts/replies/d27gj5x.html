			<div class="markdown"><p>Anne: <strong>Groundwater can't save us from climate variability and change.</strong> My research has looked at this in the Oregon Cascades, where streams fed by volcanic aquifers supply water to the agriculture and cities of the Willamette Valley (Portland, Salem, and Eugene) in the summer when it doesn't rain. But when warmer temperatures cause earlier snowmelt and shifts from snow to rain in the winter, the groundwater outflow from the aquifers naturally draws down further by the end of the summer, resulting in less water in the streams. You can read the details of my work here: <a href="http://wpg.forestry.oregonstate.edu/sites/wpg/files/bibliopdfs/08_Jeffersonetal_HP%20%282%29.pdf" target="_blank">http://wpg.forestry.oregonstate.edu/sites/wpg/files/bibliopdfs/08_Jeffersonetal_HP%20%282%29.pdf</a> and here: <a href="http://wpg.forestry.oregonstate.edu/sites/wpg/files/bibliopdfs/08_Tagueetal_Climate.pdf" target="_blank">http://wpg.forestry.oregonstate.edu/sites/wpg/files/bibliopdfs/08_Tagueetal_Climate.pdf</a> </p>
<p>More broadly, groundwater can't save us from climate variability and change, because we can easily pump out more than can be recharged. We saw this during the recent California drought, when groundwater pumping rates increased significantly resulting in declining water levels and even subsidence (sinking of the land surface). Despite California's winter rain and snow, groundwater levels are still significantly below normal: <a href="http://ca.water.usgs.gov/data/drought/drought-impact.html" target="_blank">http://ca.water.usgs.gov/data/drought/drought-impact.html</a> This sort of over-pumping isn't just limited to California. We are seeing probably irreversible aquifer declines in areas around the world already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Desalination for general use and TWW recharge of the groundwater are good options. If you have the time look into what Western Australia is doing in terms of water supply. </p></div>		</li>
