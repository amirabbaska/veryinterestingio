			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's an article you might find interesting:</p>
<p><a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2015/07/17/new-horizons-data-transmission/" target="_blank">https://hub.jhu.edu/2015/07/17/new-horizons-data-transmission/</a></p>
<p>Spacecraft we have out now have long transmission times, especially since they can be quite far away. The article above takes New Horizons, a craft that can transmit at ~1-2kbps. For comparison, average internet speeds in Australia (where I live) are around ~30mbps on the higher end. But in the case of places like America where they have better infrastructure, higher-end internet speeds can reach upwards of 100mbps.</p>
<p>This is partially due to the the spacecraft being old (once we launch them, it takes a while to get to its place) which means it was created during the 2002-2005 period (approximately). It runs out outdated technology, which means it has less bandwidth.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you're talking about transmitters on Earth, the record was set at around I believe 42tbps. However, I am not sure if this will be sustainable. I was unable to find a reliable reading of the maximum stable bandwidth connection (that was relatively efficient and didn't cost a fortune to maintain). However, you may find this section of SETI's website relevant as well:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/seti-observations" target="_blank">https://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/seti-observations</a></p>
<p>It talks about what the section of the EM spectrum is best for transmissions. And finally, you should check out the Wow! Signal (bandwidth - less than 10 kHz) - it may not be relevant to your original question but I do believe you'll find it interesting.</p>

<p>Hope this helps and sorry for not being able to answer your question with anything more than hypothesis as this hasn't ever been really attempted - we're usually on the receiving end. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;higher end&quot; in America is not 100mbps, that's average for cities. It's what I have because I don't want to pay for the 500 that's available. The higher end is 1000mpbs. Gigabit ethernet is available to millions of people now.</p>
<p>Rural areas still have 3-10mbps as their best option in some places, though. </p>
<p>Quality reply though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty great when you consider the Kepler mission has already announced a little over <a href="http://milkywaygalaxyatlas.com/starsystem0_100.php" target="_blank">200 planets within 500 light years of Earth</a>. Of these, 4 of the 5 most promising &quot;earth like&quot; planets discovered to date are <a href="http://milkywaygalaxyatlas.com/earthlikeplanets.php" target="_blank">within 40 light years</a>, with the closest of these being 4 light years away. So well within communication range. Albeit... with a lag time of 8 to 80 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely. Within a lifetime is <strong>incredibly</strong> promising news considering the vastness of space - I'll take it for sure. Hell, we could just shoot signals even if we weren't sure - just in case something came out of it. Something like that wouldn't take a ridiculous amount of resources; at least compared to other distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disappointing, so not even the nearest star. And unless some other civilization within 500 LY is sending such a signal directly to us - and why would they? - we won't be seeing anything useful from SETI, with current technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, we have a certain footprint on Earth that makes us pretty noticeable if someone actually takes the time to look at us. For example - our abundance of O2 and O3 - in other words, free oxygen. SETI is more meant to be on the lookout for any communications <em>just in case</em>. While it isn't even the nearest star - this is a worst case scenario. A widened beam could reach shorter distances than 500 LY but much further than 2-3 LY. It's 1am so I won't be able to do the proper calculations right now, but we could always send a cone in the direction of the nearest star for example to get the best of both worlds as much as we can. While it's still pretty wide and thus using a decent amount of power, it's also a  small enough cone to make it feasible (and Proxima/Alpha Centauri is close enough for it to be easy enough) and intelligible. Don't fear - I'm only using extreme, worst case scenarios.</p></div>		</li>
