			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean we get it is great among artists who know what they are looking for and the techniques used, but to you average job blow I think Sumit316 hit it dead on. If it wasn't for the theft and whatnot it would not be near as popular among people who don't study art. It's rather posh to assume most people have knowledge or even care about the techniques you listed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that the average American 21st century kid won't have a clue about this stuff except to know that this painting is famous for being famous.</p>
<p>However, I believe that's where museums like the National Gallery of Art (in Washington D.C.) or the Met ( in NYC) come in: The National Gallery, as it turns out is the only place in the Western Hemisphere where anyone can see a DaVinci painting, and they have a really cool one (it's double sided) - which is when we asked our kids where they might like to go in DC, my &quot;39 Clues&quot; &amp; &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; reading son came up with this one. Why? 'Because it had the ONLY Da Vinci on this side of the planet!' So, OK, why not? But we actually got more than we bargained for. </p>
<p>That painting really is cool. And you can spend a lot of time reading about it in the gallery as it is in a special place of honor with lots of cool bits of information about it. But the kicker was tagging along on one of those free museum tour groups which was coming to its grand finale in the next gallery over... We spent 20 minutes captivated by a painting we had earlier glanced at for 5 seconds while the guide brought the room to near tears with the story behind the painting and then the even deeper story behind that one. By the time she was done we kind of felt like we knew the artist personally and shared in his personal heartbreak.</p>
<p>So, yes the average joe can be taught to 'get it' or at least begin to appreciate some obscure painting techniques and heartbreaking stories (it was a Rembrandt btw) if the person sharing it has some genuine passion for it. </p>
<p>So, thanks to my son, I kind of get why you might see someone standing in front of a painting just looking at it, and then see them like 45 minutes later still rooted in the same spot with that far off look in their eye. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I visited the Louvre it was a little funny to see that the actual painting was really small in size and how people were scrambling over each other to get a picture of it. When there are already thousands of good quality pictures available, I do not understand what these people were trying to capture which would be unique or different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People are hardwired to preserve what is important to them. Everyone has experienced what is fleeting and loss and it affects some more strongly than others. That person in a concert recording would have a better concert experience by not recording, but fear not having a record of a fleeting experience.  It is not in the quality of the recording, but the act of recording for oneself.</p></div>		</li>
