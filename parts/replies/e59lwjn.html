			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just not right, the lid holds no significant pressure in.  The difference with the lid on vs off is the hot air &amp; steam escaping and cold air flowing over the top of the bubbles.</p>
<p>Edit to add what I posted elsewhere:</p>
<p>I just weighed one of my glass pot lids.   1.5 lbs, 9 inch diameter.  That's 1.5 lbs over <del>254 square inches</del> 63 square inches  or  0.023 psi.  That is how much the pressure can increase inside the pot  before it lifts the lid and releases the extra pressure.  It's a 1%  increase over atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>EDIT: sorry, fixed the math</p>
<p>â€‹</p>
<p>Edit 2: The other, and perhaps most significant difference, besides just the cooling of the airflow, is that the air under the lid is almost entirely steam, while the air flowing in from outside without a lid is dry air.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>PPPPS: I rounded way up on the weight of that lid btw, and y'all know it doesn't matter and the effect the op was asking about happens with thin sheet metal pot lids as well.  It ISN'T caused by pressure.  It's caused by the space above the bubbles being filled with steam instead of having dry outside air flowing in.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the lid holds no significant pressure, then the 'hot air and steam escaping' should occur equivalently, but it doesn't. There is a restriction with the lid in place, increasing pressure.</p>
<p>While the pressure with the lid is indeed low, it is not insignificant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, with a lid no cold air can enter to mix with the steam just above the surface, the steam escaping around the edges keeps the flow one way.  The space between the lid and the water is contained and will be hotter than without a lid.  This lets the bubbles persist longer.  With the top open there is air flow, more heat escapes, and the bubbles cool and shrink sooner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have high quality pots and pans it could hold in a bit of pressure. My lids are made of fairly heavy glass and seal pretty well too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't hold enough pressure to have any significant effect on the bubbles.  What makes a difference with the lid off is the airflow cooling the bubbles at the top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're saying that direct cooling of the bubbles' internal air causes collapse?  Or a change in the water temp and thus surface tension of the bubble?  </p>
<p>Sounds possible.  I imagine that the local humidity is also a huge factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partially the cooling, more likely the dry outside air being in contact with the bubbles instead of the steam that would fill the space under the lid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue with this explanation is that the bulk liquid also experiences a higher pressure. Even if you were able to raise the gas phase pressure, say by gasketing and valving, boiling will stop temporarily until the liquid phase heats up sufficiently to have the vapor pressure equal to that of the gas phase pressure, and then you will get the same bubble sizes again.</p></div>		</li>
