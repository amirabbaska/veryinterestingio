This was long before anybody dreamed of something as portable as a floppy disk (which IBM started work on in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_floppy_disk" target="_blank">1967</a> and didn't release until 1972).</p>
<p>Interestingly, <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US3503060" target="_blank">US Patent 3503060</a>, which Wikipedia refers to as the fundamental patent for modern hard drives, spells &quot;disc&quot; with a 'c' ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it was discette, the c would make an &quot;s&quot; sound like in the word descent.  To preserve the k sound,  you have to change the c to a k. I guess the could have used a qu if they wanted to,  like briquette. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>then why not have it be a K to begin with?  Is this not the same problem with discus and discuss?</p>
<p>Why is &quot;C&quot; even a letter?  It always makes an &quot;S&quot; or a &quot;K&quot; sound.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not that it makes any sort of a difference but after repeatedly saying fridge and frige, it seems more uncomfortable go say the latter.</p>
<p>Also I’m a dumbass.</p></div>		</li>
