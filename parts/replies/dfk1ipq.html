			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite YouTuber does the monthly contribution model on Patreon where subscribers can subscribe to toss him $1+/month. His channel is a relatively small gaming channel, around 250,000 subs right now, but he's making over $5,600 a month from Patreon on top of his ad revenue. Dude is living the life.</p></div>		</li>
