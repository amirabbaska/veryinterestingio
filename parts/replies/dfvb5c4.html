			<div class="markdown"><p>That will not happen if the program is written correctly and it's cross-checked by experts in the field. Ideally, a program takes some input. In this case let's say the input is &quot;produce a district map that insures fair representation for every voter&quot;. It is then fed the demographical data and it crunches the numbers, producing an output. There is no political interpretation or bias. It's not AI or anything like that. Just an algorithm that produces the same result every time it receives a given input.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the problem is the definition of &quot;fair&quot;</p>
<p>All the videos explaining gerrymandering dont quite capture the reality of the situation, because they assume there are just two groups of people that need to be organized fairly.</p>
<p>particularly when race is involved, this isnt always the case.  if you have a 60/40 split between democrats and republicans, one definition of &quot;fair&quot; is that if you had 10 seats, 6 go to Dems and 4 to Reps.</p>
<p>but maybe the racial makeup is also 60/40 white to black.  if racism is prevalent, you could easily wind up with all-white representation across both parties.  hypothetically those white representatives (even the dems, who most people heavily associate as the party representing black people) never have to worry about advocating for their black constituents.</p>
<p>this isnt as big a problem today as it used to be, but its definitely still something that factors in</p></div>		</li>

<li>there is still no one correct way a computer will do this, any particular program will give someone an advantage</li>
<li>computers don't take demographics into consideration, they just lump groups together</li>
<li>computers usually can't recognize federal court orders</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why wouldn't we just go with districting based on something like a grid, where the size of the grid is determined by state size?</p>
<p>So Washington might have a smaller grid than California to keep the amount of districts the same?</p>
<p>That might be a terrible way to do it in actual practice but in theory it seems least biased imo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're going to very quickly run into urban vs rural divides. Let's look at Illinois as an example. Most of the population is centered around chicago in the upper right. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/United_States_Congressional_Districts_in_Illinois%2C_1973_%E2%80%93_1982.tif/lossless-page1-400px-United_States_Congressional_Districts_in_Illinois%2C_1973_%E2%80%93_1982.tif.png" target="_blank">Here is what current districts look like.
</a></p>
<p>The population of Illinois as a whole is 12.9 million. The population of the chicago metropolitan area is 9.5 million.</p>
<p>If you do it with similar size grids of say 10 districts you can end up with the 9.5 million all in 1 district and the remaining 3.4 million have control of the remaining 9 districts.</p>
<p>If you do it by population the chicago area will control 7 districts and the entire rest of the state will only have 3 allowing the city of chicago super majority control of the state.</p>
<p>Any computer algorithm runs into similar problems because you have to tell the program how to divide the population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that the population is concentrated into cities.</p>
<p>If the grids are big enough to prevent gerrymandering, too many people will be in the downtown LA grid and not enough in the rural Kern county grid.</p>
<p>If they are small enough to allow a proper balance, they are small enough to allow gerrymandering.</p>
<p>Also, grids have a hard time following federal court orders.</p></div>		</li>
