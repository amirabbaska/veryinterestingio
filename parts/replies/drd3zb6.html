<p>I asked my old neurologist in a panic once about emotional responses and MS (and me) because of some of the checkup questions they ask, and his general response was basically that the wiring is all laid side by side, which causes intense emotion to result in physical symptoms when there's an overload onto nearby paths - pain in your chest being the easiest example - so lesions up in that area can cause a slew of issues and systems confusion, both physical and emotional. </p>
<p>For completion sake, then we talked about specific brain damage related emotional dysfunction and it did nothing for my panic, as the usual conclusion was like &quot;MS can affect all that crap!&quot; and his passion for his work was akin to a child in a candy shop. Very willing to discuss things (passionately), even when it was off putting. But he let me hold the (real) skull in his office while we talked, so that was neat.</p></div>		</li>
