			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm replying to your comment because it stands out as &quot;on point&quot; and personally relevant.  Anyway, amongst those starting a career in academia, i.e. grad students mental illness is endemic.  This plog post cites and summarizes the results of 2 studies: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-love-and-war/201511/graduate-school-and-mental-illness-is-there-link" target="_blank">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-love-and-war/201511/graduate-school-and-mental-illness-is-there-link</a>.  In the first study, 47% of doctoral students at UC Berkely were deemed to fit the clinical criterion for depression.  Seems significant to me!  Question is, were they like that during high school? hehe.  There is so much more to look into here.</p>
<p>Anyway, grad school attracts the achievement oriented &quot;A&quot; students.   They've had a clear, mapped out plan for success and checked all the boxes on the route to accomplishment.  Then in grad school they face failure for the first time: they have a publication rejected, provoking an existential crisis.  Of course all those accolades from age 3 through age 21 may be to blame, but there are many other stresses of grade school: financial, social; the uncertainty of the future which generates anxieties of its own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say that's where we face big failure for the first time. You can bounce back from, say, a D in organic chemistry. There are ways to recover and stay on the upward ladder. In grad school you face the prospect of a terminal masters - bye bye, we aren't interested in having you do a dissertation, don't let the door hit you on the way out. Or you pass quals and even generate enough data to satisfy the thesis committee, but it's unpublishable. Or the big names in your increasingly narrow field say &quot;sorry, not looking for a postdoc&quot;. The stakes get higher and your chances of success gets lower and as you watch colleagues fail around you, you increasingly see that there are limited second chances. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, but it definitely applies to me.</p>
<p>I'm 15 months into my PhD and presented a poster at a conference recently. When I showed the first draft to my colleagues, they constructively tore it apart, but it felt genuinely embarrassing because I felt like I had 'failed'. It was the first time I had a chance to show my work to colleagues, and I felt like it bombed. At the conference itself, a few people discussed it with me but some were not convinced by my results.</p>
<p>It took me multiple weeks to get over the huge anxiety of facing my work again, and not convincing myself I was a useless fraud, or to talk to my supervisor without feeling stupid. </p>
<p>I now understand that failure is natural, and being successful is about how adaptatable you are to bumps in the road. But I learned this from my SO, who just finished his PhD. Academic departments aren't very tight - knit and are often lonely,  and because my problem is more personal than technical, it feels very inappropriate to bring up with my supervisor or colleagues (I.e. The best people to talk to, who have probably experienced the same). </p>
<p>I really try my hardest, I was a really good Masters student, but truthfully getting good grades in school taught me very little about being a successful PhD. </p>
<p>I don't mean to discount your point BTW - everyone is different, and most students go on to finish their theses - but although I have had anxiety/depression in the past, grad school really dumps you in the deep end at times. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What's to be uncertain about? If you go for a professorship, you almost certainly know that you WON'T get it! There's that scene from 3rd Rock From the Sun:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dick: Leon, of course it's wrong! The odds against <del>you're being right</del> [you being a professor] are... staggering! You have a great advantage, you know the outcome. You will <del>be wrong</del> [not be a professor]. Don't fear it, embrace <del>your wrongness</del> [it]!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know your point was on academics- but I have just completed a medical degree and I have to say, both anecdotally and statistically (in Australia at least) mental health problems in medical students and junior doctors is a massive problem. This is not just because of the emotional toll of facing death and disease, but also the personal psychological toll of study, the guilt about relying on parents to support you, or living off a tiny amount of money to attempt to support yourself. Plus a lot of students are used to being big fish in small ponds, and quite simply- I have never felt as unintelligent as I did on a daily basis during my degree. The guilt, pressure, personality type and job load all create a pretty nasty melting pot </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't generalise the stresses of academia to people with high levels of education in other jobs. Academics have unique stresses, especially to do with poor job security for many years, having to move city or country every few years during that time, and having many duties other than their actual academic role.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer I expected before opening the thread was that mental illness would be higher with more educated people. How do we know this isn't a reporting problem? If you are not educated you are also probably not someone who does everything you're supposed to do, like go to the doctor when you're sick. So it might not be that more educated people are reporting their mental health more often. They also have access to free college counseling in many cases. </p>
<p>My other hypothesis is that people who have more ambitions are more likely to develop depression. You go to school because you want to be successful, yet when you graduate you might not be able to find the job you want. So that would cause a lot of sadness and possible depression imo. </p>
<p>I'm not quite sure how they are working more stressful jobs if they get s degree. I'd say the more stressful jobs are often the ones that don't require a degree. An example of this would be in the service industry and construction. I know my job as a structural engineer is much less stressful than when I worked at Papa Johns. </p></div>		</li>
