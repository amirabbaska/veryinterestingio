			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating,  I had no idea that solar noon was even a thing!  I understand how our elliptical orbit would cause a shift.  Combine that with the earth slowly tilting on it's axis causes an uneven change in daylight hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously, thought I knew a little bit re: axial tilt and the sun's positions, but &quot;solar noon&quot;?? Sigh. The more I learn, the less I seem to know.........!</p>
<p>But I love all of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just a fancy name for when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. I go into a little more detail <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5kqq4u/in_the_northern_hemisphere_as_we_move_towards_the/dbrz2j1/" target="_blank">in this comment</a>, but the short version is that each town tended to keep its own time based on the solar day before time zones were created (in the 19th century/1800s).</p></div>		</li>

<p>The effects subtle, but you can just about see it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's awesome! I your program public? I actually just wrote a pretty crappy Excel macro to do the same (non graphical) calculation using NOAA data. I'm kind of embarrassed now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting, related thing is that the mean solar day is almost 4 minutes longer than the stellar/sidereal day because the distance that the Earth travels along its orbit in a day (about 2.5 million km) means it has to rotate about 361 degrees for the sun to return to the same relative angle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/usa/new-york" target="_blank">graph</a> you linked illustrates perfectly my hatred for DST. It would look SO much better without the blatant 1 h shift. </p></div>		</li>
