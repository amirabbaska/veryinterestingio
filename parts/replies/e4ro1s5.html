			<div class="markdown"><p>A huge factor in allowing water to enter is the lack of climate control. An unoccupied home is neither heated in winter, nor air conditioned in summer. This allows the materials making up the structure to expand and contract more than they would in an occupied home.</p>
<p>In addition to simple expansion and contraction, water can seep into small cracks during winter days, then freeze during the colder nights. This just accelerates the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned this the hard way. I never knew how sensitive the refrigerator can be. My roommate left for 10 days and I don't mind a cold house so I just shut off the heating and let the house drop to 40 degrees to save some electricity. Turns out the fridge needs to be in a room around 50+ degrees F to function properly. Had to throw out everything in there. While looking up why the fridge might be malfunctioning I learned a lot about what can happen to a house with no climate control too. I didn't know houses were so fussy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a huge part of it. The expansion and contraction in a home that is left to the elements is astounding.  A friend of mine has a deer camp with wood paneled walls, wood floors, wooden bar, all very rustic and beautiful. He keeps it slightly heated now in the winter and vented his roof more for the summer, because there was so much buckling and cracking due to the extreme cold and heat swings between seasons.  His bar is roughly 15' long and there were 1/2&quot;+ gaps at the ends of his trim boards.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our hospital moved a few years ago into a brand new facility. The old building was “mothballed” In order To attract potential buyers. Climate control was key to the entire operation. It didn’t have to be comfortable, but it had to control humidity. Folks in the community were a bit stunned when a few months later the entire structure was torn down. It turns out that the cost of maintaining the building was over $100,000 per month. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Years ago, a friend put in a steel and concrete foundation for a boathouse. &quot;Ice and water always win,&quot; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;Nah bro, this is 3' of concrete with steel reinforcement, this thing is built <em>solid</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Somehow, water started eroding the loon shit underneath the foundation, and the ice started some small cracks somewhere. Anyway, you can guess who was bitching about his poorly built boathouse within a decade. </p>
<p>EDIT: 3', not 3&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun story - a friend of mine is rather rich. He built a home, and declined to put in sprinklers because &quot;the biggest cause of damage during a fire is actually the water.&quot; Which is true - a fire caught early will mostly cause water damage. </p>
<p>I can't seem to get it through his skull that a fire caught late has much more damage in total. </p></div>		</li>
