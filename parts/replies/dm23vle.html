			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this to do with the age/deterioration of the heart itself, or the whole circulatory system?</p>
<p>I.e. could you replace somebody's heart with the heart of someone much younger and essentially prevent this kind of death?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not a doctor or anything close, but I would think the patient's body would be too far gone for such a thing. You see how their skin can just tear, their bones break easily, their immune system is easily compromised, etc. Possibly if the patient was younger and got a new heart at forty or fifty. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Blockage in coronary artery --&gt; heart attack --&gt; dead tissue in heart --&gt; scarring --&gt; reduced pumping function --&gt; enlargement of heart and thickening of walls (cardiomyopathy) --&gt; developed substrate for reentrant ventricular tachycardia / fibrillation --&gt; premature beats (PVCs) --&gt; one timed perfectly enough to create 200+ bpm reentrant circuit in scar (ventricular tachycardia) --&gt; degradation to ventricular fibrillation (cardiac arrest) --&gt; death. </p>
<p>Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death over cancer, stroke, accidents, etc. combined. This is one example of the circumstances that can lead to cardiac arrest. There are many others. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A heart transplant is a tremendous stress on the human body. Thousands are performed every year but they are not routine. There is also a shortage of  donor hearts, so it isn't necessarily a good use of resources to transplant one into someone who's like 95. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pacemakers are for slow heart rhythms (bradycardia). They typically don't let the heart get below 60 beats per minute. </p>
<p>Implantable defibrillators are pacemakers that will also shock the person back into normal rhythm if they go into cardiac arrest (vfib, heart rate &gt; 250 bpm). Think the &quot;clear&quot; paddles on TV but inside the person's body. </p>
<p>Many, many, many people go into cardiac arrest that don't have defibrillators. </p>
<p>If someone with a pacemaker dies, it will continue to pace but nothing will happen. Dead meat don't beat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll ultimately have something called electromechanical dissociation. This basically means the pacemaker will try to fire and stimulate the heart, the heart may be stimulated but it won't contract because of a secondary cause like low oxygen levels, acidosis, electrolyte problems etc. Eventually the pacemaker won't trigger the muscle at all because the muscle will effectively be dead or too sick to work </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by  &quot;dead or too sick to work&quot;?</p>
<p>Now this could be something completely different, but how would it be any different than the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxQmOR_QLfQ" target="_blank">dead dancing squid</a>?  I have always assumed that this is because the muscles are stimulated by something in the sauce they put in it, but I could be completely wrong.  What would stop electricity from being able to move the muscles, similar to this?</p></div>		</li>
