			<div class="markdown"><p>It's amazing what you can explain when you leave out jargon and unnecessarily technical terms at first. And then when people understand the idea as a whole, you can fill in the gaps in knowledge with the nitty gritty of the information and it'll make way more sense to the person you're explaining it to</p></div>		</li>

<p>To be clear, the right amount of detail was left out. The extra info required to make it &quot;accurate&quot; would have been distracting and confusing, and would have, at absolute best, not helped anyone to actually understand what's going on. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. And actually, you can do a very similar thing on a smaller (local) scale with ARP spoofing. Most networks are insecure against it.</p>
<p>Basically you go onto a network and say, &quot;Hey, look at me, I'm the router!&quot; and if you yell loud enough things start going to you instead of the router.</p>
<p>Make sure <em>you</em> then send traffic to the router and nobody can even tell the difference. Some routers will kick anyone who sends out ARP spam, but obviously only by hardware address, which can be changed.</p>
<p>Basically the only real way to protect against this is to use https on literally every site.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most modern switches now have protections against ARP spoofing. If they see gratuitous ARP requests being made, the switch port gets blocked thereby cutting of the attacking node.</p>
<p>Re the HTTPS requirement, there is always a potential to use ssl stripping, so in a network where ARP spoofing protections havent been configured, an attacker can still man- in-the-middle &quot;ssl traffic&quot;. Either by stripping away ssl so that comms are:
Victim --(http)--&gt;attacker--(https)--&gt;web app</p>
<p>Or by mitm the ssl connection:
Victim --(https; attacked self signed certificate)--&gt;attacker--(https)--&gt;web app</p>
<p>The latter will throw &quot;untrusted certificate errors&quot; if the self signed certificate is not a trusted root ca installed on the user's device. However this for a lot of users , they will just accept the warning and proceed.</p>
<p>Some (very effective) controls against this are the usage of HSTS and ssl-pinning. </p>
<p>PS: Apologies if there are non eli5 concepts in there. I'm typing on my phone (hence possible typos as well). If you'd like any clarification please let me know. Cheers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's worth noting that a faulty connection will be noticed and fixed fairly quickly - the network will detect things not getting to where they are supposed to as a fault. The person doing the man in the middle attack needs to either spoof the connection to make it look like it has been delivered or forward the message on to the actual correct destination. so this is not noticed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. Yes and no. </p>
<p>Think of it like a physical letter. The contents of the letter are sealed (encrypted), but… You need to know where to send it, so the from and to address are right there on the outside for everyone to see.</p>
<p>Now, if what you’re trying to do is general surveillance or to generate fake profiles, like were used on the FCC website, you don’t need much more than that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We found out from the snowden leaks that the FBI/NSA had tapped into Google and Yahoo (and maybe others') private clouds. Google and others would only encrypt data sent between google and the user, but when google would process your request in their private cloud, the encryption was stripped. FBI/NSA (and likely many others) could see pretty much anything that was happening between google's servers (and yahoo, and maybe others). </p></div>		</li>
