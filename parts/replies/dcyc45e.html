			<div class="markdown"><p>Bragg scattering doesn't apply to gases, only crystalline solids, and the notion of &quot;reflection&quot; really only applies to things with a well-defined surface (solids, liquids). For gases, you need to describe things in terms of scattering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, although taken down to single atom interactions the description becomes arbitrary. We use the terms to &quot;reflect&quot; our use of models at the macro scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also get some evanescent fields penetrating into the material (maybe a physicist would like to chime in, it's not my strong suit). This leads to a technique called surface plasmon resonance in which laser light is bounced off a gold sheet while proteins are flowed across the gold sheet on the other side. The binding of proteins can impact the specific reflective properties of the gold sheet in a detectable manner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so lets say a 2um laser. how deep in the material (say silicon) is it still feasible to get reflections from? amy idea?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He asked for properties at 2 microns. This link only provides information in the x ray energy range. </p>
<p>Pierce and Spicer measure the optical reflectance and photemission of amorphous silicon here: <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prb/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevB.5.3017" target="_blank">http://journals.aps.org/prb/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevB.5.3017</a></p>
<p>Within error, they seem to retrieve an absorption coefficient of nearly zero at 2um.</p>
<p>This means that at 2um, light should penetrate very deeply into the material, so you could conceivably have reflections from the back side of your silicon wafer. </p></div>		</li>
