			<div class="markdown"><p>Anything with a tart or sour taste is acidic (acids taste sour!). Fruit is generally acidic, with some kinds like citrus fruits being more acidic than others. Tomatoes are acidic. Vinegar is basically acetic acid diluted with water, meaning that anything pickled is going to be acidic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you ask any chef, they'll tell you that it's mostly the continued contact with metal that changes the flavor. Canned tomatoes will taste different than fresh tomatoes. Canned mushrooms will never be as good as fresh mushrooms. If you're cooking with canned ingredients though, you can usually adapt your recipe to overcome that canned flavor.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question, canned stuff will never taste the same as fresh stuff. It's kind of part of the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few bacteria won't affect the taste and safety, we definitely eat live and dead bacteria all the time. What you want to avoid is overgrowth of bacteria. You don't what to eat an entire colony of bacteria and the toxins they produce.</p></div>		</li>
