So really, all crops and livestock are in process, to a greater (e.g. maize) or lesser (e.g. Apios americana - potato bean) degree. Some of the newer crops to start the process of being cultivated and changed significantly from their wild state include the kiwi (from East Asia, but popularized in New Zealand and now grown in large quantities in places like Italy!) and Macadamia nuts (from Australia)</p></div>		</li>
