While it is less commonly used/pointed out, it is still a very strong authentication method when combined with the other three types.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is also done with IP addresses. The game Path of Exile (and probably many others) has a 2FA system that is only triggered if your physical login location looks unusual.</p></div>		</li>

<p>FTFY. On the flip side, support will remove it from your account if you want, but it's a small price to pay for the security it offers. Also, I'm not complaining GGG and PoE are awesome. Stoked for 3.0 in a few weeks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I had that one in there originally, but it's a relatively new kind of security layer, and I figured it could be technically slotted into 'something you are' because something you are not is where the security breach says you are.</p>
<p>Plus I wanted to keep it simple since all the security layers can get fuzzy sometimes. :P</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am the Queen of England -- yeah right</p>
<p>I am the Queen of England and have the correct PIN - OK, maybe you really are the Queen of England</p>
<p>I am the Queen of England, correct PIN, correct card, correct fingerprint - Yes Queen!</p>
