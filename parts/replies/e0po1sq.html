			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few different approaches. One is to look at amino acid distribution. Life uses 20 standard amino acids yet there are far more naturally occurring amino acids. We don't know why life picks only these to use but if we find a higher abundance of only certain amino acids (other then what you would expect to occur naturally) it could be a sign of life. Also, chirality (molecules that are the mirror image of each other) is a good place to start. Life on Earth is considered homochiral. It uses amino acids of only one chirality. So, if you saw an over abundance of one chiral form of amino acids it could also be a sign of life. Another way is to look for long-chained charged polymers (like DNA) that have been argued are need for storage and to pass on genetic information. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All you say is the alien life must be base on what we know about earth
You talk about amino acids and .... what is your approach about other life form maybe they arenâ€™t base on C or use C but other molecular chain than we know
Who you approach this question?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can use carbon isotopic signatures, though I don't know of any way to do that that doesn't require an on-site mass spectrometer. The Mars rovers use their mass specs for, among other things, these sorts of measurements.
Known metabolic pathways on earth tend to fractionate Carbon isotopes in specific and predictable ways, and we can use these signatures to look for life on other planets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No actually! So you'd have to analyze not-carbon, but it's not an unreasonable assumption to make that whatever element the life-form uses will exhibit a different isotopic signature than the background.
The reason this works is that one C isotope (I think it's carbon-12) is lighter and easier to use in metabolysis, so lide forms tend to be enriched in Carbon-12 relative to Carbon-13. Additionally, biogenic carbon chains tend to have different lengths than abiotic carbon chains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahhh, they have a suite of extremely miniaturized mass specs, I think an IR spec too for rock samples? I don't remember too well, sorry. I'd Wikipedia it</p></div>		</li>
