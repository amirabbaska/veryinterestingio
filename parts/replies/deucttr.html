<p>You have a toaster. It takes some slice-like things and burns it. You have a butter machine. Its input is to search the table for a butter plate and pass the butter. It passes butter.</p>
<p>If you built a machine that would take the output of the toaster and put it on your plate, and then trigger the butter machine to pass butter, you could then tell them their purpose, to which they would exclaim &quot;oh my god&quot;.</p>
<p>Each piece only knows about its inputs and outputs. What is my purpose? You pass butter.</p>

<p>If you want, I'll come back later tonight and clear things up!</p>
