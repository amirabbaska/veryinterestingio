			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the great answer, sums up what I'd guessed you must do. What I've always wondered though is how you handle sharp edges. Some mountains have very sharp ridge lines which surely would cut through cables over time. Then there's cliffs, doesn't the cable hanging over the side just drag the cable at the top down until it goes taught?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Near the shoreline or in areas where there is risk of external aggression (anchor dragging, fishing nets, etc.) the cable is armored and very, very tough.  In deep water, however, the cable is exposed polyethylene about an inch in diameter.  I don't know of anything special being done in areas of special abrasive concern.  (As I answered elsewhere, I'm an optics/electronics guy, so I hear stories from the route planning/laying guys, and I haven't heard anything.  There are only a few cable designs - basically heavily armored, lightly armored, and 'bare'.  I suspect if there is a troublesome abrasion area they might deploy the lightly armored stuff.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cable laying is suprisingly well controlled these days.  They first have a map of the ocean floor.  Then they have a 3-d model of the ship, plus currents, plus cable properties.  </p>
<p>So, if the cable has to go over a ridge, they make sure it isn't hanging.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Followup question. Does it occur that a cable breaks, partly or completely, and if so; what is the repair procedure in such a case? Really interesting :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>water erosion, being so much faster than wind, is unlikely to leave many sharp edges, actually.   ever found a sharp rock in a river bed?  while it happens, its pretty rare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps sharp was the wrong way to put it, I was more thinking about ridge lines where the ground falls away steeply each side. Even a blunt knife will cut if you put enough weight on it and I'd imagine a submarine cable weighs a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I interviewed for a company that makes pipes for oil/fluid purposes. The bore sizes are normally around 21 inches (at least these that the company makes, and they supply for pretty much all the large oil and gas companies globally) and these pipes tend to have multiple layers, so even if the first layer is ruptured, there are still other layers to prevent failure and spills. I've seen a destructive test for one segment and it takes so so much for it to critically fail. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My graduate degree (Electrical Engineering) was with specialty in fiber optics, and got a job in Bell Laboratories where the undersea technology was being developed.  Participated in the first trans-Oceanic cable lay and (pretty much by accident) actually spoke the first words between continents on optical fiber.  Woot!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If Cyrus West Field and Alexander Graham Bell could just read that comment. From Field's first mixed but eventually successful adventures with transatlantic telegraph cables and Bell's telephone experiments to &quot;I spoke the first words of nonsense through a transatlantic optical fiber cable. Woot!&quot; (And it came to me through such a cable) :)</p>
