			<p>Thanks for the great answer, sums up what I'd guessed you must do. What I've always wondered though is how you handle sharp edges. Some mountains have very sharp ridge lines which surely would cut through cables over time. Then there's cliffs, doesn't the cable hanging over the side just drag the cable at the top down until it goes taught?</p>		</li>

			<p>Near the shoreline or in areas where there is risk of external aggression (anchor dragging, fishing nets, etc.) the cable is armored and very, very tough.  In deep water, however, the cable is exposed polyethylene about an inch in diameter.  I don't know of anything special being done in areas of special abrasive concern.  (As I answered elsewhere, I'm an optics/electronics guy, so I hear stories from the route planning/laying guys, and I haven't heard anything.  There are only a few cable designs - basically heavily armored, lightly armored, and 'bare'.  I suspect if there is a troublesome abrasion area they might deploy the lightly armored stuff.)</p>		</li>

			<p>The cable laying is suprisingly well controlled these days.  They first have a map of the ocean floor.  Then they have a 3-d model of the ship, plus currents, plus cable properties.  <br><br>So, if the cable has to go over a ridge, they make sure it isn't hanging.<br><br>This video does a good job explaining it <a href="https://youtu.be/j6p0Mf_CAvg?t=1m17s" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/j6p0Mf_CAvg?t=1m17s</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Sharks were a concern early on, and there was some evidence (things that looked like broken teeth in a cable).  AT&amp;T did some fishing expeditions to try to identify what kinds of sharks presented a threat.  Eventually a version of the cable was developed with a metal layer around the outside under another layer of poly, basically to break the teeth of a predator.  I haven't hear of a problem since (but I'm not close to the repair guys as I once was...)</p>		</li>

			<p>electric fence? with enough to fry the squirrel? if you check it every evening or at least once a day you could probably have squirrel soup, fried squirrel with eggs, bbq squirrel, squirrel and potatoes. just remember to vary your diet bc they really don't have a lot of nutritional value as far as enough fat, vitamins&amp;minerals to support you for long. but enough to cover a meal a day. or you could give it to your dog.<br><br>why do you have fence lights? is this decorative or protective? and if protective what are you protecting? </p>		</li>

			<p>Something the others haven't touched on is how they identify where the break in the cable is.  It's pretty similar whether it's a conductor or optical cable.  Essentially you just send test signals down the cable, and you watch for what gets transmitted and what gets reflected.  A completely broken cable will fully reflect the signal, while a partially broken one tends to transmit some of it while also having a reflection.  Using time-domain reflectometry, you can actually measure the amount of time it takes for a reflection as well as looking at the attenuation (essentially decay) of the signal.  Since you know the speed it travels through the medium (typically about 1/3 the speed of light if you're using electrons, but I assume it's higher with photons in optical cables) and you can measure the elapsed time between when you sent a signal and when you received it, you can with surprisingly high precision and accuracy figure out where the break is.</p>		</li>

			<p>Damn.. I'm surprised they haven't figured out how to cut the cable other than dropping a giant pair of scissors down to the seabed. /s<br><br>Also <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Submarine_cable_repair_animation.gif/220px-Submarine_cable_repair_animation.gif" target="_blank">here's</a> the image /u/labroid is referring to. </p>		</li>

			<p>That's it.  Turns out there aren't giant scissors.  There is a special grapnel called a 'cut and hold' grapnel.  Think of a grapnel hook with a giant mouse-trap mechanism hooked to a steel blade and gripper teeth.  Drag that hook perpendicular to the cable until you snag it, grab it with the grippers, and set off the cutter.  It cuts the cable and holds one end so you can pull it up.  Then you do the dance with the ship as shown.</p>		</li>

			<p>Perhaps sharp was the wrong way to put it, I was more thinking about ridge lines where the ground falls away steeply each side. Even a blunt knife will cut if you put enough weight on it and I'd imagine a submarine cable weighs a lot.</p>		</li>

			<p>I interviewed for a company that makes pipes for oil/fluid purposes. The bore sizes are normally around 21 inches (at least these that the company makes, and they supply for pretty much all the large oil and gas companies globally) and these pipes tend to have multiple layers, so even if the first layer is ruptured, there are still other layers to prevent failure and spills. I've seen a destructive test for one segment and it takes so so much for it to critically fail. </p>		</li>

			<p>No, he was a nice guy, and when you call someone else, it is pretty hard to get the first word.  The first exchange was me saying &quot;Now what?&quot; and him saying &quot;This is the United States calling.&quot;<br><br>There is a special phone on the terminal equipment called an &quot;order wire&quot; that is used for the techs to talk to each other between cable stations.  For the first system, TAT-8, there were cable stations in England, France, and the USA.  The cable came most of the way across the Atlantic from the USA and then had a split (called a branching unit in the business) where one cable when to France and the other to England.  The France to England legs were already hooked up and the ship spliced the USA to branch connection last.  The order wire is kind of a party line that anyone can call anyone and you don't have caller ID.  I was in England the guys in France had just called several times at somewhat inconvenient intervals.  So when the phone rang again I naturally assumed it was the French guy again, but indeed the splice had been completed and the USA leg powered up and it was the US calling.  I had no way to tell before I picked up.  Oh, well...</p>		</li>

If you want to do field work, a good technician-grade training and willingness to go anywhere in the world to install/test.
