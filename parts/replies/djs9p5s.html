			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. He was my next door neighbor and I wasn't allowed to play with him when he was shooting... You know, cuz my parents knew someone could get hurt... I was walking down the street when he was in a vacant lot. I turned to say hi and he shot one off the hip to see if he could hit me.</p>
<p>He could.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, my papa had his left eye pop out when a pipe exploded and ripped half his face off while working under a truck. He regained full vision in the eye, just has a large scar on his face (though it's super faded now). So it's not completely done for if it pops out, there's still a possibility it'll regain function. </p></div>		</li>
