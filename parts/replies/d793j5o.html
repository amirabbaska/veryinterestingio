			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct as to why the images aren't displayed as well, but there are two other reasons for why we don't take as many photos of the poles. The weather is often terrible and there isn't a tremendous amount of interest in those regions. It would be too expensive to take much aerial imagery, and satellite imagery of that area is often completely covered in clouds. One other reason satellite imagery isn't taken much is for those satellites that can see the poles, the use of an earth fixed coordinate system introduces singularities at the poles that are inconvenient to work around.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's twice the size of Australia. Most trips are just to the South Pole and back, and even that's 1800 miles. </p>
<p>The most recent successful trip was by the Expeditions 7 team, which traveled to and from the South Pole in 18 days. </p>
<p>I say successful because the most recent attempt was earlier this year by explorer Henry Worsley, who tried to make the first solo and unaided trip to the pole and back. He died of a combo of exhaustion, dehydration, and an infection.</p>
<p>Edit: As /u/ioar pointed out, Worsley attempted the first solo trip all the way through Antarctica, not to the pole and back. That trip has already been done solo (which is incredible).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you mean first to cross the antartic continent?
Aleksander Gamme did a solo-unaided trip from the antartic coast to the pole and back in 2011/2012 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole#1950.E2.80.93present" target="_blank">link</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, is there anything that makes crossing the continent more difficult than to the poles and back, other than not getting to choose the closest point to the pole and doing it from there? Or did he just get unlucky in his solo attempt?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. The top and bottom edge of a Mercator projection map (as used for most navigation, including Google maps) represent a single point in space (for most intents and purposes). As you go further away from the equator each square inch of map depicts less and less actual land meaning satellite imagery of similar resolution will appear to be reducing its resolution towards the poles on maps of this type. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you have to choose one projection at a time, though there are lots of different projections to choose from, depending on what your purpose is.  There is a lot of debate about what the &quot;best&quot; projection is (if there even is such a thing).  My favorites for general purposes are various versions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_equal-area_projection#/media/File:Cylindrical_equal-area_projection_SW.jpg" target="_blank">cylindrical equal area projection.</a>  I like these because they </p>
<p>1) show relative sizes of countries accurately. Most people get the idea from Mercatur maps that Africa is much smaller than it is, and that Greenland is huge.</p>
<p>2) preserves east-west and north-south accurately- most Americans don't realize how far north Europe is, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But even with Google Earth and it displayed on a globe, there's not high detail for the poles and elevation data seems to be completely lost at high <del>altitudes</del> latitudes, showing everything as a flat plain (at least it was like this last time I looked with Google Earth).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is more <em>area</em> available but the resolution is determined by the original images. If the pixels per meter of actual land is constant then as meters of land/centimeters of map goes down, so does the resolution. </p></div>		</li>
