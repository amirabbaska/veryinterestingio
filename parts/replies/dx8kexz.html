<p>I think this is the key point here, though.</p>
<p>It's pretty easy to say that &quot;the moon orbits the earth&quot; and that &quot;the earth orbits the sun&quot;, because they are gravitationally bound to their parent body and will never leave this orbit because they just don't have enough energy to esacpe.</p>
<p>However, this whole idea of an &quot;orbit&quot; does get muddied very hard in many-body systems and on larger scales. We say that &quot;Pluto and Charon and the other moons orbit a common barycenter&quot;, but what does that mean, really? They all follow almost chaotic paths and the only reason that system doesn't rip itself apart is because it fell into a resonance (probably by ejecting quite a few other moons). Is &quot;orbiting&quot; really a good word for that?</p>
<p>And on larger scales, the concept of an &quot;orbit&quot; pretty much stops working. Galaxies are buzzing around pretty chaotically within their clusters, probably never passing through the same position twice or completing something that we would call &quot;one orbit&quot;. </p>
<p>On even larger scales, this stops working entirely because dark energy starts to dominate and have a much bigger impact than &quot;the whole universe&quot; around it.</p>
<p>That's why i think that formulating a thing that's the &quot;center of gravity of the entire universe&quot; is pretty meaningless.</p>
<p>I also believe that the word &quot;orbit&quot; works for certain situations but misses the point in other situations.</p></div>		</li>
