			<div class="markdown"><p>If you could also add an edit to explain the skin effect too. Basically, the higher the frequency of the signal transmitted through the cable, the less of the cable the electricity uses. </p>
<p>By using many thin wires and braiding them, you use the cable more efficiently, and by braiding the cable you help utilize more of the cable with less internal crosstalk and better external noise rejection. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be thinking stranded wire which is different from twisted pair.</p>
<p>The skin effect is just that at A.C. frequencies current transfer along the outer portion of the conductor but that's not really relevant to twisted pair wiring. </p>
<p>Two very different concepts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, that is true. I still think it light be useful to include as twisted pair and stranded cabling often go hand in hand in a lot of situations. The “twist” OP was talking about seemed a bit ambiguous to me.</p></div>		</li>
