<p>Since we are taking the infinite limit, this pushed the laboratory to the boundaries of the space you're in possibly to infinity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding infinity, is the expansion of the universe involved in the amount of <em>space</em>? If it is, wouldn't we have to keep building the laboratory <em>until</em> the expansion stops at a certain point (if it ever does)? Was talking to my mom the other day about the expansion of the universe and it brought up the question: is the expansion of the universe increasing the size of space as a whole or just what we can measure? </p></div>		</li>

<p>I suppose it depends on if the universe is infinite or not. However for any local patch of space, it appears to increase in size as time goes forward. This is why galaxies seem to appear to all be rushing away from us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can offer a cosmologists perspective which is that space itself is increasing. Thus the amount of volume between two objects otherwise in a static configuration, is increasing. BUT due to this expansion and light becoming ever more redshifted, we actually will be able to observe less and less as time goes on even as time increases</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this true. That as space expands there becomes a limit of which Galaxy's we could travel to. Like if you left right now to go to the nearest galaxy you could make it there eventually. But at a certain point in the future you would be unable to reach it by traveling at the speed of light. Since the rate at which the distance to the Galaxy is increasing. Eventually the rate of the distance will be going faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>Do you get what I'm saying? I'm not exactly sure of how to word it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a real concept, it just can't be applied everywhere. &quot;Small infinity&quot; doesn't make sense, not without a rigorous definition of small, then maybe. Math is simply the language we use to talk about physics, it can be used for other things too. Physical infinities are irrelevant to the existence mathematical infinities. Same goes for anything in math. For instance, there are numbers so big they can't be used to count anything in our universe, yet they're simple natural numbers. Infinity isn't any different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is more of a philosophical question. Certainly we use infinity in math and theoretical physics. But in my view, infinity is only a tool of human beings, and is not &quot;out there&quot; in nature.</p></div>		</li>
