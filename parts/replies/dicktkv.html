			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect the &quot;runaway greenhouse effect&quot; would likely be the worst possible case. This means that warming continues to increase as various feedback mechanisms reinforce the current trends (i.e., people have speculated that various types of methane and other compounds with carbon could be released from deep oceans and high latitudes as a result of climate change, which would then accelerate climate change). <em>Venus is commonly held to have experienced a runaway greenhouse event, and is likely uninhabitable for anything we'd recognize as life.</em>^1</p>
<p>As for likely scenarios (and I'm a human-plant-fungus kind of thinker, so take my word for what it is), I think we can expect massive disruptions to agriculture and human well-being. These are already occurring in many parts of the world, as increased heat, higher sea levels, and changed precipitation patterns stress what were once stable subsistence practices. Saltwater intrusion to rice paddies, movement of insect herbivores and microbial pathogens into new territory, and mismatches between local environment and crop genetics is becoming commonplace. We'll likely start to see the effects in the &quot;first world&quot; in the next few years, if you haven't seen the signs already.</p>
<p>I largely work in the Arctic and coastal areas these days, and we're seeing massive changes in subsistence hunting, fishing, and foraging activities. Sealanes are disrupted by changing patterns of sea-ice, and the political situation with the &quot;opening of the Arctic&quot; is <em>dicey</em>, to put it mildly and nicely. Even in the US and Canada, local communities (whether indigenous or otherwise) are seeing pretty serious disruption to lifestyles from a changing environment. Thawing permafrost and eroding shorelines, for example, are causing serious issues to arise with critical infrastructure (water purification, refueling, power generation, SAR missions, etc.). </p>
<hr />
<p>^1 I did not intend to suggest that Earth would become like Venus as a &quot;worst case scenario.&quot; I was merely suggesting, by way of analogy, that &quot;runaway greenhouse effects&quot; can be inhospitable to life:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Runaway: in this context, reinforcing feedback loops, such as those likely to be produced by increased methane emissions from thawing permafrost and microbial decomposition of hitherto inaccessible organic materials.</p>
</li>
<li>Greenhouse effect: this shouldn't require explanation in this context, but the &quot;blanketing&quot; effect caused by increasing concentrations of &quot;greenhouse gases&quot; like CO2, methane, and NOx.</li>
</ul>
<p>For reference to why I used Venus as an analogy, please consider the <a href="https://skepticalscience.com/Lee-commentary-on-Burgess-et-al-PNAS-Permian-Dating.html" target="_blank">Permian Extinction</a>, which is what I had in mind for &quot;worst case scenario of runaway greenhouse effect.&quot; Climate change even 1/10th as severe as that runaway greenhouse event now would cause massive, completely incomprehensible and catastrophic changes. Likely? I hope not. Possible? Why not?</p>
<p>I thought more people would be familiar with &quot;Venus, a greenhouse planet, is inhospitable to life&quot; than with &quot;beware the second coming of the Permian Extinction!&quot;</p>
<p>n.b. Thank you to /u/informed_yet_stupid for pointing out that the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum is probably an even better match for &quot;worst case scenario&quot; than the Permian Extinction. A similarly developing &quot;runaway greenhouse effect&quot; with similar consequences seems plausible at this point. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I grew up a market farmer, <em>this</em> keeps me up at night.  People really do not appreciate how 'farm-to-table' our food supply is.  Ask Venezuela or famine stricken Africa what it's like to have a disruption in food systems.</p>
<p>I am personally going to be brushing up on the agricultural products that thrive in agri-zones that are much to my south, expecting that i'll be tearing up the lawns, cemeteries
and parks around me struggling to feed ourselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your plan of action is pretty reasonable. My current field of research is in community resilience and is largely motivated by the same underlying fear. Although my doctoral research proved how little I actually know about how plants, humans, and microbes interact, I <em>did</em> learn that our agricultural systems are incredibly fragile over any length of time. We're going to spend a lot of time, energy, and resources on learning how to feed people in a different way over the next 100 years...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the other posters nailed it: I am an interdisciplinary scientist who primarily works on the ecology of linked human, plant, and fungal systems. My doctoral research was on the function of cryptic fungal symbionts on invasive plants. I currently work on integrated observing systems in the Arctic and high-elevation rangelands, which also has a lot to do with the relationship of humans and plants (although less so with fungi these days, unfortunately). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sea level rise is the most dramatic - <a href="https://sealevel.nasa.gov/understanding-sea-level/projections/empirical-projections" target="_blank">NASA</a> has collated the projections from a bunch of models and <a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/slr/#" target="_blank">NOAA has a tool</a> you can play with to see the impacts on coastal regions. For a sense of the scale of that impact,<a href="http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/websites/retiredsites/natdia_pdf/3hinrichsen.pdf" target="_blank"> half the worlds' population lives within 200km of a coastline.</a> </p>
<p>Other affects increased droughts (which will cause huge food insecurity, especially near the equator) and increased frequency and severity of storms. Warming will allow the ranges of tropical pathogens to spread outward - a lot of major diseases in the tropics are mosquito-borne, and are limited by the range tolerances of their hosts; increased flooding and wetlands in many places will also provide a lot of new habitat for infectious diseases (<a href="http://www.who.int/globalchange/publications/climatechangechap6.pdf" target="_blank">WHO report (pdf)</a>). We can expect major extinctions of species whose ranges can't shift as quickly as the climate changes, or which are bound by some other geographical constraint. </p>
<p>Even moderate-case scenarios are going to involve increased storms and drought (which we are already seeing cause serious famines in parts of Africa [ie. South Sudan]) and increased coastal flooding. These ecological impacts will have corresponding social and economic ones, but that's getting out of my range of expertise. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a little confused on using the NOAA tool. Is it supposed to show where the sea level will be given various scenarios? I live near the west coast in southern California, when using the vulnerability setting it shows that areas near where I live that are pretty much right by the coast won't be too badly affected but some areas much more inland than me are colored dark red. How is this possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It incorporates elevation in addition to proximity to the coast, so a low-lying inland area that is currently marshy or has a high water table is more vulnerable than a cliff-y/higher elevation coastal area. There's documentation of their methodology on there somewhere, don't have it at hand at the moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you read the NASA article I posted (and I believe there were newer projections in April), the modeled sea level rise with climate change is anywhere from 0.5 to 2ish meters higher than the expected rise based on the natural trend. The difference between 0.3 meters by 2100 and 3+ meters is quite significant in terms of coastal/human impact. Worst case scenarios I've seen are in the 7-10 meter range. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth used to be about 10 degrees centigrades warmer during dinosaurs' time. IMO it will likely continue to exist in some livable form. Question is how different is it going to be locally and how fast will the change be? Nobody cares about Mali these days because most of its land is a sandy desert. Is Mexico going to do the same and if yes will the 100 million people living there want to move into US to find livable lands? Is China going to become more of a desert and want to invade Siberia for its population? What will India do if their monsoon seasons (that allow for rich agriculture) be disrupted? Will they seek to emigrate into Europe? What about Africa? Into Europe also?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found this line of argument to be the most effective for people who doubt climate change.

<p>The question is how many people will die a likely violent death because of unavoidable migrations. Some argue that the current migrations from North Africa and Middle east into Europe is only exacerbated by the civil wars, but in reality is partially caused by worsening climates in those areas leading people to want to find libable opportunities elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>
