			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotta say I used to hate the thought of having to have a drip, and then had a really bad stomach ulcer that meant I had to have 5 going into me at once lol. They’re genuinely not as bad as you’d think (especially when you’re already high on the pain and/or painkillers), more annoying than anything else when they finish the drip and you have to sit around with valves flopping into your food when you try to eat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You basically just pray for a good nurse or phlebotomist for all your sticking needs, unfortunately.</p>
<p>If you get a good one, though, you'll never feel a thing. If you feel it, they're usually eh. If your arm turns black and blue, you know you found a bad one and time to request someone else have a go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really?</p>
<p>Mind you, I never got it for immunizations, but in my hospital stays I have definitely been given some sort of anesthetic before some injections though I don't remember what.  I've been poked so many time for IV's and blood draws they all run together, but I THINK it was a blood draw of some kind.  I've gotten the offer maybe 3 or so times.  Never my standard nurses, always lab techs of phlebotomists I believe (not sure which).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this something that's not COMMONLY done for adults? Or not done at all?</p>
<p>Fuck, I'd pay $20 to not feel the nurse fucking my arm with the needle when she takes blood (this time, the lady went so deep I can only assume she hit muscle or something from how much it hurt at the end). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They used this on me once before surgery about 15 years ago. The numbing agent hurt worse than them putting in the IV, and they still missed the vein so they had to do it again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I regularly get IVs and have had this quite a few times. But in my experience too, the shot of lidocaine hurts worse than the IV itself. It’s a painful burning sensation that’s honestly a bit of a shock when you first feel it. It does help to not feel the nurse digging around for a vein, but I’m on the fence about it now. If they do it, cool. And if they don’t do it, that’s fine too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had foot surgery about 20 years ago.  The gave me a general to knock me out in order to give me the local, then woke me up for the surgery.  I guess the foot is very sensitive, and putting needles in for the local would have been very painful, but they didn't want to keep me under for a surgery that didn't really need it.</p></div>		</li>
