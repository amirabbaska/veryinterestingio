She never once cheated/stole/lied to get a sale she was just good to her customers and had very good customer perception, another banker at her same bank was doing all this, she got fired... as far as I know they were never pressured to do anything wrong, it was personal choice... I was very good friends with her manager, he was fired months later for taking a 60k loss but not for the account issue.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fired for being a low-performer.  Whether or not that was due to a willingness (or not) to fake account signups is debateable, but you're going to have every shithead of a bad sales employee blaming this for their bad numbers now.  Essentially impossible to sort out after the fact.</p>
<p>Plenty of WF sales folks (I refuse to call them bankers - they are just retail sales employees) made their numbers without shady stuff.  Plenty more felt pressured to keep up with those high performers but didn't have the skills and/or customer base to do so.  Thus the shitshow.</p></div>		</li>
