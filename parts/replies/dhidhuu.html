			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer.  I just want to add something out w/r/t the first kind, which is really what most people mean when they talk about &quot;tolerance.&quot;</p>
<p>Let's say you take some opioids.  Let's say three things happen: nausea, euphoria, and constipation.  (Those are pretty classic responses to opioids.)  You will gain tolerance to these three things, but at different rates, and to different degrees, because the body's feedback response to these three things happens in different places, via different means, even though the response is to the exact same chemical.  You'll gain tolerance to the nausea very, very rapidly.  You'll develop tolerance to the euphoria more slowly.  And you might not ever develop tolerance to the constipation, so if you keep increasing the dose to maintain the euphoria, the constipation is going to get worse and worse.</p>
<p>A different example might be caffeine.  Everybody's heard that if you drink a cup of coffee it dehydrates you.  Well, maybe the first time.  This is an effect you gain tolerance to more rapidly than you gain tolerance to the stimulating properties.  If you're a long-term, heavy coffee drinker, you might get slightly less stimulation out of it, but there'll be very little diuretic effect (diuretic means it makes you pee), and you'll get more water from drinking coffee than you lose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, man, caffeine is a mad diuretic for me- coffee or tea. To the point, where I've had to stop drinking both, altogether.
...now, if I just held out until it got to the point where I didn't have to pee... gawd bless!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>Most supplements the body treats them similar to food,heck vitamins are even found it food, so it can digest them and break them into parts that it knows how to get rid of, or it can directly filter them from the blood and pee them.</p>
<p>Usually you have water soluble vitamins, these are the safest for overdosing since you'll just pee them, but some might still do damage even if you can get rid of them fast (in case of big overdoses)</p>
<p>You also have fat soluble vitamins, like vitamin D (which is not really a vitamin, I know it's called that but it's closer to a hormone). It gets stored in the fat and it can be released at a later date.
Vitamin D is not that easy to overdose, but fat soluble vitamins can be more dangerous since they are stored in the fat so you can take a higher dose for a while and not feel anything and it accumulates over months inside your fat tissues until you have so much in the fat that you burn the fat and it gets released in great quantities at once in the blood and the body has a hard time to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Minerals and the like usually can just be peed as well in the case of an overdose and it strains the kidneys.</p>
<p>Usually unless you try really hard it I wouldn't worry about vitamin overdoses</p>
<p>Other types of supplements like say creatine or protein? They usually are peed out as well, our bodies can't store protein so eating too much of it won't help you, but it might strain the kidneys.</p>
<p>I think creatine can be stored to a degree but I am not entirely sure on it.</p>
<p>Some other forms of supplements (like DHEA) can bind to receptors and are closer to hormones or drugs, depends on the supplement really, but usually most of these can't be sold over the counter.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a quick note.  Some of the fat soluble vitamins (E and K) are not that hard to overdue.  And way over doing it with the water soluble ones, like you say, can be tough on the kidneys.  </p>
<p>An interesting mechanism that causes problems when people are over zealous to tune the knobs of nutrition is the idea of disturbing enzyme co-factor equilibria. Most essential vitamins and minerals are important because they get incorporated into proteins as accessories that help the protein perform some reaction. Zinc, Manganese, Magnesium, Iron, Selenium (this actually gets build into a specialized Amino Acid, which is cool) are all metals that are used by various enzymes and proteins for different reasons.  </p>
<p>But if you saturate the body with one substance that is at all similar in size, shape, and reactivity it is possible for that substance to replace the proper co-factor and then the proper one will be excreted since it's not needed. This is more common for metals since, obviously, they are less distinguishable than many vitamins.  </p>
<p>Think of it this way. You're the enzyme for eating soup - so you're designed (evolved, whatever) with a special notch for holding a spoon. Now if you're in the body of an over zealous health nut that  fills the system with forks...the fork will fit nearly as well into your spoon notch, but it will not be very helpful for eating your soup.  </p>
<p>cheers</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The supplements usually dont have compounds the body can even make use of, and the ones that it can use, most people already eat enough of it. Like yes you need zinc, but only a very very small amount. So vitamins mostly just get flushed out.</p></div>		</li>
