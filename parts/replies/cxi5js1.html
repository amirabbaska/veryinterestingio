			<div class="markdown"><p>god fucking dammit man.  I don't care how old the culture is this shit needs to stop.  Fuck anybody that harms animals</p>
<p>Ediiiiiit:  <del>jesus. Yes I am 95% vegan. I buy half a cow twice a year from a local farm. I can see them roaming free every day on my commute that YES often times I bike to.</del></p>
<p>Edit edit: Ok for fucks sake. </p>
<p>Since apparently you cannot say you're &quot;95% vegan&quot;...
Half a cow between four people every six months. And all other foods and ingredients aside from the beef is vegan. Yes that means no egg or cheese and stuff like that. I use the Veganomican book--basicallly a bible for recipes. </p>
<p>No I'm not perfect. So take your <strong>&quot;gotchya&quot;</strong> bullshit elsewhere. I try to be as responsible as I can be with my food source. I do not eat chicken or eggs. Or cheese. Or fish. </p>
<p>I don't know why I still eat beef as much as I do but it is very little. probably twice a week. And it is from the aforementioned cows from my local farm that roam pastures and are slaughtered humanely (I've been there while they did it as a teaching moment for my kid).  </p>
<p>And yes, &quot;a vegan and a crossfitter and an atheist walk in to a bar&quot; joke....But as you can see I didn't initially say anything about veganism until the reddit mob demanded explanations and made assertions about western meat industry. </p>
<p>Anybody need anymore details or are we just about neckbeard assumptions on reddit</p>
<p>Christ. RIP inbox. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of those practices are illegal in The Netherlands. If you want to look up the new systems that are in development, look up &quot;Het rondeel&quot; it's likely the most viable and animal friendly chicken coop of the moment. Castrating boars was also made illegal this year, cutting tails is also being worked on by giving them more stimulation and reducing the numbers of animals in the group to reduce stress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's ridiculous to treat these issues as &quot;China&quot; versus &quot;the west&quot;.  </p>
<p>It's actually fuckwit humans everywhere who are prepared to torture animals versus people who think it's wrong to inflict needless pain on other living things.  </p>
<p>And whether bad stuff happens in &quot;the west&quot; has no bearing on whether torturing bears to extract their bile is ok.</p></div>		</li>
