			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention atmospheric friction. In space forums the notion of rail guns up Mount Chimborazo or something similar is periodically suggested. </p>
<p>Achieving orbital velocity in our atmosphere would result in a dynamic pressure of around 36,000 kilopascals. Max Q for a typical ascending rocket is around 35 kilopascals. A severe hurricane is around 3 kilopascals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, assuming the velocity vector doesn't point back into earth's atmosphere. From LEO (Low Earth Orbit) you'd need a nearly horizontal velocity vector or else you'd have a perigee in the atmosphere (aerobraking) or beneath the earth's surface (lithobraking).</p>
<p>A 9.2 km/s horizontal velocity at 300 km altitude will give you an apogee of 10,000 kilometer altitude.</p>
<p>10.2 km/s at 300 km will give you an apogee of around 36,000 kilometer altitude.</p>
<p>It is possible to escape earth's gravity well with less than escape velocity, though. Have the apogee near the edge of the Hill Sphere and the sun's tidal influence can tear a rocket loose from earth and pull a it into a heliocentric orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the temperature and gravity change, does standing af the north pole feel different from standing on the equator? Or since the rest of your body is going the same speed, would it not feel any different?</p></div>		</li>
