			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't say for this particular problem, but because simple calculators only need to provide a few places of precision, and because even cheap microprocessors can do floating-point operations quickly, calculators do sometimes use crappy, brute-force algorithms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the most efficient method is to take the number and round it modulo one half</p>
<p>The bablylonian approximation is super efficient for square roots. The remainder can then be approximated via a taylor series. </p>
<p>This is at least how I would code it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to irrational numbers, I think most calculators just cut them off at a certain amount of decimals. I just calculated 2^pi , and it came back as 8.824977827. According to that same calculator, pi = 3.141592654. I ask myself, &quot;Why would you need more than 9 decimals of pi?&quot;. In practice, that's 9/1,000,000,000 that you're missing out on in precision. </p>
<p>It's just not worth putting in the computing power to calculate the more precise, out of 3.141592654 and 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286 208998628034825342117067982148086513282306647093844609550582231725359408128481 1174502841027019385211055596446229</p></div>		</li>
