<p>Do they have to reposition the satellite every experiment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hubble can't manoeuvre on it's orbit, it can only point at different parts of the sky. The programmes during a cycle (i.e. a year) are all arranged such that they make the best use of the telescope's time. Most target's are only observable during part of the year, some during extremely narrow windows. Each project is broken down into visits, during which the telescope acquires the field and a guide star (for tracking the sky) and conducts some sequence of observations. Most programmes lose observation time as the telescope passes behind the Earth, it's too slow to point to a new target as that happens. Some projects are conducted all in one visit (if they are small), others can span years.</p></div>		</li>
