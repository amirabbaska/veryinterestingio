<p>We started counting passwords once and we each had an average of about 25 to 30. That includes internal systems and then any personal stuff like social media. Ain't nobody remembering 30 separate passwords much less changing them over every couple of months. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you start counting your personal ones I bet you have a lot more. I started using LastPass a few years ago, and I have everything in it from sites like Reddit and imgur, banking (including sites like PayPal and square), credit cards, mortgage, health care records, shopping sites (amazon, newegg, think geek, monoprice, redbubble, woot, steam, etc) ... you get the idea.</p>
<p>I have about 230 entries. Especially when you consider that many of these sites are ones I use once a year or less, there is <em>literally no way</em> I could have unique, secure passwords for each one without a tool like this. It's insane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lastpass is great, but it's default &quot;machine authentication&quot; setting is stupid as hell. Changed my email password, then got prompted to authenticate my machine to get the password, and they'd send the password to... my e-mail.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, Lastpass is the only way I can have decent passwords, and the ones that should be the most secure (like my work login) are the least secure because I have to actually remember those and legally can't use a password manager. Whereas my Reddit password is a 15-character string and I could happily change it weekly if I wanted to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been using a password manager for a little over a decade now (I've been migrating/importing the database to new apps as old ones die) and it has 794 entries. I'm sure at least half of them are crap I'll never log into again, but hey, at least I have the password!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My last company made us use passwords that are 16 characters, and a mix of caps, symbols, numbers, and lowercase. And they typically expire within a couple months. Since absolutely nobody could possibly keep track of any of these damn passwords, I promise you that 1q1q1q1q!Q!Q!Q!Q or some variant thereof (when it expires, you use 2w2w2w2w@W@W@W@W) would work on like 98% of our systems.</p>
<p>Oh and my company is the government. The government is fucking retarded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's what I was saying to some other guys, people will take the path of least resistance. You could memorise a random set of values every month, but someone's just going to go and either write it down or create a pattern of some sort. Human minds just don't remember patternless values very well. That's why those people who remember decks of playing cards are so impressive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit because people are asking: running unauthorized software is against policy and is grounds for termination. Otherwise I would be running Chrome via special means. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Except ourpassword rules also make it worse. We make passwords that are hard for us to remember and easy for computers to guess.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, if you're not going to use a password manager, you <em>should</em> be writing them down. At least outside of an office environment.</p>
<p>&quot;Easy to find&quot; doesn't matter inside your home, unless you're worried about your friends and family exploiting you. Burglars aren't likely to be after your passwords, and if even they are, once they can unplug your computer and take it with them, all you're doing with keeping the passwords from them is making it more inconvenient for them. That extra inconvenience isn't nothing, but you're trading that little bit of security for a massive, <strong>massive</strong> weakness in having easier to remember and/or reused passwords.</p>
<p>Basically, the rule is</p>
<ol>
<li>Use a password manager.</li>
<li>If you won't use a password manager, pick long random things and write them down.</li>
<li>At this point, if you still can't be bothered, you're probably vulnerable no matter what you do, but at least you can use a few long random passwords for your most important sites. You'll be hacked eventually, but probably nothing life-changing.</li>
<li>If you won't do that either, just wire the contents of your bank account to a Russian. There's no other option that prevents him from getting it anyway, and at least you won't have wasted your time trying.</li>

<p>Honestly, since I started using a password manager (LastPass, which is free) my life has gotten a lot simpler. All my accounts have the maximum-length password allowed by that particular bank or website or whatever. It's way more secure, because no script is ever going to guess a password like &quot;EFn*Nok43dsi24@-$wQL#2aZ%7&quot; and I don't have to remember shit.  I wish I'd been using this for the last 10 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More-importantly, it means that you're using a different password for every site, so if Bob's Discount Chatting About Shit Forum gets hacked and it turns out that they didn't hash passwords (or they didn't <a href="http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/" target="_blank">do it properly</a>), then the hacker only has your password for Bob's Discount Chatting About Shit Forum, and not any of your other accounts.</p>
<p>People who don't use password managers routinely reuse passwords, and in this case when one account is compromised hackers can break into your others, too. People think their banks are the important ones to protect, but really it's your email and social network accounts that are the first things attackers will often go for, because these can often be used to log in to (or reset the passwords for) other services anyway, plus you can do some spectacularly good identity theft and extortion if you can capture somebody's email or social accounts.</p>
<p>The moral: use different passwords for everything. Use a system, like a password manager, to make that easy.</p></div>		</li>
