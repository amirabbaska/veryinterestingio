			<div class="markdown"><p>What you gave is motivation for why we define 0! as 1, but it's definitely not a proof. The first few lines you wrote are valid because as you wrote 4! is <em>defined</em> as 4x3x2x1 and 5! is <em>defined</em> as 5x4x3x2x1. But this line of reasoning is only justified because we already know the definition of n-1 factorial. You're assuming that 1! should equal 1 x 0!, this is certainly a reasonable assumption and is the one taken in standard mathematics but it is not provable </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can we keep doing this for negative numbers?</p>
<p>(-1)! = 0!/0 = 1/0 = undefined</p>
<p>(-2)! = (-1)!/-1 = undefined/-1 = undefined</p>
<p>etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, you <em>could</em> do it. But you'd continue to get undefined answers. The factorial function can only be applied to non-negative integer values.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you'll find that in the extension of the factorial to the entire complex plane (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function" target="_blank">gamma function</a>), the negative integers are undefined.</p></div>		</li>
