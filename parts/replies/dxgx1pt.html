<p>There are other minor keys, as someone mentioned, but the natural minor key for A minor has the same notes as C Major, but the way you would play them would be different. The idea behind the roman numerals is that it isn't the actual chord that you play that's important, but where you are in the scale that matters.</p>
<p>So the standard pop progression is a I V vi IV progression (traditionally you notate a minor chord with lowercase roman numerals); it doesn't matter if your I is a C or your I is a G, if you're playing the root major chord, fifth major chord, sixth minor chord, and fourth major chord in the progression, you can sing the tune over it (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ" target="_blank">Four Chords Song</a> by Axis of Awesome for this in practice). This is also useful if you are playing a song that was originally played in, say, C major, but your singer has a range that's more suited for E major: just use the E Major progression instead of C major and you're good.</p>
<p>But if you take it and transpose it into a minor key, well..</p>
<p>So a C major song with that progression would have the chords C major, G Major, A Minor, F Major.</p>
<p>If you're playing in A Minor, you'd play A Minor, E Minor, F Major, D Minor which would sound similar but different.</p></div>		</li>

In addition to other good answers here, every major key has what's called a relative minor, which is the same exact notes, but starting and ending on different notes (2 steps down/6 steps up the scale, in the case of the natural minor). And in fact, for every major key, you can actually get 7 different scales out of it by starting on the 7 different notes (7 because the 8th is the octave, which is the same note higher up). These different scales are called <em>modes</em>. Modes are an important part of a lot of music, particularly jazz.</p>
<p>Here's the 7 modes and their examples in the root key of C:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ionian/Major Scale: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.</li>
<li>Dorian: D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D.</li>
<li>Phrygian: E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E.</li>
<li>Lydian: F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F.</li>
<li>Mixolydian: G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G.</li>
<li>Aeolian/Natural minor scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A.</li>
<li>Locrian: B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B.</li>
</ul>
<p>They all have very, very different characteristics, despite having exactly the same notes in them. Each of them is either a major (Ionian, Lydian, Mixolydian), or a minor (Dorian, Phrygian, Aeolian, Locrian*), but with its own unique sounds. Whether it's a major or minor scale is defined by the relationship of the first note to the third note, and whether it's 4 half-steps/semitones (major), or 3 semitones (minor).</p>
<p>*The Locrian scale also has a lowered 5th note, which makes it Diminished, and not technically minor, and is just a weird scale.</p></div>		</li>
