			<div class="markdown"><p>Recording artists are NOT entitled to royalties. A written song has 2 distinct shares, a publisher's share and writer's share. When the song is recorded then another copyright is created, known as the Master Recording. Now a Recording Artist can be given a share of the sale of the Master Recording, but they are not legally entitled the way a writer of a song is. It depends on their contract. Now the writer of song IS entitled to Mechanical Royalties which is based on the selling of CDs, MP3s, etc... Writers are by default, legally entitled to royalties based on radio/streaming plays, use in TV/Film/Games, and sales. Recording Artists are not given the same protections. As a result a recording artist will get a writers credit on songs even though they didn't write it. Its a trade off for the song writer, they lose a part of the writers share, but an artist puts their song out there to earn royalties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my post I was talking about ALL of the types of royalties that artists received. I didn't go into much detail about recording artists because the question wasn't targeted so much as recording artists.</p>
<p>You are correct that recording artists don't have statutory licensing that guarantees them royalties. However, pretty much every record deal I've ever seen or heard of guarantees royalties to musicians, in particular for sales (physical and digital) as well as other licensing revenue of the recorded version.</p>
<p>I can't speak to whether or not musicians routinely get added as writers to songs. I know from dealing with sampling cases that the definition of how much a person must contribute to a song to receive a credit is a moving goalpost.</p>
<p>Still, every recording artist who either A) Controls the copyright in their recording or B) Has a professional record contract, is entitled to royalties through their deal. How much does vary with new artists often getting unfairly low percentages, but this is a big part of why copyright termination is a thing, even if it doesn't resolve the problem for decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is the best ELI5 answer in here... not that the others are wrong, but it's the most complete and basic (was surprised many of the others didn't immediately distinguish how the rights are broken up into composition and recording).</p></div>		</li>
