			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked for a bank for a while--our main branches were open Saturday mornings and our locations in grocery stores were open 9-7 M-F, 10-4 Sat, and 1-5 Sun. Targeting individuals. Because most people do their banking online and don't come in to branches anymore. Being open in a grocery store, and longer hours, allowed us to go out into the store and talk to the grocery customers to try to acquisition new accounts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will say, that's the one thing that I didn't mind about the job, was pleasing our customers. Oftentimes a lot of our clients didn't even know we were open on the weekends and were so happy when we told them our hours at the in store branches. That was always nice, to be able to help people out a little bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but why are all of the commercials and marketing for banks targeted for individuals? Seems like all advertising for them as about how easy it is to set up an account, and how many ATMs they have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The local branch of my GFs bank is now set up so that they don't have bank tellers.</p>
<p>Just insert your card and touch the screen to select what you need to do. I assume large deposits or withdrawals alert a branch employee but at least us poor people can withdraw our last pennies without being given that look.</p></div>		</li>
