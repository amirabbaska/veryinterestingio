			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a relatively new science called epigenetics. This science looks at alterations to epigenes, which don't <em>change your DNA</em> but they do <em>change which parts of your DNA are active.</em> So your DNA may contain a sequence to make you susceptible to infection; as a child the epigenes keep this sequence suppressed, then when you turn 40 your epigenes change and activate this DNA sequence so you start getting sick more often. This is called gene expression.</p>
<p>Gene expression is affected by just about everything you do: exercise, diet, sleep, occupation, daily habits, and friendships.</p>
<p>Puberty, aging, aggression, focus, ability to learn, ability to problem solve, social habits, how much sleep you need at night are all influenced by your epigenetics.</p>
<p>Epigenetics are coupled with your DNA and you inherit epigenes from your parents, so having a child at 20 will pass down different epigenetic markers than having a child at 40 - and this is one theory of the increasing prevalence of autism in America.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would not be surprised at all to find that the last thing is true. It's been known for a decade that increasing paternal age is correlated with increased risk of schizophrenia, and autism and schizophrenia have a number of potential or probable risk genes in common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding to what you said, the epigenome is altered by obesity and obese parents can transmit obesity to their offspring. This helps explain why obesity rates are increasing very fast, both in developed and also in developing countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding experiential factors like sleeping habits, does this mean that poor sleep could influence an epigenetic change that leads to disease? Or am I misunderstanding it?</p>
<p>Asking as an insomniac.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I follow your question. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23932332" target="_blank">Here is some science</a> specifically about the epigenetics of insomnia.</p>
<p>If you go through a stressful life event, that will affect your epigenetics and may activate your insomnia gene.</p>
<p>If you practice poor sleep habits such as by working late nights consistently, your epigenetics will adapt and activate the insomnia gene to 'help you stay up and work.'</p>
<p>If you have insomnia but use medication or techniques to force a good sleeping routine for long enough, your epigenes will shift to deactivate your insomnia gene.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S102845591060099X" target="_blank">Here is more science</a> that links the epigenetics of insomnia to the epigenetics of Alzheimer's disease. The article states that there is no reason to say that insomnia <em>causes</em> alzheimers, or that the epigenes that cause insomnia are the same ones that cause alzheimers. However, epigenetics influence insomnia, insomnia interferes with sleep, less sleep causes more stress on the body, more stress causes more changes to epigenes, eventually the Alzheimer's gene (or other hazardous genes) will become epigenetically activated.</p></div>		</li>
