			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the word &quot;mass&quot; is used in the nontechnical sense. It is <em>a</em> critical mass. It has not <em>achieved</em> critical mass. The plutonium pit has achieved supercriticality by being compressed by shaped wavefronts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can still speak of the mass in a technical sense, but it is in relation to other things.</p>
<p>6 kg of Pu-239 is not a critical mass (it will not sustain chain reactions) at room temperature, standard atmospheric pressure, and without any reflection. You can hold it in your hand (it will be warm, but your hand won't fall off).</p>
<p>6 kg of plutonium <em>is</em> a critical mass when compressed to 2.5 times its original density by explosive lenses, contained within a heavy, neutron-reflecting tamper. (The Trinity Gadget or the Nagasaki bomb.)</p>
<p>Or, for a non-weapons context: 6 kg of plutonium in air is safe from a criticality perspective. 6 kg of plutonium encased in beryllium might just be enough to start reacting (the Slotin accident). 6 kg of plutonium in <em>water</em> might moderate enough neutrons to start heating things up significantly. The mass isn't irrelevant here (it's the easiest quantity to modify, so you definitely want to know it if you are playing with plutonium!), but it's only relevant in respect to the other conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good example of this is the &quot;Ivy King&quot; device, which was the largest pure fission device detonated by the US. It contained roughly 4 critical masses of HEU. However, the HEU was shaped into a fairly large hollow sphere. This configuration was not sufficient to go critical. The chemical explosives crushed this sphere sufficiently rapidly to cause it to go critical.</p>
<p>Another example would be the criticallity accident they had in Japan several years ago. Workers kept adding a solution containing enriched uranium into a barrel shaped vat that was not intended for the purpose (precisely because of criticallity concerns). Once they filled it to a certain point, it went critical and proceeded to do so repeatedly over the next 24 hours. (The chain reaction would stop when the liquid was boiling due to the way water moderates a reaction). The proper reaction vessels were long thin containers that prevented the solution from getting into the right shape to go critical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shape and density both matter together with the overall mass. A sphere is better than a hollow sphere (or two hemispheres separated, or whatever), and a denser sphere is better than a less dense sphere at the same mass.</p>
<p>The physical parameter behind those things is the fraction of neutrons produced per neutron: If the average is larger than 1, you can start a chain reaction, if it is smaller than 1, there is no chain reaction. More plutonium (same for uranium) in a smaller space close together makes it more likely that a neutron hits another plutonium nucleus instead of leaving the material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a minimum mass required for a nuclear explosion, regardless of density? Like, imagine you had a few grams of plutonium, and you can compress somehow to an arbitrarily high density. Could you make even a few grams of plutonium detonate, or would it not work for some reason?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Density matters but so does the shape of the mass. Nuclear explosions rely on chain reaction caused by neutrons being emitted from one fission event and going on to induce fission in a different nucleus, which itself emits more neutrons and so on.</p>
<p>Obtaining a critical mass involves maximising the probability that a given neutron will induce a fission event, and to do that you must maximise the number of nuclei that it encounters before escaping the material. Imagine a long, thin chunk or plutonium. When a fission event occurs and produces neutrons those neutrons are always going to be near an edge, giving a high chance that they will escape without inducing another fission event. Contrast that with a solid sphere, the neutron will probably have to pass through much more plutonium before escaping, and on average is much more likely to continue the chain reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The term that is often used by weapons practitioners, which I prefer, is &quot;critical assembly.&quot; The mass is just one part of the physical system that affects criticality. The &quot;assembly&quot; emphasizes that there are more factors to consider.</p></div>		</li>
