			<div class="markdown"><p>That may or may not help with the issue of noise but wouldn't exactly practical. The sensor consists of two tunnels that are something like 2 kilometers long. On top of that there's an entire control room stuffed with equipment and people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there are plans for a space detector known as the LISA Gravitational Wave Observatory which consists of several satellites.  It's would be much larger than LIGO and thus be sensitive to different sources of gravitational waves, so it's not exactly taking a LIGO detector and putting it into space.</p></div>		</li>
