			<div class="markdown"><p>True that it's easy to forget those who didn't make it. But it must have been amazing for let's say the youngest son of a farmer who had no real prospects in his homeland, to come to the West and see the rich, vast lands that were there to be taken by anyone who was willing to work hard. A chance! Freedom! (From the perspective of the natives it was of course quite a different story.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One other thing to keep in mind - The US doesn't have any established religion or state church. A lot of European (not all!) countries do, and over the years have been more or less repressive. Besides the prospect of being a land-owner, a lot of immigrants came over to this country to escape from religious persecution.</p>
<p>Of course, their descendants are now working overtime to put into practice acts that their forbears fled from. But as they say - time is a flat circle. We still have 2 pieces in our Constitution that protects against that - the 1st Amendment and Article Six (no religious test for office). There are constant battles over those in the courts though; and the speed that so-called &quot;Constitutional Originalists&quot; would toss those protections out is a good indicator of their overall hypocrisy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually how my father's line ended up in the U.S.A. in the first place. This is also why I find the concept of &quot;The Wall&quot; so offensive. In my mind, if the wall goes up, it's spitting in the face of the Statue of Liberty. Barring the various Native American tribes, every one here is either an immigrant or descended from one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When immigration was unlimited, there was literally a new factory being built every week in every city. There were millions of acres of farm and ranch land out west that were literally just for the taking. So of course we had unlimited immigration. As soon as those things stopped, immigration became limited. Now for some reason, a bunch of people who are really bad at math think finite resources coupled with unlimited immigration is a great idea.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's also historical: in the 1800s in particular, immigration was unlimited, the West was wide open, and people from anywhere in the world were able to go to the USA and succeed or fail on their own merits. But the history glosses over the losers in that race: how free are you if you're dead?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Literally none of this is true? Black people were still literal slaves in the 1800s? The Chinese exclusion Act was passed that century? Natives still had many independent nations in the west, and a few pockets in the east still holding out. The Mexican-American war, which claimed most of what we now call &quot;the west&quot; wasn't finished until the middle of the century. Where are you getting this bootstrappy land of the free history? Edit: And beyond all of the that, monopolistic ownership over land and resources was still enormous, inequality of income was still incredibly high. </p></div>		</li>
