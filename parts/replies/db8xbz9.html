			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds very similar to how USPS works, where there are people up the ladder that are far removed from the realities of the job that just look at numbers and tell local management what they need to order us to do, even if it violates the union contracts. Certain things are not allowed but they are loosely enforced by local management because they understand the impossible demands from upper management, and just about every single post office lately isn't staffed to handle the current load because somewhere along the line someone doesn't want to hire the help needed (part-timers) so their 'numbers' look good for someone above them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also should be noted that the UPS trucks and the DIAD boards (those elctronic gizmos people sign on) are both equipped with GPS.<br />
If anyone really feels their UPS driver isnt stopping at their house, then the driver's boss can see exactly where they were when each package was scanned.<br />
All the drivers know about the gps, so I find it hard to believe that so many people are having this happen.<br />
Most likely, a package is accidentally loaded onto the wrong car and a driver 20 miles away is told to mark it as &quot;missed&quot; for the day, which shows up as &quot;rescheduled for the next business day&quot; when tracked.<br />
It almost certainly isnt malicious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is pretty close to the truth. Every time I have had an issue with a delivery, it was someone running extremely late for their normal delivery time, or when Amazon says something will be delivered by 8 I'll see the tracker updated with failed delivery saying no one was home (which is BS). As others have said, complain. It is your only recourse to changing the outcome.
Normally I wouldn't care too much, but the times I am watching this most closely is for expensive packages. So I don't really appreciate when they fake deliver something after I've been waiting all day to make sure I get it.</p></div>		</li>
