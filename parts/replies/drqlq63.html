			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, ty. Previous things I've read made it sound like the momentum built up in the generators was huge, which is why it takes a lot to change the frequency. Sounds like I overestimated the amount of energy, so it won't be able to be used as a kind of buffer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The momentum built up in the generators is huge.  There's so much momentum that several gigawatts of generation can trip offline without the grid instantly collapsing.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figured we'd be able to use that momentum as a temporary kind of buffer for a couple hours but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7m0r9p/when_there_is_a_high_load_on_an_electrical_grid/drqm66u/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7m0r9p/when_there_is_a_high_load_on_an_electrical_grid/drqm66u/</a> seem like you can't let the frequency drop too far, so not a huge buffer then. Thought it may be possible that the momentum required for a 5 Hz change may be enough to tide things over for a couple hours until load lessens</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget, every transformer in the system is designed around 50/60 hz. The power is generated then transmitted at MV or kV. This involves transformers up and down</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The frequency drop alone would not reduce power drawn by resistive loads. And it would f-up everything else on the grid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the thing most answers aren't really getting. Sure a lot of bad stuff happens when frequency drops but the amount of power consumed by the grid doesn't really change much when the frequency drops. The original question kind of seems to think that if frequency drops then there is suddenly more power available for everyone, which isn't the case. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, spent a lot of time in remote Costa Rica, power delivery was unreliable at best. You'd see the frequency drop as the hydroelectric couldn't keep up, then a 10-20V drop not much later.</p></div>		</li>
