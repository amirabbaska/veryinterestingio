			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's just me, but it seems like those fish all stayed oriented with their tops to the light, as if they felt that was the top even though as far as the gravity goes there was no up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sounds good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Peer pressure :)</p>
<p>Actually, I'm not convinced those pictures were taken in space because the article is full of things like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When researchers are ready for the fish to participate on orbit, they will travel in a special transport container to the station, where the crew will then install them within the habitat for observation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I assume they haven't retrospectively added pictures to the article and this was just from testing on the ground...</p></div>		</li>
