<p>As for his arguments, he leans on the chemical reactions he knew and the ones most popular at the time. For example, he suspects nitrogen and carbon are elements, he burns them, and he gets a corresponding type of acid, and <strong>furthermore finds he can account for all of the mass.</strong> He does a similar thing with sulfur and finds a corresponding acid and <strong>no loss of mass</strong>. However, if he burns carbohydrates, <strong>he loses mass as water and later tracks down and proves that he lost it.</strong> <strong>It was not just one thing, but collections of similar observations like these that allowed early chemists to realize that elements differed from salts which differed from acids, and so on.</strong></p>

<p>are the key factors to answering OP's question. From a historical records perspective, Antoine Lavoisier was really the first analytical chemist, as well as the first <em>myth-buster</em> in chemistry. He was obsessed with accuracy and precision. He had to manufacture most of his scientific apparatus because, prior to him, chemistry was more akin to <strong>alchemy</strong> rather than modern day chemistry.</p>
<p>Before Lavoisier, the scientific discipline of physics was viewed as being superior to the scientific discipline of chemistry because physical phenomena, such as falling bodies, could be modeled with a relatively high level of precision, considering the technological advancements of the time. Because of Lavoisier, chemistry was elevated from the depths of alchemy to a science on par with physics. References 1 and 2 below give a great account of Lavoisier's scientific genius and contributions to the field of chemistry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To Lavoisier, it was time &quot;to rid chemistry of every kind of impediment that delays its advance&quot; with a reform that included a new language. Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau, Claude Louis Berthollet, Antoine Franåois Fourcroy, and Lavoisier adopted the long-neglected idea of an element as originally proposed by Robert Boyle more than a century earlier. They retained the names from the past of many simple substances, or elements. But when an element combined with another element, the compound's name now reflected something about its chemical composition. For example, a calx was the combination of a metal and oxygen; therefore, zinc calx became zinc oxide. Lavoisier and his colleagues predicted that if the new system was &quot;undertaken upon sound principles...it will naturally adapt itself to future discoveries.&quot; Withstanding the test of time, the basic system is still in use today.</p>
<p>Lavoisier's new system of chemistry was laid out for everyone to see in the Traité élémentaire de Chimie (Elements of Chemistry), published in Paris in 1789. As a textbook, the Traité incorporated the foundations of modern chemistry. It spelled out the influence of heat on chemical reactions, the nature of gases, the reactions of acids and bases to form salts, and the apparatus used to perform chemical experiments. For the first time, the Law of the Conservation of Mass was defined, with Lavoisier asserting that &quot;... in every operation an equal quantity of matter exists both before and after the operation.&quot; Perhaps the most striking feature of the Traité was its &quot;Table of Simple Substances,&quot; the first modern listing of the then-known elements.</p>
<p>Lavoisier did not expect his ideas to be adopted at once, because those who believed in phlogiston would &quot;adopt new ideas only with difficulty.&quot; Lavoisier put his faith in the younger generation who would be more open to new concepts. Two years later, in 1791, the results were obvious. &quot;All young chemists,&quot; he mused, &quot;adopt the theory, and from that I conclude that the revolution in chemistry has come to pass.&quot; His legacy endures more than 200 years later.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, Lavoisier's obsession with precision, accuracy and mass balance can be seen in his approach to daily life. At one point, he was in charge of tax collection for the city of Paris, a job that he loathed. He was a true scientist at heart and considered accounting activities to be a dreadfully boring activity.</p>
<p>Lavoisier recognized that the only way to enforce tax collection in an objective manner was to control all goods coming into and out of the city. To accomplish this feat, he ordered the construction of a wall around the entire city. This wall was approximately six feet high and was to have 66 toll-booths. Sadly, this wall would lead to his downfall. It was an extravagant expense, and the citizens hated it. Lavoisier's political enemies used the hatred of this wall to have him executed during the French Revolution. [2-3]</p>

<p>As a historian I would caution anybody when they want to say that a single person revolutionized a field — it just never happens that way, there are always more people involved and the &quot;revolution&quot; is always a somewhat messy affair. The &quot;Lavosier did everything great!&quot; is a 19th-century story that chemists started telling (as part of a heroic mode of history of science) that is not quite right. For one thing, Lavosier didn't come out of nowhere — it wasn't all alchemy before him. Robert Boyle did quite a lot in transforming chemistry into something &quot;scientific&quot; even though his work was still suffused with alchemical notions. (Historians of science are less-inclined to draw firm lines between &quot;scientific&quot; and &quot;pre-scientific&quot; study when it comes to alchemy/chemistry, but we'll leave that aside for a moment.)</p>
<p>Lavosier was certainly important for the so-called Chemical Revolution but he was not the only one. Joseph Priestly, for example, shares in many of the laurels. Humphry Davy is another. Much of Lavosier's theories of chemistry were proven incorrect within a decade or so of his death. &quot;Modern chemistry&quot; comes out of not just Lavosier's work but the physical theories of John Dalton. </p>
<p>That all being said, Lavosier was immensely important. No one would deny this. But some of the &quot;before Lavosier — darkness; after Lavosier — light&quot; approach to this is bad history.</p>
<p>For a nice overview of the issues (disentangling Lavosier's real contributions from the hagiography), see Robert Siegfried, &quot;The Chemical Revolution in the History of Chemistry,&quot; <em>Osiris</em> 4 (1988), 34-50.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I'm a total layperson when it comes to chemistry.
You mentioned that Lavoisier believed sulfur was an element because it turned into an acid when he burned it. </p>
<p>Is creating an acid when you burn it one of the hallmarks of an element? Where does the hydrogen come from? </p>
<p>Edit: I really appreciate everybody's answers, thank you! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically what others said. The class of chemicals called oxoacids come from combustion of an element and combination with water to give the acidic protons. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxoacid" target="_blank">Here</a> is a list of some of the many elements which do this.</p>
<p>Lavoisier thought that all acids are oxoacids. He did know of some exceptions (hydrochloric acid for example), and called them radical compounds. Later when Faraday and others began to experiment with electrolysis they discovered that acids such as hydrochloric did not contain oxygen, but contained elements which Lavoisier had not been able to isolate with the techniques he had available (chlorine, sodium, etc).</p></div>		</li>
