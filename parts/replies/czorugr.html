<p>Pandas, for example, can survive by eating tons of bamboo because nothing else eats bamboo. If they couldn't digest bamboo, they'd have to compete for other, easier to digest food sources.</p>

<p>The hilarious thing about this: Pandas aren't even <em>good</em> at digesting bamboo. They do so very inefficiently, and they would be healthier if they ate a more varied diet. This is something which they are still capable of doing; they just prefer the complete and utter lack of competition with bamboo. They can safely spend all their time eating the massive amounts of it they need to go through to extract enough nutrients, and so that's what they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do reproduce slowly, but it's mostly that their habitats have shrunk because of human encroachment. So even if each square mile can support X pandas, having fewer square miles means less of them. But this also can effect the availability of food for them, since different varieties of bamboo are edible at different times of year and with civilization going on sometimes we happen to wipe out the local panda's supply of a particular variety. So you end up with a lower concentration of pandas per square mile than you once had.</p></div>		</li>
