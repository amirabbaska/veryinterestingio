			<div class="markdown"><p>this is a great answer. Lava / Magma sediment interaction is a fascinating phenomena, and cool thing to see in the field. slightly tangential to OP's main point, but interesting nonetheless, are magma/lava interactions with water rich sediments.</p>
<p>I've seen some really cool examples in the field at Sour Milk Gill, Lake district UK, where a sill has intruded into a partially consolidated, water rich lacustrine sequence. the magma caused vapoursiation of the water and re-mobilisation of the sediments into really bizarre pillow lava-esque breccia type structures - all formed in situ. more about this <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265180032_SOUR_MILK_GILL" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>On the surface we can also see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootless_cone" target="_blank">rootless cones</a> or pseudo-volcanoes, where hot lavas are emaplced over wet sediments. again we see vapourisation of the water into steam which causes small eruptions, but without any direct magma source. You can see some great examples of remnants of these in the Ogwen Valley, Wales, UK right near the youth hostel (if anyone knows the area).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be tired, I could just be missing base knowledge. But I have no clue what either responses here are trying to convey beyond &quot;no, the outside lava is cooler than the inside lava, so it just flows over it.&quot; Is there perchance a place a bit my laymen's termed or if someone could explain these responses?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lava doesn't melt the ground, because it cools too quickly. If the ground has water it may boil and the boiling breaks the ground, other types of ground may bake and become harder. It's hard to predict. Sometimes really cool looking things happen when lava hits certain types of ground.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does that mean metamorphism can occur without great pressure or is this lava plus great pressure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Metamorphism can high p/low t (e.g surface faulting), high p/high t (mountain building and burial), or high t low p (contact metamorphism). It's a spectrum of conditions that produces a spectrum of metamorphic products. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an assistant professor of geology, which means I got my job via a long (and sometimes torturous) process of schooling and temporary research positions (postdocs) before finally getting a permanent job at a university. By non-volcanic mountains I mean large mountain belts that have developed in response to the collision between tectonic plates (e.g. the Himalaya, Andes, Alps, etc) and I study them through a mixture of field (walking around and mapping the distribution and orientation of rocks), analytical (dating or chemical characterization of rocks and sediments), and modeling (running computer simulations to explore how mountains and their associated topography develop) techniques.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While not the person you asked the question about, I am also a geologist, but work in the mining industry. Exploring for &amp; defining potential ore bodies.</p>
<p>We use the regional work of academics &amp; gov't geological teams to narrow down the regions of interest, then do a lot of field work ourselves to generate targets to eventually drill. The oil &amp; gas guys do a similar thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get a geology degree (B.Sc.) then go to graduate school for Structural Geology/Tectonics. All flavors of geologist can wind up applying their knowledge to the understanding of mountain development. It takes people with different specializations to study the varying types of evidence that geologic processes leave behind. That being said, structural geologists will typically study the mechanisms behind mountain formation and are primarily focused on processes like this. These are typically distinct from the processes that will build and maintain a volcanic mountain.</p>
<p>Read up on the process of Orogenisis (mountain building). Read up on active orogenic zones such as the Himalayas.</p>
<p>There are other ways to wind up studying mountains. For me, I specialized in field geology and structure in grad school and did many trips to the Himalayas as a structural geologist for my research.</p>
<p>This is typically only possible via academic institutions and grants. Some aspects of engineering geology will also necessitate investigating mountains.</p></div>		</li>
