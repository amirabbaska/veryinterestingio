One should note that we're still a long way off the actual implementation of a Generalized AI (Strong AI). The researches being done right now are going to contribute to that ultimately, but right now we're still experimenting with the various ways to build, train and operate various types of Neural Networks. </p>
<p>I have a friend doing research about using genetic (evolutionary) algorithms to train Neural Nets, and we both agree a minimally inteligent entity would have to be made up of at least hundreds of different specialized neural networks interconnected, summing up at least a couple hundred milion neurons. We would need different networks for long and short term memory, as well as networks that write data to those nets, and also other networks to filter whats going to be written, and so on, all the way to interpreting human input.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of layers of data abstraction we are lacking there.</p></div>		</li>
