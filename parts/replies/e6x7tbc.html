			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, most television here does actually follow a regular half-hour/hour-long programming, especially channels with adverts. The BBC's slightly different because it doesn't have adverts, giving it more leeway, but even so it also usually follows a regular half-hour/hour-long programming except on saturday/sunday nights or for the few sporting events it still shows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s pretty good. </p>
<p>Mom watches Coronation Street here on the CBC. Canada’s national broadcaster. </p>
<p>But CBC actually cuts off the last 60secs of Coronation Street most days.... so that they can fit in station-promos... before the next :00. </p>
<p>Priorities, I guess. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is that they have a lot less advertising but run our shows designed to fill 30/60 min with it. So it often doesn't line up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't watch Doctor Who, I can't attest to if that show is abnormal but shows do usually follow those rules.</p>
<p>But, Doctor Who is a BBC show, and the BBC does not have advert breaks.</p>
<p>So your 30 minute window is around 28-29 minutes of programming.</p>
<p>That doesn't fit with a US '30 minute' window which is usually like 21-24 minutes of programming and hundreds of adverts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doctor who episodes are normally 40-43 minutes long. For channels that show them they can then adhere to the 18m limit on advertising per hour here. Some can bend this slightly by playing the credits at higher speed to gain a few seconds or more. </p></div>		</li>
