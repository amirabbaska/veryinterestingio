			<div class="markdown"><p>It's cool that you mention that they 'cheat.' This great book called the Red Queen details how monogamous birds are actually cheaters, and the female will usually choose an older male with more security to build her nest and feed her chicks food (the equivalent of a hubby) but whilst he is out all day she will jump next door into the younger stud's nest, have an affair with him if you like, and actually father his children. It's meant to be one of the best methods of getting your genes into the next generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's pretty common but can also be pretty risky. If 'hubby' catches her cheating he'll spend less effort finding food for the babies which can lead to their demise, even though some of the babies are his. They've done studies and the female will usually lay the 'cheater's' eggs first so 'hubby' deciding to bounce affects his babies more than the illegitimate ones.</p>
<p>Ostriches are the weirdest birds though imo. They all sleep around like crazy before the females all lay their eggs in one communal nest, which the dominant male and female will raise together. It's like a giant sex party with no repercussions unless you're the dominant pair, who instead get stuck with raising everyone's kids as a reward for being responsible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How is this done?  Does she mate with the younger male first, or does she have control over the order in which the eggs are released?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's akin to saying humans only cheat if they haven't had children after 5 years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be analogous in a way, but keep in mind that humans don't have distinct mating seasons like many other species do. I don't know one way or the other, but it's not unreasonable to believe that a species with overt, discrete opportunities for reproduction could develop a more utilitarian approach to pair bonding in cases of apparent sterility than we humans, with our hidden ovulation and seemingly-constant fertility.</p></div>		</li>
