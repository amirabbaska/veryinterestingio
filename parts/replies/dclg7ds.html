			<div class="markdown"><p>Locksmith here. To expand and correct on your information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schlage has pin sizes ranging from 0 to 9 and most residential locks will all have 5 pins. The pin sizes for a Schlage lock are also standard in many other brands like original Baldwin hardware, Emtek, Ashley Norton, Rocky Mountain and more. There is also something called MACS (max adjacent cut speciation) that comes into play and it varies by key type. Schlage has a MACS of 5 so pins can be no more than a 5 size difference from each other. So you can not have a key like 91807</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The amount of possible keys changes by key type. Kwikset uses a different key but only has cuts 1-6 (technically they have a 7 depth but it is almost never used) with a MACS of 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, when purchasing hardware from a department store depending on how they order it a set of locks will come in all on the same key. There is usually a keyed a like number on the box somewhere that would reference this. This is generally done in case someone is purchasing more than one for the same property.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't make this many unique locks, however, as that would be hell for mass production.</p>
<p>There's a few hundred different locks, and this means that there's a low enough chance of your key opening another nearby lock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have two ATVs at my cottage. Both Polaris, but both different model. Both keys work in both ATVs. The keys don't work in any other ATV I tried. The chance of that happening are slim but it makes my life easier. I don't have to look for the right set of keys :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of agriculture equipment has universal keys, including some atvs. Our kubota, john deere, and caterpillar loaders and tractors use brand specific or model specific universal keys.  If we lose a key i just grab a random spare from the drawer. Farm life lends itself to losing alot of keys</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not super uncommon in the powersports world.  I've owned a number of Polaris sleds, and my '00, '04, and '13 have all used the same key, which also fits 3 of my friends sleds. Polaris only has something like 5 unique keys for their sleds. </p></div>		</li>
