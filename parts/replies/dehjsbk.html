			<div class="markdown"><p>Chromophores, also known as colours, usually contain a lot of double bonds or conjugated double bonds. Double bonds (C=C or N=N bonds) absorb photons and emit light at visible wave lengths.
Here is such a typical chromophore:
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coomassie_Brilliant_Blue" target="_blank">Brilliant blue</a> </p>
<p>There are some 16 double bonds in there, and they are all conjugated. Conjugated means alternating double - single bonds. They can be flipped, so that the double bonds become single and the single bonds become double. This gives a very large de-located electron system, that can emit wavelength in the visible spectrum, here blue.
Now to the bleach:
It is an oxidiser, as said before. And what bond is likely to be oxidised? Think of unsaturated fatty acids? They have double bonds, and they get easily oxidised rendering the fatty acids bad, since they start to smell and go rancid. So in the chromosphere there are a lot of double bonds were the oxidiser can start doing its work. If some or all of the double bonds are oxidised, the conjugated system is broken and can no longer alternate or switch bonds,  so the delocated electron system is inhibited and the &quot;color&quot; is gone. The molecule itself is still there, but now it does not have colour anymore.</p>
<p>In your case, the green colour was only partially decoloured and the remaining conjugated system was yellow emitting. The same effect can be seen when you get a bruise. First it is red because the Haemoglobin is red. When your body starts to break down this Haemoglobin for removal, it turns to green, then to yellow and then becomes colourless and gets removed.
The Haemoglobin is broken down to biliverdin, that is green and then to bilirubin which is yellow.
Here is a picture:

Note that from the green verdin to the yellow rubin only one double bond is missng, but this is enough to change the colour. Those systems are very delicate.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, that's what acids do. Though sometimes oxidation is irreversible in the sense that treating with a reducing agent will not restore the original chemical configuration. </p></div>		</li>
