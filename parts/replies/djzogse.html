<p>It's actually easy to explain the difference between off-shell and on-shell particles from a purely scientific perspective, but it's really hard to think of it from a philosophical overview--- photons are an excitement of a field that acts this way, virtual photons are a perturbation of a field that acts that way, etc. </p></div>		</li>
