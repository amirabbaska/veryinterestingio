			<div class="markdown"><p>In the UK late 90's early 00's you could easily pick two close by atms of different banks and take out the last £50 or whatever as it took them an hour or two to sync up. Used that many times on a drunken night out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When Ulster Bank/RBS fucked up a few years ago they were letting all customers withdraw £500 because they couldn't get account details. However, the system took a few mins to update so a few people hit a few ATMs in quick succession. One fella withdrew £6000 and fucked off to Australia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had something similar where I live. An ATM was giving out double what you requested. There was a massive queue, and the police had to stop people from using it, as it was technically stealing.
I got my moneys worth before they got there though :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you use contactless payment, at least with RBS, it doesn't update your available balance until the next day. So you can spend money once with contactless payment, and still take it out of an ATM that same day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Contactless payments are done offline so there's no check to see if the funds are there, one of the reasons why they're restricted to a low cash value and a certain number of times before you have to make an online transaction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there's this neat trick we found with the local gas station. They don't cash checks until i think two days later. so if you're low on cash and it's a day from payday, you can pre-pay a larger ammount than you intend to pump. Go back inside and get your change in cash. This also works for if you are intending to pay the bank back after the weekend, but before the overdraft hits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pro-tip: be under 18 at the time. </p>
<p>then call bank and ask them to reset your balance to zero, as they mistakenly gave you money you didn't have, knowing full well you were under 18 and therefore not eligible for credit facilities (organised or not).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>exactly this - finance systems are still stuck in the awkward transition from batch&gt;RT methodology, so if you want to make money, make middleware and reconciliation software that can join Branch A's IBM 360 derived platforms up with the shiny new outsourced cloud system in branch B, and make sure it does so before start of business!</p></div>		</li>
