			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much.  You have to cook the really green ones to make them edible.  Spent a bunch of time in the Amazon a while back and one of our basic sources of starch were boiled green bananas (not any special type, just the regular local bananas).  They weren't sweet at all and had a consistency a bit like a firm potato when boiled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, no. The primary difference lies in that as the banana ripens, complex carbohydrates and starches are broken down into simpler sugars over time. This is why a very ripe banana tastes sweeter than a green banana. Carbohydrates contain 4 kcal/g if they are simple or complex. Complex carbs just take longer to break down, which would also result in the banana's glycemic index changing.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, people really like talking about bananas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up to that, even if the amount of calories it contains don't change, does the ability to extract calories get affected as it goes through the process? Like does a green banana only allow us to extract 50% of its calories while a ripe one allows us to extract 60% for whatever reason?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My biological education doesn't really go past A-levels, but to the best of my understanding no. You can get the same amount of energy from a grown banana at most stages of ripeness.</p>
<p>As the banana ripens, long and branching chains of sugars break apart, leaving more chains that are shorter, allowing your body to digest them using enzymes that can &quot;eat&quot; from each end, meaning the whole thing is converted into usable sugar more quickly. Your digestive system still contains the enzymes to break down the more complex carbohydrates, there are just fewer &quot;starting points&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>No they don't. Monosaccharides contain 3.75 kcal/g, polysaccharides contain up to 4.20 kcal/g. The use of 4 kcal/g is just simplified. </p></div>		</li>
