			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't recognize the shapes, it's the movement. We instinctively react to quick movements, especially in our peripheral vision. Which is why we jump at sight of creatures that move this way. Many prey animals (which we once were) are wired this way, which is why many predators adopted stealth techniques like stalking, and ambushing their prey to hunt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree.  I was suggesting ( based purely on what I had watched) that those shapes stand out more in the same sense the other guy said people tend to spot spiders and snakes first in hidden animal puzzles </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems so strange, snakes and spiders, not big cats or wolves or in some parts of the world bears?
Wouldn't these large predators be a bigger threat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are a threat in a different way.  It's not like you'll be walking along, see a wolf two feet from you, and survive by jumping back.  For a snake or a spider that might save your life.  For a big predator, that reaction won't matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd guess that large predators are easier to spot due to their increased size, and our peripheral movement detection is good at spotting movement that large predators would need to get close enough to harm us.</p>
<p>Also for the most part you aren't going to accidentally step on a bear or grab a piece of fruit with a lion hiding on it and die immediately from a venomous bite like how it could happen with a snake or spider.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually no, if you look at countries like Australia, India, Shri Lanka, etc. WAY more people are killed by snakes and spiders than tigers, dingos, bears, etc.</p></div>		</li>
