			<div class="markdown"><p>IR thermometers do not measure frequency. They measure the integral of intensity x some calibration curve similar to quantum efficiency that is specific to the detector. A single detector element has no direct way to discriminate between wavelengths (frequency).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh right, this is the real world, that makes sense. I didn't even think of how hard it would be to detect these low energy photons. I was thinking some fancy scintillators could work at that low of an energy but even in high vacuum I think not. </p>
<p>Side question what kind of material processing do you do with lasers or are they unrelated? I work with a lot of lasers and getting into material development about half-way through my phd but I have no idea what to do after. I dit a lot of high vacuum mass spec and laser spectroscopy work but I want to take advantage of the new materials experience and hopefully run with it when I graduate. What are useful skills for someone coming into materials and wanting to eventually help with the design of micro manufacturing processes or something similar. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work primarily in instrumentation for laser welding, but the same instrumentation technology has applications in many other laser processes.</p>
<p>Useful skills include coding in various languages (my company can't find enough good LabVIEW programmers since most school/graduate research programs let you get away with terrible practices), familiarity with design of experiments (DOE, not the Dept of Energy), g-code, robots and industrial automation, basic metallurgical analysis and of course the ability to communicate well and get along with people.</p>
<p>The 300-lb gorillas in the industry are Trumpf (DE), IPG Photonics (mainly East coast USA) and Coherent/Rofin-Sinar (mainly silicon valley).</p>
<p>Micro and macro-processing are usually pretty separated, but both have good opportunities.</p>
<p>If you are in the USA, start meeting people in the industry at:</p>
<p>ICALEO
Photonics West
Fabtech
MD&amp;M West</p>
<p>If you are in the EU, the Munich laser show this summer is the place to be and it only happens every two years.</p>
<p>Send me a link to one of your papers that I can access (not in a university anymore) and I will let you know if I know of a good receptor for the kind of knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, follow-up question; the sensor in a laser thermometer just measures the frequency of the black body radiation, which means that the black body radiation has a wavelength, correct? If black body radiation goes from 0 kelvin to whatever the max is, does black body radiation ever become visible within our ability to see light? Or does what we see (for example, flame or something glowing red hot) constitute a different form of radiation? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, that's why hot coals glow red after the fire has gone out, or hot metal glows red. As the temperature increases, frequency goes up until it becomes visible, red, then continues changing to orange, yellow, blue and so on. The light we see from the sun is actually most black body radiation, most of the nuclear burning is going on inside the sun and we see only a relatively cold outer shell which still emits enormous black body radiation. And so we see stars of different colors mainly because of the different temperature and therefore the different black body radiation emitted and not anything different about the surface of the Star. That said, there's plenty different inside the stars themselves and Red Giants are from nitrogen burning not normal black body radiation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the quick reply!</p>
<p>So this is where I'm getting confused - the coals were visible before they got &quot;hot&quot; enough to glow, so black body radiation doesn't perfectly correlate to the visible light spectrum, does it? Could you use the visible light spectrum to measure temperature without measuring black body radiation? Also, what would happen if I pointed one of these laser thermometers at the sun? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To tweak what you said - the thermometer is actually receptive to only a particular (very small) band of wavelengths, and it is measuring the <em>intensity</em> of radiation it receives in that wavelength band.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a small point, but that's how one class of night vision devices, knows as thermal imagine devices, work.</p>
<p>The more &quot;classic green&quot; NVD work by using an image intensifier.</p>
<p>The type used would depend on the operational situation, although there are definitely hybrid devices.</p></div>		</li>
