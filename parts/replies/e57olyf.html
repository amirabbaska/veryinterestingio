			<div class="markdown"><p>This ^ is why I feel a bit dubious about the whole concept.
Basically the entire land biosphere burned after the KT event, and it left 2mm of soot...the nukes would be lucky to manage 0.02 </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be wrong but the Chicxulub impact messed up the ecosystem not because of fire but because of the dust that got ejected. I mean it was more mechanical than chemical.   </p>
<p>Plus you know nuclear winter is about a few degrees lower that will cause massive human loss and suffering but not a 70% extinction of all life </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, but how is a few (3-5 being a few) degrees of cooling going to cause massive amounts of death and suffering? I don't think that would even be a large enough temperature change to disrupt crop cycles unless crops were alao starved of sunlight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>0.02mm of sooth would still cause a significant (of not compete) blocking of the sun while still suspended in the atmosphere. The question is off that would stay up for long enough to kill all plants and/or affect climate, and to offset the other effects of the bombs. My best guess is that even a few weeks of atmospheric sooth would be enough to kill many crops and affect our food chain, leading to famine, but not nuclear winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would blot our quite a lot alright </p>
<p>I just did the math though, that is 20 cubic metres per square km of soot. The earths surface is 500 million square km, so to get that coverage you need ten trillion litres of soot.
Thatâ€™s gigatons... I think my estimate was a bit liberal tbh. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that is firestorms are a big question mark. No one has tested a 1MT weapon on a city, let alone a modern city. Predictions from both sides seem all over the map and it may come down to regional differences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If all the burnable material in a city is covered in concrete and steel rubble, it's not going to burn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure about this, I don't think anyone is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So if the bombs don't start firestorms, and firestorms don't have significant climate impact, then nuclear winter isn't a concern. Ultimate, we'll probably never know for sure though.</p>

<p>Complete agree</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Concrete would be vaporized by the heat from the explosion, but it wouldn't burn in the traditional sense as it needs external heat. Fire can be lit and then it just burns, concrete will only vaporize as long as there is heat being added.</p></div>		</li>
