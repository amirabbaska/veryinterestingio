			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing about the US and Texas in particular is that there is an insane number of pickup trucks on the road and vehicles with low fuel economy. When the fuel prices raised here it actually produced more jobs in Houston, since we have such a large oil and gas industry here.       It also created jobs across the US in the oilfields with Fracking, which increased jobs that used pickup trucks. The average Joe did feel the pain in their monthly budgets and many people bought more fuel economic vehicles.           More on topic though, the size of the cities and low population densities make public transportation more expensive and less profitable.              I don't know the number but gas prices would have to be well over 150-200 USD a barrell for there to be any real push for a expansive public transportation system.            In 2009 I took a train from Barcelona to Stockholm with stops along the way. If you drove that same distance from south Texas north, you wouldn't make it out of the US. (you would be really close to Canada though)                East to West the US is twice that distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, the car is a solution to the situation, not a symptom. Even if (as several have pointed out) the car and oil companies colluded to keep their product used more when alternatives in denser populated areas would (have been and still are) more beneficial. But eventually even subways are used in major cities. It's the size that some people just don't realize. We could literally house the <em>entire world population</em> in a city no denser than any modern one, and it wouldn't even cover Texas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple reasons...and if we talk about the history of why some things are the way they are it would be a long read. So I will just hit the main points.<br />
1) Usually the better school systems are outside the city.<br />
2) Bigger yards. I live in the city and my yard is tiny. My friends that live outside the city have a nice large yard.<br />
3) Price. price per sq ft. in the city is significantly more than outside the city.    </p>
<p>So usually people that live inside the city fall into 3 categories.<br />
No Kids, Super Rich, Super Poor    </p>
<p>Now the 2 hr drive each way is extreme, most people have an hour or less drive (although it can seem like an eternity in traffic)    </p>
<p>Bonus info<br />
Why is it hard for public transportation to take off in America?<br />
Most major cities from mid-west to west did not really start growing in population until after cars were built. The cites were built with streets wider and more convenient for cars, but also businesses being more spread out. So unlike an older American city like NYC where you can get just about everything you need within a few city blocks. In a city like Houston everything you need is a few miles away in all different directions. Instead of hitting the subway to one spot and doing all your shopping, you would have to hop onto multiple buses to do all your shopping. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically it boils down to the cost. In Houston a house close to downtown in a nice neighborhood could cost you 10x what one 30 miles / 50 km from downtown. For most that cost is less justifiable than just commuting every day. </p>
<p>Additionally, the US statistically has the 2nd largest home size of any country in the world. (behind only Australia). We like large homes with yards and grass. This plays into having lower population density as well. It is not uncommon for neighborhoods where every house sits on a lot that is 1000 sq meters.<br />
In 2016 the average home built in the US was over 240 sq meters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why some other people do it, but in my area there are few places in the city that I would want to live, even if it means a long commute. A lot of people value having a larger space and a quiet neighborhood versus living close to work.</p>
<p>Also, in the case of my city, it's more dangerous to live there and the school systems are awful.</p></div>		</li>
