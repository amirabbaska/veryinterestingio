<p>Can you expand on this?</p>
<p>Edit - yes I know how gravity works on earth. Thank you. I was thrown off by the term &quot;gravity well.&quot; I took it as meaning a black hole.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Gravity well&quot; is just a metaphor for how gravity works. The &quot;depth&quot; and radius (gravitational effect) of any gravity well is proportional to the amount of mass at the &quot;bottom&quot; (in the center).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity decreases as you move away from the surface of the Earth so we are in essence stuck at the bottom of a gravity bowl. This has effects you don't normally see in reference to somewhere else in the surface but for GPS satellites high in orbit, the total time dilation effect (gravity + speed) is on the order of tens of microseconds. It does not seem like much but without daily corrections your GPS position would drift by miles every day due to the timing errors between the clocks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. It's because the mass is more spread out in a galaxy. Even for a black hole, the redshift is only large if you're basically right on the event horizon.</p>
<p>For a galaxy, once you're inside the gravity is pulling in all directions, so it partially cancels out and you get an escape velocity of hundreds to thousands of km/s. For a black hole, the gravity is all pointing into the black hole, and just gets stronger and stronger as you get closer and closer. When the escape velocity is just a bit under the speed of light, light can escape but loses energy in redshift. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is a common misconception, but mass isn't what cases black holes and behavior like black holes. It's density, not mass. You can create black holes and observe black-hole like redshift with small mass and high density; the mass isn't the important thing at all.  So this is question is like asking if the sun is as hot as a lemon, because they are both yellow (irrelevant properties) :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;the redshift is so large the gravity wells dont have a large impact any more.&quot;</p>
<p>But this doesn't explain how astronomers will know if the redshift is caused by the gravity of the mass or not? what do you mean &quot;at distances where you get nice measurements&quot; too? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know galaxy masses. They lead to redshift of the order of 0.0001%. If you see 10% redshift (=an example where you get useful redshift measurements) 0.0001% doesnâ€™t really have an impact.</p>
