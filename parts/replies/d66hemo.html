			<div class="markdown"><p><del>Is the mechanism for the slowing of the photon due too the extreme gravity or the warped spacetime? As in, are they simply being attracted to the planet and slowing due to that pull much more than normal?</del> </p>
<p><em>I reread your comment, that's kind of answered</em></p>
<p>Or is the spacetime being stretched, therefore giving them a longer distance to travel? Forgive me if I'm way way off. [6]</p></div>		</li>
