			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two major things that cause food poisoning: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pathogenic bacteria or viruses that were alive in your food and can take a pretty long time to manifest -- up to days -- making the specific meal that got you sick difficult to pinpoint. Getting food poisoning in this way can last a while because your body has to fend off an infection.</p>
</li>
<li>Toxins created by bacteria that was allowed to build up on the food due to improper handling (storage, transportation, etc). The bacteria die when the food is cooked, but the toxins remain. When you eat the food, you're ingesting the toxins and your body reacts. The onset is usually pretty fast, but you're typically not sick for very long. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh. This makes sense. Ate at a shady sea food place on the Gulf Coast of Texas. About 4 hours later on the way home to Dallas, it all hit me. Had to stop 4 times in 20 miles to expel from both ends. I had one last bout of severe abdominal cramping followed my an expulsion, and that was it. I've been wondering why the onset and resolution were so sudden.</p>
<p>And I still remember the fucking oyster that did it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you're killing what can be killed. In this case, toxins refer to the waste products from the bad bacteria. So unfortunately, you've killed the bad, but their shit remains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only had food poisoning once, and it was honestly one of the worst few hours of my entire life.</p>
<p>I <em>thought</em> I'd had it before, but nope, I was wrong.</p>
<p>When I did actually get food poisoning it was, shaking, vomiting and shitting violently simultaneously, and you think you're going to die.</p>
<p>I called the place the next day to alert them, I was sure it was the seafood bolognese..but they stopped me mid explanation and said &quot;Did you have the lemon dessert?&quot; I had, apparently other people got sick as hell too.  The dessert was Hors d'oeuvre size, so I had no idea something so small could fuck you up so bad.</p>
<p>They sent me 100$ gift card in order to say sorry, but...I'm sure as fuck not going back.</p>
<p>Now if someone calls into work and says they have food poisoning I think &quot;If you can call in the middle of food poisoning, it's not food poisoning&quot;, I don't tell them that, but I think it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, no one was around to take my temp or anything (not that i'd be able to have my temperature taken orally, I would have vomited all over them, things at the time need to go out, not in).  My mouth and butt were a no-go zone.</p>
<p>And I'm not rich enough to have a fancy ear temperature thermometer. </p>
<p>But it was incredible, worse 3-4 hours of my life, fell asleep dehydrated and exhausted, but when I woke up I felt kinda OK, except for very, very dehydrated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got food poisoning from a fancy-pants resort restaurant.</p>
<p>It hit me as I was waiting for the taxi to take me to the airport home (the next day).</p>
<p>I have distinct memories of planning my immediate schedule, like &quot;okay, it's gonna take me 30 minutes to get through that TSA line, so I should probably purge again so I can make it to the other side, and then I'll be in a good spot to purge again before we have to find our gate.&quot;</p>
<p>This story may out my pseudo, as while on the plane, when they were bringing the cart out, I needed to talk on the white phone again for a sec, and they were quite perturbed that an uppity passenger was trying to get past them.  I explained in a clear and firm voice - more attention-attention than parade square - heard from cockpit to tail by 400 strangers, &quot;I'm sorry, but I have an URGENT AND PRESSING NEED TO USE THE WASHROOM.&quot;</p>
<p>All's well that ends without smelly sick/worse on the aisle floor in the middle of Steerage, I say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are partially right. Some bacteria produce heat-stable toxins that stay in the food, so even if the meal is cooked, the toxins stay active (think ETEC heat-stable toxin or <em>B. cereus</em> or even <em>S. aureus</em>). Heat-stable toxin food poisoning is usually much shorter lasting (6-18 hours). However, as you said, if the bacteria colonizes the GI tract, it can last much longer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I proceeded to have the worst 12 hours of my life. Had it continued any longer, I would have called an ambulance. </p></div>		</li>
