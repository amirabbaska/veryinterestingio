			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I myself potentiate recreational substances with grapefruit juice. Any drug that is in inactivated via CYP3A4 can benefit from preloading with grapefruit in the days prior to dosing. People also take potent CYP2A6 inhibitors (Diphenhydramine) for drugs that are inactivated via this pathway. Although there's very few CYP2A6 inducers, there is the occasional report of someone using them to potentiate a codeine high, or any other drug activated on this pathway</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, everything in the substrate list is potentiated by grapefruit juice (which contains inhibitors like bergamottin)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For CYP2D6, most recreational drugs are activated by the enzyme, so inhibiting it actually reduces the potency. </p>
<p>Not sure about CYP3A4. You'd have to research the specific drug. It's hard to find info on this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a disclaimer: you may get a &quot;better&quot; high if you preload with grapefruit juice or extract with various drugs; however, it is very difficult to predict the exact level of systemic drug exposure that increases as a result of CYP3A inhibition.</p>
<p>tl;dr: You might overdose and end up in the hospital or, worse, the medical examiner's office/morgue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something else entirely. When marijuana is smoked it crosses the Blood-Brain-Barrier in a matter of seconds and doesn't undergo enzymatic conversion. Mangoes increase the permeability of membranes in your brain to allow more THC to be absorbed. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the change in activity due to binding at the active site? Or somewhere else? Are there any conformational changes that we know of or is it a different mechanism altogether? Being that it can have both a positive and negative affect, I would assume it doesn't just bind the active site and block it. Just a biochemist with limited knowledge on this but I'd like to know more!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inhibition is both mechanism and competition-based. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/14769198/" target="_blank">Source</a>     </p>
<p>CYP3A4 metabolizes furanocoumarins to reactive intermediates that bind to the reactive site, causing irreversible inactivation. CYP3A4 activity does not return to normal until de novo synthesis returns it to its previous level. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589309/" target="_blank">Source</a>     </p>
<p>Interestingly, the labeled content of furanocoumarins do not correlate with inhibitory activity. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4180667/" target="_blank">Source</a>     </p>
<p>My knowledge on the mechanisms are limited as well, but I've done a lot of reading of articles written by people with more expertise than me! I am actually terrified of biochemists when I present because they ALWAYS ask the hardball questions.</p></div>		</li>
