<p>FM is less susceptible to natural radio noise because noise affects the amplitude of a received signal, not its frequency.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only this though. Even if you had no noise nor interference, FM radio would still sound better than AM radio because the audio bandwidth on standard AM modulation is smaller (I believe it's only 10.2kHz in the US), and it's not stereo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To explain that a little bit further for those who aren't aware - </p>
<p>The human ear can hear from 20 hertz to 20,000. Hertz is a measure of &quot;cycles per second&quot;; in the case of sound, it measures the number of wave peaks in a moving column of air per second, the movement of air being how sound works. Speakers push in and out to move air, and your ears measure the movement of air to tell your brain what you're hearing. 20 hz is a super low bass rumble, 20,000 hz is a super high pitched noise. Most of us can't hear that high, and peak out somewhere around 17-18000, dropping with age.</p>
<p>Because AM radio peaks out at 10,000 hertz or so, it's chopping off the top half of the frequency spectrum. That means that all of the high pitched parts of the sound are lost. For talk radio, this does result in a loss of quality, but not bad enough to ruin the experience. For music, this really does crush the quality, rendering it unlistenable for anyone used to higher fidelity audio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, only if you exclude the newer HD radio technology, underwhich both FM and AM sound the same, since the encoding of the audio is the same for both types of carrier modulation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AM is like making out a picture behind a foliage(noise), you cant see the picture it if too much has been covered by leaves. FM is like identifying the color of a light behind foliage (noise), no matter how much noise there is, if a small part goes through, you can still identify the color (information.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes of course, but what I was trying to ask was could you send one signal with varying amplitude and frequency, and have an AM receiver read it's respective message from the varying amplitude of that signal, and the FM receiver read from the varying frequency of the same signal. Two messages, one wave</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not with standard AM/FM radio transmitters/receivers. You'd have to come up with a different standard - and a new standard nowadays would be digital (so it's possible, but not realistic for today's technology)</p>
<p>Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) uses phase (which is time-related to frequency) and amplitude at the same time (but it's a digital modulation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>QAM is used to modulate 2 separate signals by varying the amplitude. The only time phase comes into play here is when the two signals are shifted 90^o apart so the receiver can differentiate between them. </p></div>		</li>

So you could conceivably combine these two to transmit through both methods. The main issue is that FM expects a constant amplitude while AM expects a constan frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Standard analog FM radio has a channel separation of 200kHz, and the &quot;swing&quot; around the center frequency is of -+75kHz (so 150kHz total), leaving 50kHz of &quot;separation&quot; between adjacent channels. Normally the regulating organization will assign channels taking into account the location of transmitters, to try to avoid stations with adjacent channels in the same area to minimize interference too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have noticed before that if you set the radio just right between some stations you can kinda hear both at the same time. Go one way or the other and the station that you move towards becomes clearer and most stations dont even have another one close enough to it to be able to do that where I live. So they probably just space them out enough to avoid that </p></div>		</li>
