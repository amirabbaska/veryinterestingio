			<div class="markdown"><p>Bitching Betty goes all the way back to the first jets, and is a generic term that refers to the voice warning systems used in aircraft. Ex USAF avionics, the ships I worked on all had &quot;her&quot; for various ailments. Quite the earful sometimes.</p>
<p>Betty isn't the same on all these, different companies used different women to record the tracks played. Even MiG's/Su's, Russian fighters/bombers, and passenger transports like trains have their own take. Some even use a guys voice, Bitching/Barking Bob, and in some cases can be selected by the aircrew.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember hearing somewhere that female voices were used because the pilots (almost entirely male) responded better and more promptly to a woman's voice.</p>
<p>I guess when that voice is saying things like &quot;radar lock, evade&quot; or &quot;altitude, pull up&quot; you do want the pilot's response to be prompt...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, i think it also has to do with just being able to distinguish the voice clearly. In a combat situation, theres a lot of communication going on at all times to keep track of, not to mention everything else. When almost all the voices you hear are male, another Male voice is easily lost, so they used a female voice as the brain will focus and respond to something new and out of the ordinary.</p></div>		</li>
