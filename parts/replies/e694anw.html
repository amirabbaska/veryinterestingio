			<div class="markdown"><p>One sort of nuance for any physics-minded folks: there are dissolved gasses in the deep sea, and if they were to come out of solution, they would behave like gasses and would be compressible. However, under pressure, they will stay in solution, so it doesn't matter for deep-sea animals.</p>
<p>If you're wondering how animals get oxygen in the deep sea (or in the non-surface part of any body of water in general), they extract dissolved gasses from the water, and the oxygen stays dissolved and never comes out of solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If an animal's enzymes can't function under high pressures at a particular depth, the animal can't live at that depth. Other than air-filled spaces, enzymes are really the only pressure-related reason that some animals can't live at the deeper depths.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real answer is a biochemical one. TMAO is thought to be what allows deep sea fishing to live at high pressures. It allows blood flow to continue instead of proteins building up and stopping flow. </p>
