			<div class="markdown"><p>A variation on &quot;rich get richer&quot;+&quot;central limit&quot; approach that I heard recently in the context of a specific Pareto distribution example: in the USA, executions (death penalty) follow a very obvious power law, in terms of which counties do them. You could eliminate nearly every execution in the USA by just stopping the process in a few counties. Why would that be? If you get into details of it, in most counties where the death penalty is legal, the judgment of whether to sentence to death is held up against a standard of &quot;is crime X worse than the previous crimes that have <em>not</em> have the death penalty assigned to them?&quot; The odds are that crime X is not that exceptional compared to every other crime that has ever not have the penalty applied. In the counties that have historically used it a lot, the opposite is applied: &quot;is crime X less-worse than the previous crimes that <em>have</em> gotten the death penalty?&quot; The odds are that X is probably very similar to other capital punishment cases in such a case.</p>
<p>I found this a pretty useful way to think of Pareto distributions when applied to complex social phenomena. </p></div>		</li>
