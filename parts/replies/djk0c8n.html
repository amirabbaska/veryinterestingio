			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the surface tension is minimal. What I think that accomplished was decreasing the density of the first few feet of water he hit, greatly increasing the impulse of his impact from a few milliseconds to a few seconds. Basically he created a small column of turbulence which is similar to the purpose of the bubblers mentioned in the top comments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't see how the toolbox hitting the water would break the surface tension. You're still hitting water, the surface tension isn't changing right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if you're hitting an upwards spray of water first, this could provide a significantly softer landing. Also, apparently divers can dive from higher up if they have aerated bubbles coming up from underneath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but he threw it while in free fall which does 2 things 1:reduces the velocity of the thrower slightly and 2: Increases the velocity of the tool box. Newtons 3rd law explains this very well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I the only one who noticed that it actually says in the article &quot;toolbelt&quot; instead of &quot;toolbox&quot;? Would a toolbelt really have made that much of a difference in this situation, what with it weighing much less than a toolbox?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They would accelerate due to gravity at the same rate, but he threw it ahead of him. The toolbox would have been going his speed plus how fast he threw it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conversely, he would also reduce his velocity from the equal pushing force he expended on the tool box. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The terminal velocity of the toolbox ought to be faster than the person. Smooth surfaces, regular shape, no clothes flapping. So even if he didn't throw it, it would probably get ahead of him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on surface area the answer would be no. Terminal velocity is based on the surface area. Also If he was holding the tool box they both share the same momentum and he could have thrown it adding momentum to the tool box to reach the water first.</p></div>		</li>
