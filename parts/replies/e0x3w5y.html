			<div class="markdown"><p>Beekeeper here. Honeybees also produce a &quot;homing&quot; pheromone, called Nasanov pheromone, which alerts other bees as to where to fly home.  You will see bees out in front of the hive fanning their butts pointed in the air.  <a href="https://youtu.be/a7Dl1CtSihc" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/a7Dl1CtSihc</a>
There is also the Queen pheremone that let's other bees know that they have a queen.  Only the queen produces it, and if the queen dies or goes missing the pheremone will fade, letting the other bees know they must make emergency queen cells to make another queen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>how do a Queen is born? they give it something akin to the boss baby formula? afaik the queen is several sizes bigger than most bees but at the same time they can't have more than one queen for each hive, but how the hive does decide when or how to produce a new queen? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you said they are standing at the hive pointing their butts in the air I imagined something more like <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/rsecwjy" target="_blank">this</a> while they dance in the rhythm of 30s music.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The primary function of the fanning isn't to spread the pheromone but to ventilate the hive and to keep it from overheating. The number of workers dedicated to the activity will be directly proportional to the temperature at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I take them down with a classic hand sprayer bottle filled with water. If you shoot them down mid air they will crash land - assuming you used water and nothing else in your sprayer you can collect the flying bug in a cup or whatever and put it outside where the water will evaporate and you and they can go with your respective days unharmed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a paper wasp nest in my door frame, between the house door and screen door. It's been interesting watching it grow the nest every day. There are two larva growing in it, one was closed over by the wasp today while I was gone for errands. At first I was just waiting for the right time to spray, but then I never had any issues so I just left it... Although I'm not sure if I'll leave it once the two other wasps emerge. Three wasps just sounds much worse than one wasp lol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, an interesting fact about the alarm pheromone - if you are ever stung by a honey bee, after taking the right steps to remove the stinger and everything if you are able to you should smell it. Honey bee alarm pheromone is a chemical called isoamyl acetate, which is also used in banana flavorings, and the stinger will smell vaguely banana like. </p></div>		</li>
