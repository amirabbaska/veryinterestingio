			<div class="markdown"><p>YMMV but I recently purchased a home that hadn't been heavily lived in for over two years.  The basement was utterly rampant with spider activity and it was nasty as hell.  Over the past six months or so I've been regularly spraying the perimeter of each room, in addition to windows and other thresholds with this stuff, and it has culled the population enormously.  </p>

<p>Not sure how widely available this brand is, but I'm sure you can find something with the same active ingredient.</p></div>		</li>
