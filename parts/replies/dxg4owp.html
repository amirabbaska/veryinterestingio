<p>Do you study/work in this field? I have a question, when you said </p>
<blockquote>
<p>we’re not even sure that conscious thought is anything but an emergent and ultimately useless property of brain function (if the brain is an engine making things run, consciousness might just be the heat coming off of it).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This struck me a lot because I’ve for some time now came to see consciousness as the most sophisticated way a body developed to enhance its survival chances.
With consciousness, there is a part of the body exclusively responsible for “watching out” for the the body in specific situations. Kinda like a manager. </p>
<p>Now compare that to forms of life that have no consciousness, who didn’t develop that “manager”. </p>
<p>What I find very amusing in this approach is that our concept of identity would drastically change. It’s not your body who is existing <em>for</em> you, for your “soul”. This soul is nothing but an employee of that body. </p>
<p>Hope I made it halfway understandable and would love to hear your take on it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're very welcome! I'm a graduate student (PhD candidate soon, hopefully) in neuroscience with most of my experience being in ethology, neurobiology and psychology (all in animals)-- so by no means an expert (yet), but I think I'm pretty well read. And scientists (even those of us in training) live for answering people's questions to the best of our ability, in my experience. I'll preface again by saying that I don't study consciousness (does anyone?), but I can give you my thoughts. Again, this is speculation on my part, not fact or even particularly substantiated theory. I will also add that I'm short on time, so I can't cite as much as I'd like, but I may add references later...</p>
<p>Also, before I ramble, I'll mention that your idea sounds very much like that of the &quot;homunculus&quot; (not sensory/motor cortex homunculi), or &quot;little man&quot; theory of cognition/philosophy, which is generally argued against on the basis that something must control that &quot;manager&quot; too- and something would have to control that manager, and something would have to control that one, and so on. Your turtles have to stand on something, after all.</p>
<p>On to your questions: first, we don't have a particularly good definition of what consciousness really is, much less what does or doesn't have it. We know that we as humans have it because we can conceive of having it. We think, therefore, we must be able to think- sound logic. We also assume that because other humans behave like we do, they must also have consciousness. We can also ask them, and they are able to reply affirmatively. We can't do so for other organisms, but the inability to falsify whether or not they have consciousness means that we can't say either way. It's not proof for or against the concept. </p>
<p>Further, it turns out animals are capable of things people ascribe to humans only. Of course, there's the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327078in0902_6" target="_blank">mirror test</a>, which claims to determine self awareness. More specific work has been done in the field of animal metacognition, which has been leaning towards animals being capable of things like being able to report <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19242741/" target="_blank">confidence in a memory</a>- the evaluation of one's own uncertainty is considered to be a pretty high level phenomenon. Neither of these are evidence of consciousness (that bar might not even exist), but they do suggest more intelligence than people usually ascribe to animals. In fact, if you're interested more in animal intelligence and such, I recommend reading &quot;Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?&quot; by Frans de Waal, a primatologist and ethologist that has studied concepts like self-other distinction, empathy, morality, and imitation in primates and other animals. I don't always agree with his views (I give &quot;lower&quot; animals a bit more credit), but he's an excellent thinker on the subject. That said, in summary there, I don't know if we can say that agents do or do not have consciousness.</p>
<p>Further, I'm unsure whether consciousness, conceived of as potentially functional and not merely a byproduct, would provide anything advantageous. From the perspective of evolution, I doubt one can make a case for selective pressures favoring a subjective experience. The brain seems to have the intended function of taking in external information and responding to it in a way that maximizes rewards and minimizes punishment. This does provide an avenue for the emergence of things like aversive and appetitive signals- but you can avoid something without the conscious feeling of &quot;fear&quot;. You could also, in theory, approach or eat something without consciously feeling that it is a &quot;good&quot; thing. It does not necessitate you be aware of why- and one could argue that the act of consciously feeling things can be a detriment in some cases. That is to say, the behaviors that arise from these feelings are certainly adaptive-- but do we need to feel something to do it? Would the function without awareness be just as useful? </p>
<p>Another question: supposing feeling/being conscious of things is somehow adaptive, would you not expect this conscious feeling to arise before action?
In fact, many studies (some are decades old, even!) have found that the neural signatures of many behaviors begin to appear before we are consciously aware of choosing to initiate such a behavior. There's a popular idea of &quot;free won't&quot; as opposed to &quot;free will&quot;. Basically, a study by Libet in the... 60s? 70s? originally found that when you decide to move, the moving parts of your brain are already ready to make that movement before you're aware of actually wanting to move. You can also veto these feelings and not move after you're aware of them. In summary, you feel urges to do things, which your brain has prepared &quot;without your consent&quot;, but you can veto the action if you'd like.  In this case, your &quot;manager&quot; doesn't actually have any control over what your brain wants to do, but has the authority to stop it from doing things- kinda like a real life manager.</p>
<p>I'm short on time now for real (oops) and will end abruptly with some of my thoughts: I don't know if I equate the soul with consciousness. I think it depends on your perspective and definition for each. I like to think of consciousness as an illusion- a comforting one, but I don't think it's necessarily functional. I'll even add that I was not raised this way, but through my readings, I've become very partial to a Hindu/Buddhist interpretation of the soul and mortality: life as an illusion from which the soul must escape. If you think of consciousness as the soul, then the idea is that to achieve moksha, you must somehow surpass your own consciousness, recognize it (and your physical body) as an illusion, and in fact, simply an extension of Everything That Ever Was, Is, And Ever Will Be. Consciousness as an emergent property of the brain and of the universe- both really just the same thing. Similarly, I think of myself as the universe expressed as a human for a little while, studying itself, meaning my consciousness isn't particularly functional- it just is, like everything else.</p>
<p>I must sound really fake-deep, but it's hard to discuss consciousness without veering off into this kind of talk, lol. I apologize for rambling so much, and again, I may include some more studies later- but this topic is definitely one that requires a lot of soul searching, and (at least for now) can't be answered by science. We can't exactly falsify consciousness, so even experts mostly just... do their best to try to make sense of it.
I hope reading this wasn't a complete waste of your time!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a great read, thank you!</p>
<p>Also, &quot;I must sound really <strong>fake-deep</strong>&quot; don't put so much pressure/high standards on yourself. I don't think anyone was judging you as being &quot;fake-deep&quot;. In fact, I don't even know what that is. But I'm assuming it's some sort of response to the popular culture of the day. Regardless, I thought that was very informative and &quot;genuine-deep(?)&quot;. Don't self deprecate as much! Ok bye</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be better to say &quot;I am currently embodied in this body&quot; - and there's an etymological appeal to it too.</p>
<p>Many people think that, if you managed to transfer their thought processes and memories to an electronic computer, it would still be them. That being the case, it would be false that they are their body.</p></div>		</li>
