			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting thing is that dealerships don't own the cars that are on their lot.  They are basically &quot;consigned&quot; to them from the factory for 30 days.   So that's why they can have thousands of cars for sale on their lot, they don't own any of them.   The factory does.   If they sell them within 30 days... it's all good.   If they are running out of time, they have a &quot;SUPER END OF SUMMER BLOWOUT SAVING EXTRAVAGANZA&quot; or some stupid shit like that.   Gets them off the lot even if they make very little profit.<br />
Remember the big financial meltdown of the economy in 2008 or 2009?   Did you notice how many car dealers went out of business?   Well, they had hundreds of unsold cars on their lots at the end of the thirty days, and the factory said &quot;Time to buy them&quot; and the dealers couldn't, they didn't have that much cash, because of course, no one was buying any cars no matter how many Super Labor Day Sales they had.   So when the IOU for all those cars on their lots came due, they had no choice but to go out of business.   Then that started happening all over the country, and that's what made all the car factories go bankrupt also.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI, this must be an American thing.</p>
<p>In Australia at least the dealers own the cars and are financed by finance companies offering &quot;floor-plan finance&quot;. I.e, you want to put 20 of a new model onto your yard, then your finance companies pays the money to the manufacturer and they are delivered. The dealership then pays a repayment to the finance company offering the floor-plan finance</p>
<p>Very rarely however do you see bulk orders happening unless it's a cheaper model that is almost guaranteed to sell quickly (Eg. Toyota Corolla). So what you find is, in almost all situations the new car you order will not be available that day (unless you're swayed to buy something I stock).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would suspect that American car dealerships are much larger than Aussie car dealerships.   And they try to steer you into a car they have on their lot, for obvious reasons.   I would suspect that most car dealers in the US have about 500 new cars in stock at any given time, at least in a large city.  Plus a lot of used cars also. If you get out in a smaller town those numbers would be less, of course.
But there are exceptions to this rule of course.  Tesla dealers were usually in very small storefronts and had one Tesla sitting inside.   You had to buy it based on that, you didn't even get a test drive.   Maybe that has changed in recent years, I don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, sales targets are where it's at.  remember with cars, the product os already made, so it is better to sell them at a low price than not sell them at all.  i am in scientific instrumentation sales, and it's a similar principle.</p></div>		</li>
