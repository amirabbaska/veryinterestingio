			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. Hypervelocity impacts induce <em>medium-internal</em> sonic booms, since the shockwave travels faster than sound can. Never thought about that, but it explains a lot about why high velocity impacts are so much more damaging than the &quot;little bullet hole through glass&quot; effect that seems intuitive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypervelocity impacts also just plain release a lot more energy. Energy of an impact increases with the square of velocity, so at orbital velocities the impactor and some of the impactee just vaporize. There's also fun stuff like metals flowing plastically under extreme stresses.</p>
<p>That said, shockwaves in metal is a scary thought.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is much faster in solids than in gases so that would explain this phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.&quot; (Clarke's First Law).</p>
<p>Since a self-healing sail is just a matter of materials science and doesn't seem to require any new physics, there's no reason it couldn't happen eventually. But the constraints on mass and thickness mean that it's farther off than most other applications of self-healing materials.</p></div>		</li>
