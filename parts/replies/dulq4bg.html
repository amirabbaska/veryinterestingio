			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much a battery/capacitor hybrid. Supercaps are cool. There's a video of a guy on youtube that made a pack of 6 C cell sized supercaps that can start a car. If the car didn't start right away it'd probably be a problem, and they run themselves down in like a week, but still. Kinda neat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are a different kind of super capacitor. They are true electrostatic capacitors and use high surface area forms of carbon for the electrodes. They are bigger and substantially more expensive than the type /u/agate_ mentioned which are cheap and small and often used for clock and memory backups but they also have much lower ESRs allowing them to charge and discharged extremely rapidly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are describing is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_layer_(surface_science\)" target="_blank">double layer</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A double layer (DL, also called an electrical double layer, EDL) is a structure that appears on the surface of an object when it is exposed to a fluid. The object might be a solid particle, a gas bubble, a liquid droplet, or a porous body. The DL refers to two parallel layers of charge surrounding the object. The first layer, the surface charge (either positive or negative), consists of ions adsorbed onto the object due to chemical interactions. The second layer is composed of ions attracted to the surface charge via the Coulomb force, electrically screening the first layer. This second layer is loosely associated with the object. It is made of free ions that move in the fluid under the influence of electric attraction and thermal motion rather than being firmly anchored. It is thus called the &quot;diffuse layer&quot;.</p>
