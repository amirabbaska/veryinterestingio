			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's not just software getting more demanding (even though that's part of it).</p>
<p>Simple test: Take a computer that's slow. Reformat and reinstall exactly the same software. It'll be faster.</p>
<p>All this assuming Windows. Windows has a habit of cluttering up everything, registry, temp directories, system directories and so on, and that slows things down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I'm talking about such things as the register growing unnecessarily large, making fetches slower, of having a shitload of files in the system dir, making it slower to find a specific file, having a shitload of temp files which make creation of temp files slower as it needs to check for duplicate names, or simply having shared files of wrong versions.</p>
<p>Then, of course, we have all the crap that software does, such as preloading itself to make launching faster, but at the expense of other programs.</p>
<p>It's not fragmentation that's the problem, it's that there is so much stuff, and so much dependencies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it is for location of file fragments on a physical drive, which is often significant, but windows also has an issue of what's <em>in the files</em> gets mucked up. The databases that power every windows function get too huge or too disorganized to scan through quickly, so literally every system operation suffers. Fresh install starts with tiny, fast core databases. </p>
