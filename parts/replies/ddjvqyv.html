<p>I think the issue people have with Trump not disclosing his tax returns is that he made his wealth a big deal and part of his campaign. Basically saying, if I can make myself a multi billionaire,  imagine what I can do for the US economy. </p>
<p>His tax return would be one way to verify his wealth, so his lack of disclosure is why many Trump haters latch on to this.  Somewhere some people have got confused that he was legally obliged to share this information,  but the truth is only that people suspect he lied about his wealth and now think  he refuses to disclose this information as it will prove he lied. </p>
<p>It is all just assumption currently.  I doubt we will ever get the whole truth.  I won't share my personal views on Trump,  but I think in 4 years time we can all have a proper discussion with how it went. </p></div>		</li>
