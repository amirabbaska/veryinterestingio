			<div class="markdown"><p>Copy-pasta:</p>
<p>A few very brief notes on the ISDS provisions from a first skim by an arbitration lawyer. I'm editing as I notice new things. First impression - it's great. Democratic provisions and enormous leeway for governments that want to protect the environment and public health. Note that there are two separate procedures.</p>
<p>State-State disputes - covered by Article 28.</p>
<p>ISDS - covered by Article 9.</p>
<p>I'll deal with them roughly side by side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The investment chapter permits states to make policy on environmental and public health grounds Article 9.15</p>
<p>States are also encouraged to promote corporate social responsibility (Article 9.16). Seems like a small thing, but this is actually a big leap - especially to have all of these countries agree on CSR in theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is the interesting stuff from the investment chapter. Note that the claims of health and environmental suffering are headed off at the pass.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Focus on alternative dispute resolution. Parties will be forced to negotiate for a set period, with the aim of reaching an agreement. If that fails, they have the options of 'good offices', 'mediation', or 'conciliation'. (Article 9.17; 28.5; 28.6).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Negotiations generally do not work, but it is encouraging that they are forced upon the parties, to avoid lengthy and costly battles.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a clause that requires arbitrators to be experts in the relevant subject matter of a dispute (except for labour, environment, and corruption disputes) [this is only for State-State disputes I think]. (Article 28.9(3))</p>
<p>There is a specific subsection for environmental disputes that mandates a level of expertise in environmental law. (Article 28.9(4))</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is all really promising. Arbitrators usually are experts anyway, but mandating it is quite novel.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Hearings are automatically public unless the parties agree otherwise, if State-State (Article 28.12(1)(b))</p>
<p>ALL HEARINGS in Investor-State cases will be open to the public (Article 9.23(2).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>I like this. There will be sections that have to be closed because of confidential information, but I think the majority will be open. It will be rare for both parties to want to close proceedings, and in the case of hearings involving corporations, ALL hearings will be open, with confidential information kept separate.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>All arbitrators must be neutral, completely uninvolved in the dispute, be chosen solely based on objectivity and expertise, and be totally independent of both Parties (Article 28.10).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This will hopefully silence the people complaining about 'corporate courts for corporate lawyers'. Sure, some arbitrators will be lawyers. Some will be judges, some will be academics. But clearly all must be independent. If there is even a whiff of conflict of interest or bias, the other side will be able to use this article to reject the selection.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Third party participation in State-State hearings - a State with an interest in a case will be able to intervene and make their own submissions in cases. (Article 28.3)</p>
<p>Where two investors have a similar claim, they will be consolidated into one case (Article 9.27).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This isn't common in arbitration proceedings as it is usually dependent on the agreement of the parties or Tribunal. Here, however, it appears to be an absolute right to intervene. The consolidation will mean that many investors' grievances can be effectively dealt with together, or that Governments can come to one another's aid. It will likely mean far more work for lawyers too.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Enforcement of awards looks interesting but I haven't been through it properly yet. There are effective ways of enforcement permitted under the treaty, which will help Governments to act against other Governments or Corporations. Suspending of benefits seems to be the biggest enforcement mechanism permitted, with detailed rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Investor cases, no punitive damages can be given, and most importantly, I will quote here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>IF AN INVESTOR SUBMITS A CLAIM TO ARBITRATION... IT MAY RECOVER ONLY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IT HAS INCURRED AS AN INVESTOR OF A PARTY</strong> (Article 9.28(2)).</p>
<p><strong>WHEN AN AWARD IS MADE IN FAVOUR OF THE CLAIMANT, THE ONLY DAMAGES THAT CAN BE AWARDED ARE THOSE THAT THE CLAIMANT HAS PROVEN WERE SUSTAINED IN THE ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT, PROVIDED THAT THE CLAIMANT ALSO PROVES THAT THE BREACH WAS THE PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THOSE DAMAGES</strong> (Article 9.28(4))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can we PLEASE stop talking about 'lost profits' and 'punitive damages' now? Please?</p>
<p>That's the interesting stuff I think, based on a short reading. Otherwise, the content is quite standard. I'll outline the normal procedure for those that don't know:</p>
<ul>
<li>One party initiates a claim</li>
<li>Negotiation happens to settle</li>
<li>If negotiation fails, both parties pick an Arbitrator</li>
<li>Parties agree on the chair between them, or the two selected arbitrators choose a chair between them.</li>
<li>The case happens based on a selected rules of procedure (usually ICSID in investment cases).</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, according to that if the treaty passes the world will end and everything will be ruined forever. I just took a look through some of the various articles that chris hedges fellow writes, and it seems like this is a trend. They're ridiculous. Everything from films to positive thinking to violence addiction will destroy the country and ruin everything.</p>
<p>Conspicuously absent, is any kind of reasoned discourse or evidence-based explanation of how a thing works and why it working in this particular way will cause problems. Nor is there an explanation of why China would ever agree to such a purportedly terrible treaty. There sure is a lot of vitriol and hysterical exaggeration though. Put simply, you can do better so far as reliable sources are concerned.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure why you're trying to convince me though, I honestly don't give a crap about what trade treaties your country gets into. </p></div>		</li>
