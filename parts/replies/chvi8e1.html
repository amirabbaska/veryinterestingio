			<div class="markdown"><p>I see what you're saying but I'm not sure you could call the external air pressure constant because it's not just the atmospheric pressure that's impacting airflow into the car.  In the case of a car moving down a highway, the air pressure would fluctuate, sometimes abruptly, at both changes in speed of the car and from changes in crosswind.  Not a physicist, meteorologist or any other -ist, just a thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, but that would generate a random change in pressure, not a stable oscilation that we perceive, as long as we don't change the windows or our speed.</p></div>		</li>
