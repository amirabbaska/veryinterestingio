			<div class="markdown"><p>Misleading. The most common form of colour blindness makes you see red and green as the same color <strong>but only in most extreme cases</strong>. Like on the graph you posted thats an extreme case, usually green and red would be closer toghether, meaning that ofcourse you still see red as red and green as green but you see less shades in between. Personal example - I see less shades between blue and purple, so some (just some!) shades of blue look like purple to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great way to explain colorblindness (assuming like me, everyone asks you &quot;what's it like??&quot; when they find out you're colorblind). It's not that <strong>all</strong> reds and greens look the same, it's just that <em>some</em> shades are indiscernible.</p></div>		</li>

I dont see in black &amp; white.. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My best friend growing up was like this, but if you put the two shades next to each other, he could understand they were different without being told, they were just much closer together to him, so if he wasn't looking at them together, he thought they were the same. </p>
<p>Dude was asked to pick out the new coloring for the &quot;field&quot; parts of the mini golf course he worked at, so the 10 different shades of blue/purple were a bit of a problem for him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely. I was colorblind for 23 years before I figured it out. It's not like it's impossible for me to see the difference between Red and Green, I just have trouble with middling shades and things with lots of red and green simultaneously.</p>
<p>I can tell that <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ee58b112c451fa3a518dc9c9482f9fd3" target="_blank">these are green and red</a> but I can't read <a href="http://www.colour-blindness.com/CBTests/ishihara/Plate8.gif" target="_blank">this</a> or <a href="http://colorvisiontesting.com/images/plate%20with%202.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>, whereas most people can pretty immediately. I can't read them at all. Just a bunch of dots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a Psych lab and one of our experiments required the participants to take a colour blindness test first. Ran a hundred or so subjects before I finally came across one who couldn't see the numbers at all. He legit freaked out! Felt like I changed someone else's life that day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Huh, always figured it was a standard part of vision tests... When I was little the optometrist usually did the test with the dots. When I first did my drivers license test they also tested me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say it's the TWO most common types, protan and deutan, when severe result in red looking like green. It's not just one form (protanopia). From my understanding of all the info I've read, deuteranopia is similar in making red appear green.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm the opposite with blue and purple. For me, almost all purples look like blue. I end up being corrected often. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Text below is taken directly from the user guide for color correcting glasses (<a href="http://enchroma.com/user-manual-warranty/" target="_blank">http://enchroma.com/user-manual-warranty/</a>).   It helps to better explain how the glasses work but also calls into question the life changing experience in the viral marketing videos</p>
<p>When putting on the glasses, allow at least 10 minutes for the eyes to adjust to the darkness of the lens and avoid removing the glasses during the adjustment period. Removing the glasses, even momentarily, will tend to reduce the effectiveness of the color enhancement.</p>
<p>To ensure optimal effectiveness, wear the lens for at least 10 hours in a variety of situations over the course of 1-2 weeks. Depending on the rate of neural plasticity in the user, a significant amount of time may be required for the visual cortex to respond to the new information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if the glasses blocked the light in areas where there is little overlap between red and green (instead of blocking the middle part like in your diagram, they'd block the sides)? Wouldn't that reduce your ability to discriminate between red and green?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd be blocking a lot of wavelengths, so I'd imagine most things would appear blue to black because the shade of red/green they happen to reflect would be completely blocked by the glasses.</p></div>		</li>
