			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is indeed a great explanation of the initial issue, I thought I would underline the apocalyptic aspect of this.</p>
<p>Two big points raised - Melting of ice, death of ocean life. Both of these start off a cycle we may never escape, and may eventually leave earth inhospitable for human life. </p>
<p>Not all life, but certainly human life.</p>
<p>Ice is the most reflective thing in nature, and a large part of our planet is covered in it. This reflects heat back into space. As it melts, it exposes dirt and water, the least reflective things, and they absorb heat, making the problem worse, and so more ice melts, and it gets worse.</p>
<p>As acidic water kills sea life, sea life dies. This creates more carbon, more methane, and makes the water more toxic, which kills more life and makes the problem worse.</p>
<p>This, by my understanding is 'THE BIG DEAL', where the little damage we do creates a tipping point where we no longer have any control because it will get worse no matter what we do. </p>
<p>I would compare it more to driving a car toward a distant wall. There will be a point where even if we slam on the brakes, it will be beyond our ability to stop, either due to speed or distance.</p>
<p>Scientists have discovered that wall is closer AND our brakes don't work as well as we had originally thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. But billions of animals and entire species will pay the cost as well. Species which have taken millions of years to evolve.   </p>
<p>Once they're gone they're gone.</p>
<p>It's entirely possible in a few hundred years time the way we talk about dinosaurs, mammoths, dodos and other extinct and rare animals will be how they speak about elephants and tigers and probably everything but common animals.</p>
<p>The idea of seeing the world's species decimated is sickening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As pessimistic as it sounds  the wall may as well be here. It's not that we can't apply the brakes now and possibly avoid a catastrophe. </p>
<p>No the problem is that it takes us far too long to apply the brakes, and so many people are not on board. At this rate it'll take decades before we make any real push towards reversing climate change. Setting up alternate energy and recycling is great, but we still have coal plants and giant landfills. We've made steps, but far too few too small. </p>
<p>Our world is going to look a lot different in 50+ years, and it won't be the world our grandparents dreamed of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it seems, bleak, but it isn't all doom and gloom. As humans we have a great capacity for adaptation and technology is always moving forward. We could 'build a better brake', we could push back that wall. Current estimates are based on current technology. IF we make changes now, big changes, we can slow things down. We can buy ourselves more time. Time to repair damage, time to find solutions. </p>
<p>Look at how fast computer technology improved, once enough companies found a way to profit from it.</p>
<p>Saying it's too late, or people are too unwilling to change is as bad as the people that deny it, but not quite as bad as those that believe it but want to profit while they can.</p>
<p>Be the change you want to see in the world, my dudes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to understand that we can (and, at this point, pretty much have to) combine an effort to slow and limit global warming as much as possible with programs aimed at reducing the damage it causes.</p>
<p>For instance, currently, about 25% of the world's population survives on subsistence farming, mostly in Africa, Asia, and South America.  Those people are the ones most at risk due to climate change - even if farm yields drop in many parts of the world, first world nations will be able to endure longer because they can just shift where they grow or import their food.  But for people who rely on subsistence farming to survive, there aren't any easy options - if the land where they live becomes impossible to survive off of by farming, they're going to have to leave.  This is going to result in increasing waves of refugees, perhaps even more than flooding or more overt weather-based disasters.  We need ways of handling those refugees, socially and politically.</p>
<p>Obviously the current world situation (where a comparatively far-smaller refugee crisis is sparking a vitriolic backlash) isn't a good sign in that respect.</p></div>		</li>

Scientists already know the phytoplankton are dying on a big scale, So how soon will we start feeling the effects of O2 decline? Is this going to be an issue for us or will we all be dead before the O2 problem gets critical?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The irony is the politicians don't make ANY of these decisions.  You know who do?  The business owners.  Whether or not the EPA mandates a specific emissions target on cars/trucks is irrelevant.  All that matters is whether Ford/GM etc. decide to do it on their own.  Oil companies can decide today to move to Solar.  Grocery stores can immediately halt the use of plastic bags.  Businesses can commit to going carbon neutral.  None of this requires the govt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>O2 levels are not going to be a problem on the timescales we're talking about. It is worth noting however that the only reason we have so much free oxygen in the atmosphere is photosynthetic organisms dominated the earth way back. The only reason most oxygen breathing life can exist is that it pretty much evolved in response to the massive amounts of waste oxygen produced by plants. We are in the middle of an ice age, but what we're doing right now is pretty much rapidly, artificially ending it. What's supposed to happen next in the cycle is massive freezing over about 20-30% of the surface. With everything we've done over the past 200 years were skipping right through and onto the greenhouse stage. This would have eventually happened anyway, but you're talking on a timescale of tens of thousands, perhaps another million years, not the hundred or so we're looking at now</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The atmosphere is made up of 21% O2, 0.04% CO2 and other gasses, the effects of an increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere will be significantly worse than an equal decrease in the amount of O2. So it's the latter, the earth will turn into a fireball way before we start running out of oxygen.</p></div>		</li>
