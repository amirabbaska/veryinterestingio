<p>But the paper doesn't seem to actually present anything, it's just a summary with a lot of references.</p>
<p>You can get the full text of just about any paper by pasting its DOI at the end of <a href="http://sci-hub.cc/" target="_blank">http://sci-hub.cc/</a> though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He claims to have conducted hundreds of test, not just MRI (which is the minority because it's expensive) but also direct electrodes and other methods. He also claims that managed to induce digestive system diseases in sleep deprived rats which can be see with a naked eye on dissected animal. Like I wrote above this seems suspicious to me because I never heard of such dramatic effects in humans. One can argue that humans have more powerfull brain that rats, etc., etc. but still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Task based studies that used  cluster enhancement in the past may be plagued by a higher false discover rate than expected by chance but that doesn't invalidate 40,000 brain studies. Voxel-wise analysis and permutation based analysis are unaffected. The findings of that paper also don't invalidate resting state studies (although a lot of resting state studies have their own slew of problems). In addition, false discoveries in task-based neuroimaging, while worrisome, are not as damning in practice as that article may make you believe. For some studies with appropriate familywise error correction you might find a few hundred significant voxels that group together in clusters that are related to the task. If many of these voxels turn out to be false discoveries then that could just make the cluster smaller. The general location of the effect would still be where it was observed, just with fewer significant voxels.     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a fair point and it would be ridiculous to condemn all fMRI studies.</p>
<p>I think much of the growing resentment against fMRI has to do with the arrogance of some fMRI researchers, who claim that future society will remember this century as the century of fMRI. Also some people try to find answers to problems that are clearly out of reach of fMRI (be it free will, religion or ethics). At the same time it isn't even clear what the signal of fMRI actually represents in terms of neural activity (excitation, inhibition or transmission).</p></div>		</li>
