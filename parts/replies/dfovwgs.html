<p>Realistically, what's important here is that: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>all ships aren't sailing to the raj and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all ships have different expenses </p>
</li>
<li>some have better security (anti-french measures!) </li>
</ol>
<p>You might personally think the captain of Raj #22 is a trustworthy, wholesome fella who also voted for your president, so you put a higher proportion of your investment bankroll into #22. It really comes down to simple stuff like that for a lot of people. Or the fact that #22 has returned over Â£1m to investors or something like that and never lost a fight. Might be more expensive but the value is there. </p>
<p><strong>tldr; it's never as black and white as it appears.</strong></p>
<p>Generally investments are all made to be logical and reasonable at the time of buying, because the buyers and sellers are literally arguing about the value and that's the <strong>agreed</strong> upon price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Owning parts of ships were the actual precursor to stocks, historically. Its not just the image, its how expeditions were financed. Some dudes in netherlands then came up with the idea of stocks. Instead of just owning 1% of company, you could own stocks of companies, each representing a %. It's not that much different from ships. A company can also sink. An Index is just owning all spice ships for example, like owning a chemical index. That's it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ships aren't just an example it how it truely started with the Dutch and English. It also allowed skilled craftsman and other middle class individuals to get in the spice trade without needed to have the money to build an entire ship themselves. It spread to other industries when people got the system down and saw how much capital could be raised. </p></div>		</li>
