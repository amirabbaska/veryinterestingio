<blockquote>
<p>Given a recent estimate of 4.3 million solar masses for the mass of Sagittarius A* and S2's close approach, this makes S2 the fastest known ballistic orbit, reaching speeds exceeding 5000 km/s (11,000,000 mph, or 1/60 the speed of light) and acceleration of about 1.5 m/s2 (almost one-sixth of Earth's surface gravity).</p>

<p>So, I'm curious, if you were standing on a planet orbiting that star, would you be able to feel that acceleration? Could a planet even orbit in that scenario?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>S2 is not the fastest of these stars. I should correct the Wikipedia article. S2 has a high average speed, but one of S2's neighbors, S14 (aka S0-16), is the one with the closest periastron distance (only 45 AU), and hence the highest maximum speed. The is probably the one u/purplepatch refers to. At periastron it <a href="http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/kaniol/a360/Black_Hole_in_Galaxy.htm" target="_blank">moves at 11,700 km/s</a>, or 4% of the speed of light.  That's almost 3 times as fast as S2. It is very difficult to observe stars in this region, so it's very likely that there are stars on even closer orbits that we haven't detected yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rough estimation based on the scale and time. Orbit looks to be roughly 12-14 light days in 'circumference', and the time period of the video looks to be 1992-2006. </p>
<p>So ballpark, it's travelling at about one light day per year on average. Or 1/365th the speed of light c. Not relativistic. </p>
<p>However, it is <em>significantly</em> accelerated on approach to the black hole.  It's extremely hard to pin it down exactly from a YouTube video over breakfast. Say it's going 10x it's average velocity. Still 1/36 of c. At 100x it's a little over 1/3c. Staaaarting to get relativistic here. But I do not believe it is achieving those kinds of velocities. </p>
<p>So no. Doesn't look to be. </p>
<p>For comparison, the sun orbits the Milky Way at ~225km/s. Thats about 1/1300 the speed of light. The star in the elliptical orbit is moving only about four times faster than our own solar system, on average.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dark matter distribution in galaxies is, as best we can tell, a generally triaxial ellipsoid shape. Basically a roundish shape that's more or less stretched in certain directions.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.5616.pdf" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.5616.pdf</a></p>
<p>The density of baryonic (regular) matter falls off pretty significantly as you get farther from the center of a galaxy. Dark matter density changes much less, and extends much further from the center. As a result, the centers of galaxies are gravitationally dominated by baryonic matter, while the outer regions, known as the halo, are primarily under the gravitational influence of dark matter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So last year Lisa Randall and Matthew Reece proposed a possible link between mass extinctions on earth and the sun's periodic passage through a hypothesized &quot;disc&quot; of dark matter in the plane of the milky way's disc on its orbit around the galaxy. This seemed to be exactly counter to observations of stellar motion that gave rise to the discovery of dark matter in the first place --i.e. stellar motion of stars in the galaxy is consistent with the disc of the galaxy being embedded in a roughly spherical halo of dark matter. Is there any evidence that dark matter actually clusters more densely in the galactic plane than in other parts of the halo? Why didn't these two astrophysicists get laughed out of their field for this claim/theory? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I always thought of the black hole as holding our galaxy together. Did the galaxy form in much the same way as our solar system? Then in this analogy the central black hole is just the center where a bunch of mass collected, like our sun, but unlike our sun it isn't the anchor around which we rotate, but is rather just part of the central mass around which we rotate? This is like, a poorly worded question?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The galaxy and the solar system are a bit different.</p>
<p>In the solar system there is a single very big thing (the Sun) with lots of much smaller things (planets, asteroids, etc) going around it.  The solar system is completely dominated by the Sun, so if the Sun vanished the solar system would fall apart.</p>
<p>In the galaxy there is a big black hole and billions and billions of stars, gas clouds and dark matter around it.  The mass of the black hole is not very big compared to the rest of the galaxy, and in fact the galaxy is held together by the combined effect of the billions of stars.  For example, our Sun is held in place not by the black hole but by the billions of other stars in the galaxy.  Since the black hole makes up only a small part of the mass of the galaxy if it were to vanish not much would change.  <em>Why</em> the black hole forms at the centre of the galaxy is still debated, and there are a number of theories why.  Not all galaxies have a central black hole, but all big galaxies seem to have one.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm aware of the differences between the two, but I'd never considered possible similarities until just now.</p>
<p>Is it possible that on a long enough timeline a galaxy (perhaps one smaller than our own) would condense to resemble something more <em>like</em> (but obviously still different from) a hugely oversized solar system with a mammoth black hole sitting alone at the center and much of the other mass having condensed into black holes or supermassive stars as well?</p>
<p>Or is there simply too much rotational velocity? Or will there generally be too many stars and too much stray matter left about by supernovae? Or ...</p>
<p>It's early, so maybe I'm missing something basic. <em>Hmm...</em></p></div>		</li>
