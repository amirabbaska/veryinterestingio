			<div class="markdown"><p>Even having a PFO puts you at minimal risk. You have to 1. Have a PFO (20-25% of us do), 2. Have an air bubble AND 3. Increase your right-sided pressures enough to overcome left-sided pressures, open the PFO, and allow the bubble through. I mean, we TEST for PFO's by injecting micro bubbles, so...
The risk is pretty small. Now, none of that applies if you have any other congenital R/L shunt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It typically doesn't because of all the precautions nurses take to clear lines, but accidents can still happen.</p>
<p>Central lines can come unhooked or be inadvertently removed allowing entry of air into the vein, people get stabbed somewhere that similarly allows air to get into a vein when it shouldn't, accidentally insufflating into a vein rather than into the abdomen for laparoscopic surgery...</p></div>		</li>
