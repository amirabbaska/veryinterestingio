			<div class="markdown"><p>To combat seasickness, I bend and sway intentionally, making exagerated movements with the movement of the boat. That gets rid of it 99% of the time. On the other end of the spectrum, however, I experience motion sickness on a tire swing that I'm actually causing to move. Carsickness falls somewhere in between those, I suppose. I have not been car sick since I learned to drive.</p></div>		</li>

They do make it in non drowsy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I read in the car, the most natural way for me to do it is to have the book / phone near my lap and be looking down at it - this makes me feel car sick eventually. If I hold the book / phone up and toward the window side, so I can see out the window with my peripheral vision, I find I can avoid the car sickness. Took me way too long to figure that one out, and I still only remember when I start to feel clammy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get motion sick a lot. I usually take medicine if I can't take sit in the front. Otherwise, look out the front window when possible, focusing on something in the background.</p>
<p>Also, I tend to feel like I'm getting hot when I get motion sick, so I like havi g the windows down and take off my shoes if I feel too hot.</p>
<p>Finally, chewing gum or sucking on a peppermint helps, something about mint I think. Just what works for me, I've had motion sickness issues for as long as I can remember.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you tried Sea Bands? They're just bracelets you wear that apply pressure to a pressure point on your arms. They've helped me with motion sickness in cars, on boats (45-minute ride across a choppy ocean, no nausea!), and roller coasters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't buy this.</p>
<p>I have terrible motion sickness. It doesn't make a difference where I look at, or if I close my eyes. It's slightly better if I sit in the passenger seat than the back seat, but not by much. The only thing that seems to work is if I'm driving myself. </p>
<p>For me, most public transportation trips lasting &gt;20 minutes makes me want to puke, excluding the subway. A buzzing, bouncing, swaying bus that smells like diesel is pretty much torture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brain has more ways than just visual stimuli to tell you are in motion. So even if you close your eyes there s possibly some conflict between some of the stimuli. It is also possible that an unrelated stimulus can make you sick (like the car smell)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can read in the car if I have the window in my peripherals, so my brain confirms the movement, so maybe you're doing that but just not realizing it. Also, everyone is different. Maybe you're just simply not as succeptible to motion sickness.</p></div>		</li>
