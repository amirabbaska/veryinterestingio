			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question! Two differences, both agricultural: monoculture and scale. What happened was the shift in agriculture from small, highly diverse plots to massive monocultures-- hundreds and hundreds of acres of a single crop. The days of subsistence farming are over, nowadays farmers are producing food for the entire country/world instead of just for their family and town. Take almonds for example. A handful of trees could be pollinated easily by native pollinators, but now almost all almonds produced in the world come from a few massive farms in California which hire out beekeepers to drive hundreds of millions of bees in to pollinate. If all the bees died, these trees would not be pollinated and there would be no more almonds, period. This is what people mean when they say honeybees are crucial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other issue with monoculture is that it doesn't support a wild population of pollinators. Hedges and woodlands which would have provided both habitat for them to live in and a variety of plants which produce pollen and nectar over a long period allowing them to build their stores to overwinter. A single species of plant (like almonds or apples) which all flower at the same time and which are managed to remove dead wood mean there is a glut for a few weeks and then nothing for the rest of the year. It's necessary to move the hives from site to site both to have enough pollinators for the plants to produce fruit and also so the bees don't then starve.</p>
<p>To support our need for efficiency, we have to manage the bee population manually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you would need to include that to some extent while people have realized the value of honey bees, they still have a certain dislike for most other types of bees that are not honey bees and there is a general emphasis on removing them. A lot of other bees get destroyed simply becasue they are not honey bees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also there are other pollinators such as carpenter bees. Also we technically don't need bees we could always pollinate by hand. Kind of a pain but from what I understand while being inefficient it fits yield better results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some places like western China mass hand pollination is actually more cost-effective due to the cheap labor costs. You could stop using strong pesticides and lose more crop, pay to have been keepers come which costs more than hiring workers to hand pollinate, or just hire workers which costs less and produces better results. Of course, if standards of living or labor costs go up the hand pollination will quickly become less cost-effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the world as a whole, grains/cereals are the most important crop and form a major part of food production for a lot of nations. These are wind-pollinated and do not rely on pollinators, and account for 60% of the world's food output. Nearly everything else either relies on or heavily benefits from pollination. Would the human race go extinct if bees suddenly vanished? Probably not. But you'd be looking at ruined livelihoods, food shortages, and far-reaching geopolitical ramifications if ~30% of our food production suddenly vanished or was greatly reduced. This is what made the Colony Collapse Disorder of 2006 so scary: it revealed a potential flaw in our food security.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that this would be feasible with the honeybee. The sting is actually made from the ovipositor (egg-laying organ) which is really not something you want to deactivate. Furthermore, honeybees need their sting to protect their hive from other bees, invading wasps, and mammals which are after the honey. Without the sting, they would have no way of protecting the hive and would likely be wiped out pretty quickly. As mentioned below, there are stingless bees which produce honey but they have evolved very different behaviors to compensate which make them not well-suited to mass production for honey or pollination services.  </p>
<p>Edit: We do in fact breed for &quot;gentleness&quot;, which is a trait assessing the overall aggressiveness of a given hive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm currently researching bumblebee health, specifically the buff-tailed bumblebee. Something everyone seems to forget is yes, honeybees are very important pollinators, but they are not the only ones!</p>
<p>Bumblebees are also exceptionally important: Their fuzzy fur lets them forage on cold days, AKA earlier in the spring and later into the winter. They also use &quot;buzz-pollination&quot; to pollinate certain crops, such as tomatoes, which honeybees cannot do. Some crops, such as strawberries, require repeated pollination which bumblebees are better at too.</p>
<p>Wild bees, such as bumblebees and solitary bees are in danger. (You can see the variety of bees in the UK <a href="http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/reserves-wildlife/guide-solitary-bees-britain" target="_blank">here</a>.) The rest of this thread highlights the stresses bees are facing, including pesticides and monocultures.</p>
<p>Breeding and releasing bees will not fix the underlying issue: lack of food. Crops (take strawberries for example) fill huge fields <em>but for a short period of time</em>. Once the crops are harvested, the rest of the year in that area there is very little for the bees to eat, so they starve or succumb to disease due to stress.</p>
<p>Planting a larger variety of flowers can help to increase bee populations naturally. Note: Some bees are exceptionally picky, and by planting lots of dandelions for example, you can negatively impact their populations. Therefore a carefully selected variety is important.</p>
<p>There is also evidence to suggest plants contain secondary compounds that can help bees clear infections, especially those that have the worst impact when the bees are stressed (like now), eg Crithida bombi. Replacing these &quot;pharmacies&quot; with crops is likely also negatively impacting populations. Further research into which plants are important to bees can help save their populations.</p>
<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12761/epdf" target="_blank">This paper</a> and it's references provide some further reading on secondary compounds and bee health. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aha! That's info I was looking for. I replied to the comment you hijacked. I've never seen a bumblebee &quot;apiary&quot; in any orchard my lab group works in. I feel like agriculture, in general, because of how industrialized it's become, keeps forgetting that we're effectively trying to optimize living things. That's a bear of an undertaking. I don't know if anyone has stopped to think &quot;maybe this bee just doesn't like this crop, we should try another one, or one that evolved with similar plants.&quot; That's an easy solution, nature already did the hard work, you don't have to tweak and calibrate an expensive quad bike crop duster thing.</p></div>		</li>
