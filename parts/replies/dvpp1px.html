			<div class="markdown"><p>Aromaticity (as a chemical property as described in that article) is actually not associated with the process of olfactory perception (sense of smell). Although many aromatic molecules have strong smells, not all smells are caused by aromatic molecules. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot that goes into smell, but sticking to the nature of the sub I was providing a more insightful article incase anyone was curious :)  </p>
<p>Edit: For those that want to argue that Im missing OP's question you can read <a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/smell-disorders" target="_blank">how the nose works</a> and an overview of odor on the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odor" target="_blank">odor wiki</a> for more information. Multiple aspects go into oder (far beyond the information I have provided.) if you want to get technical. Enjoy your daily taste of science (it's healthy for you!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't worry, it gets better. The best thing to do is imagine that those rings are like a 6 way outlet. Everytime you plug in something new, you add a new device that changes it in some way (say your cellphone is plugged in, it draws a small amount of current (ie makes the molecule more polar) and it changes the original properties) and the structure changes slightly. Everything is based on (I thought) pretty simple equations, you just have to find ways to understand them. I'm not saying it's easy, and I love chemistry, I literally was doing extra homework for fun because it was like the chemical version of a sodoku puzzle, but that's what it is, a puzzle I know you can solve. Also it's been a few years since I've worked with them, hit me up in a couple weeks after I start working on it again and I'll have much better analogies</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about your fridge, but in mine there's also the smell of rotten something (milk?) that gets into anything left for more than 10 minutes in it because a jug of milk exploded from forgetting to empty it about a year ago and I figured I'd just let it sit and desiccate to make it less nasty to clean up - well, live and learn - because now even with it clean there's a certain odor - it even gets through cans of coke and makes them flat+stale tasting if left in there overnight.  Might actually have some starving veal spirit haunting it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to unplug, empty, clean out the fridge, leave it open 24 hours, clean again, let dry again and then go back to using it. Obviously something you will need to plan for :P But you'll be glad you did =)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you cleaned the evaporator on your fridge? That can be a cause of the lingering smell. But... the smell of your refrigerator is not permeating aluminum cans or affecting the carbonation of the soda. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Newsflash: Its not clean. Theres still milk somewhere. Take out all the shelves and clean under the supports and rims. Turn it off and drain it. Clean out the evaporator tray. All places milk would likely still be after a surface clean</p></div>		</li>
