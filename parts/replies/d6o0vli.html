			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of how I listen to audiobooks. If I'm just sitting at home, or going for a walk/bike ride my mind wanders off too easily and I stop paying attention to the audiobook, but if I'm doing some task like dishes, or assembling something I hear every word.<br />
