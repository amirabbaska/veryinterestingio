			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any experiments on plants grown in utter darkness? I would love to see resulting photos of the plants.</p>
<p>Also, what if a plant was grown in a whitebox type setting? Completely evenly lit from bottom to top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been tons of experiments in this regard, but plants don't live very long without the ability to photosynthesize. </p>
<p>Here's a picture of a s<a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9819ff2a8c732ad7a93c3ab7fe7ce9d7-c" target="_blank">imilar experiment</a>. The plant was placed sideways in a box with only a small hole on one side where light could come through. You can see the plant &quot;chased&quot; the light even around obstacles.</p>
<p>A fully lit plant would (depending on species) just grow equally in all directions. It would end up short and bushy. </p>
<p>You can also <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/27/79/a6/2779a629ba5729f952bed3d0c59885ec.jpg" target="_blank">spin plants</a> around in a wheel to simulate gravity. If you removed the center lighting fixture and shined lights on the outside the plants would grow <em>around</em> the wheel to better reach the light. You'd end up with the roots and the stems growing in the same direction and the wheel would look like a spinning wreathe with stems flapping around like whips.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We've learned (relatively recently) that plants share nutrients beneath the soil between their roots, using fungal pathways and chemical communication. Essentially, if you shade one plant, but it has a root system shared with other uncovered plants, you get &quot;a plant without sunlight&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember being kind of cruelly sick by repeated reversing the seedling whenever it started the grow the right way. </p>
<p>When the leafy parts started to grow up and the roots reaching down, I would prop it upside down so the shoot points down and the roots points up. </p>
<p>But it still knows which is up, and it tries to reverse it again; except it can't un-grow what it had grown. </p>
<p>Repeated flipping made a wriggly starting stem and roots. </p>
<p>I had wondered what made them do this, but as the years go by, I think I just accepted it as it is. :c</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did this for a science fair project in grade school (many years ago) and I used a shoe box with a maze in it for the plant to follow the sun on the other side. The little shit outsmarted me and went above the maze walls since I didn't make them tall enough lol. I also did the spinning plant thing as well. Most interesting project I have be ever done. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plants will still grow outwards in total darkness as an attempt to find light; the result is called etiolation. However, they will be very weak and lack color due to absence of chloroplast which store glucose (energy) after photosynthesis has occurred. As for light coming in at all angles, only specific tissues in the plant absorb light and conduct photosynthesis which are known as parenchyma. Parenchyma is the soft and supple tissue within a plant that will almost always contain chloroplasts as it is a photosynthetic tissue. In laymen terms, only certain parts of a plant absorb sunlight therefore it would not make a difference to have sunlight hitting from all angles. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what about gravitropism?  :D  IME plants will face towards the light but continue to grow upwards away from gravity. I've seen this personally with side lighting and the plants continue to grow straight upwards and only 'face' the light source.</p>
<p>*edit:  I'm sure different plants have different response mechanisms. </p></div>		</li>
