			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. Op has it turned around. The drying action makes the clothes somewhat fluffier. Because it's blowing the air between the fibers but that can only happen if you don't stuff it too full. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just so wrong.  The washing machine does that to force out as much water as possible during the final spin cycle.  But a dryer is specifically designed to avoid forcing the clothes to the outside.  The have just enough speed (combined with the raised sections of the drum) to lift the clothes to the top of the circle, then gravity overcomes the speed and the clothes drop.  If your dryer is spinning the clothes around in a full circle, you should get it repaired.</p></div>		</li>
