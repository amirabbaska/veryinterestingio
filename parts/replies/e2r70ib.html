<p>I may have a sensitive skin/thick hair combo (hence why I swapped to DE), but more than 4-5 sounds like utter madness. I dont even do more than 3! Like you said, 12USD gets you 100 feather blades. </p>

<p>Id probably suggest avoiding this for anyone who wants to give DE a try. Its a fairly expensive intro cost, inconvenient, and at best, not much better. Just no need to drop the extra 50 when youre testing something new. Id suggest a decent cream (not some overly foamy nonsense) like creamo, and for the love of god, alum. If you choose to stick to using a DE, you can go balls deep with all the extras.</p>
