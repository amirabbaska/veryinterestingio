			<div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine is a weak base, correct? So if the citric acid makes the tea more acidic the caffeine is better soluble? The caffeine gets faster in the tea and has less time to interact with the tannins, will also interact with less tannins inside the tea because there are not as many  = More free caffeine?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, the imine is weakly basic. Protonation would make it more soluble. </p>
<p>The oxygens may also be basic due to resonance with the N atoms. Not sure how this would affect solubility but it is most likely minor compared to the imine. </p>

<p>I don't know how and if caffeine and tannins interact. Do you have a source where you got this from?</p></div>		</li>
