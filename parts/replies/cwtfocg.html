			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the species, but in general not much. They're 98% water and the parts that aren't are very fragile indeed. If they get caught in a rough tide and smashed up against the rocks they're done for, in some cases rough surf alone can rip them apart. Most of the jellies you see in aquariums are grown from larva or polyps because catching and transporting them as adults without damaging them is very difficult.</p>
<p>Their real success is that they reproduce quickly, have few natural predators &amp; do not need <del>oxygen</del> <em>much oxygen</em>, so in good conditions they can form huge &quot;blooms&quot; of thousands or millions of individuals in just a couple of weeks. When your species can do this it doesn't really matter if you fall apart at the drop of a hat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We have a lot of moon jellies where I live and if you pick them out of the water they kind of melt in your hand. Such an amazing, ethereal organism. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bought a moon jellyfish with a tank and I had to fill it with a mixture of distilled water and aquarium salt. Then I had to take the jellyfish in it's bag, place it slowly in the tank, and spend an hour pouring some of the new water into the bag it came in. I guess I must have done it too quickly because the jellyfish did not even survive for a few minutes. I think it died of shock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think aquarium salt is enough for marine fish/creatures, isn't there specific marine salt? Even if that's what you meant, yeah, sometimes pH and mineral differences in the new vs old water are too much for such a delicate thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on what you mean by &quot;complex&quot;, plants and fungi can get pretty complex. Because muscles require impulses from nerves to contract, most complex animals require nervous systems so that they are capable of muscle contractions used in voluntary movement as well as in things like digestion and breathing.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hate to be that guy, but when you test reflexes the brain absolutely plays a role. Although you're right in that the reflex circuit synapses in the spinal cord and immediately activated motor neurons which produces the reflex response... There are a load of inhibitory neurons that play a role in reflexes. Thus, when upper motor neurons are injured (in the brain), patients can become quite hyperreflexic</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, the brain actually tries to stop your reflex but it's too late so it can only dampen the reaction. When your brain can't intervene, such as with ms, your reflexes are brisk and if not careful, the doctor gets kicked in the nuts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jellyfish don't have brain, but they do have a neural system that make the reflex response possible for them. Their reflex system is just not like ours. When their neurones perceive a stimuli, they just generate a mouvement in response to that stimuli, but they don't really control this response, contrary to us.</p></div>		</li>
