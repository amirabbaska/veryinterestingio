			<p>From the longform abstract(?) of the paper <a href="http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2015/EPSC2015-838-1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, the four areas they sampled were fairly spread apart and varied in their morphology, with two located on central peaks inside craters, one on a crater wall and one on a canyon wall. This led the authors to believe that there is no reason to assume one specific process for their formation (it's hard for an aquifer to  supply water to the top of a peak in a crater)<br><br>So some of the observed RSL could be sourced from an aquifer, but it doesn't seem to be the rule.</p>		</li>

			<p>Okay, cool. That makes sense.<br><br>So if some of it is, would the rest of the perchlorates/better pH line of questioning play out?</p>		</li>
