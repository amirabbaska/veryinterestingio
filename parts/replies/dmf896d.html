			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also add that confirmation bias may be at play here. For all the times I've woken up minutes before my alarm, there are hundreds of other times where I slept through my alarm, woke up hours earlier, or didn't have an alarm and woke up at a random time, but these don't seem as significant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. I'd say it's common enough that it makes it worth noting that our brain is capable of some pretty cool stuff, but not so common as to think our brain is a super powered atomic clock. Sometimes it messes up, sends signals too late/early, responds to some other stimuli that interrupts certain mechanisms, or just altogether seems to not do anything at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this response is more of a restatement of the premise than any explanation as to how the brain is able to maintain the perceived accuracy. Not sure how it got over a thousand upvotes </p>
<p>I like the next response down which says that you basically are teetering on and off the edge of conscious well before the alarm goes off, but you only remember the last few seconds you were semi conscious went it finally does go off and thus conclude your brain was waking you up right before the alarm went off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That answer doesn't explain why people wake up, then look at the time and see the alarm <em>is about to go off</em> and promptly turn it off and get up. It hinges on the idea that you are semi-awake when it goes off and thus remember that you woke up before that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, but you added more complexity and facts to the question premise which was only about how the op thinks &quot;we can wake up seconds before an alarm goes off.&quot;  The op didn't say he sits up and looks at the clock for the first time each day.  If that were the case, than yes this explanation couldn't be a complete answer.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could never understand how people function like this. I cant sleep after the initial wake up knowing there is another loud alarm behind it. I've had room mates that let their alarms go off every 10 minutes for an hour. What is the fucking point of that? Just get up instead of teasing yourself and annoying everyone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to be like that, but recently I started having nightmares in that ten minute span. I now bolt out of bed as soon as my alarm goes off, terrified that if I fall asleep, even briefly, I will suffer some horrible dream where my grandma kills my other grandma or something ridiculous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've gotten so good at it that I don't even really notice I do it. I'll just turn off the alarm or hit snooze. Eventually I added a math problem to my alarm, but I still did those. It took more effort, but it was where I was conscious, but I wasn't all there</p></div>		</li>
