			<div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, agreed. I wouldn't necessarily say things like shivering are purely subconscious, though. I practiced throughout my highscool and university years, and I can forcefully stop myself from shivering in the cold. I'm still working on fooling my body about ambient temperature to stop myself from sweating in some situations. I think this is somewhat similar to what some monks can do, though not exactly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you can override your autonomic nervous system with regards to shivering to some extent because you have conscious innervation of those skeletal muscles as well, but that could only happen for so long, eventually the drop in temperature will be so severe that the signals from your ANS would be so strong you couldn't override them. I don't think it's possible to stop yourself from sweating as the nerves which control sweating physically don't connect to the parts of your brain under conscious control.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doesn't shivering help raise the body temp? So your brain says, &quot;hey, we need to warm up this body so we're going to make it think it's cold so it starts shivering.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, shivering is a muscle response to cold, caused by the autonomic nervous system which causes random muscle contractions to generate heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am curious now though that this is brought up. Does the body sense a temperature gradient or the temperature that's actually there? Like if I'm a 101F and someone else is 98.6F will I feel colder than another the other person when exposed to the same room temperature.</p></div>		</li>
