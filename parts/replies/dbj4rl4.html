			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Your brain thinks you're about to die so it sends out emergency information to critical functions. Your muscles twitch and you spread your arms and legs out in an attempt to catch yourself. This is instinct. Interestingly, you can train yourself to overcome that reaction. Like when gymnasts are told to tuck their arms in when falling rather than reach out with their hands, so they don't break their wrists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question to this, why does that electric feeling hurt (at least with me it does) even if I drop something? My oh shit reaction comes with that full body electric pain as whatever it is falls to the floor. It sucks since I get that feeling so many times a day over the littlest things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's also affected by the fact that your brain normally runs a bit behind what's actually going on (thus reaction time).  In addition to the sudden firing of neurons, your brain is also pausing or shutting down other mental processes to free up active memory.  By the time you recognize the thought, &quot;Shit...,&quot; your body is already in that freefall state.  Your brain has already detected the sense of momentum and likely outcome, and is trying to figure out ways to mitigate the danger.  The whole scenario that you remember is mostly hindsight, as you organize the what, when, and how of the situation.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions, though.  Some people have trained themselves to wait until they recognize the thought &quot;Shit!&quot; before they physically allow themselves to respond.  If you haven't done this, though, your body should begin acting before you realize it.</p>
<p>Then again, I'm not a neuroscientist, and can only speak from my own experiences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually due to something called the &quot;return trip effect.&quot; Basically, you tend to expect a trip to take a shorter amount of time than it does, so you unconsciously lengthen your expectation of how long the return will take. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm, wrong, but I'm under the impression that these responses are very quick. Like within 10 seconds. I would assume adrenaline takes about that much time / longer to take effect? And those effects would be lasting, rather than the instantaneous reactions OP is referring to?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: I forgot this was ELI5 sorry, I'll try to phrase it:</p>
<p>basic autonomic nervous system [a part of our nervous system that takes care of regulating involuntarily our body functions especially while resting (parasympathetic) or while flight-fight responses (sympathetic)] structure consists in one cluster of neurons (placed in the spinal cord, called preganglionic neurons), connected to a second cluster of neurons (called postganglionic neurons) through nerves (called preganglionic fibers); this second cluster of neurons connects to the organ/tissue (heart, muscles) through post-ganglionic fibers. The nervous system communicates through 'neurotransmisors', which in case of sympathetic postganglionic fibers are <strong>norepinephrine/epinephrine</strong></p>
<p>now, if norepinephrine is a neurotransmisor, why is it also called a hormone? a hormone by definition needs to be released to bloodstream, and I'm telling you they are going from neurons/fibers directly to tissues/organs</p>
<p>to understand why, I need to introduce you a very interesting gland called adrenal gland</p>
<p>embryologically speaking, their origin comes from two totally different places: the cortex (adrenal cortex, which produces other kind of hormones) comes from &quot;intermediate mesoderm&quot; and the medulla, the part we are interested in, comes from &quot;<strong>neural crest ectoderm</strong>&quot;; ectoderm is the embryological sheet that develops the nervous system; now, here comes the interesting part: <strong>adrenal medulla</strong> is indeed part of the <strong>NERVOUS SYSTEM</strong> and adrenal medulla functional cells (the ones who secrete epinephrine/norepinephrine, called chromaffin cells) are <strong>NEURONS</strong></p>
<p>since adrenal gland, as I told you, are made of a cortex and a medulla, some &quot;paracrine&quot; (contiguous) effects of adrenal cortex hormones (glucocorticoids) don't allow these neurons (chromaffin cells) to fully develop, especially one really important part of them called axons, the ones who send the nervous impulses to the rest of tissues/organs); this has been proven, if you place a &quot;farm&quot; with adrenal medulla cells without the cortex, they develop those axons, thus they are literally neurons</p>
<p>now, if I'm telling you that these weird neurons called chromaffin cells DO NOT have those prolongations called axons and hence they can't communicate with the effectors (like the heart, so it can beat faster), where do they release their norepinephrine/epinephrine? the answer is: in the blood</p>
<p>therefore, norepinephrine/epinephrine are called hormons, because in this particular place in the body, called adrenal glands, they are a weird exception: they don't release these neurotransmisors through postganglionic fibers to the effector but through the blood; adrenal medulla is considered as a postganglionic neuron (they are just kind of special for the reasons I told you before)</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: norepinephrine/epinephrine are mainly/originally neurotransmisors, but they can also be called hormones because one weird bunch of neurons called adrenal medulla release these neurotransmisors to the blood, and that can be called 'hormone', but don't mistake them: they are neurotransmisors and their action is really fast because they are part of the nervous system... they are not slow except that little fraction that is released to the blood (and, obviously, blood is slower than nervous messages)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some can respond in less than a second, which was news to me. Different adrenergic receptor types and subtypes are differentially found in specific tissue types throughout the body, leading to the variety of effects.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question here, if someone is on Beta blockers for, say, high blood pressure, do they have a noticeably different response during sudden stress incidents? i.e. A chair tipping, almost falling, etc.</p></div>		</li>

		<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ltmslfg" target="_blank">ltmslfg</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>it depends on what kind of beta blocker he's on</p>
<p>beta receptores are:</p>
<p>b1 = in your heart (when stimulated it makes beat faster, stronger and other effects) and in your kidneys</p>
<p>b2 = in your lungs (it relaxes your smooth muscle tissue there so air-flow can get in easier: it's bronchodilator) and some splanchnic territory vessels (since you don't need blood in your gastrointestinal tract during fight-flight responses)</p>
<p>b3 = they are in adipose tissue (in order to destroy fat and send energy to your bloodstream so muscles can use it)</p>
<p>if the drug doesn't include b1 blockers, he won't have a noticeable different response during those incidents; if he does, he will even have trouble when getting out of bed fast (ortostatic hypotension) and could faint (lipotymia)</p>
<p>edit: sorry, I misread... adrenergic response doesn't have much to do with those incidents you mentioned; those are controled by equilibrium system (vestibular system, cerebellum, basal ganglia and motor cortex; dopamine is important here but not adrenergic response)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While adrenaline physically prepares you for action there are a host of other excitatory neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline, dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine etc. waiting at the tip of neurons to be released almost instantaneusly in response to a fearful stimulus. So an 'adrenaline rush' is really a blanket term for the highly integrated response between hormones and neurotransmitters to deal with a threat at a physical and psychological level. </p></div>		</li>
