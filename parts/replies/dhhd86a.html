			<div class="markdown"><p>These batteries <em>can</em> be replaced if you want to rescue an old cartridge from the trash! Unfortunately you'll lose whatever save you had before the battery died. </p>
<p>There are a lot of tutorials online about how to safely open old GB/GBA cartridges, and most watch-repair stores can get you a replacement as long as you bring the original battery in so they know what size it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, had to do this with my Ruby cart. You need to get the special screwdriver though. I did not have it so I had to file down some of the plastic around the screw and use needle nose pliers to remove it. Huge pain, but got it done.</p>
<p>I want to say the battery in it was a 1616 for reference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, if you have an original GBA you can replace cartridge batteries easily without loosing the save data. Take the cart apart and insert the board into the GBA using some cardboard to wedge it into place. Turn on the GBA and swap the battery while the power is on and then put everything back together, job done.</p>
<p>Googling will get you some more in-depth guides on how it's done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's weird. I remember that in primary school my buddy had to replace the battery when he bought a used copy of Pokémon Blue. That was like 2002 so the game could've only been like 8 years old max. Around that time I got my copy of Pokémon Yellow and it's still rocking today. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the cartridge and the specs of the battery, but usually a very long time. CMOS batteries in PCs are shorter lived around 5 years. The one in the NES is something stupid like 50 years. The one in the Gameboy is something like 15 years. So a long ass time.</p></div>		</li>
