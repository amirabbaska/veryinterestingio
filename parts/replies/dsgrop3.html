If you want a LOT of information on this topic, you should check out Danna Staaf’s book that was published in October of 2017 called Squid Empire, which I reviewed here: <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/358/6359/53.full.pdf" target="_blank">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/358/6359/53.full.pdf</a>
The book is super entertaining and will answer this question much better than I will be able to here. But short answer is that extinct Nautiloids are more closely related to the living nautilus than squid. There are plenty of extinct cephalopods with shells that basically are squids with shells, but nautiloids are not those. Nautilus are very different from the other cephalopods, so if you’re familiar with a living nautilus you’ll know the kinds of differences I’m talking about (speed, behavior, body plan, eye, the list goes on). Belemnites were closer to “squid with shells”, and I think modern coleoid cephalopods evolved from belemnites (either that or belemnites and modern coleoids shared a common ancestor). Some ammonoids might also have been more squiddy under the hood, but honestly I’m not sure what they had going on internally.</p></div>		</li>
