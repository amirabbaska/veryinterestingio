			<div class="markdown"><p>You still see it happening too. There are international agreements on what constitutes 'child porn' and I think only Germany has a different age limit.</p>
<p>Also patent law. America pretty much forced India over a barrel to let life-saving medicines be protected by patents. Formerly India had a patent exclusion for life-saving medicines.</p>
<p>-edit- Also nuclear and chemical weapon taboos.</p>
<p>-edit- Also copyright/file sharing laws, as mentioned Megaupload founder ran an internet site and never set foot on American soil but is still being extradited to be prosecuted by America for violating American laws.</p>
<p>And geeze, you people. I provide an example of America forcing other countries to adopt our child porn laws and I get called a pedo. Twice. It was a friggin example. That's why you can't have reasonable discussions with Americans about anything to do with sex in any way...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The above poster really only provided an answer for Mexico and he was using an unsourced Huffington Post blog that appears to be promoting a book. That's sketchy at best. I know it's fun to blame everything on America, but come on. <strong>I'm sure America banning it could have helped get the ball rolling</strong> but other countries have to take responsibility for their own legislation instead of blaming it on some boogeyman. If the USA could control every country's every law with &quot;intimidation&quot; and &quot;pressure&quot; then we would be running the world a lot differently.</p>
<p>I am curious about the international bans. <strong>I suspect the USA encouraged those bans through various means. But I tend to think it took a lot more than just that to get it banned pretty much everywhere. I'm not denying potential USA pressure to ban it</strong> ...but there is basically no provided evidence to support it in the parent comment besides the super ambiguous first paragraph that's totally unsourced and then a brief mention of the USA cutting painkiller supplies to Mexico that is <em>practically</em> unsourced (Huffington Post <em>blog</em> with no reviewable source other than a book it appears to be essentially advertising that I'm not about to buy to verify). That evidence hardly substantiates the USA magically forcing every government to capitulate.</p>
<p>This simple explanation doesn't pass the smell test. Why did the USA care about what every other country did (especially countries far away with few trade ties)? Why did almost every other government so easily capitulate instead of acting in the interests of their citizens? To be clear, I think the USA pressured some countries (and even more countries just looked at the health scare and decided to take action on their own with little or no pressure) and that accounts for some of the international bans but the question hasn't really been answered. I could see medical or tobacco countries having a vested interest in banning it globally but I am hoping someone with real knowledge on the historical events can chime in with details.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Working for an NGO with focus on substance abuse. I agree the top comment oversimplified what happenned. </p>
<p>Most countries signed an agreement on banned substances aimed at cocaine years before all this happened. This is the agreement also could be interpreted to include psychoactive substances like marjuana.</p>
<p>When it all came down in the states, it was easy to use this agreement to enforce bans. </p>
<p>So it is more complicated than a single issue but the US were definitely the driving force behind the global ban.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During the formation of the UN the USA drafted the narcotic schedules (marijuana is a schedule 1 drug) and put them into the UN charter. To become a member state of the UN a country had to adopt laws in the charter, including the drug schedules.</p>
<p>That's really how the U.S. drug war spread to the world. </p>
<p>Edit, because the thread is locked:</p>
<p>Yes, I was mistaken, I said the UN, I meant the precursor to the UN; the League of Nations. </p></div>		</li>

<p>US paid MONEY as a bribe. The US paid Nepal King millions and the King pocketed it for himself. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Mjn6sCiHoFIC&amp;pg=PA325#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Nepal was gaining $100,000 per annum on Tax revenues</a>. Being a 3rd world country, there was no reason for them to ban it other than US giving the King millions. Weed is holy in Nepal!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In response to &quot;Alcohol — controlled by criminals — had become even more poisonous.&quot;</p>
<p>I thought it should be noted that the United States government was intentionally poisoning the alcohol supply chain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frustrated that people continued to consume so much alcohol even after it was banned, federal officials had decided to try a different kind of enforcement. They ordered the poisoning of industrial alcohols manufactured in the United States, products regularly stolen by bootleggers and resold as drinkable spirits. The idea was to scare people into giving up illicit drinking. Instead, by the time Prohibition ended in 1933, the federal poisoning program, by some estimates, had killed at least 10,000 people.</p>

<p>Last year I watched a politician's town hall and this lady asked a question about marijuana legalization and basically said, if you legalize marijuana, that means eventually everything will be illegal my son died from overdosing on hardcore drugs and I don't want that to happen.</p>
<p>He emphasized that he only wanted to legalize marijuana and maybe have a discussion about how local areas might be interested, on a case by case basis, of having addiction clinics to cut down on deaths, etc.</p>
<p>Anyway, he made the &quot;mistake&quot; of saying marijuana doesn't kill anyone, and she didn't want to hear that, so she kept saying there's all these stories and even the moderator said, yeah, I have one in my notes as an example, you're wrong and it's totally true.</p>
<p>I couldn't understand what <em>about</em> marijuana could do that so I looked up the case. Car crash. Definitely had marijuana in his system. Also? Several times the legal limit of alcohol in his blood.</p>
<p>Now, maybe it didn't help things, but I wouldn't know how the line gets drawn between each substance's contribution; I just think it's weird that the weed smokers who aren't also drunk off their butts seem to be much safer by comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lady using that car accident as a scapegoat against marijuana isn't interested in truth or logic. She wants to confirm her bias.</p>
<p>Part of the issue I often hear with politics among people, is that they use emotional arguments like that to fuel their narrative. That's why I believe the divide between America's parties is getting larger. If they had to use logic to explain everything, instead of emotional arguments, the political landscape would change dramatically. </p>
<p>As an example, how could anyone logically back up &quot;build a wall&quot;?</p>
<p>I'm genuinely curious, considering most immigration is done via plane, and most illegal immigration is from expired visas, rather than entering illegally.</p>
<p>An example from the left, how could anyone logically explain completely free healthcare; and, more importantly, the transition from our current system to a single buyer?</p>
<p>It still feels like an emotional argument, even if the outcome would probably net positive results overall. With our current system, insurance companies make money, and will line the pockets of politicians to prevent that from changing.</p>
<p>Sorry for diverging off the original topic, but to bring it back, a lot of major decisions in politics are made using emotions as the backbone of the argument. This causes a lot of issues with both the initial concept of the law, and with it's execution, as explained with the respective examples.</p></div>		</li>
