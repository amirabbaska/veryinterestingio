			<div class="markdown"><p>To be more specific, Tupperware and most others are dishwasher and microwave save. What they can't handle is heating very fatty things in the microwave. If you put something like fatty soup or a meat dish with fat pockets in the microwave, the fat tends to get very hot very quickly, damaging the plastic. If you then put it in the dishwasher the fat that melted into tiny pockets in the plastic is washed out, causing it to turn opaque off-white. So just be cautious about fatty things in the microwave and you can continue using the dishwasher for your Tupperware, as long as you don't set it to the industrial strength cookware programme at 90°C </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you're right here, and the dishwasher is a complete red herring having nothing to do with it at all. It's fats and other things that get hotter than boiling. If you never microwave a container, or take care what gets microwaved in it, you will never get these white spots. I don't know if water itself in the microwave has the capability to do this or not though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they are microwave safe (there should be little logos at the bottom to indicate such) boiling water should be fine. But fat in a microwave can easily get to several times the temperature of boiling water if it is not finely dispersed and can form little pockets of water-free fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it can't handle fats in the microwave, it isn't microwave safe. Fat is food. Tupperware that's microwave safe needs to be able to handle being microwaved with food in it. If it's not able to do that, it isn't microwave safe. </p></div>		</li>

<p>To prevent, hand wash and don’t use in the microwave.</p>

<p>So, basically don't use it for the only thing you were using it for</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possible that the detergent is eating at the plastic making it more susceptible to the melting, but the hot water is the main culprit. </p></div>		</li>
