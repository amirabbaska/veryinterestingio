			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's about right I'd say.  I mean, even defining what the &quot;final form&quot; is can be difficult.  Something like weight or height is going to be highly dependent on both age and environment.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Think of DNA as more like a recipe than a blueprint.</p>
<p>And like all recipes, the final actual outcome is dependent on many variables in the environment.</p>
<p>You could use the same old cake recipe a hundred times and not get the exact same cake twice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Embryology demonstrates a ton of this &quot;procedural unrolling&quot;. Simply having a deficiency for a ciliary motor protein (think flapping strings on cells) can cause the heart to form as a mirrored structure compared to normal. I think you would be interested in Hox genes as well since they play a big role in regulating gene expression during development. Lastly, another form of compression would be DNA splicing whereby two different proteins/enzymes can use the same DNA to create similar proteins. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically if you want to see an example of genes splicing themselves in order to make new proteins/cells, this is how some immune system cells are made. It's actually incredibly interesting. It allows us to have extreme diversity in our immune system cells' ability to fight off foreign invaders without taking up a huge amount of space in our genome. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the DNA be more analogous to the install.exe for a program, though? Plenty of programs can generate content whose informational size far exceeds the size of the installer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that expansion that happens in an installer program is usually just &quot;.zip&quot;-like. Very rarely generated procedurally at installation time. Procedural generation of content usually happens at run time.</p></div>		</li>
