<p>Tl;TS (too long, too stoned)</p>
<p>Some people smoke less weed and don't get weird. Some people smoke weed with more relaxing properties so they just relax. Some people smoke lots of weed so they get weird. Some people smoke weed that makes you more aware of things so they get weird.</p>
<p>Doing any drug when you're not in the right frame of mind is bad. </p></div>		</li>
