			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading somewhere the average sleep cycle is 1.5 hours, so working in a length of time that is a multiple of that is a good way to wake up refreshed. I imagine that varies wildly tho if true.<br />
Not a sleep doctor, nor can I remember the source, so assume I am wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine is definitely very close to 1.5 hours. When I go to sleep I set my alarm so that I sleep for some number of 1.5 hour intervals + 30 minutes. If that means I wake up 45 minutes before I really need to then that's what I'll do. I'll be more alert when I wake up having slept for 4.5 hours or 6 hours then if I slept for 5 hours or 6.5 hours. The added 30 minutes is to actually fall asleep and to add some tolerance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct, however everyone's sleep cycle time varies, and it is hard to time out 1.5 hours perfectly. That is why I put 2+ hours in my original response</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe they sort of come in twos so 3, 6 or 9 hours is best, but 4.5 is ok if you have to and I suppose most people do 7.5</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't biphasic sleeping common before the industrial revolution? And hasn't there been studies suggesting that without artificial light that humans tend to fall into biphasic sleeping patterns?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been studies suggesting this.  However, there have also been recent studies of primitive tribes in Africa, South America, etc. that never went through an industrial revolution, have little contact with modern society, and have no sources of artificial light.</p>
<p>They do not sleep in biphasic sleep patterns.  Left to their own devices, they sleep in roughly the same patterns as modern humans, from after sundown to sunrise, and in single bursts.  There is no indication that their circadian clocks, melatonin release, etc. is any different from us.</p>
<p>The evidence that humans slept in two phases prior to the industrial revolution is similarly sketchy.  While there are medieval mentions of &quot;first&quot; and &quot;second&quot; sleep, they are vastly outnumbered by references assuming single sleep patterns similar to what we have today.</p>
<p>The only difference artificial light seems to have made is pushing our initial sleep time slightly later.  Most of us no longer need to be up at sunrise to maximize our productive time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could it be in reference to maybe nighttime sleeping and a sort of &quot;siesta&quot; during the day? I vaguely recall hearing something about that being a thing in Greece or somewhere in that general geographic region.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The amount of nighttime per day varies widely with season and location but averages out at 12hrs. I'm assuming the remaining tribes don't sleep for the entirety of this period? I'd be curious to know what the duration of sleep is for primitive tribes, and whether this varies geographically/seasonally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Human beings differ so widely on sleep that I have trouble believing that there is one sleep cycle that all people should follow.</p>
<p>As an example I personally I have no trouble sleeping straight through in one shot. I have no trouble waking up. I have no trouble doing nights or days. I can stay up for many hours at a time without being fatigued.</p>
<p>There is no way I fit into any sleep cycle that would fit most people.</p>
<p>Every time I hear a sleep study (and the effect on behaviour) it seems like people are roughly divided up into 3 sleep cycles. </p>
<p>Early to bed and early to rise.
Night owls and late sleepers.
And biphasic.</p>
<p>Which honestly makes a lot of sense. This way you always have 1/3rd of the community awake and ready for danger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.livescience.com/12891-natural-sleep.html" target="_blank">Yes, there have been a number of studies that show that naturally we are biphasic sleepers</a>. I've always wanted to start playing with my sleep schedule and see what works best for me but it's hard as our society is built for a single sleep cycle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was biphasic throughout high school. The phases were kinda dumb though.</p>
<p>School was around 7-2. I slept from ~3-7PM, and 12-4AM on weekdays.</p>
<p>I usually spent 7PM-Midnight doing whatever - mostly playing video games. Then 4AM-7AM doing homework before school started. I really liked this schedule for two reason: 1, I got all my homework done way better than when I had the entire afternoon and evening to do it, and 2, it feels amazing to go to real sleep right after school.</p>
<p>However, my senior year I had a girlfriend, and sleeping the night away after school wasn't working for us, so I slowly converted back to &quot;normal.&quot; And in University I slept at completely random times - whenever I had a free hour, which was completely arbitrary every day. And now that I have a 9-5 and other responsibilities, I'm back to a standard schedule.</p>
<p>But I definitely miss sleeping twice a day. I basically always felt awake and alert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did polyphasic for a month one time, and it's honestly a little more trouble than its worth. You have to time your naps within like 10 minutes every day. Granted, biphasic would be much easier, but like you said with the way modern schedules are it would've been nearly impossible. I did 3 20 minute naps and 3-4 hours at night. I felt normal whenever I got it perfect, but it was a struggle to need to nap no matter what, and I've pretty much permanently lost my ability to nap. Crazy dreams though, I would have like 2 lucid dreams a day, and even when I didn't they were always vivid and insane. Shit gets insane when you are in your REMs the second you close your eyes, but it takes time to teach your body to do that, and life got in the way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this imply I can go to sleep at 3am, wake up at 7 go to work and the nap from 5-9 and equal an full 8 hours? Because from what you say this would give me a solid four hours each sleep period to reach REM cycle. And this is pretty much how I live^i^dont^^want^^to^^^die^^^^young</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you go to sleep at 3am, you should wake up at 6am, so rather go to sleep at 4am, then nap from 5-9. This will restore you about as much as 8 hours of sleep despite being 2 hours shorter. See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/53s3w8/eli5_is_taking_a_3_hour_nap_during_the_day_and/d7wnnyo" target="_blank">this</a> for an explanation.</p></div>		</li>
