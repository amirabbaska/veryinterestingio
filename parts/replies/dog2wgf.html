			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this: Doggerland is an european example. There was a landmass between Great Britain, France and Scandinavia 10000 years ago. </p>
<p>The sea levels rose by some 35 meters in only 2000 or so years and that entire landmass vanished. </p>

<p>There's also evidence that there was some obstruction in the channel, so when that broke there was some very giant waterfall. </p>
<p>What social, economic or environmental results you can expect is speculation and vastly depends on why the sea levels falls. Shifted weight of water and ice does have an effect on the landmass and this causes geological effects. What is an interesting question if the currents in the oceans would still be stable, i.e. if the gulf stream stopped bringing warm air to Europe it will get much colder (note that Rome has a similar latitude than New York, and that all of northern Europe should be much colder, Berlin is nearly as far north as Moscow or Vancouver). </p>
<p>The social aspects would be very interesting, as countries would naturally claim the &quot;new&quot; lands at the coasts for themselves. While it might be unproblematic to do so for some 100 meters or a few kilotmeters, what are you doing with the new land that is 50 or 100 km out? Would we see the formation of new countries? Or just an extension of the ones that have coastal regions? What if new ressources are found in areas where two old coastal regions overlap? What will history do with islands that are not islands anymore? The questions here are just too big, numerous and fuzzy to answer. But we do know that big changes how geography is accessed - new modes of transportation or treaties - often cause conflict.</p>

<p>FTA: Another view speculates that the Storegga tsunami devastated Doggerland but then ebbed back into the sea, and that later Lake Agassiz (in North America) burst releasing so much fresh water that sea levels over about two years rose to flood much of Doggerland and make Britain an island.[11]</p>

<p>Agassiz created the upper Mississippi River valley, too... and the Red River of the North... and St. Anthony Falls and Minnehaha Falls in Minneapolis... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But unless the landmass creation was instant, I doubt this would be a problem - everyone's territory would expand gradually, so when it meets, pretty much all the land will have been claimed anyway.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And, given that humans left Africa around 75,000 years ago, and given that humans tend to migrate along coast lines and river systems, it's highly likely that many of the best archaeological sites are currently under ocean water.  It's kind of tragic.</p></div>		</li>
