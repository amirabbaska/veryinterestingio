<p>Can you elaborate? What are the new criteria/classes? Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, things just got more specific. The conclusion of <a href="http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/crego2014.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a> states, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As expressed by Marcus et al. (2012), the fact that the two
factors   of   the   PPI-R (Psychopathic Personality Inventory-
Revised),   fearless-dominance   and   impulsive-
antisociality, are largely uncorrelated is itself a testament that
PPI-R psychopathy is not a true syndrome in nature.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Cyclothymia is probably a true syndrome in nature,
wherein the dysthymic and hypomanic symptoms are due to a
common  etiology.  <strong>Psychopathy,  in  contrast,  is  more  likely  a
constellation of traits, with each having its own separate, independent etiology.</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit: I'm not sure what the most up-to-date criteria/classes are, hopefully someone else can answer that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Is &quot;constellation of traits&quot; the best way to describe this concept? Because it feels like there's <em>some</em> usefulness in the concept of psychopathy, whether or not it has a singular etiology, since there is seemingly an emergent, identifiable property of &quot;being a psychopath&quot; that occurs when someone coincidentally expresses all the traits in the constellation together.</p>
<p>Is there a name for that sort of concept? Sort of like how IQ, height, etc. are being found to be &quot;polygenic traits&quot;, is there a term like a &quot;polypathic trait&quot; to refer to a <em>symptom</em> you see only when several independent diseases co-occur?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s enough to write several essays on the subject, but this is simplified: </p>
<p>Antisocial personality disorder (or, as of late, - syndrome) builds upon the original construct of psychopathy (so does sociopathy). Most of the original criteria for psychopathy (callousness, superficial charm, lack of empathy etc) are still clinically associated with the ‘new’ antisocial personality syndrome. </p>
<p>However, having diagnostic manuals formed after open traits like these, led to too much room for interpretation and bad inter-rater reliability - different doctors/psychologists diagnosed differently. That makes a bad diagnostic tool. Hence, modern day psychopathy has - as part of the evolution of diagnostic tools such as our manuals (mainly DSM-5 and ICD) - come to focus on more concrete and observable behaviors (such as criminal acts). Why the word psychopathy was dropped? Mainly, but not entirely, due to that it started ringing really bad. That’s the same reason to why we now switch personality ‘disorder’ to ‘syndrome’. </p>
<p>Now with these more concrete behavior criteria, raters diagnose more similarly, to the cost of loosing much of the core of psychopathy. Not all psychopaths engage in criminal behavior, and it’s believed that those captured by the ‘Antisocial personality syndrome’  are only a part of the bigger group. That’s another line of research. </p>
<p>And finally, ‘psychopaths’ aren’t classified diagnostically in health care, but are still identified for the cause of  f ex risk assessment within the forensic field. Look up Hare Psychopathy Checklist - revised, for a closer look. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In psych (my work) we still use Trait Psychopathy as a descriptor, referring to essentially the same thing; we refer to traits rather than describing it as a disorder. Psychopathy itself is really isn't a disorder for an intelligent individual - it can even be quite a benefit in some circumstances. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add here that in the DSM V personality disorders were grouped into clusters with overlapping/similar traits. This is new/different. Cluster B (this is my language here) are largely characterizes by patterns of destructive, narcissistic, harmful behaviors. (See diagnostic criteria for Borderline, Antisocial, and Histrionic PD). </p>
<p>Also - the Personality disorder work group for the DSM 5 proposed a new mode for diagnosis of various personality disorders which is in the DSM 5 starting on page 761 (English translation). My anecdotal experience as a clinician (clinical social worker - I don’t do psych assessments) is that these aren’t largely used, but the old standard form is used. The proposed personalizing functioning and trait model is wildly different IMO. They committee states in the DSM 5 that they included it to “introduce a new approach that aims to address numerous shortcomings of the current approach to personality disorders” (p.761). It’s fascinating and I’d encourage anyone who is curious to read up on how the DSM is written/made. It really looked like they were going to change it (I was in grad school when the work groups were working) and I felt surprised they didn’t. In terms of science, clinical psych is a relatively new field and info is constantly emerging. Change happens slowly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How can the various criteria become more objective? (not saying they're objective as it is right now, just looking for clarification)</p>

<p>Such as? And in what way are they nonevidenced?</p>
