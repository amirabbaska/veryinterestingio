<p>Heavy investment in growth is likely the bigger cost. As well as legal fees across many jurisdictions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you consider &quot;subsidizing.&quot; Uber charges less per ride than other companies would, hurting their revenue in order to attract business. That's a form of &quot;subsidy&quot;, because while Uber may provide cheap rides where the driver gets 80%, they are only profitable when providing reasonably priced rides where the driver gets 60% (random numbers).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally uber and lyft remind me of Kozmo and Urban Fetch (last bubble). It can work, but not at the rate they're charging. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if the venture investors want to keep stuffing my pockets full of cash why am I going to complain? </p></div>		</li>
