<p>When I was in college, we did a lot of stupid things.  One day we decided to have a water drinking contest.  I wasn't drinking, I was just there watching. It was far scarier than any drinking contest I've ever seen.  Out of nowhere, guys just went from coherent to completely nuts.  It hit them hard and fast, and once it hit them they had no clue what was going on.  We cut it off pretty quick.</p></div>		</li>
