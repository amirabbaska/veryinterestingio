<p>I don't think injection into the deep ocean is being seriously considered anymore; as far as I know you end up with a giant puddle of supercritical CO2 which will utterly destroy any deep-ocean ecosystem it happens to slosh across, and ocean currents will tend to move it around in unpredictable ways.  Pretty unfortunate for all the tube worms and giant squid and such.  Maybe OP has more information on this topic.</p>
<p>CO2 injected underground <em>will</em> mineralize, sooner or later, combining with whatever cations it can find (mostly calcium and magnesium) to form carbonates.  The question is how <em>fast</em>, and that depends on what rock it's injected into.  Most studies and experiments have been done in sandstones, which are porous and permeable, so like a sponge they can soak up a lot of fluid.  Plus, you can find large, deep sandstone layers in just about any sedimentary basin, which is most of the world.  But they're also mostly pure quartz with some clay; they don't have many cations or interesting reactive surfaces, so mineralization of CO2 tends to be slow...  estimates on the order of 1000 years or something.  From what little I know we really don't understand the dynamics of high-pressure water-CO2-rock systems very well, so we don't know how long it will actually take, what factors affect the reaction rates, or if there's anything we can do to speed it up.  And nobody wants to monitor a high-pressure toxic waste site for 1000 years.</p>
<p>It might be better than that though, since I've seen dynamic simulations that indicate that after a much shorter period (100 years maybe) most of the CO2 will dissolve into the groundwater.  Water with dissolved CO2 is denser than the surrounding water, so this CO2-laden water will sink to the bottom of the formation and you'll get a fairly low-pressure system that tends to keep the CO2 sitting where you put it without further intervention, instead of one that's a shaken-up soda bottle ready to pop.  This is all done in deep saline groundwater systems that are of no use as drinking water anyway, so if that works out well it's probably a pretty good solution.  What it does to deep-rock microbe ecosystems <em>there</em> is an interesting question that might be worth investigating, since the right sort of bugs might be useful at accelerating the rate of mineralization as well.</p>
<p>Naturally the best solution is to make injected CO2 mineralize <em>fast</em>, like at Hellisheidi.  Iceland is all basalt, which is fairly reactive at Earth-surface-ish temperatures and pressures (turns out minerals that are stable at 1100 C and 5 GPa are pretty far from equilibrium at 20 C and 100 kPa) and has lots and lots of nice metal cations to donate to forming carbonates.  However,  we don't understand why the chemistry of these rocks makes these reactions so <em>fast</em>.  Basalt is also not quite as nice as sandstone for injecting fluids into, since instead of connected pore spaces making the rocks sponge-like the spaces the fluids are sitting in are generally hard-to-predict networks of fractures.  (Ironically, fracking could be a great way to make nice reservoirs where they don't exist already.)  But the good news is that while basalt deposits fairly regional (unlike sandstone which you can find basically everywhere <em>except</em> Iceland), they are often very <em>big</em>.  In North America, the Columbia River Basalt and related formations stretches basically from Seattle to Salt Lake City.  This won't be of very much use to power plants in Florida, since piping CO2 around costs money, but it's certainly worth looking at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno!  Maybe.  Would be interesting to find out!</p>
<p>Couple obvious downsides I see: First, supercritical CO2 is compressible; it doesn't turn into an incompressible liquid unless it's really cold.  This would make it fairly inefficient at transferring pressure to the surrounding rock to fracture it; a lot of the energy from your pumps would just go to compressing and heating up the CO2.  Second, after hydrofracking a fair amount of the frack fluid comes back out of the well and is disposed of, so using CO2 for fracking still results in a lot of CO2 you need to deal with.  Third, frack fluid is full of additives for encouraging the hydrocarbons to let go of the rock and flow back up the hole; figuring out the chemistry of this process with CO2 might require starting fresh.  Though it might also be worth it; the petroleum industry does the <em>craziest</em> things because someone tried it and it ended up working.  </p>
<p>To me it seems more likely to use existing fracking methods to do the actual fracking, and then maybe use CO2 as part of a reconditioning or work-over process to give a depleting well a bit of extra pep.  It seems less likely that a lot of the CO2 would get trapped underground in that process though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, thank you for reminding me.  I had heard a few years ago that some people at the US Department of Energy were investigating exactly this.  I need to check up on them and see if there's been any progress.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Depends on the well.  I think it needs to be about 2000 meters deep for storage to be considered &quot;basically permanent unless something bad happens&quot;.  There's plenty of wells shallower than that.  There's also an ever-increasing number of wells deeper than that; in many places drilling a well 2000 meters deep is commonplace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. First, carbon capture is only one among a set of technologies we need to use to decarbonize. That means, even by generous estimates, what carbon capture needs to put underground by 2050 is about 10 gigatons per annum (for reference, we emit about 40 gigatons each year today.) </p>
<p>Second, the thermodynamics of capture and storage are not too bad. It takes about 20% of a coal plant's energy to do it. The thermodynamics of capture and conversion is definitely bad. You will need more energy to convert carbon dioxide into something than you extracted when you burned a fossil fuel. But that's why capture and conversion is only supposed to be about 10% of total capture market. </p>
<p>Finally, injection underground (which is the best studied) is temporary on geological scales—thousands of years. So it's not something we need to worry about immediately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have to use 20% Of the coal plants energy to do that conversion then the overall efficiency of the plant is lowered below other types of power plants. In summary this means that people wouldn’t build the plants and therefore the research and conversion is pointless. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point that is sometimes lost is that carbon emissions come from many more sources than just coal plants.  To meet the decarbonization targets agreed to in Paris, we will need to deploy carbon capture to natural gas fired power plants, and non-power plants using coal -- i.e. cement plants, metallurgical furnaces, pulp and paper plants, waste-to-energy plants, etc.  Even if all coal plants were to be replaced by non-carbon emitting alternatives (nuclear, hydro, renewables), carbon capture is still needed.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does that follow? What do you mean by efficiency? If you mean price, that's pretty interesting. But it's not like we don't have a use for power that is on 24/7 (although nuclear can fill that niche).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Part of the rationale (not that I agree, but it's what I read), but by prolonging the issue, or kicking the can down the road, more advanced technologies will be available in the future to completely solve the problem.</p></div>		</li>

Pumping underground was never a proper solution, don't be fooled, it is only a future problem that will need another solution to correct the coal industries shortsightedness and geo-politcal manipulation.   </p></div>		</li>

<p>Unless it causes small earthquakes like injection of fracking water and materials does. So yeah, in a relatively new and upcoming field, you shouldn't say there's nothing to worry about for thousands of years when there are things that could go wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any idea how many deep well injection plants, water treatment facilities, oil and gas fracking wells there are? There have been a few instances of these &quot;earthquakes&quot; from poorly implemented injection wells in sites with particular geologic formations from a time when the geo-dynamics of injection was less understood and this shit keeps coming up.</p>
<p>There are 180,000 oil and gas waste water injection wells in the US...yes, 180 thousand. This is just the oil and gas number of wells. A tiny percentage of those caused seismic events.

<p>Throughout the US and the world, deep well injection is the preferred disposal of municipal waste water. If you live in a city, chances are your city is injecting or has plans to do so. This data is from 2016. I do not believe that these deeper class 1 wells like this have caused seismic events.

<p>Having said all this, co2 injection is gonna be different at scale and there would be a learning curve like anything else. The science and discussion about fracking and waste water injection is long since been closed. It is far more widespread than people can even imagine it is an everyday occurrence.</p></div>		</li>
