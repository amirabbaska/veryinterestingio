			<div class="markdown"><p>So why the hell does my device stop &quot;reading&quot; my capacitance when I prop it up on something? I've got a Nexus 7 and I love it, except if I want to use it while I'm eating or knitting or something and I prop it up on something instead of holding it, suddenly it's like the screen can't detect my touch to scroll or click (even when I get mad and give it a good hard thump or three), even though if I were holding in my hand at the same angle it would work fine. Sometime, if I lift it up and put it back or jostle it, I can get in a click or scroll before it reverts to ignoring me again, but not always. And as soon as I pick it up and hold it, it's fine again. It's like some sort of needy puppy or something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's more likely to be a problem with the specific device, rather than the way the screen works. How are you propping it up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just leaning it against stuff, like you'd lean a book or something. Like today, I leaned it on a cucumber that was sitting on the table. The other day, it was leaning against a basket on the counter at work. Doesn't matter the angle of the lean (barely elevated to almost upright), whether it's leaning in portrait or landscape mode, the content of the object leaned against or sitting on, or any other variable I can think of. Lean = touchscreen no worky. Pick it up = touchscreen works. </p>
<p>Another commentor has noted that it seems to be a known bug in this version, along with other related issues (touchscreen going all supersensitive and registering multiple taps instead of one, two conduction points instead of one which causes random zooming and related effects, taps triggering adjacent areas instead of or along with the actual tapped area, and so on). I've definitely had those issues, too, and usually have to reboot it to get it to stop.  Based on that, my guess is it's just some sort of baked-in second gen quirk that I'll have to live with until it dies and I get a new one. </p></div>		</li>
