			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they are the actual lyrics. And she's blatantly singing about the taste of an actual cherry chapstick (&quot;I kissed a girl and I liked it / Taste of her cherry chapstick&quot;). But since &quot;cherry&quot; can only mean &quot;virginity&quot;, they censored it anyway because... why the fuck not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aaaah, got it. I'd never heard it censored, so I assumed that you were implying that &quot;cherry&quot; was substituted in for something else. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so what was the censored version, are you saying the word cherry was removed?  I'm a grown adult and I didn't make the virginity connection until it was just now pointed out to me.   </p>
<p>Also from what I remember from when <del>bad romance</del> love game was on the radio disco stick was left intact.  Maybe that's a false memory though....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also a lot to do with who the artist is.</p>
<p>You will find less female singers get censored than male, it's just a part of our culture that women are less offensive than men at the moment.</p>
<p>Imagine if &quot;I'm all about that base&quot; were sung by a guy, a lot of that song would get shredded, like calling girls different than her bitches etc, fucking horrible song.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure? Tove Lo's &quot;High all the Time&quot; song has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then I go to sex clubs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in the second line, which is weirdly bleeped out on most radio stations. I guess it's because it's a &quot;sex club&quot;? But then the next line is about watching people get it on. And for crying out loud, the entire song is about doing drugs to get rid of the pain of a breakup...but apparently sex club is offensive.</p>
<p>But then Ed Sheeran's &quot;Don't&quot; has: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it's never bleeped out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd rather have a guy profess his love for crack than belittle and hound me for what I look like and what that supposedly says about me.</p>
<p>One is a glimpse into a life of unfortunate circumstances, the other is a vile and poisonous stain on our society with no other agenda than to make money on pitting the emotions of one &quot;group&quot; of people against another &quot;group&quot;, and, possibly, making the artist feel better about herself by attacking others. What do I know...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't she... immediately say &quot;Nah, I'm just playing,&quot; though? Not saying it's a good song but I don't think that's the reason it's bad.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it's &quot;bass&quot; rather than &quot;base,&quot; comparing larger women to bass sounds and smaller women to treble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Censoring double entendres makes absolutely no sense. The whole idea is to mask the underlying meaning. If the listener doesn't know what the meaning is, no censorship is necessary. If they do know the meaning, their precious innocence has been spoilt already.</p>
<p>In the end you've ruined a song for no reason. Removing or bleeping out lyrics more often just calls attention to them and children might look them up and figure it out anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I did say it was overzealous censorship. It's presumably because the Just Dance videogames is rated E for Everyone, so Ubisoft didn't want any chances of angry &quot;But who will think of the <strong><em>children</em></strong>?!?!?!&quot;-type parents beating down their doors.</p></div>		</li>
