			<div class="markdown"><p>People who still use pop-up ads also know the are still people computer illiterate enough to click through. <em>You</em> know pop-ups are malicious, but your grandma may actually believe she's the 1,000,000th visitor to that page and sign away her personal info to claim her prize. Ads like these prey on the weak, and as long as the weak are still out there, why bother spending time and money on a more sophisticated method? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine made a lot of $ by making pop up chains that a person couldn't escape from unless they A) turned off the computer or B) paid for some sort of service.</p>
<p>99.9% figured out how to use the power button. But he did this 100,000 times a day. The more volume the more $. There was no immediate law against this so while the merchants were willing to process this type of garbage transaction it was easy $. Nowadays it wouldn't take many chargebacks/complaints before the merchant pulls the plug. </p></div>		</li>
