<p>Now, quarks (at normal energies) can only exist in bound groupings; the force which binds them gets stronger as you try to &quot;pull them apart&quot;, to the point where instead of doing so, you input enough energy to create new bound sets of quarks and other particles. </p>

<p>Question: When I read that, what jumped to mind was how the &quot;accelerating expansion&quot; of the universe is often explained by concluding that eventually all particles will be ripped apart.</p>
<p>If that is the case, and considering that effect you described above, could the universe &quot;expand&quot; to the point where - as these particles are forced apart - enough new matter comes into existence to, essentially, create a new universe, starting the whole cycle over again?</p></div>		</li>

<p>As I personally understand it- No.  </p>
<p>The reason for that is down to the fact that mass and energy are essentially the same thing on a very fundamental level. Particles can only spring into existence (and then usually annihilate) if there's sufficient energy in the local Vacuum for them to do so, and when they do, they 'use up' some of the local energy in their formation. Then return it when they annihilate.</p>
<p>There's not sufficient energy to give rise to a new universe. Which is probably a good thing. It'd be murder trying to get property insurance with 'big bangs' happening all over the place :) </p></div>		</li>
