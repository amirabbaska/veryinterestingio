			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick question about the math, if the issue is simply no <em>adjacent</em> duplicate pins, wouldn't the number of possible locks be something more like:</p>
<p>10 x 9 x 9 x 9 x 9 x 9, </p>
<p>since the first pin can be any of the 10 values, and each next pin in the series can be any of the 9 remaining values not equal to the previous one?</p>
<p>That'd be something like 590,490 combinations.</p>
<p>Or are there more unmentioned restrictions on the choice of pin size that reduce it down to the 4096 possibilities?  I'm just not seeing where you get these '6 independent instances of 4 choices'.  It seems like you have a lot more than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not really understanding this either bit the starting number would be 9x8x8x8x8x8 it ranges from one to nine there is no zero position. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry about the confusion. I'm going to have to get a little a little deeper into terminology for this one. When setting up the sequence of numbers we've been referencing, this is called the Key Bitting Aray (KBA). Typically this is what your master keying is based on, but I will dive into that on another comment I saw asking about master keying.</p>
<p>Lets choose a KBA: 274985</p>
<p>If you notice, the numbers alternate odd and even so that there is less of a risk to duplicate numbers next to one another. The reason you don't want to do this is because it will create a large flat spot in your key, which is not a good idea. Once you have your KBA, you expand your key system using a method called progression. This is very similar to how an odometer operates. Example of a 2 step progression:</p>
<p>Step 1:
*
274987
274989
274981
274983</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>*
276987
276989
276981
276983...and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>Each progression is called a block.There are 4 sequences in a block, 4 blocks in a Vertical Group, and 4 vertical groups per page. This can be extended to 4 pages per KBA, 16 pages per KBA, and 64 pages per KBA(max for a 6-pin system).</p>
<p>I think this might be a question so I want to clarify. The KBA is what locksmiths use as a guide to create a master key, so the KBA is really just used as a base. It is only used when pinning a cylinder that is only operated by the master key and nothing else.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps to clarify...I had to open my keying manual for the terms, but sometimes it's just easier to use them.</p>
<p>Edit: Looks like someone already explained the Master Keying pretty well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He had mentioned 0-9, as in a blank cylinder being permissible. Hence the 10 possible values.</p>
<p>Though in response to you he seems to be providing more limitations - altering odd-even for starts, which cuts down to only 4 or 5 options per pin. So that explains that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add-on to this:  Many locks in the same box/shipment are configured with the same pin settings, making it easier for customers to just have one key to open multiple locks without going through the trouble of changing the pins.  If you go to a store and look at locks, they will often have a 5-6 digit number on the package which indicates the pin settings.  Sometimes this number is even on your keys!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. If you go into a hardware supplier for a new lock and want this option, just ask for locks that are &quot;keyed alike&quot; or &quot;KA&quot;. Depending on the lock, some places will charge for this, but usually its only a couple dollars a lock.</p></div>		</li>
