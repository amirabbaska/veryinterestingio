			<div class="markdown"><p>You would get cold quite quickly.  After about an hour, you would feel warm and sleepy.  By 2 hours, you would be asleep and by 4 hours dead.  It would take a few more days to actually freeze solid.</p>
<p>The ISS collects (and needs to radiate) more energy than 1000 human bodies.     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your entire body would boil first because of the massive pressure difference. Things boil at very low temperatures when there's low atmospheric pressure.  There's an astronaut who had a leak in his suit and described the feeling of his tongue beginning to boil. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was actually the spit <em>on</em> his tongue boiling, he was testing a space suit in a vacuum chamber in a NASA facility, and he was uninjured aside from a brief loss of consciousness and ear ache afterwards.

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I think about it is that space is neither hot nor cold. Matter is hot or cold, and when we talk about ambient temperature we are talking about the temperature of the gas (or sometimes liquid) we are in. It’s common to say that space is cold because there is very, very little matter there, so you have very little ambient thermal energy in the form of vibrating atoms and molecules, but it’s kind of like dividing by zero. It’s not that stuff is vibrating slowly, like with cold air, it’s that there is no stuff to vibrate.</p>
<p>The result is that temperature in space is paradoxical. If you’re exposed to it directly, you’re actually relatively insulated, because there’s very little matter around you to transfer energy to. You this lose energy at the rate you radiate it, more or less, which is way slower than the rate you’d transfer it to cold water, for example. On the other hand, if you are exposed to radiation in space, like direct sunlight, you may suddenly find yourself with a massive energy surplus and no way to radiate it. </p>
<p>A quick google suggests  that in near earth orbit, in direct sunlight you’d feel a temperature of 393K, or about 248 degrees Fahrenheit. If you passed into shadow, that would drop to 173K, or about -148 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s why spacesuits have to both heat and cool astronauts. They would cook to death during spacewalks if the suit didn’t provide protection from the heat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. Convection at room temperature is much more effective than radiation at removing heat.</p>
<p>Source: I design satellite radiators. It's weird shit, yo. Google the Satellite Thermal Control Handbook, it's a fantastic resource if you're interested in this stuff. </p></div>		</li>
