			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it has a lower nutrition/mass ratio or requires too much energy to make per mass of food produced. I don't think mutations like this are efficient, but that's just speculation.</p>
<p>I think that if you wanted to sell these you'd have to market them specifically and filter out the non-mutated ones. I don't know about you, but normally when I shop produce I try to avoid the weird-looking stuff (except for root veggies, which always look weird), but I might buy it if i knew it was supposed to look weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's only considered defective against a USno.1 grade. It the grades and standards for this product it is considered damaged by means of Internal Sprouting  (second growth). Damage is the smallest measurement of defective product on this product. You can't consider it seriously damaged so this would be perfectly acceptable on a USno.2 grade. Please see <a href="http://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Pepper_including_Sweet_and_Other_than_Sweet_types_Inspection_Instructions.pdf" target="_blank">United States Department of Agriculture Shipping point and Market Inspection Instructions for Sweet Peppers and Other Peppers</a> page 18 is internal sprouts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should note that something is considered defective if it doesn't meet the guidelines listed in the grades and standards for that product. This means it has less marketability (less likely to sell). If you're at the grocery store and you're in the produce isle, you see two peppers left on the shelf, one is fine but the other is mishappen or discolored. Most people will not buy the one that they consider to be of lesser value because it isn't what they think of when they say bell pepper.</p></div>		</li>
