			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be disappointed but ink is just pigment in a carrier (organic solvent) too. You're not staining the skin, you're implanting pigment particles that are too large to be broken down by the immune system. This is why the tattoo doesn't go away and is bleached by UV radiation (the sun). Most organic / inorganic pigments (which tattoo ink is made from) will degrade from prolonged exposure to UV (I can get into the chemistry if you'd like) and thats why the tattoo will fade over time. </p>
<p>The reason you can't just cover it with a lighter color is because you're not &quot;covering&quot; it. You're just adding more material to the tissue. Black ink is going to absorb more light (hence why it is black) and will simply overpower the reflection of the lighter ink. Lighter colors don't work because you just see them in combination with what is already there. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a less chemically detailed note, human skin is not a single color. It fluctuates based on a huge number of factors, from temperature to emotion and many others. If you did just tattoo one patch of &quot;skin tone&quot;, it would be pretty apparent that it wasn't natural skin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While very true, the person could have a white tattoo put in place over the black square. For instance, my artist has blacked out whole tattoos and done entirely new work over the black with white pigment with shading and depth.  (Remy at Beautiful Aftermath tattoo in Walla Walla, Wa. He's on instagram and Facebook if you want to check out his work.)  My point is there are always options to eliminate poor work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember right, and I might not be, the tattoo &quot;ink&quot; gets captured by immune cells in the healing process which then die in place and aren't cleaned up by the body, that's why they last so long. Laser treatments break up those dead cells and the ink flushes into the body. </p></div>		</li>
