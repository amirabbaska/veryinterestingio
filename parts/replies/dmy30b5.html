			<div class="markdown"><p>Please tell me if I'm wrong but from what I'm hearing its not just a single 1:1 exchange but rather a nucleus as well as the proton thats involved in the transformation, so the proton is transformed into a neutron and a beta particle and neutrino but with the help of the entire nucleus releasing lots of energy to become a lower mass species? As well as this people are also saying that while i'm correct with isolated single protons and neutrons but a bonded neutron and proton is less massive then 2 isolated protons? Are these both correct or is this 2 ways to say the same answer? Sorry for the confusion. Thanks in advance!</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is correct as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry for all the questions but what if you had a Hydrogen atom? its nucleus is a single proton so when it is fusing into helium then what would happen? because one of the two protons would transform using beta decay but as you said thats possible using it's nucleus but if the whole nucleus is just a proton then how would that work?</p>
<p>EDIT: My teacher is arguing that it absorbs energy from around it? Is that true/How can I disprove it?</p></div>		</li>
