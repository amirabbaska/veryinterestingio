<p>Buy up 10% of a company's shares to get a board seat, pressure management to issue massive amounts of junk bonds (using the company's own assets as collateral) to buyback the remaining 90% of outstanding shares, rapidly dispose of valuable assets (including employees) to pay back the bonds, and then exit once the share price skyrockets - leaving the company a shell of its former self.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do you even need bonds as an intermediary to do that? Why not just rapidly dispose of assets to buy back shares instead of selling bonds to buy back shares then dispose of assets to pay the bonds? </p>
<p>Also, why would the share price go up if the company is selling its own assets to buy back shares- each remaining share is then worth a proportionally less underlying value. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Essentially, it increased potential expected gains by 10x. Didn't matter that the interest rate on the junk bonds were in the high teens if the payback was 500%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It still sounds like at the end of the day you're just liquidating the company and dishing out the proceeds to shareholders. I don't see how that could generate 5x in value unless the company's share price was that far below net assets (yeah right), or the bonds are never fully paid. </p>
<p>For example if a company has $50 million net assets and $150 million market cap, and it sells $130 million in bonds to increase share price by a huge margin, it's going to need more than assets to pay back the bonds. If it only sells $50 million in bonds it's not going to be able to buy back enough shares for generation of huge returns, and the share price will crash to the bottom shortly thereafter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. Isn't this very practice itself &quot;structural fraud&quot;? Having the board of directors take loans on terms that were against the company's own interest, benefitting the lender at their own expense?</p>
<p>Maybe I misunderstand the legal and contractual obligations of members of the board of directors. I guess those obligations are not as well defined or enforced in some scenarios. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. The only thing I don't get is why the share price skyrockets? Why are investors at that stage suddenly willing to pay more for a share when the remaining company is just a husk. Maybe it has more cash at that stage but fewer other assets and most importantly, less of a future, no? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the short term, these &quot;savings&quot; allow the company to pay off debt. The future potential value of the company sharply increases by the removal of large amounts of interest and payments owed.</p>
<p>Additionally, for a short moment (that single quarter), profit margins went through the roof. The removal of those 'costs' (like employees, property taxes, etc) from the balance sheet and the influx of the sales themselves (if, say, a factory gets sold off) make it look amazing overall. Purely by the numbers, someone's earned his golden parachute, and will likely jump out before the resulting crash.</p>
<p>Truly massive layoffs, especially if heavily mediatized, are usually terrible for stock prices. It's showing a desperate move to increase profitability by eliminating one of the major non-c-level-compensation expenses: employees (and their benefits, and future insurance or litigation payouts and so on and so forth) However, if &quot;used&quot; correctly and quietly enough, what you're actually doing is creating a glut of oft-highly-trained workers seeking new work, which helps slash overall wages in the sector, making this a win especially for major stockholders of that industry in general (as devastating as it is for income equality and the livelihood of smaller towns).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see. Fascinating. So the scheme relies on other investors not quite realizing what is going on..? </p>
<p>So you make the company look good in the officially reported numbers that every investor has easily access to, but to see the truly rotten core they would have to dig a bit deeper. Then you hope that a sufficient number of investors don't do their homework and fall for it... </p>
<p>Is that it?</p></div>		</li>
