<p>Are there good examples of true randomness inn nature that would illustrate the distinction?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The classic examples of true random phenomena are atomic and quantum processes that are thought to be actually and completely unpredictable. Radioactive decay is one example of such a process.</p>
<p>The isotope carbon-14 is the isotope used for carbon-dating. Suppose you isolated one such atom of carbon-14. That atom is unstable, and we know that at some point it will eventually emit an electron. When this happens, one of its neutrons will convert into a proton, and the carbon-14 will turn into nitrogen-14.</p>
<p>According to all our experimental observations, it is impossible to predict when that atom will decay and emit that electron- it is equally likely at any given point in time. The atom has no &quot;memory&quot; meaning that nothing in the atom's history will influence its future likelihood of decaying. Eventually it will decay, but it is impossible to predict when.</p>
<p>Also, according to some quantum hand-waving I don't really understand, the uncertainty principle means that even if we were able to observe the atom in order to make a guess as to when it will decay, the mere act of observing the atom will then change it, thus making the new state of the atom unknown. Every time you try to look at it you then change it a little bit, so your future predictions are never accurate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you confused about the uncertainty principle, then here's a good explanation that Neil deGrasse Tyson gave once in a podcast I heard.  I'll paraphrase slightly, but he compares it to searching for a coin that has fallen in between the driver's seat of a car and the center console.  You know it's not moving (momentum = 0) but you do not know its precise location. Say you stick your hand in there to find it and your finger touches it, but as soon as it does it drops away from you.  The very act of making a tactile measurement has changed its momentum such that while you momentarily knew exactly where it was, in that instant you did not know where it was going anymore.  It's the same way with sub atomic particles.  Measurement is an interaction so while you can gain certain piece of data from one particular measurement, we cannot (at this point) do so without interacting with the particle in a way as to avoid changing other aspects of it's state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like /u/cooldude_i06 mentioned below, the quantum hand-waving you mention is actually the observer effect, not the uncertainty principle.</p>
<p>I'm not sure it's all that relevant to radioactive decay, either, since I can't really think of what measurements you would do to an atomic nucleus that would affect its decay rate without breaking it apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not quite right that computers are completely unable to generate true randomness. Pseudo-random number generators are unable to generate true randomness (hence &quot;pseudo&quot;), but PRNGs aren't the only way to generate randomness.</p>
<p>You can get &quot;really good randomness&quot; by finding generally unpredictable sources of entropy in the computer system like the time between user keystrokes or the length of mouse movements. This is &quot;really good&quot; in the sense that the state (seed) of the pseudo-random number generator can be frequently set to an unknown state, meaning that it's extremely unlikely that a specific PRNG seed will be used long enough that someone could feasibly predict the future generated numbers. However, if you knew and measured the sources of entropy you could theoretically predict the system's future state. Since keystroke timings etc. aren't truly statistically random this is not true randomness.</p>
<p>That's good enough for most applications, but if you really need true randomness then you can hook your computer up to a hardware-based random number generator. These measure statistically random physical quantities like thermal noise or quantum phenomena, and do produce true random numbers. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pseudo random numbers do have their drawbacks, like you mentioned they often end up being correlated in some way.</p>
<p>It is however not all bad, since using pseudo random numbers for simulations makes it easy to replicate (you just need to remember your seed value). This makes it invaluable for sensitivity testing your models. </p>
<p>Using extra hardware to get truly random numbers is great but you would then have to save the entire number set somewhere if you would like to reuse it, which can be cumbersome if you are simulating really large samples. </p></div>		</li>
