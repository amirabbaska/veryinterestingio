<p>Like seriously, that's the sole objective of all organisms. As far as we can determine, we are the first to gain the necessary abstract thinking skills with our big brains, to even be capable of considering the <em>point</em> of something.</p>
<p>Maybe there have been spiders that move around a bit in their webs. But by and large they've found themselves picked off by hungry birds looking for movement. Or lost too much energy before they were able to find their next meal. And therefore the gene pool simply favors the survivors. Those able to pass on their genes. </p>
<p>And in this case, it favored spiders who stay still to stay hidden to predators with shitty eye-sight. And not waste precious energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some will move around like crazy to avoid getting eaten by birds. Like when you disturb the web and they spend the next five minutes flipping out and rocking back and forth until they are a blur.</p>
<p>Usually happens when I've caught a fly that was bothering me and try to chuck it in for them to eat. Some species will pounce on that thing, others will retreat into a corner and some will just stay put in the middle and gyrate madly.</p>
<p>I once had a surprisingly great time sheltering under a bridge from the rain whilst stoned and just watching two spiders around the lights attempting to steal food from each other's webs before getting into a death match for an hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on: Most web weaving spiders don't exactly have great vision (I believe most of them can just tell between dark and light at the most) so it'd be especially hazardous to just go wandering around blindly when you could just stay still in your web and use your sense of touch to know when you caught something.</p>
<p>This doesn't count for jumping spiders who have surprisingly good eyesight and are active hunters who really only use their webbing as a safety measure on tricky jumps!  </p></div>		</li>
