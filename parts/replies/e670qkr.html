			<div class="markdown"><p>If your pot is stainless steel then that is why.  Stainless steel is much more resistant to cavitation than propeller bronze. Both because it has a tougher oxide film, and because it has higher strength.</p>
<p>If you only boil in your pot a few minutes per day then that is why.  Propellers and impellers can experience cavitation for 24 hours per day, for weeks, months, or in the case of hydroelectric plant impellers years at a time.</p>
<p>If your pot boils at 100 C then that is why.   Because of its higher temperature, water in your pot is less dense, so the collapsing bubbles have less energy.  Salt in seawater has a similar effect.</p>
<p>Mostly length of exposure to cavitation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason cavitation damage to pumps, props, valves and piping is damaging whereas in a boiling pot is not is the quantity of cavitation and how much the pressure at the vena contracta drops below the vapor pressure.    In these systems to are lowering pressure on an incompressible fluid so the change can happen rapidly and violently when you increase local fluid velocity.</p>
<p>In a pot of boiling water you are raising the vapor pressure by increasing the internal energy of the water.   This process only moves the vapor pressure ever so slightly higher than atmospheric so there is very little energy in the cavitation.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the systems in the top, the cavitation occurs on or very near the boundary.   So the metal absorbs the impact.</p>
<p>In the pot scenario, cavitation does not occur next to the pot walls because the pot is hotter than the fluid, even up the walls.   So those bubbles don’t collapse but instead rise.  The only cavitation occurs in the center of the water volume which can (poorly) absorb the impact of the microjets without transferring enough energy to the pot itself.</p>
<p>And SST props are very common and can suffer from cavitation.</p>
<p>You could boil water in a pot in a residential burner for decades and never suffer cavitation damage.  You would however suffer erosion and mineral leaching as hot water loves to leach minerals.   Maybe over an extremely high heat (100,000+BTU commercial burner you could see some cavitation damage over time.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly the correct answer.</p>
<p>The reason the boiling water is quieter is because the steam portion that is rising through the water will absorb the little remaining cavitation (and there’s less cavitation once it is boiling)</p>
<p>Flashing processes (also known as boiling, but flashing is typically lowering pressure instead of raising temps) is not a significant noise generating process.  In fact, we cannot accurately predict noise generation of these systems currently.</p></div>		</li>
