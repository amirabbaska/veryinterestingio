<p>That's why i feel weird when people put milk in tea. Then I realize many probably feel that way when I use milk in coffee.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you take it with reduced fat or whole milk? I could see how someone could prefer either :). I use milk in coffee sometimes, preferably whole but it's not a big deal if we only have something else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll have to take it up with culinary institutions around the world I suppose, because this is the accepted science behind it currently! You feel like you haven't drank anything in a week because the food is exhausting your stores of saliva. When you're thirsty, liquids that quench your thirst seem all the more appealing. Combine this with culture(your preferences) and the memory of taste(also your preferences!), and voila.</p></div>		</li>
