			<div class="markdown"><p>On that note: Lemon, lime, vinegar and other acids bring out the flavors of many foods. Especially grilled meat and soups. Whenever you're eating something and tastes like it still needs something even after you've added salt it probably needs some acid. I either squeeze a lemon wedge or pour a little of juice from pickled jalape√±os.    </p>
<p>Try making aguas frescas (crushed/juiced strawberry or any fruit really, water, sugar, dash of salt, and juice of a few limes) and taste it before and after you add the lime juice. You'll see what I mean. It doesnt get &quot;limey&quot; it just brings out the flavors that were already there.     </p></div>		</li>

<p><em>taste</em> meh</p>
<p><em>tastes after salt and lemon juice</em> Fuck yeah!</p>
<p>It's like a flavour explosion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a reason that in any cooking show where they say a dish was underseasoned what they really mean is you didn't put enough salt in it.</p>
<p>If it lacked a particular seasoning, they mention it by name, like you didn't add much cinnamon or I couldn't taste the tarragon at all, but if they say lacked seasoning, or underseasoned, they just mean salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup I was in cooking school for a year and probably the number one change any chef asked for was more seasoning. It  always meant more salt.. me? I love salt so I put too much and I was told it meant I was in love (I was..) I usually had to add more other ingredients to cut the salty taste  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The part that makes this bs is that 'enough salt' is completely arbitrary and based on how much salt you normally eat. If you go on a lower-sodium diet for whatever reason, food tastes incredibly bland for a couple weeks, and then you adjust. After that, a 'normal' level of salt tastes incredibly salty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A year or so ago I read that adding just a pinch of salt to the coffee grounds in your cafetiere will enhance the flavours and soften the sharper edge coffee can have, so I tried it and I've been doing it ever since. It's probably not the best of habits to have gotten into but my goodness, does it elevate the flavour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, that's such a small amount. Nothing to worry about.  Let me go ahead and put your mind at ease on that one. Go look at the sodium in a single hotpocket or can of soup. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that is actually so new to me. as someone who is more or less obsessed with coffee, it's always great to hear ways to enhance the flavour. i'll give another suggestion if you're willing to try it, is just add a touch of vanilla essence to your morning coffee. just a very small amount it's awesome. also is there are side effects of adding salt to your coffee?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense. Salt+bitter=sweet. Its just this weird thing. For the same reason, the secret ingredient of hot chocolate is a pinch of salt. It turns the bitter chocolate flavor into a sweet one.</p>
<p>Sugar masks the bitter flavor. Salt actually eliminates it. IIRC, salt inhibits your tongue from tasting bitter at all and instead tricks it into tasting bitter as sweet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual reaction is with your taste buds I'm fairly sure.</p>
<p>The salt doesn't really REACT with the food. Not in a chemical bond kind of way. It does pull water out, which does things. </p>
<p>From what I understand is that the POP most people keep talking about is the salt reacting with your taste buds. </p>
<p>Also, OP, have you ever had bread that didn't have salt in it? It's vile. </p>
<p>I used to bake my own bread all the time, forgot to add salt once. Never again.</p>
<p>Try it with biscuits or something sometime, just make a 1/10 batch without salt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does actually. The chemical receptor for the unami taste (the taste of meat) is for sodium glutamate. Glutamate is an amino acid that you probably find in all meat, so adding salt will allow more sodium to bind to that receptor along with glutamate and be perceived as a meety taste. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The umami sensation is for glutamate, not sodium glutamate. </p>
<p>Glutamine is an amino acid that is present in pretty much every protein in existence. the difference is that meats generally have a higher concentration of free glutamine, that is glutamine that is not bound in a protein. (That's why MSG is so great) </p>
<p>If you take MSG (monosodium glutamate) and put it in water it will dissolve just like sodium chloride. The sodium in MSG will leave the glutamate and go hang out with water molecules and the glutamine will be nice and happy in the water as well. </p>
<p>Adding salt will not increase the amount of glutamine that can be perceived by your taste buds.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of baking specifically, I'm not sure that the reason isn't actually chemical. In many situations I'm sure that you're right and salt isn't reacting with anything other than water on the exterior of the meat, but baking is already such a science project that it wouldn't surprise me if there is a chemical reaction. I hope that made sense? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sodium chloride does not <strong>react</strong> in a <strong>chemical</strong> sense with anything. </p>
<p>Neither will form covalent bonds, where they share electrons as they are both happy with gaining/losing a single electron.
Neither will be oxidized or reduced as they already follow the rule of 8. (8 electrons in the outermost shell) </p>
<p>Sodium and chlorine only really react in an ionic sense, they can also be used as catalysts for other chemical reactions that ARE occurring in the bread. </p>
<p>Of the things the salt could be doing besides being salt, acting as a catalyst is the most likely. </p>
<p>There are a lot of chemical reactions that are occurring, but salt just isn't one of the things that is doing anything. </p>
<p>Baking powder, baking soda, water, and any acids (vinegar, lemon, etc) that you add are all acting in a chemical sense. </p></div>		</li>
