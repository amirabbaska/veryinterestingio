			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine this to be the biggest factor. Most vaccines are getting injected into muscle and the most painful part is when the liquid actually gets pushed into the muscle tissue. The needle is usually small enough that the surface skin pain isn’t really high compared to the muscle underneath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually makes a lot of sense. There's really no point in numbing the skin if it's not going to work anyway. It might provide some comfort in the beginning if it psychologically &quot;tricks&quot; you into not worrying about it, but you're still going to feel it anyway. So maybe it would only work once, since you'd obviously learn from the experience that numbing agents don't really work in this case.</p>
<p>That on top of whatever extra costs there would be for the clinic to stock that stuff, which would undoubtedly get rolled downhill to the patient or whoever is financially responsible for them.</p></div>		</li>

There is a video by vsauce that shows this lady being hit by a harmless light. She claims the pain to be a 10/10 the worst pain she has ever experienced in her life. All they had to do was give her the idea that it would be painful. Her brain did the rest.  Minefield episode 6 touch.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read something years ago about people being told that they were going to be touched with a hot metal rod to measure pain reactions for something blah blah. They were required to put their hand on the other side of a divider and then they were touched with an ice cold(but not cold enough to cause any damage) rod for about a second.</p>
<p>The placebo affect of it was so intense that a few people actually developed blisters as if they were burned by a heated rod. Most(I'm assuming, I can't remember exactly so I don't want to say all) said that they felt as if the rod was extremely hot.</p>
<p>But as I said I read it years ago, I may not be remembering it correctly.</p>
<p>Personally I've run the kitchen tap and thought the water would come out hot, as if I'd just used the hot water, bc ours gets to literally boiling for some reason?? But when I put my hand under I thought it scalded me and snatched my hand back, only to realise it was actually ice cold. It was a cold day, hence icy cold water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to donate plasma and I gotta say, once you get used to having a needle poke you it doesnt actually hurt. It's more the anticipation, tensing, seeing it go in (actually seeing it or picturing it), and thinking about the decisions you've made in life that have led to this point that are the problem. Once I got used to looking away and breathing slowly/imagining something else, it really does just feel like a &quot;little pinch.&quot; Even if they screwed up and had to adjust the needle, as long as I didn't think about it I was ok.</p>
<p>And this is a lovely 4+ inch needle going halfway into your arm at the same spot twice a week. </p>
<p>It's most definitely mental over the actual pain it causes. I think the finger prick to test your blood before the donation <em>hurts</em> more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My son is a needlephobe but needs regular MRIs with an IV in place. His last one was a breeze because they waited a full hour with the cream in place (with plastic film over it). The guy said you can tell when it's right because it should leave a white splotch on the skin.</p>
<p>When I had an IV done there they injected numbing medicine with a small needle and then did the cannula. Huge difference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;This follows past studies that looked at using VR headsets in hospitals as a way to reduce pain medication usage by distracting the patient.&quot;</p>
<p>I wasn't aware there were studies on this, but I have chronic pain and mobility issues, and recently got myself a VR headset and think it is fantastic. I definitely feel like it helps on some level dealing with pain, in addition to getting me to move around more when I'm gaming, even if it is still seated play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Occasionally EMLA cream can be used for pediatrics to reduce pain. It can cause methemoglobinemia if overused, which causes the hemoglobin to basically hold onto the oxygen and not release it for tissues in the body. Local anesthetic are not without side effects and sometimes it’s just not worth taking a risk or costing more money for a pain that is so temporary. Once a shot is given the pain is from within the tissue where the vaccine is distributed. So really it would only cover the initial poke and nothing else. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there 100% is a lot of diving and over exaggeration in soccer/football, but what a lot of people forget is that sometimes players just need a minute collect themselves or work out a kink. A kick to the back of the leg after running 10-12 miles might fatigue you more than it otherwise would. It won’t force the player to leave the game but he just needs a minute. It’s a pretty stamina driven sport. Run for miles and miles each game and substitutions are limited; usually they aren’t used till the 80th minute (and rarely are all 3 subs used)</p>
<p>So what I’m trying to say is that a player may very well be in actual pain and be perfectly fine several minutes later. When you’re fatigued your body tends to react much more negatively to sudden stress</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True...by in actual practice, nurses and pediatricians have to get really creative when working with kids.  Kids can’t consent to or decline treatment.  A five year old kid might scream and holler and say he doesn’t want stitches after you’re fixing up the laceration eye.  “Too bad son...Mom makes the call here...”  Kids can’t give informed consent.</p>
<p>You don’t lie to parents.  And it’s best to bring kids on board as much as possible so they’re not scared of the doctor.  But sometimes, you have to do what you have to do.</p></div>		</li>
