			<div class="markdown"><p>The sitting at a chair example was just to give a visual I believe. We are not actually motionless when sitting at our desk. That would mean we are travelling only through time and not space, and as discussed that would be impossible. In fact, it's been stated that nothing can be still entirely, even that movement might be a necessary component of existence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, both of those explanations do help. I guess I just find it strange to think that I am constantly being whipped through space at millions of miles an hour, yet I can also feel like I am being completely still, and vis-a-vis things in my immediate environment, I might as well be. It blows my mind that my perceptions don't blow my mind more frequently ;). </p></div>		</li>

So yes, everything we see from earth is slightly distorted due to earths motion. But only very slightly, because earth isn't moving very fast relative to most objects. Although our speed around the sun is 1 <em> 10^5 meters per second, that's only around 0.1% of the speed of light, so effects due to relativity are negligible. But if an object </em>were* moving close to the speed of light, relative to us, then we would have a very distorted view of it, and it would have a very distorted view of us and everything else. </p>
<p>Basically the answer to your question is that we live in a pretty quiet part of the universe so even though there is no unique reference point, things aren't moving fast enough for relativity to be an issue for most observations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Earth isn't necessarily moving.</p>
<p>Think of it like this:  Imagine a blank, infinite universe.  That is, there's nothing in it.  Now stick one object in it.  There is no way for that one object to ever &quot;move,&quot; because in order to move, it would have to move relative to something else, and there is nothing else in the universe for it move with respect to.  That object will be forever stationary.</p>
<p>Now add a second object to that universe.  Each of these objects can move, but only with respect to one another.  So who's to say which of those objects is moving and which is stationary?  Or that they're not both &quot;moving?&quot;  Each object, from its own perspective, can be seen as either moving with respect to the other, or as standing still with the respect to the other.  </p>
<p>Now add a third object.  Same deal.  That object can view itself as moving with respect to the other two or as standing still with respect to the other two. </p>
<p>You can add billions and billions of objects to that universe, and the story never changes.  Since motion can only be relative to other objects, each object can be seen as stationary, from its own perspective.  </p>
<p>In short, in relativity, wherever you happen to be standing is <em>always</em> the center of the universe, if you want it to be.</p></div>		</li>
