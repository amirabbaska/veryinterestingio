<p>Perhaps if part of a spaceship was hit and the trajectory changed or it went into some kind of tumble then we might be able to deduce that it was hit.</p>

<p>If we're still talking about the Voyagers here, then it is pretty certain we would never be able to ascertain what happened in the case of a fatal collision unless the spacecraft was active transmitting to Earth at the time.  </p>
<p>Once the high gain antenna no longer points at Earth, the craft is uncontrollable and untrackable.  If the craft was transmitting when the incident occurred, maybe a Doppler shift anomaly just before final LOS could provide a clue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: no.</p>
<p>Long answer: We know space is empty, and have much better ways of estimating the object density in space. Space is mindbogglingly empty: basically if you were to base your estimate of how much stuff in space is by how long it takes one of the voyager probes to collide, you would be waiting a very, very, very long time, and since the statistics would be terrible (there are only 2 voyager probes), it wouldn't be a very accurate measurement anyways. Its much easier to look for objects with telescopes or satellites.</p>
<p>As for dark matter, we really only see it's effects at a galactic scale. By it's nature it won't interact with the probes - otherwise it would be 'normal' matter. And at the scale of our solar system, the gravitational forces acting on voayger are essentially the sun with a very minor correction for Jupiter.  Seriously, the sun contains over 99% of the mass of the solar system. Any forces on the voyager probes caused by dark matter would be so small they'd be undetectable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just fyi, traveling at it's current speed it would take Voyager about 76,000 years to reach the nearest star. So they don't have to worry about a trajectory change due to being near a star or black hole. Space really is mind blowingly big!</p></div>		</li>

<p>And that's assuming it were traveling in its direction, which neither of them are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you said current speed, but just so everyone knows, the thing is going 17 km/s... That's roughly 38,000 mph, the earth is almost 25,000 miles in circumference. So every hour it would circle the earth almost 1 and half times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A day and a half <em>round trip</em>.  After travelling for 39 years, both spacecraft are still less than 1 light day from home.  </p>
<p>But Voyager 1 <em>is</em> officially in interstellar space, so that's cool.  There was some doubt in the early years whether it would reach the heliopause before the RTG (nuclear power source) was exhausted.  Fortunately, it made it with about 10 years to spare.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep. They are both on the edge of our solar system (plus or minus).</p>

<p>Nope, because they aren't go fast enough to reach another star while still operational.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons#Timeline" target="_blank">New Horizons</a> will also end it's life in the outer areas of the solar system and perhaps just beyond that edge but not any further. It will also <a href="http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/081706.php" target="_blank">not pass Voyager I</a>.</p></div>		</li>
