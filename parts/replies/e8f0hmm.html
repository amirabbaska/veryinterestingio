<p>But could you please ELI5 the waterfall vs agile styles? I didn't understand them fully. Not being a native speaker doesn't help...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Waterfall is the &quot;traditional&quot; way of doing a project.   Basically, you lock in all the requirements for the application before any work starts.  Once you have the requirements detailed, the developers start writing their code until the application meets all of the requirements that were specified.  Then the software is released for use more or less in its final form, with the exception of maintenance work (bug fixes, minor enhancements).    </p>
<p>Once one release is done, the cycle starts over for the next major release.    This is most often seen in larger software packages.....for example, Office 2010, vs Office 2013, vs Office 2016.    </p>
<p>Agile's main difference is that the requirements can change during development, and the software is never truly &quot;final&quot;, there are always major changes to the software in the works at any given time.    Users get a regular stream of updates to the app.    This is often how mobile apps are developed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not a correct description of waterfall. it says (1) lock in requirements, (2) start writing code.</p>
<p>Fact #1 - the waterfall process involves writing requirements, then external design, then internal design, THEN coding, then testing, etc. In strict waterfall (yes, there's more than one way to do waterfall), you complete one phase and get it signed off on before you begin the next phase.</p>
<p>Part of the point is that, if you change something that affects a phase, you need to back to that phase and finish it again.</p>
<p>Fact #2 - there are many, many more ways to develop software than waterfall and agile. The agile community likes to refer to waterfall as &quot;what you're doing if you're not doing agile&quot;, but that's not right in any sense. Agile came after at least a dozen other ways of organizing software work, many of which had similar hype, and none of which are now the beloved buzzword of the industry that Agile is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah thank you! Everything is clear now.</p>
<p>Also, if I want to join the gaming industry, what should i do? Do you have any advice? I'm still in high-school, actually the top mathematically and informatically oriented high-school in my country, and university is most likely next, but I'm thinking about game development pretty seriously. Could you help? Or redirect me somewhere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Waterfall is a bunch of nerdy engineers with pocket protectors using PowerPoint and meetings to plan software, write it, and then go back to it over and over to fix the errors they didn't realize were present. They occasionally dub one fix with a new name and sell it again. </p>
<p>Agile is a bunch of millennials in shorts and over-ear headphones using markers and whiteboards to plan software, write it, and then go back to it over and over to fix errors while they're writing it, in order to introduce new errors so the process can continue. They release fixes all the time, and the software is only abandoned when the last programmer or client loses interest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Waterfall is doing the initial draft of your book, giving it to your editor, who then points out all the inconsistencies and stuff, then gives it back to you to redo parts of. When you make those changes, you give it back to the editor, and they tell you about any new inconsistencies you added.</p>
<p>Agile is like handing over chapter-by-chapter to your editor, and they check it while you plan the next chapter out, so you can make sure it fits with the previous stuff that has already been edited.</p>
<p>Or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The partially-true but incomplete short answer is yes, but the full answer's kinda long and boring. </p>
<p>Skills change over time, and mine aligned nicely with business and strategy... and that stuff pays better even though customers for it can be hard to find. </p>
<p>There's the cleverness of fixing a big, and the cleverness of figuring out how to make a business and IT team really work together. I specialize in that piece, and it's really personally rewarding when it works.</p>
