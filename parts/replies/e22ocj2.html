			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the actual answer. They chose not to opt-in to Medicare, and were able to establish viable alternative payment routes that medical providers are (typically) not going to be able to swing. If a medical provider chose not to sign a contract with Medicare (or other insurance payors), they would be able to charge what they wanted on a cash basis (you see this some with concierge medicine) or join an independent physician's network.</p>
<p>Vision plans work similarly.</p></div>		</li>
