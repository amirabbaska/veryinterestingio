			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not fair to say. We have no reason to believe that for any radial vector from a given point, there is the same mass in the forward direction is backwards. And that is really what you're saying.</p>
<p>The comment you replied to said that these forces are basically zero. You said it's a big deal that they basically cancel out. While there surely is some cancellation, we have no reason to believe there is that much of it. We are not in the center of the universe. If the forces were not already basically zero, then even the modest cancellations you could reasonably expect would not be enough to produce extant results.</p>
<p>So basically while you're right that cancellation is a thing, the cancellation is fundamentally unimportant and doesn't even cancel completely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an asymmetrical universe where we might perceive ourselves to be at &quot;the edge&quot; of space, all those very close to 0, but not exactly 0 gravitational values would result in very different large scale (pan-galactic) dynamics. My point is simply that even the butterfly level effects that such gravitational bias might introduce is muted further by the fairly even distribution of mass that our universe exhibits.</p>
<p>Oh, and we are at the &quot;center&quot; of the universe, but then, from what we know, any given point can be considered the center.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no thats not true. There is a mass center point of the universe. however there wont be a giant black hole forming there, because space is constantly expanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you put the gravitational pull of a star on a graph, it would be an asymptote, right? Getting infinitely closer to 0 but never quite reaching it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, essentially every other star in the universe's effect on every other star is on that asymptote, essentially non-existant. Excluding binary star systems, and odd scenarios like that.</p></div>		</li>
