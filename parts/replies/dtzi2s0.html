			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do almost all cd/dvd/blu-ray/game consoles require the disc to go in in a specific direction?</p>
<p>The reader uses some kind of lens or other scanner, and it saves space to have it only one side. It's also cheaper that way.</p>
<p>Many have improved to take it in any direction face up, but plenty still ignore upside down. </p>
<p>Which means that, by putting the onus on the user to place the object in question in correctly, they can produce readers that are cheaper and take less space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the UK, notes can go in either way up. But most vending machines are cash only, as we have one pound and two pound coins. Newer ones accept card payments, so I expect note payment will never be common, but can be found in self-service checkouts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cost.  Just because the available tech improves, doesn't mean it's adopted.  For instance, a reader with a lens on top that requires the bill to be oriented a certain way would be cheaper than a lens with 2 lenses that can look at both sides.</p>
<p>So the question becomes, is making the bill reader more convenient going to make enough money for it to be worth it.  Have you ever walked away from a vending machine because you could only put the bill in face up?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in the UK and the readers have improved in some places. You can put a note in anyway up and with some slight wrinkles and it'll accept it. It's like they've turned the sensitivity down. However, our new plastic notes don't wrinkle as much so that's no longer a problem. It'll get to a point where you could just put a note shaped piece of paper in there and it would be like, &quot;Yep, fair game.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
