<p>Similar case in Holland, someone was looking online for an antique clock and saw one that looked identical to the one he had next to him.  In this case he contacted the police, then &quot;bought&quot; it, and the police caught the thieves when they came to get it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is really similar to how theft-rings work for normal merchandise as well.</p>
<p>They will post items up for sale (Ebay is the most common) and when it sells they'll hit up the store and steal it then ship it out.</p>
<p>When I worked at Lowe's we had a list of common stuff that this was done with, for us it was largely Dyson vacuums.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow I think I came across one of these recently on Kijiji! I was researching an expensive baby stroller and saw a &quot;brand new&quot; one on Kijiji for like half the price. It seemed too good to be true, and when I messaged the seller he made it sound like they had multiple strollers and mentioned shipping it. I responded to ask if they do pick up (as I was afraid it was a scam) and he never wrote back. It didn't occur to me that they may be selling stolen goods. I thought it was just a scam to get people's money and ship no products out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing that with an actual product, obtained for free by theft, they can maintain a high seller rating and maintain this scam long term, vs doing it one-and-done vendor scam style</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because if they shipped nothing they'd get shut down.</p>
<p>By shipping the product they can look like a legitimate seller on Ebay. They aren't doing this as a one-off.... a lot of these guys (the more experienced at least) are doing this for a living. They need to keep selling to keep earning.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Typically, for paintings like that, the painting and the frame are not really an original pairing, so it's doesn't so much matter if they are separated.</p>
<p>As far as the cutting, you just attach the remaining canvas to a new set of stretcher bars, resulting in a half inch or so reduction in size on each side, not at all something noticeable for a larger work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the Vermeer was on a shopping list. I don't know about the others, and it has been pointed out that more valuable works were passed up. Neither the Vermeer nor the Frinck were cut but they are smallish paintings. The Rembrandts were large (63 by 50 inches and 52 by 43 inches) which I think would explain some why they were cut.</p></div>		</li>
