			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol. I think I read in a study once that although we may prefer our perceived reflections, friends and family tend to prefer the &quot;mirrored&quot; version of ourselves that we aren't used to. I think they rated them as more attractive. Weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's opposite for me. When I see real me in a picture or in an angled mirror I see myself as I actually look. I hate regular mirrors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mirror is part of it (actually a big part)</p>
<p>But lighting, lens focal length and a number of other camera related bits and pieces can affect it too.</p>
<p>When i worked for a newspaper, I had to shoot a subject a few times, and she was rather difficult with which pictures she would allow published.</p>
<p>The last shoot i did with her i took a whole bunch of pics, enough that she wouldnt catch on with what i intended to do.</p>
<p>She went off for her tour around the site we were at with her pr people and a few journalists, and i processed a few photos to send then approached her as she was leaving to double check she was happy with the pics i had selected (not really, but she bought it)</p>
<p>What i had done was selected the best 4 pics, and then flipped them  (and added R at the end of the filename) </p>
<p>She picked the 4 mirror image pics as her favorite, and the PR people all selected the correct ones.
After i showed them what i had done, they were all rather suprised.</p>
<p>(All pics were taken with a 1DX, 70-200 and speedlite in a small softbox)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not the issue at all. Find a photo of yourself that you think exemplifies how you look badly in photographs, open it and flip it. Still looks bad for the same reason.</p>
<p>Probably 99% it's the focal length that is giving people this issue.</p></div>		</li>
