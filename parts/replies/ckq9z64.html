			<div class="markdown"><p>They got more than a slap on the wrist. They got <em>creamed</em> by the EU. They had to provide a choice of browsers, and more importantly Microsoft started looking over their shoulder because the EU <em>kept coming after them</em>. Why do you think that IE has plummeted from 98% of all browsers to now something like (from memory) 20%? Even Windows on the desktop has dropped somewhat. You've now got countries all over Europe mandating non-Microsoft OSes (mostly Linux) for government sites.</p>
<p>Even in the US, the anti-trust lawsuit basically proved that Microsoft had broken the law. And then, at the very last minute... the government blinked. Having <em>won</em>, the &quot;monopolies are good&quot; faction of the government managed to take over, and not only did they not impose any meaningful penalties on MS, but the penalty they did impose actually <em>helped entrench the Microsoft monopoly further</em>. I don't quite remember the details, I'd have to look it up, but the penalty was something like &quot;you have to sell twenty thousand Windows licences at cost to schools&quot; or something. That's twenty thousand more Windows users. Great.</p>
<p>It's like they found an accountant guilty of tax avoidance, and as punishment they reduced his tax rate for the next ten years.</p>
<p>Thank goodness the EU actually believes in free market <em>competition</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea what you are trying to say.</p>
<p>The US gov is not just <em>able to</em> prosecute, they <em>actually did</em>. Then having proven their case, and being in a position of being able to do anything up to and including splitting Microsoft apart (there was real significant talk about splitting the OS and application suite parts of the company apart), they didn't even give them a slap on the wrist.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the EU also went after Microsoft, and a few years later they too proved that MS had been engaged in criminal behaviour, but <em>unlike the US government</em> they hit MS with real penalties and forced a real change in corporate behaviour. I don't know how much MS have &quot;learned their lesson&quot;, but it doesn't matter so long as they believe that the EU is still watching them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are good points, but I'm pretty sure the main reason that IE use has dropped so drastically is how much IE sucks, combined with the fact that better alternatives now exist, such as Chrome and Firefox. </p></div>		</li>

<p>should be:  &quot;combined with the fact that better alternatives are now allowed to co-exist on the windows platform.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IE sucked a long time ago. Firefox was around for a long time, and was <em>much</em> better than IE, and still hardly anyone used it. You <em>couldn't use</em> Firefox if you wanted to do online banking, or deal with government web sites, or even an awful lot of commercial websites that assumed that IE was the only browser that people would use, so they wrote code for IE. </p>
<p>And you know what? They were right (in the sense of correct, not in the sense of doing good). IE had something like a 97% market share, and there was simply no way that Opera or Firefox or Konquorer could compete against that in the open market, no matter how much better they were (and they were ALL much, much better that IE) because you couldn't use them, you had to use IE or you would miss out on half the internet.</p>
<p>I know because I was one of the 3% who made a conscious decision to miss out on half the internet rather than use Windows and IE. I've been using Linux effectively exclusively for over 15 years, and I work with people who have been doing so for closer to 25. There's no IE for Linux.</p>
<p>It was only after the EU forced Microsoft to offer Firefox, and European governments started mandating and rolling out tens of thousands of non-IE browsers, that websites started taking the idea of browser-independence seriously again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can the justice system prove they are acting as a cartel?  That is illegal also.<br />
I understand the whole lobby thing and that Comcast is most likely spending millions of dollars to persuade the right people to get this merger done...but how can 2 companies not competing with each other and essentially forming a cartel go unnoticed? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much all of the cable companies are one big cartel -- it's not that nobody <em>knows</em> what they're doing, it's a matter of whether or not the government will <em>do</em> anything about it. Keep in mind that cable companies <del>pass out money</del> provide simply <em>absurd</em> amounts of campaign contributions to politicians via their lobbying efforts, and that the current head of the FCC used to be the cable lobby's head honcho. </p>
<p>Put simply, they would not invest all of that money if it did not have a significant and measurable effect on the decision-making process of the members of government who -- in theory -- are there to represent the best interest of the American people. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best TL;DR ever.<br />
I remember when we had to take mandatory cartel training at my job and one of the &quot;scenarios&quot; given was where a sales rep was offered a cartel arrangement and the rep went to her legal team and asked them to report the other rep.<br />
If only real life worked that way...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're only a cartel if they're purposefully colluding in order to keep prices artificially high.  Proving that is difficult, especially when it makes a lot of good business sense just not to compete against one another naturally.  </p>
<p>Cable providers who are first to a neighborhood and lay down the line have a significant advantage on late comers who basically have to rent those lines from the first provider.  Because of that, it makes a lot more business sense to focus on new markets and markets you already control then getting into markets where providers already are. </p>
<p>In this case, allowing the government to take ownership of the line and charge each cable provider a flat rate probably makes the most sense. </p></div>		</li>
