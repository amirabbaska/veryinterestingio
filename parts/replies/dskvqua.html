<p>the oculomotor nerve only innervates the levator palpebrae superioris muscle in the eyelid, one of a couple muscles that open the eye. the orbicularis oculi muscle, the only muscle able to close the eye, is innervated by the facial nerve. oculomotor palsy will only give you ptosis of the eye with difficulty fully opening the eyes, but you will still be able to fully blink (close eyes).</p></div>		</li>
