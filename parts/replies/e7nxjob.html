<p>Above is the same car during the season without the camouflage. You can see the curves significantly easier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I looked at a bunch of pictures of car camouflage and it left me feeling uncomfortable? Is that because my brain doesn’t like the strange designs or because it looks so abnormal? I’m confused </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect it’s not because the designs are “abnormal” or “unnatural” (because what does “natural” even mean in the context of cars) but rather because your brain is having a really difficult time interpreting what you’re seeing into a cohesive mental image.</p>
<p>The camouflage was designed to interrupt your interpretation of the object in 3D space and it’s being successful - your brain is unhappy with being unable to process things properly, which is probably the source of your discomfort as unsettled feeling.</p></div>		</li>
