			<div class="markdown"><p>For a reasonably serious look at the history of cancer and treatment, I would really recommend the book &quot;The Emperor of all Maladies: A Biography of Cancer&quot;, by Siddhartha Mukherjee which is fantastic. It charts the study of cancer, cancer treatment, and societal attitudes (including to things like lead petrol and smoking, and charity fundraising) from the Ancient Egyptians, up to the modern day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all cancers have the same underlying pathologies, and they don't respond to the same therapies.  However, there are some that have &quot;most common&quot; things we can target.  Efforts have been targeted toward &quot;most common&quot; so that the greatest number of people can benefit.  If you have the same sub-type of cancer that 80% of other people have, you're lucky, because people have done way more research for you.  If you're the poor bastard with something that's only been reported in like 2 other case reports, then there probably hasn't been as much work done for you.</p>
<p>Essentially it comes down to limits for funding, time, manpower, and our own knowledge.  We'll likely never be able to save every single person that gets cancer.  But we can push those numbers as close to 100% as we can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, it’s impossible for there to be one universal “cure“ for cancer, because there are hundreds of different manifestations of cancer.<br />
Some of them are similar enough that research on one applies to others, but in many cases, each one basically has to be treated as a totally unique disease. That slows research down tremendously.<br />
So they mostly focus on the most common kinds of cancer, which means if you’re unlucky and get some obscure and poorly understood form of cancer, you have much lower chances of surviving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say I discover something that will save 3/4 people with a certain cancer where previously, only 20% (1/5) survived. Let's say I have 100 people with that cancer. For the 20 who survived anyway, it is obsolete. Of the remaining 80 I save 3/4, or 60. Now the survival rate is 20+60, or 80. </p>
<p>Then let's say I make another discovery that saves 3/4 people. Now, it is obsolete on 80 of my 100 people. Of the 20 left, I save 15.</p>
<p>The first discovery changed the survival rate 60%. The second one was just as effective but it only raised it 15% because it was only applicable to a fraction of the original patients</p>
<p>Tldr: if 2 inventions save 50% of people each, the first will save 50% of people and the second will save 25% (50% of the remaining people). The third will save 17.5% and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s pretty incredible. In the 50s, about one in ten survived, and just 50 years later, that statistic completely flipped. Nine out of ten surviving.<br />
Honestly, the rate at which technology has improved in the last 50-100 years in general is pretty amazing. We made more technological progress in a ten-year span than previous societies made in 100.</p></div>		</li>
