<p>There are some plans of building a floating city on Venus' clouds. Really interesting idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends a lot on the planet sizes, but if you start doing co-orbital planets, you can fit 42 planets on the same orbit. Our Solar system has 6 habitable orbits that can exist for an earth size planet: so 252 planets.</p>
<p>It gets weirder if you start with bigger suns and/or smaller planets: <a href="https://planetplanet.net/2017/05/03/the-ultimate-engineered-solar-system/" target="_blank">https://planetplanet.net/2017/05/03/the-ultimate-engineered-solar-system/</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought, by definition, that would make them non-planets since they have not cleared their own orbital path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The long term stability of such systems is at best questionable and it is unclear how such a system could really form. Additionally I am not aware of any systems discovered with multiple coorbiting planets except for a couple of systems with one. So to be realistic I would say that a star like our sun cannot support much more than 10 planets in the habitable zone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Kind of crazy, and one random comet or meteor perturbing an orbit and the system turns into Hungry Hungry Hippos, but it's certainly a theoretical maximum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like the diagram is suggesting that you can cut the temperature of the star in half and only reduce the &quot;starlight on planet&quot; by about 30%. Is that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The luminosity of a star depends on two things:</p>
<p>It's surface temperature, created by the internal fusion process inside of it.</p>
<p>And it's radius, so a star with the same temperature but with larger radius will be brighter.</p>
<hr />
<p>What you're seeing on the graph is not the absolute luminosity of a star, that is, it's total real luminosity in LOs, but percentages based off on the luminosity of &quot;a&quot; star.</p>
<p>What that means is that you have 60% of the luminosity of a star (Doesn't matter the class) on that specific region, because the inverse-square law doesn't change with temperature. </p>
<p>The chart is not using distance for that reason, it's a generalized one, since the size drastically changes, and it wouldn't be viable making a chat like that.</p>
<hr />
<p>Red Dwarfs are so faint you can't see them with your naked eye, even tho they make about 70% of stellar population, while the sun in a G-Class Yellow Dwarf, much brighter. So you need to keep that in mind when doing charts like this, that it's not to scale most of the time, and sometimes, doesn't include distances, only ratios.</p></div>		</li>
