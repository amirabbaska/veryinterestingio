			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand this further, consider that to massless particles traveling at the speed of light, time does not pass.  Could a photon observe the passage of time, one emitted from a distant star 1.2 billion light years away would have <em>zero</em> time pass from when it was emitted until it hits our upper atmosphere (and slows a bit).  </p>
<p>Meanwhile of course other bits of the universe had other amounts of time pass; in this case, 1.2 billion years would have passed on earth.</p></div>		</li>
