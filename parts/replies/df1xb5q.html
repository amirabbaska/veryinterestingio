			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, some are saying Congress would have to pass a law to enact term limits. While it's true that Congress would have to be the ones to make the change, what they'd actually need to do is pass a constitutional amendment, because right now the Constitution says if you meet certain age and residency requirements, you're in.  You'd need two-thirds approval by the House and Senate, then approval from 3/4 of the state legislatures to make the change, a lot more work than a simple law.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not a <em>lot</em> of time.  Five years.  So two and a half terms for a Representative and 5/6ths of a term for a Senator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the absolute minimum time in which one could possibly qualify, but that only applies if you're 62 or older, which admittedly is a lot of them.  Otherwise it takes 20 or more years of service to get a full pension.  If you get elected to the Senate at age 32 and serve one term, you're still gonna have to pay your way through life.  If you get elected at age 62 and serve one term, you're all set, but then again, anyone who has a 62 year history that's impressive enough to get elected to the Senate probably has worked hard their whole life, so that feels less like mooching off the tax payer to me. Still a sweet deal, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>5 years of service at a salary of $174,000 per year is a pension of (approximately) $8,700 per year.  Congress gets the same pension as Federal Employees.  Average Highest 3 years of salary <em> 1% </em> years of service (there are a few variations to the formula).</p></div>		</li>
