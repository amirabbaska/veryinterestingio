			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you have the most complete answer, a very satisfactory answer at that. I would also add  numbers to this. An internal combustion engine, as far as I know, has a theoretical efficiency upper limit of around 37%. The true efficiency of most of these is at most 20%. I believe most power plants operating a conventional steam cycle are at around 33-39% actual efficiency, correct me if I'm wrong. From what I understand, the 20% actual efficiency of an internal combustion engine is partly due to trade-offs in the design to make it accelerate quickly at low speed, along other design considerations that make it user friendly.</p>
<p>Another point is that now there are power plants that run multiple cycles to capture even more energy, bringing their actual efficiency to the 60-70% range. Some even go as high as <del>97% (but these are highly specialized, only 4 manufacturers of the required specialty parts operate in the US).</del> EDIT: Can't find a source for that claim. I thought it was something in Denmark?</p>
<p>Also, just to nitpick (for science), I believe in a steam engine in a power plant, the enthalpy of the steam is used to drive the gas turbine, not just its pressure.</p>
<p>Source: most of this is readily available (even on wikipedia). I'm also a chemical engineer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is for Combined Heating and Power. Not really a heat-to-electricity efficiency. 60% is about the maximum thermal efficiency with current technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Gothenburg, Sweden we have a waste burning facility thst generate distributed heat and also electricity. Supposedly having 95% efficency. The chimney has fans at the bottom to blow the exhaust out because it is so devoid of heat it doesnt ascend on its own</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This must have been debunked or I am remembering it wrong, sorry. I had remembered reading about combined cycle cogeneration in Denmark reaching 97% efficiency, but either it was debunked or I can't find it sorry. I did find some claims of up to 80% efficiency on wikipedia but those sources are bad links. It did mention they used their waste heat for heating homes and melting the ice on the roads etc. in the area, hence such high efficiency. So maybe?</p>
<p>TL;DR I don't remember where I got this number and could very likely be wrong. Sorry.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>How can enthalpy exert a force on a turbine blade without acting via pressure somehow?  Isn't the actual physical force on the turbine blades the result of a pressure difference between one side of the blade and the other?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I meant by that is that not only pressure drops due to work, but temperature is decreased, and the steam approaches its dew point. This is to say that we draw more energy with a turbine than we do with a piston, because as the gas passes through the turbine it not only does work but it also cools significantly and loses energy that way. In contrast, in a piston, the gas is still very hot when the piston is fully extended and the exhaust stroke begins.
BUT you are correct in saying that the force ON the turbine is pressure from the gas (P=F*A). I wasn't trying to say that you are wrong there.
EDIT: I guess I'm picturing it like first the gas expands against the turbine blades and rotates it while moving down it, where the turbine blades are a different shape and extract MORE energy from the gas by cooling it. Isothermal expansion and then adiabatic expansion. This isn't exactly how it works, a real turbine doesn't have two distinct stages, but it's a way to visualize it. This is according to my college profs. I could be wrong though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC enthalpy is more of a conceptualization to help in accounting of energy in energy balances. </p>
<p>H=U+dP*V </p>
<p>I.e. internal energy + the change in pressure times volume. However, to answer your question, Unless it is something physically verifiable such as pressure, temperature, mass, etc, then it is most likely derived or a conceptualization of empirical data. </p>
<p>So yes, pressure is what physically drives the blades. However, it is/can be all interconnected which is where concepts like enthalpy come in handy. </p></div>		</li>
