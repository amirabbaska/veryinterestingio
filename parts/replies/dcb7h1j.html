<p>It isn't illegal to be stupid or greedy.</p>
<p>If you break the <em>law</em>, you're held accountable by the government.</p>
<p>Incidentally, another problem with the whole financial crisis was that it was very hard to prove wrongdoing in a lot of cases; remember, to find someone guilty of some crime, you must prove <em>beyond reasonable doubt</em> that they committed a crime.</p>
<p>In a lot of cases, the &quot;criminal activity&quot; in question was questionable bond ratings - basically, how &quot;safe&quot; a bond was. The problem is that a lot of the questionable bond ratings were a result of over-inflated valuation of real estate and the idea that real estate values could only go up - basically, even if low-quality mortgage buyers defaulted on their loans, you'd just be able to sell the house to someone else and possibly make even <em>more</em> money as the price of the house had gone up in the interim.</p>
<p>You had a very good argument that you were simply rating the bonds according to the present market, and a <em>lot</em> of people simply believed that real estate prices were going nowhere but up. (This is a well-documented fact, incidentally - the people who realized that the market was over-inflated made a bunch of money when the market tanked, but most people were blissfully unaware and/or thought that the bubble was far from bursting).</p>
<p>To find guilt of fraud in such cases, you'd have to prove <em>beyond reasonable doubt</em> that the person in question <em>knew</em> that the bonds were riskier than they rated them at the time that they rated them.</p>
<p>This is (obviously) not something which is easily done, doubly so when a lot of these people could have made a lot of money with that knowledge by betting against the mortgages.</p>
<p>A lot of the people who went to jail outside of the US were involved in other, much more blatant forms of fraud - in Iceland, for instance, the banks basically created fake loans to each other to make it look like they had more money than they did. It was very clear that the loans were fake and so when they were discovered, the people went to jail for it.</p>
<p>But bond ratings is basically a form of risk evaluation and is much more nebulous. It is much harder to prove that someone was actively behaving in a criminal manner as opposed to simply being as stupid as everyone else in the market.</p>
<p>The VW thing is the government, because they clearly and deliberately broke the law and lied about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a dilemma about the ratings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are you rating them according to vague, subjective, &quot;holistic&quot; criteria? <em>&quot;We had a meeting with the CEO and he seemed like a really awesome and credible guy, very confident etc so even if the finances are a bit poor we will give a good rating&quot;</em>? That's quite... problematic.</p>
</li>
<li>Are you rating them according to set, public, mathematical criteria? Well, that opens up for gaming the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>It has to be one or the other, or somewhere on a degree between them. Subjective is bad, mathematical is bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The SEC was, and is, fully empowered to bring criminal charges and prosecution thanks to the 2002 Sarbanes Oxley Act (aka SOX).</p>
<p>The fact that bankers, investment banks, credit agencies, and auditors were not brought up on criminal charges by the SEC under SOX is a testament to how effective the financial industry has been at neutering the SEC, Financial Regulations, and engaged in 'regulatory capture.'</p>
<p>The is a reason Goldman Sachs nickname is 'Government Sachs.'</p>
<p>Fun Fact - Trump just announced his fifth appointment of a Goldman Sachs banker to his administration today.</p>
<p>EDIT: for more on SOX see my long comment waaay below.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true, lots of laws were broken by bankers. See, for example, <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/03/david-dayen-out-of-control-new-report-exposes-jpmorgan-chase-as-mostly-a-criminal-enterprise.html" target="_blank">this list</a>. The difference is that the climate of opinion among U.S. prosecutors, particularly at the SEC, has shifted away from criminal prosecution of individuals for financial fraud toward imposition of penalties on the firms. So all of those huge, multi-billion dollar settlements between that banks and the U.S. government were in lieu of prosecution. Much of this is based on a calculation, of whether it is the <em>organization</em> that needs to be deterred, and its shareholders hit (in which case fines), or specific individuals within those organizations (in which case criminal prosecution). For better or for worse, the gov't decided to go after the organizations in the wake of the financial crisis.</p>
<p>With VW a couple things are different. First of all, it's a German company, and the exec being prosecuted is German. U.S. gov't is much harsher in treatment of foreigners than citizens. Second, it may be the sector, because criminal prosecution of individuals in cases of corporate misconduct was pioneered in the auto sector (vs. Ford). Third, they may think this has greater deterrent value. Fourth, the nature of the crime is such that it may have been a relatively small number within the firm who knew about it, which means it makes less sense to pursue the organization as a whole. These are just some speculations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank god some people on here have sense. Everyone keeps saying they did nothing illegal. It's frightening to me that people believe that. </p>
<p>No, they did plenty of illegal things and at the precipice of the crash it seems pretty evident that plenty of people knew what was coming. They simply just knew how to circumvent laws that would put any one person in jail.</p>
<p>There's also the fact that politicians are corrupt as hell and like to protect people giving them money.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading these comments was depressing. Seeing such a large crisis come about due solely to corrupt and greedy people breaking laws, only to have all the top comments be &quot;no laws were broken!&quot; is seriously depressing. If &quot;liberal&quot; reddit is going to have such idiotic comments be the top-voted comments, how in the world would anyone expect the next such crisis to be averted? No one cares, and we even excuse them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's naive and untrue, it's very complicated, but here is one passage from the article below:</p>
<p>&quot;Larry Thompson became known for his memo, but back in the Clinton administration, the deputy attorney general Eric Holder laid out his own memo for strengthening corporate prosecutions. But he undermined his own words by also explaining that prosecutors needed to take into account the collateral economic consequences. In testimony in front of the Senate in March, Holder, who is now the U.S. attorney general, seemed to lament the position government enforcers had found themselves in. “I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if we do prosecute — if we do bring a criminal charge — it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy.” Holder quickly walked back the remarks. Soon after, Lanny Breuer returned to Covington &amp; Burling as a vice chairman.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that is relevant to the question. That quote is about the impact of prosecuting (and potentially shutting down) <em>institutions</em>. That concern does not arise when prosecuting individual bankers. The other explanations here about the difficulties in proving the necessary elements of fraud are more relevant for individuals, I think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree with you, but you are certainly able to conduct your own analysis. Corporations also escaped the criminal penalties, not just individuals. Maybe consider criminal RICO prosecutions in other entity contexts (as opposed to gang). </p></div>		</li>
