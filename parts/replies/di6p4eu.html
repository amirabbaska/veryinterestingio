			<div class="markdown"><p>Also they totally do get hurt. </p>
<p>I've seen pictures of weathered <em>old</em>(3 weeks old...) houseflies with dented eyeballs and bent/broken/missing wings and limbs. People just don't notice this because they're small and fast and already kinda clumsy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not into windows though. Always full speed ahead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how I always kill them. They annoy the fuck out of me as nothing else can, and it's pretty satisfying, but if the wall is too far away they can manage to slow down before impact. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth pointing out the square-cube law that makes any fly-sized organism much stronger than its human-sized analog.  Inertia at a given velocity scales with the cube of size, holding density constant, whereas strength scales in proportion to the square.  Scale that shit down fam.  Boom.  Indestructible flies, strong ants, super gymnast fleas, etc. </p></div>		</li>
