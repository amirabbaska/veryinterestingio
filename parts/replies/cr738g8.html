			<p>But why not make that default message the ad itself. So if the ad failed to load, or was blocked, it would just be an image of the ad. I use adblock and dont want to see them, but if i owned a website and made my money of ads, if it were possible id love to be able to charge advertisers extra for &quot;unblockable ad space&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>Because then they would need to change the hard code every single time the ad changes.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm with you on this. That space could be monetized. It would just need to be handled differently. Sell unblocked ads that don't change often. You could find companies willing to pay to have their advert under the blockable adverts. Maybe sell the space on a weekly or monthly basis.</p>		</li>

			<p>It would be extremely hard to sell that space.  First off, you can't really estimate inventory.  Secondly, you would have to find a very small advertiser who would buy it (big companies wouldn't even bother). For all the time you spent trying to get the small advertiser, you wouldn't even break even.  Thirdly, as mentioned before, you'd have to hardcode it.  Developers are in demand everywhere and it wouldn't be worth their time.</p>		</li>

			<p>Or use it for internal advertising. Advertise the website itself, or other parts of it.</p>		</li>

			<p>it is easy to block pretty much everything with an addblocker and here  is how. <br><br>most add blockers come with a list of domain names that is know to serve adds. <br><br>example would be www.addsfromhere.com or something like that.<br><br>in this list it is probably listed as <em> .addsfromhere.com/ </em> and would there for block everything from that domain. &lt;-- this is the simple version. <br><br>so if sites would change and preload adds for sites they would have to putt the adds somewhere right ? <br><br>so it would look something like this. <br><br>www.site.com/adds/image.jpg as example. <br><br>all you would have to do is to add a new filter that looked like this. www.site.com/adds/* and it would be blocked again.  <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>First of all, <em>ads</em>.<br><br>But to your point, the website doesn't have to call the domain ads, they could call it anything. That means that the adblocker would need to know the name of every location for every website. I think that's a lot more work than they want to do.<br><br>They could even store the ads in www.site.com/images... along with their normal pictures.</p>		</li>

			<p>[Heres the most common Adblock list] (<a href="https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist.txt" target="_blank">https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist.txt</a>). As you can see most of them have the word &quot;ad&quot; in them, but some don't. <br><br>The problem with storing it in their own files along with other images is that it could accidentally just show a random image from the folder instead of an actual ad. Not gonna get anyone to pay for ad space that might not even load an ad. <br><br>Chances are it would be put into a folder with an easy to find name like something with the word ad in it. Boom, blocked by Adblock again. </p>		</li>

			<p>Why do you think there's only one solution to every problem?<br><br>    jQuery(document).ready(function () {<br>        if (jQuery('div.ad-zone').height() &lt;= 0)) {<br>            jQuery('body').html(null);<br>        }<br>    }<br><br>:\^)</p>		</li>

			<p>I think you're thinking of an ad as a single image...in reality the ad images are always changing because they are from the advertisement host. How can you make the default image multiple different images? That makes no sense. <br><br>It's not like a newspaper where, for example, Bill's Landscaping wants to put his ad (which is one image) in your newspaper. Advertising platforms use hundreds of different landscaping companies that are always changing, and adblock blocks the host that all of these advertising companies are stored. You, as the website owner, would only be able to put one ad.</p>		</li>

			<p>I may be misunderstanding you, but I think that's a lot trickier than it sounds. For one thing, at scale it's quite a bit of extra bandwidth and storage for the host to take on. The site needs to download the ad (which may be bulky video, flash, etc) to its own server, then deliver it to the user. And if you're using a caching server, like Varnish, that's going to be a lot of cache misses when each viewer gets a different set of ads. <br><br>The bigger problem, though, is accounting. The ad network needs (wants) to know a great deal of information about the viewer. In the first model, they collect that information themselves. In the second, they're relying on the site to provide that info. The site can tell the ad network whatever it wants to, and the ad network has no good way to verify anything because they never talk directly to the browser.    </p>		</li>

			<p>Another solution is perhaps to detect if the a user is using an adblocker. If so, block the content and inform that the user needs to register and pay to see the ad free version.</p>		</li>

			<p>Because the ads have to be clickable and that's what the blocker stops. <br>If it's just a picture there's nothing tracking your view and nothing you can click on for it to report. <br>The whole advertising concept is crap</p>		</li>

			<p>There's a reason advertisers have moved beyond static image ads. They're nearly worthless nowadays. You can't target which users see them. You can't count the impressions, and how can they trust the website owner when he says &quot;we totally had a billion users see that ad, and click on it&quot;? There's a reason so much processing (scripting) goes on behind the scenes nowadays. We're not in the 1990s where you just slapped a banner and made it hotlink to your product or whatever.<br><br>Finally, the vast majority of websites have relatively tiny audiences in the grand scheme of things. Why do you think ad &quot;networks&quot; exist? Small websites band together to present a collective which looks profitable for the advertisers. Your single lone website with your hardcoded image space won't even rate a second glance. Do you have a billion unique IPs visiting a month or something? Don't think so.<br><br>TL;DR That space is worth far less than you think it is. Making money off ads isn't as simple as putting up the image and waiting for the clicks and money to roll in.</p>		</li>
