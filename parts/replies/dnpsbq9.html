			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow first answer, thank you.</p>
<p>Is there a reason for abnormalities within sexes? Such as men with fatter face/extremities, or women with fat stomach rather than hips?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may interested in this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2585758/" target="_blank">journal article summary.</a> There are a lot of factors like age, sex, and genetics. </p>
<p>To answer your first question, let me explain primary and secondary fat storage sites. Primary sites will be the first to store fat. This is usually the stomach and/or hips. Secondary sites is where the fat will go after the primary sites are (for lack of a better term) &quot;full.&quot; </p>
<p>Men with a fatter face or extremities have a lot fat in the secondary sites. This fat is actually easier to lose and will typically &quot;go first&quot; when the weight loss journey begins.</p>
<p>Women with a fat stomach rather than hips could have a hormone imbalance, but it could also be genetic.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't find the article now, but it showed up on Reddit science years and years ago. There was a protein discovered that makes a big difference in how people carry fat. If I remember right, it's prevalence is genetic and it changes whether a person carrying fat holds it in more of a shape or whether is sags more. That might answer part of your question about how it can look different from person to person.</p></div>		</li>
