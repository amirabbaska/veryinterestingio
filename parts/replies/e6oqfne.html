<p>The insulating layer just underneath (dentin) does have some slight self-healing properties but even that has severe limitations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually the dentin itself does not have &quot;self-healing properties&quot;.</p>
<p>The ability to minimize harm  or even restore damaged portions of dentin,  is a function of the pulp , not the dentin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The teeth are normally mineralized with calcium when healthy. When they are exposed to an acid long-term, they develop chalky, white spots (decalcification spots) where the tooth structure is demineralized and has the calcium &quot;removed.&quot; These areas can be remineralized (made healthy again) by the use of a fluoridated toothpaste and fluoride varnish treatment at your regular cleaning appointments. </p>
<p>In addition, the microscopic structure created by fluoride remineralization (fluoroapatite) is strong and more resistant to acid erosion than the calcium-fortified structures (hydroxyapatite).</p></div>		</li>
