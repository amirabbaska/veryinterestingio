			<div class="markdown"><p>Calm down. No, it just does a ton of really dumb searches like &quot;kiddie porn&quot;, which won't put you on any lists for the specific reason that I brought it up in the first place: you're devaluing the information through saturation. Think about how many people have already used it, and how many people have already searched for &quot;kiddie porn&quot; or something similar as a joke. There's no way for the NSA to keep track of that many people, and no value in doing so. They don't find child pornography traffickers from Google searches, they find them through looking for the users on the shady websites, the people who go to the places that are like, three levels deeper than the places those searches take you.</p>
<p>Again, that's the point OP is making. We can devalue the data by saturating the searches with information that isn't useful for anything, and make sure there's too much to sift through to find the useful information.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think maybe an effective strategy might be &quot;anti&quot; searches that attempt to &quot;balance&quot; web requests to obfuscate those otherwise discernible aspects of your profile.</p>
