			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t disagree with that (though I don’t know about whether it is ‘more’ or ‘less’ energy), but the ingestion and initial processing into glucose chains and fatty acids is the great equalizer. Once it’s all there, the original source won’t matter to how much energy is lost from conversion to ATP. It’s all glycolysis and Krebs cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But where does the &quot;lost&quot; energy go?<br />
If it is lost as heat, doesn't that just contribute to body temperature regulation?  </p>
<p>If it gets bound up in useless chemical formulas that the body rejects as waste, then I can see it being &quot;lost&quot; to the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understood it as the amount of energy for the body to actually utilize the food as energy. Taking in 100calories of protein, the body will spend 20-35 calories to convert the food, so your net intake is reduced</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For carbs, you could also eat carbs that are higher in fiber. It doesn't change the efficiency, but it makes less available to burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is effectively reducing carbs though, and it depends on where you live.  In the US fibre counts as a carb on food labels, but in the EU that's not the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, opposite. Some diets subtract the amount of fiber you eat from the carbs to get &quot;Net Carbs.&quot; The idea is that with eating fiber, the food along with it passes through you without fully digesting it. So it's like you never ate it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't fibre cancel out carbs? So if you eat 20 grams of carbs and 15 grams of fiber your body would only digest 5 grams of carbs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other things to consider.  The human body has very poor mechanisms for handling excess sugar, for example, so even if sugar is the most efficient for burning, it doesn't mean you could eat only sugar.</p>
<p>A balanced diet it's the best approach.  Minimize sugar intake, only eating complex carbs.  Eat more fat, and eat more protein.</p></div>		</li>
