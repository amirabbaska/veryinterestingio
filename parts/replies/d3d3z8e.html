			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there are plenty of distinct cars today. Obviously certain styles and models from car manufacturers get trendy and emulated by enough other makers that you do have a lot of clustering similarities. At the moment the Honda Fit kind of defines hatchbacks, the Lexus RX defines crossover SUVs, the BMW 3-series defines entry-level luxury sedans, Ford F150 defines passenger trucks etc.</p>
<p>But there are loads of very distinct stylings. Mustangs, Dodge Chargers are distinctive. Porsche Boxster/ 911 are too. Nissan 370Z. Z4 Roadster. Lamborghini. Benz GT. Acura NSX.</p>
<p>Cars that are made to appeal to mainstream buyers are going to be bland and offensive almost by definition and as a result have non-distinctive features that aren't going to deter anyone from buying it. If you want to sell a car that 90% of the population in a budget-conscious way, you're going to have to have something that 90% of people don't hate. If you're a luxury car maker selling an upscale model, you <em>want</em> to have distinctive, different styling that makes people willing to plunk down a lot more for it. It's OK to make a roadster that 10% of people absolutely love and 30% of people hate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but &quot;most of them styled to look aggressive&quot; does not make them &quot;look the same&quot;. Lots of different appearances can convey the same theme, but they all look different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally I feel that the '94 Dodge Ram defined trucks through the present more than any other pickup truck.  Ford emulated with lowered fenders and both Ford and GM went upscale with their interiors compared to what they previously offered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar to this it's also because the only 70s cars that are maintained and still around/remembered/on TV are the good looking different ones.</p>
<p>No one's gonna keep that 2016 Toyota Camry  or ford fiesta until 2040. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically as far as collectability goes I see them in this order, top to bottom:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two-door pillarless &quot;Hardtops&quot;</li>
<li>Convertibles</li>
<li>Two-door post coupes</li>
<li>Two-door post sedans</li>
<li>Station wagons</li>
<li>Pickup trucks</li>
<li>Full-sized vans</li>
<li>Four-door pillarless &quot;Hardtops&quot;</li>
<li>Four-door sedans</li>
</ul>
<p>This may change as current offerings, mostly lacking in two-door cars, get older, but for the moment that sedan is the bottom of the barrel.  That said I know a lot of people with older four-door cars that they really like, but you'd think from what you see at car shows that everyone was running around in Roadrunners or Mustangs or Trans Ams...</p></div>		</li>
