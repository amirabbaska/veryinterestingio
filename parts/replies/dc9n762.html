			<div class="markdown"><p>I Haven't seen it mentioned yet, but i'm pretty sure urban sprawl is a pretty big reason why the lights are all fucked up across most of America. People build these cities up with no major plan and just do it as they go along, oftentimes they are probably bribed by certain businesses to build the roads in a certain manner that will increase the traffic to a certain business, or increase the property value of a certain parcel of land. You end up in a situation where people dick around while building this stuff over a long enough amount of time and the traffic is completely fucked because it was never designed coherently to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It pisses me off so much that my ride to work is slowed down by an exit ramp that always gets backed up. 95 gets backed up for a few miles and it isn't till you pass that exit that you're home free. I can't understand why nothing has been done about this. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Weve failed as a nation to spend money on roads and spend instead on iraq, Afghanistan,  the military on the federal level, and similar wastes on state and city levels.</p></div>		</li>
