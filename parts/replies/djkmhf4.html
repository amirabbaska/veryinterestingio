<p>I had these symptoms, sick in the morning, and that's what helped me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I have an ulcer and suffer from severe acid reflux. Before I was diagnosed, I felt so nauseous every morning and hated the idea of going to school feeling like that. After about a week on PPIs, I woke up one morning and felt fine. It's been 9 years since I was diagnosed and still occasionally wake up with a stomach ache, but it's nothing compared to ~1 year of 24/7 nausea. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had this as well and never got an overly-detailed explanation but one doctor I asked said it may be due to the fact that stress hormones peak in the early morning hours (which also is the time for the most heart attacks) and, depending on your circadian, I (or you) might just be getting a dump of nauseating adrenaline and cortisol. </p>
<p>Who knows. I'm not a doctor and I don't feel like puking any other time (even when I'm nervous and theoretically have adrenaline going) but maybe he's right and it's just different stress hormones or something. </p></div>		</li>
