			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew out of it, I haven't experienced it since I was a kid, probably. I don't remember it being attached to any emotions, it would just happen that I'd be reading a book and suddenly I'd have the feeling that the objects around me were large and far away. At first it was really interesting, you can stop it by looking around the room for a second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm so glad I found this post cuz I had no idea that this was a thing anyone else had experienced. I've been wanting to explain this feeling to someone for a while but never had the words. Glad to see I'm not the only one!</p></div>		</li>
