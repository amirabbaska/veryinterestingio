			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, under the right pressure and temperature ranges, in different rates. I'm just pointing out how it also applies to metallic liquids. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I mean at any pressure/temperature (so long as it's liquid). If it's a liquid, it's already in &quot;the right ranges&quot; for evaporation to occur, no? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both, depending strongly on the metal and the temperature. </p>
<p>Tungsten has an extremely low vapor pressure even at very high temperatures. On the other hand, zinc and cadmium will sublimate (go directly from solid to gas phase) at low pressures, and have low boiling points for metals even at standard atmospheric pressure. Finally, essentially every metal has very low vapor pressure if you cool it down towards absolute zero, as the available thermal energy drops below the strength of the metallic bonds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you explain your last sentence? If the thermal energy of the environment is less than that required to break the metallic bonds, then the metallic bonds <strong>won't</strong> break, which means no sublimation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It absolutely happens.  Look into tin (or cadmium or whatever)whiskers, formed from metal sublimating and condensing.</p>
<p>It's a big issue for spacecraft, and a big reason people still idea lead solder there.  On earth, less of a problem, but in some applications still a concern.</p></div>		</li>
