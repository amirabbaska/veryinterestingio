			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  In real terms all you are doing is you are making sure the fluid at the top of the straw can no longer push back on the fluid at the bottom of the straw.  You have the pressure of all the atmosphere over the top of the shake pressing down on the shake surface.  That pressure (plus the pressure due to the weight of the shake in between) becomes the pressure at the bottom of the straw.  Now you have pressure at the bottom of the straw, and no pressure at the top of the straw, so it is pushed up!</p>
<p>It's like if instead of a Tug of war, you had a &quot;push&quot; of war, and one side just quit pushing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more akin to removing a heavy weight from the top of a foam pillow or something, and it expanding back to a more neutral volume. </p>
<p>In this case, the heavy weight you're removing is the ambient air pressure, and you're doing it by increasing the volume of your mouth and the straw. This lower pressure allows the ambient pressure pushing down on the surface of the liquid outside the straw to push the liquid up into the straw.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if you had a straw that was the size of the entire cup and left no surface area outside the straw for ambient pressure to push on, you would have a hard time sucking anything up. Imagine sucking on the top of a glass bottle full of soda.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Usually we don't notice this while throwing because our feet have enough traction with the ground to push the other way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This right here is the source of a lot of scientific misunderstandings amongst people, even the scientifically literate. When a phenomenon is not taken into account just because in usual conditions, it's negligible.</p>
<p>It can lead to disasters. Like thinking that water will never stop flowing even as you harvest its energy, that the sea is full of infinite fish, that a species may never go extinct just because of hunting, that pumping a little extra gas in the atmosphere will not make a difference...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you can't. The energy that water in hydro systems gets comes from the sun ultimately. You could have a series of dam/reservoir/dam from source to outlet and you wouldn't stop the flow (unless you had some way to stop rainfall). All you are doing is concentrating that flow at a very specific point (the dam outlet). </p>
<p>Rivers that have been run dry do so typically because water from reservoirs is removed for irrigation and other uses. Not from energy harvest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, you could, but practically it is much harder. To put it another way, converting all the kinetic energy of a unit mass of water is possible but it would be a heck of a challenge to do to a continually-flowing river. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's due to the viscosity of the fluid and the diameter of the straw.  All you can do is reduce the pressure from the 14.7PSIA it is at sea level.</p></div>		</li>
