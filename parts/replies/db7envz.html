<p>Excluding things like the casing an soldering for the pinout (at the very end), can/does all of a CPU chip get constructed using this cycle  you described? Or are there some exceptional steps in there that do something else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty much the basic outline. He's glossing over a lot of the details (a very simple process flow will have 100+ steps at least) but it's not too different.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice, thanks.</p>
<p>The masks used for photo-etching: are they plain old UV or is there something special? I'm not clear how one can achieve 8nm resolution when the wavelength of UV is 10 to 400nm. </p>
<p>And clearly, it's not an acetate paper that's  been photocopied onto. What forms the image on the mask?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What university program or programs would you need to totally understand the idea and physically being able to do each of those processes? Sounds like a mix of computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, materials science, chemical engineering.</p>
<p>If I went to one of the top science schools, is there an academic plan for learning about everything you said?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends what angle you go at it from. If you are just looking at understanding and doing the process itself (especially up to when we create the wafer), I would probably say chemical engineering.</p>
<p>If you are looking at designing the patterns for the photoresists, I would say electrical engineering. </p>
<p>If you are looking at finding newer and better ways to miniaturize the processes with novel materials, material science would probably be the way to go.</p>
<p>As far as there being an academic plan, I only really know from my discipline (electrical engineering). Some upper level electives deal with HDL design, which requires knowledge on how to make chips, so they teach everything I posted, but don't go too in depth as to specific photoresists or silicon purifying methods. I suspect that the actual creation of these processes is done mainly by chemical engineers as an application of broader knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically, there's no one guy that knows the details of the entire process of designing and creating a CPU. It takes the knowledge from a team of people to be able to do it from start to finish.</p>
<p>Or is there a guy out there, basically like Farnsworth or Rick when it comes to knowing how to do every process that would normally take a team of people to do? Some kind of Savant?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So do you just layer silicon wafers on top of each other in order to make cross layer connections/circuits. Because the etchings need to happen on silicon you can't repeat multiple different etchings on the same wafer (?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope.  All of the semiconductor parts are made on 1 layer.  There can be/are many layers of metal added on top to interconnect them all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so 2 questions. What prevents the metal layers from shorting from the overlap and since you need the doped silicon for the transistors all the actual gates are on that first level of silicon?
I'm trying to tie together pictures I've seen with very intricate multi-layer traces (ie: <a href="http://sciencystuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/0000024.jpg" target="_blank">http://sciencystuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/0000024.jpg</a> (source: <a href="http://www.sciencystuff.com/?p=24" target="_blank">http://www.sciencystuff.com/?p=24</a> )) with the concept that it is all one layer of silicon.</p></div>		</li>
