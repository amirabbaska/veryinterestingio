			<div class="markdown"><p>What about things that you recall from a blacked out period at a later date?  What causes these memories to be hidden and suddenly recalled? The later recollection indicates that they were recorded, so is it possible there are multiple mechanisms of memory failure during a blackout?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn’t be a true blackout then. The reason those memories aren’t retrieved until a later date is because the right cue wasn’t triggered until then. It’s the availability vs accessibility argument. It might be available but isn’t currently accessible until the right cue comes along. However, you never really know if a memory is available until you find that cue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a degree of &quot;false memories&quot; where your brain tries to reconstruct what happened based on what people tell you happened. The brain can make any scenario happen as long as it is believable. This is also why rape cases and other high profile cases have to get a police report right away since the testimony can be considered influenced if it is not taken early. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How come people can carry on a conversation and seem to have a reasonable ability to know where they are and what they are doing and then be blacked out the next day?</p>
<p>With no memory encoding they would just be going &quot;where am I?&quot; every few seconds. I get if they were just sitting in the same place but often the blackout involves going to other bars and meeting other people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As previously mentioned, the frontal lobe is the thing that's inhibited when drinking that restricts your ability to encode information. Long term memory and semantic memory (memory for what things mean and in what context) are seated in posterior parts of the brain, which isn't really restricted. Neurocognitive psychology is a very new field, and so we don't have exact understandings of where and how all these constructs work at a biological level, but generally speaking, working memory is in frontal parts of the brain, and long term memory is in the back. All regions play some roles, but there is a lot of redundancy in the brain, so if the frontal lobe is inhibited, we can still get by in some cases.</p>
<p>We can learn a lot better from observing behaviour. If you ask a very drunk person for the last names of all the first line players on their favourite hockey team, as long as you can get them to focus on the task long enough, they are very likely to recall all the names. If you give them a list of the last names of the first line players from a team they have little prior knowledge about, they won't be any good at reciting them back to you.</p>
<p>Also, to your question about &quot;why don't they keep asking where they are&quot;, I have vague recollections of this from lectures, but I think visual and other sensory short term memory have a lot of representation in the rear parts of the brain as well. They have enough short term sensory memory to know where they are and that they aren't just constantly gaining consciousness in the middle of somewhere strange, but the information doesn't really translate past that point to be encoded as memory for retrieval.</p>
<p>TL;DR Essentially all the things you don't really put a ton of conscious effort into can be done on autopilot, and there's enough redundancy to make up for a hindered frontal lobe, but not enough to encode memories well at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. In cognitive psychology, we typically refer to sensory memory, short-term (or working) memory, and long-term memory. Sensory memory is of the shortest duration. It is the raw input of the senses. Short-term memory can be best thought of as what you are attending to at the moment. For example, your sense of touch is always operating and gathering information, but you may not be consciously aware of it until you are stuck with a pin (at which point, it will likely be a chief focus of attention. Encoding is specifically the process of moving information from short-term to long-term memory. The information must be meaningful in some way and must be connected with previous knowledge. The more meaningful and the stronger these connections, the more likely the information will be encoded and later retrieved. In order for something to be retrieved it must be cued. An apt metaphor is finding a file on your computer. Although you may know it exists, you need certain information to find it (such as part of the name, the file type, when it was created, etc.).</p>
<p>If you’re in an impaired, but functioning state, your short-term memory is operating (i.e. you are conscious), but your ability to encode and structure information in long-term memory will be lessened. Memories are also structured and “made sense of” after the event. This is why sleep disruptions can affect learning and memory. Your mind needs time to put all the new events and learning from the day in reasonable order. Often, when individuals suffer head trauma (such as in auto accidents), they may lose about 30 minutes of the recent past (even without actually blacking out). The trauma interferes with the normal process of acquiring new memories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) You can still use your STM during a blackout, yes, but encoding is not the same as moving information from STM to LTM.</p>
<p>2) Information does not HAVE to be meaningful. If that was the case, then we would not be able to learn new or non-sensical information, which we can. It just takes longer to learn information that cannot be directly integrated into our prior knowledge base. Whereas information that is easily integrated into our current knowledge base is easier to encode and retrieve.</p>
<p>3) Memories are not always “made sense of” after the fact. Interpreting the world around you tends to occur in real-time. That’s how we get around and make sense of the world around us. </p>
<p>4) The theory that memory consolidation occurs during sleep is still just a theory. It hasn’t been proven and is debated in the literature. Same with sensory/working memory. </p></div>		</li>

<li>
<p>Encoding is the specific term cognitive psychologists use to describe information moving from STM to LTM.  Period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes. It has to be meaningful. Nonsense syllables are remembered as letters and by similarity with known syllables and words (thus they tax STM more than more familiar structured material). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memories change over time. Look at the literature regarding eyewitness testimony. Upon recall, certain aspects are strengthened, others are weakened. Interference from previous learning affects new information, and new memories affect previous learning.</p>
</li>
<li>Research in psychology does not &quot; prove&quot; anything. Theories are supported or not supported. Some phenomena are well established, others are more tentative. Imaging studies and advances in neuroscience are adding to understanding in these areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any undergraduate text on cognitive psychology can explain these ideas. Your misuse of terms and skewed understanding of basic concepts illustrates a lack of real knowledge in this area.</p></div>		</li>
