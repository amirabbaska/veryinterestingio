			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually I think that the explanation they used in the film was that the ship wasn't in orbit, the &quot;time dilation&quot; effect had a &quot;cusp&quot; (it's a movie, got to give it some breaks) in the film. And it was just passed the planet, the ship maintained an orbit of the black hole above the planet. In fact because it did so for 23 years, it didn't have enough fuel later on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched it again the other day; this is exactly how it was explained and how it occurred. </p>
<p>Cooper asked TARS or CASE to enter an orbit &quot;parallel&quot; to the planet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might just work if the ship was at the L2 Lagrange point.  It would stay near the planet, but would be further away from the black hole and experience less time dilation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wondered that the fact the spaceship in in orbit while the rest of the crew landed on the planet, and orbit itself circles the whole planet. Which means, and some point in time the spaceship are closer to the black hole than the crew on the surface.</p>
<p>I would think the time dilation experience by the spaceship is mind-boggling and constantly changes over from its perihelion and aphelion.</p>
<p>And the crew returning easily to the spaceship (i.e getting into the EXACT orbit as they left) is pretty far fetched. Factor in time dilation, orbit decay and many other things movies would simply say &quot;Arghhh f**k it.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the movie, the ship orbits the black hole outside the orbit of the planet. They discuss entering a parallel orbit to that of the planet and making the insertion down from the higher orbit to avoid the time dilation affecting the mothership as much.</p></div>		</li>
