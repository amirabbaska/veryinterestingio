			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly akin to the dog example above. He says &quot;no poop&quot; because that is historically what results in what he wants... to not be changed. It doesn't mean he understands that he is lying to get his way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe his understanding of the word poop was so closely linked to getting his nappy changed that 'no poop' might mean not getting his nappy changed rather than lying about the poop in his pants. Or he was just too smart for his own good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought I read that they recently found evidence that at least dogs have some theory of mind for their owners.  Dogs were given the opportunity to &quot;steal&quot; dog treats, and they were more likely to do so when their owner could not see the treats than when the owner could see.  That would indicate that the dog has some concept of what the owner's visual viewpoint was and was acting accordingly.  </p>
<p>Also, crows are known to behave in ways that are consistent with theory of mind, they store and cache food and steal from eachother's caches.  Crows that know they are being watched are likely to create false catches, then store the food elsewhere when they are not being watched.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, crows and ravens are some of the smartest animals on the planet. I actually think I read somewhere that the only animal smarter than crows are humans, and ravens are only slightly dumber than crows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is an Every Little Thing podcast episode where a crow researcher discusses giving crows peanuts. He was in his car one day and was followed by a crow he hadn't seen. The crow wanted a peanut. It gives evidence that not only can crows communicate, but they can tell stories to each other.</p>
<p>My birds &quot;trick&quot; me all the time. Especially my conure. If she is mad at me, she will indicate she wants a treat. When I get close to her with it, she will do the quick drop and bite my finger. </p>
<p>Edit: Typo and disclaimer that I may have butchered a bunch of details about the podcast episode. It had been awhile since I heard it.</p></div>		</li>
