<p>Surely they are way too small to have any <em>real</em> effect, unless they get so close that a collision is possible? </p></div>		</li>

<p>The entire asteroid belt has a mass only 4% that of the Moon. Ganymede alone has a mass twice that of the Moon. Once just one of these large moons is destroyed, the entire inner solar system is going to be swarmed with countless trillions of objects the size of which destroyed the dinosaurs.

<p>I suppose. <em>Trillions</em> is definitely an exaggeration, though. The one which killed the dinosaurs was very large, with a very large mass. I doubt there's enough mass in all the moons in the solar system for a trillion of those. </p></div>		</li>
