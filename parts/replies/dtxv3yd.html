			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have a low grade fever: tough it out but continue to monitor it. If it gets worse, seek medical attention. You can take tylenol to ease some pain, maybe even an ice pack on your head(make sure to wrap it with a towel or something first though). Do NOT take aspirin. </p>
<p>Pyrexia occurs? If it is low grade pyrexia make sure to monitor it VERY closely and set up a doc appointment ASAP or maybe even prompt care. Apply something cold or cool to the head, such as a damp wash cloth. If your temp rises anymore, go to the ER. Anyone with above 102 F should go to the ER. Better safe than dead</p></div>		</li>
