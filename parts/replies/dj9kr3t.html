<p>To this day a lot of people still think that turkey is the healthy alternative to lunch meats like ham and roast beef.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because it is? Most people would agree that more protein is healthier. Don't try to argue that &quot;le fat is necessary too!&quot; because yes, it is. Want more fat? Just order some extra mayo on your sandwich.</p>
<p>I swear this anti-fat fad has turned into a fat-loving fad. While fat isn't as bad as people once thought, it's still 9 calories per gram and it's way easier to over-eat fat than protein.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="http://freakonomics.com/2010/12/09/beef-or-chicken-a-look-at-u-s-meat-trends-in-the-last-century/" target="_blank">This chart</a> shows consumption overall, not exclusively and deli meats. Overall turkey consumption stays at a steadier pace than other meats. However, you can see there is a jump up in consumption in the late 80s and 90s as a result of the fat scare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There doesn't seem to be enough information in the graph to come to that conclusion. This still shows chicken consumption increases at a much greater rate than turkey. If turkey became the more popular lunch meat because it was seen as the healthier of the two then the slope of chicken's increase in consumption should decrease at least a little at the time turkey's increases. Plus pork being seen as the least healthy meat should have taken a big hit in consumption yet it remains pretty constant. Furthermore, the increase in turkey's trend line's slope is pretty small and may not be enough to make any conclusions. Possible just random variance especially since it jumps up a little than remains constant for a few years then jumps up again then decreases for a few years rather than consistently increasing as would be expected if it were due to a health craze. </p>
<p>We are also missing a lot of information. The biggest of which I can think of would be cost of meats. It's possible something happened to the cost of beef that caused beef consumption to decreases and chicken and turkey to increase to take its place or maybe turkey and chicken farming starting getting streamlined and as more farms/slaughterhouses started implementing this new process chicken and turkey became more widely available.</p></div>		</li>
