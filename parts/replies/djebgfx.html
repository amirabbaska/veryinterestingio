			<div class="markdown"><p>ex military...it was explained like this...</p>
<p>Display, for whatever reason, is done pole on the left. so the US flag has stars top left...anchor point to a pole.</p>
<p>For a uniform, it is displayed as if trailing while walking. One would think, this concept should also be official like on a vehicle decal. It isn't. no clue why, and never got a straight answer. But on uniform, stars go towards front of body.</p></div>		</li>
