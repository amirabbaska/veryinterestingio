<p>Very good explanation, seriously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend and I both went to uni for engineering (although he was not in a computer field).  He cannot fathom, and still does not believe in, lossless compression.  We had like a 15 minute argument to the point he started to get mad about it.</p>
<p>Also to add: information has 'entropy' which is to say it is not ordered.  For instance the data 1,2,3,4,5 to infinity is just one piece of information: each value is 1 greater than the previous value, N+1.  Now if we have the data 487, 2, 13, 99 which may have a real meaning it's actually 4 pieces of information, nothing repeats and there's no pattern, so every piece of data is relevant to the information being conveyed.</p>
<p>A compression algorithm looks for ordered or repeating values in the data set, along with a whole lot of other types of patterns.  It goes over the data trying to fit it to all these different known patterns and then records the pattern and some values about where to apply it during uncompress.  In a simple example the data 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 487, 2, 13, 99, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 is compressed to 1, (N+1)^4 , 487, 2, 13, 99, 10, (N-2)^4 where N is the previous value in all cases.  This is a very simple example, compression algorithms use much more complex patterns including partial and combined patterns to compress the data as much as possible.  For instance we could express everything in terms of some value in the data.  </p>
<p>Anyway the point of all this is to explain why Information Theory says that the entropy of information will only ever allow lossless compression of up to about 30% (for binary computer files).  There is a real practical minimum to the size of data after which information must be lost in order to effect further compression.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What? But it's trivial to show that lossless compression actually works. I just did it!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why some schools refer to computer science/programming as &quot;software engineering&quot;</p></div>		</li>
