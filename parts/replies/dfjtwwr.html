<p>Side note, am I supposed to use a VPN at all hours now? For instance I cannot watch streams on Twitch while a VPN is on, or use Netflix. So what am I to do? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's closer to the definition of a proxy.  </p>
<p>A VPN is more like another &quot;hop&quot; in your route to what service you want.  But the &quot;hop&quot; between you and the vpn is encrypted; ISPs can see a connection to a VPN is taking place, but they do not know what the traffic is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going OT here a bit, but how can VPN help at all in this case? All the data sent and received still goes from your terminal through the ISP, out to the VPN, then to the target site, back to the VPN, then back to your terminal. The ISP still captures 100% of everything sent and received to and from the VPN, so, while a VPN will prevent the target site's server from seeing your actual I.P., won't the ISP still see every packet sent and received through its service?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Content providers (netflix, hulu, etc.) do not like VPNs as the get around region limitations of the services. So some content providers try to block VPNs. So if you use a VPN and you are having a problem with a site, you now have to consider that the site could be blocking traffic from the VPN provider's servers.</p>
<p>In addition, if you are in the US and use a VPN that open up outside the US (so that content providers think you are not in the United States), the any US government protections you have may no longer apply because the traffic leaving the VPN is no longer US based. For example, if you use VOIP over VPN to talk to someone in Europe, the US government can treat this like a europe to europe call and can listen in without a FISA warrant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ISP would only know that you are communicating to the VPN server, since VPN traffic is encrypted both ways, they cannot see what the traffic actually is. It is encrypted up until the software on your PC or the server decrypts it</p></div>		</li>
