<p>It also helps describe why the greenhouse gas effect is a thing.  The sun's photons peak in the visible (because it is hot) which isn't absorbed when entering the atmosphere but re-emitted as infrared photons from the black body radiation from the earth at room temperature.  Infrared photons do interact with greenhouse gases (such as CO2) in the atmosphere which causes some of the photons to be absorbed and re-emitted back to the earth, leading to a net warming effect.</p></div>		</li>
