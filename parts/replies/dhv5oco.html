			<div class="markdown"><p>This made me realize how much I take it for granted when my friends show me what they're interested in. They'll show me songs, movies, TV shows, video games and I'll think nothing of it, unaware that they're looking for my feedback. I'm going to make much more of an effort to value their interests, thank you for leaving this comment here :).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really happy to see that someone here got the message. No one I know seems to get this or care when I share my interests with them. I'll try to introduce a tv show, movie, or even make entire playlists of new music, all for friends and family and get absolutely nothing in return. But when they want to show me, I'm expected to be all ears and just amazed at what they are showing me. It's so hard to be excited for them when I rarely ever get anything back. I end up doing it, I guess because I feel alone and don't want to actually &quot;be&quot; alone, but I just haven't found anyone that cares about my interests. Like my boyfriend. He won't watch any tv show or movie I seem to pick. He waits about 10-15 minutes and then says &quot;this is kind of lame, lets watch something else&quot;. Then we watch one of his go to shows. It's so annoying. I feel like I'm always giving up my time to my friends and family's interests, but no one is ever interested or invested in mine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest with you, I'm more like your friends and family - I don't really show any interest in what my friends and family show me, but I expect them to be all my ears for what I want to show them. It's very self-centered and something I need to change about myself.</p>
<p>As for your problem in particular, though... I guess that's what Reddit is for? To share your interests with people that will care? I don't know, I'm no psychologist, but I hope that that changes for you :) I definitely know how heart-breaking it can feel to be rejected for what you're interested in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My ex did this A LOT. We were both really in to music, and I know how it feels being ignored, so I would take an active interest in to whatever songs she was showing me. Which usually meant listening quietly and intently while she played the same song over and over, showing me her favorite parts. </p>
<p>Then I would try to show her a song and she'd talk over it from the beginning. </p>
<p>Honestly, I take it as a sign that a person is too selfish for me if they do this consistently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, holy shit. I would always respond with my honest assholish opinion too... Wow. I guess I would think about this from time to time but only when one of my friends would react negatively to something I shared, but never really hit the nail on the head. I would over analyze why I felt disappointment and a bit of rejection, but this just hit home. This is great insight. Hmm..</p></div>		</li>

<p>All serious: one way I keep this in check is using the notepad function on my phone.  If someone mentions that a TV show, movie, actor, podcast, drink, location, app, radio station, product, restaurant, etc is worth checking out, I throw it on my relevant list of things &quot;to watch&quot;, &quot;to listen&quot;, &quot;to say&quot; (like, funny phrases, etc), &quot;to download&quot;, &quot;to drink&quot;, &quot;to go&quot;, etc...</p>
<p>People usually fall casually into conversation about things they like and then get animated in their explanations about how good the thing is.  I use that time to jot it down in the notepad.  I might forget who said it, but if it comes up again it's on my list.</p>
<p>When I'm looking for something new, the list is where I go instead of randomly scrolling through netflix, yelp, or whatever.  Then I go back and rate the item, so when said subject comes back into conversation, I've got some good stuff documented.</p></div>		</li>
