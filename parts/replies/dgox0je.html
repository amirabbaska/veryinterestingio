			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to love playing a trick on my gf by making her look into my eyes and then looking &quot;through&quot; or &quot;past&quot; her head until the double-vision set of eyes overlapped in the middle.</p>
<p>Basically it's the only way to give the effect that you're looking into each of their eyes simultaneously, and because her focal point could only be one of my eyes, it really freaked her out. She hated it.</p>
<p>We broke up. :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always see fractal like patterns slowly spinning and zooming in. And they don't look like capillaries, sometimes they look very mechanical and hard, other times more organic. It's very bizarre but fascinating to observe.</p>
<p>They're almost dreamlike where you forget about them soon after observing them.</p></div>		</li>
