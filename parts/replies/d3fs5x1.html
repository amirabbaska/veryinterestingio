			<div class="markdown"><p>Milk is approximately 87 percent water and 13 percent solids. As it comes from the cow, the solids portion of milk contains approximately 3.7 percent fat and 9 percent solids-not-fat.</p>
<p>Cheese is made by adding enzymes to milk, which causes it to curdle, taking a form kinda like watery cottage cheese.  Then the solids get strained out and smooshed together.</p>
<p>Cream cheese is just a form of fresh cheese, with a particularly high fat content.  It has a spongy, aerated texture, but from a physics point of view, it's just regular old cheese.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a whole article about it: <a href="http://www.wired.com/2006/06/cheese/" target="_blank">http://www.wired.com/2006/06/cheese/</a></p>
<p>Apparently cream cheese is a difficult product to make in a way that has a stable shelf life without making it taste like shit. There's a difficult balance of acids, fats, salt, and stabilizers that give Philly cream cheese the flavor it has as well as ability to be mass produced, and it is hard for competitors to do the same thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientifically, it’s one of the trickier dairy products. In their natural state, the protein molecules in milk have a negative charge, so they repel one another – that’s what keeps milk liquid. To solidify it (that is, turn it into cheese), this repellency must be overcome. Makers of cheddar and mozzarella usually rely on enzymes in rennet – a substance derived from the stomach lining of young calves – to attack the protein molecules and shear off the section bearing the electrical charge. Cream cheese is the result of a more technical procedure. Acid-secreting bacteria are added to the milk, and the decreasing pH flips the chargeof some of the milk’s proteins. The positively charged molecules attract the negatively charged ones, coagulating the liquid and eventually turning it solid.</p>
<p>The key is getting the cheese to an isoelectric state – the point at which half of its proteins are positive and half negative. Left alone, the bacteria will continue producing acid, giving all the molecules a positive charge and turning the mixture back into a liquid. To stop the acidification, the cheese is heated until the bacteria dies. The cheese maker has to anticipate the isoelectric state and kill the bacteria at the right time. Lucey’s research demonstrates that variations in flavor and texture are largely determined by subtle changes in the timing of this process. Cream cheese also has a higher fat content than most cheeses, and since fat repels water, additives such as guar and carob gums are introduced to bind the water. Without these so-called stabilizers, water tends to separate from the cheese, leaving a hardened gel. Lucey’s experiments have isolated the basic elements – protein, fat, stabilizer, water – and explored the effects of varying each one. His writings are a sort of guidebook to the inner workings of cream cheese, and they are arming Kraft’s competitors with new insights and production techniques.</p>

<p>Apparently english muffins are also really difficult to make if you want them to have the nooks and crannies that Thomas' english muffins have. That's why other brands are much more solid with much smaller bubbles in the bread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further clarification, Bingham plastic describes something that needs a certain amount of shear stress to get moving. It's why you can have a glob of stiff mayo hold its form on a knife but it can also be spread into a thin layer. It is one way of describing a non-Newtonian fluid (something that doesn't follow Newton's laws of flow). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be interesting to point out that the word &quot;plastic&quot; in that context refers to deformability, not the newer connotation of &quot;polymer&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More specifically, things like jelly, jello, etc. are (hydro)gels.  These usually occur when long polymers get crosslinked (often by heating) and form a mesh.  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/282388473_fig9_Fig-9-FESEM-image-of-the-agarose-gel-after-drying-The-agarose-aqueous-solution" target="_blank">Here</a> is a cool electron micrograph of a dried out agarose gel.  When wet, those holes become pores in a 3D matrix.  All of the polymers have some rigidity, but are a bit flexible.  That's why it has that quivery, semi-solid quality (once it's heated and cooled in water, allowing crosslinks between polymer strands to form).</p></div>		</li>
