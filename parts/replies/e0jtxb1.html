			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you can answer this... I have a dead coiled-up millipede outside that hasn’t been moved at all or been dragged off by who knows what, so this has allowed me to observe it from day-to-day and see much of what you are saying.</p>
<p>The question is that on any given day it is almost bone white (sits in a sunny spot) but when it rains it changes color back to damn near the perfect shade of when those things are alive.</p>
<p>How? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s really all it could be... it is just uncanny how much color returns. So much so that I legit thought it was alive again a week after it was there. Was like “do these things do some kinda cocoon phase!?!” Even poked it with a stick lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a guess, but it could be filling up with liquid. Insect &quot;blood&quot; isn't like ours at all, and is actually pretty clear. Being filled with something similar like rainwater could make it look like it has its blood back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK it stays semi preserved the same way liquids in a glass jar would be, not to that extent obviously but in a world full of insects it will be around long enough to be a viable source of nutrition for hundreds of generations. Insect might seem small or insignificant in the general sense but they are beautifully engineered, some beetles if scaled up to our size would have damn near impenetrable outer bodies. If some insects were the size of your average dog we probably wouldn't even be living in the world we do today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>luckily, physics prevents that from being possible.</p>
