Truth be told, the staggered release dates for international markets is a bit of a relic of old times when studios actually had to print film copies for theaters. This was a substantial cost, printing several hundred or a thousand high quality film prints for projectors. That's why in the olden days they had 1st, 2nd, &amp; 3rd run theaters. The 1st run theaters got the films first. As their run finished, the prints would be distributed to the 2nd run theaters, and so on.</p>
<p>Thus, even in the U.S., there used to be staggered film releases. It was pretty common that rural areas, for example, would have to wait weeks to months for movies to come to their area. International markets usually waited even longer.</p>
<p>This was tenable for 2 reasons. Firstly, the international markets weren't a big revenue source for the longest time, so there was no reason to waste a bunch of money on P&amp;A (prints &amp; advertising) for tiny markets.</p>
<p>Secondly, and most importantly, in those days, there was no internet, so people didn't even know what had already been released, and didn't really care that they were watching it months after people in New York and LA had already seen it.</p>
<p>Nowadays, both reasons are largely gone. International money now commonly exceeds domestic gross revenue, so they are <em>very</em> important markets. And people follow news worldwide (not to mention talk with friends / family / social media buddies around the world) so no one wants to wait a month to find out who gets killed in the new Avengers movie. Additionally, virtually all projectors are digital now, so print costs are basically nil (there is such a thing as virtual print costs paid to theaters to reimburse them for installing digital projectors, but that's another topic :-).</p>
<p>As a result, the international staggered release schedule is much more compressed. Indeed, it's not uncommon now for American films to premier in important international markets (like China) <em>first</em>, and come to the U.S. a week or two afterwards.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about this, but my best guess as to why they still have staggered releases, even in compressed form, is that they're now limited by the actors themselves. A big film release is always preceded by a major advertising push, including press junkets where the actors &amp; director do interviews, appearances, etc. For the bigger markets (e.g. Europe, China, Japan) they'll travel to the country for a couple of days, do a red carpet launch, plus a bunch of interviews with local press, so as to flood that country's media with mentions of the movie just as it's opening. Then they'll fly to another country and do the same. It's simply impossible for the actors to do that around the world for a dozen different countries at the same time.</p>
<p>Actors will tell you even the current schedule is grueling enough. I don't think they'll be able to shorten it much until we move to virtual actors :-)</p></div>		</li>
