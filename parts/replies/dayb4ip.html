			<div class="markdown"><p>A worm is a piece of software that will scan for &quot;vulnerable&quot; computers. It infects the vulnerable computers. It then proceeds to scan from the computer it just infected. Thus propagating itself throughout the web. </p>
<p>This is effective for a couple of reasons. Number one it requires bandwidth to do the scanning. The more computers you have scanning the more of the internet you are able to scan. Secondly certain computers will have access to other networks that most other machines would not be able to access. Thus being able to infect machines that the original scanner could not. </p></div>		</li>
