			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just being nitpicky, but saying &quot;the lens would be your eye and the sensor would be your brain&quot; is incorrect. The lens is obviously the lens in your eye, and the sensor is your retina. A sensor is a photosensitive surface, i.e. converts light into an electric current, which is performed by the rods and cones in your retina. </p>
<p>The brain in this analogy is the whole electronic circuit behind the sensor,, from the A/D converter, which allows that electric signal to be processed, to the screen showing the image.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Simplistic analogy if you were a camera</p>

<p>I'm not using a camera as a functional analog for functions of the eye, I'm using it to draw comparisons to the areas relevant to OP's question, and I am specifically trying to stick to areas of the camera that are familiar even to people who are not photographers or intimately familiar with the inner workings of a camera.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure you would feel differently if you were accidentally picking up that pan you put in the 400 degree oven for the last 45 mins. Pain is one of the most important purposes of the nervous system. It literally keeps you alive in many cases. Embrace the feels, they are your best friend!!!</p>
<p>ALIVE: pain stops you from doing a lot of deadly things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are actually people who can't feel pain (rare condition) and it's like a living nightmare. They constantly have to be careful because they don't know if they accidentally scratched their eyes on the bedsheets at night and other weird stuff like that. With pain your eye immediately protects itself before any damage can be done.</p></div>		</li>
