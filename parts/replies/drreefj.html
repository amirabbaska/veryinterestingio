			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but I believe he means that the duration of the burst hitting Earth is very short, so the Earth doesn't have time to rotate very much. Just the unlucky half of the world in the immediate path of the burst gets hit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes. it is i understand (based on many articles) that it is not like a beam just directly kills people although close enough maybe there would also be that effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not exponential, but inverse square. Otherwise you're right, for a point source (which a star is at this distance) the shape of the burst does not matter for the rate it decreases over distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be a laser, probably won't be. Not an astrophysicist, but for whatever reason lasers just aren't common in nature</p>
<p>Also: you still run into the same problem. If its more directed, then its more dangerous, and its also that much less likely to actually hit the earth. Unless theres some property of the earth which will act like a lightning rod, then the average would still be the same</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if the emission came from a perfectly flat plate, the EM density would be independent of distance correct? I know this can't really happen in nature, but the theory is interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is correct. If the plate is of finite size L, then this would be approximately true at distances r &lt;&lt; L from the plate, the behaviour would be more complicated at r ~ L, and for distances r &gt;&gt; L the emission from the plate would behave as if emitted from a point source (inverse square law).</p></div>		</li>
