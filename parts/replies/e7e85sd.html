			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question. Because of their high activity, expensive elements such as platinum are for many chemical conversion processes. There is considerable amount of research in developing new non-precious metal catalysts for fuel cells and other catalysts. For example, PNNL's Energy Frontiers Research Center on Electrochemistry is exploring the fundamentals of how the reactions occur and is developing bio-inspired catalyst (<a href="https://efrc.pnnl.gov/" target="_blank"><a href="https://efrc.pnnl.gov/" target="_blank">https://efrc.pnnl.gov/</a></a>). The Fuel Cell Technology Office has significant programs in this area (<a href="https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/annual_review18_fuelcells.html#catalysts" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/annual\_review18\_fuelcells.html#catalysts" target="_blank">https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/annual\_review18\_fuelcells.html#catalysts</a></a>). Indeed, PNNL working with Oregon State University developed a non-precious group metal catalyst for microbial electrolysis which has similar activity to platinum (<a href="https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review18/pd129_liu_2018_p.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review18/pd129\_liu\_2018\_p.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review18/pd129\_liu\_2018\_p.pdf</a></a>) . Finally, for the Chemical Transformation Initiative we are exploring both precious metals such as Palladium, Ruthenium, and Platinum as well as base metals such as copper and cobalt for these reactions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am by no means an expert but since this wasn't mentioned in u/Jamie5091's answer, there are a plethora of uses and advantages of metal-organic frameworks as catalysts for multiple reactions, and MOFs frequently employ non-precious metals such as copper. I helped with research during my undergrad that focused on the advantages of MOFs as a heterogeneous catalyst, but <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.5b13335" target="_blank">here</a> is an article related to MOFs practicality in carbon fixation. (Again, not positive about its relevance to hydrogen fuel cells, but maybe still worth mentioning!)</p></div>		</li>
