			<div class="markdown"><p>What's a German? You mean a Saxon? Westphalian? Prussian? Bavarian? Or maybe you mean culturally German during pre-Roman times. Well, that would be Celtic culture with some local cultures getting mixed in. Being German is a national identity more than anything. Germany, not Germania is a political union that encompasses many indigenous group of north Central Europe. People have been moving around Europe for so long it's hard to track down who's indigenous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>u/RedditorSince2017 didn't say that. They said that indigenous populations generally have less technological development. They did <strong>not</strong> say that's part of the definition.</p>
<p>It kind of makes sense. If they had more technology, they'd be the ones travelling around and findding the people with less technology.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is not a part of the definition, it is my observation of a common trait amongst indigenous cultures. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you suggesting the Japanese are not indigenous to Japan or the Han not indigenous to China or the Danes to Syaland ... shall I go on? </p>
<p>Technology has nothing to do with OP's question of how long a people need be in a land to be considered indigenous.</p>
<p>Indigenous is defined as &quot;originating or occurring naturally in a particular place&quot; - everyone originates somewhere regardless of their level of technology. </p>
<p>OP's question, as I understand it, is how long does a group need be in a &quot;particular place&quot; in order to be considered &quot;originating&quot; from there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Indigenous populations also are usually not aware of travelling to their location except through stories passed down through word of mouth. </p>

<p>Does that mean that it's impossible for a society with writing to ever be indigenous? Let's say that there were a population of Americans with all modern technology who moved to a currently unsettled region of Earth (or some other planet).  Would they never be indigenous if they never lost writing as a technology?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is another observation of a common trait. Usually indigenous cultures have a lower development level and are unable to create tools for posterity, often being nomadic. </p>
<p>A writing population that is able to properly preserve its history could definitely be indigenous. Iâ€™m not aware of any cases other than word of mouth, I have a vague memory that possibly one culture recorded there arrival story via rock wall or possibly wooden carving but I fail to recall which. </p></div>		</li>

<p><del>Respectfully, can you provide a source to support this assertion?</del></p>
<p>Edit:  Never mind. I think the UN link someone provided below is close enough.  I suppose it comes down to semantics: do we consider &quot;indigenous&quot; in the ordinary &quot;dictionary&quot; sense of the word or do we consider it as a political or sociological term of art as the UN uses it.  If the later, I am sure you are correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not clear to me whether you're saying that Polynesians came from the east originally or just that they were able to make the voyage. </p>
<p>To be clear, the Kon-Tiki voyage absolutely did not prove that Polynesians came from South America; genetic evidence clearly says that modern Polynesians are mainly descended from people who came from the west. Some Rapa Nui have a small genetic contribution from indigenous South Americans, but (a) it's a small amount and (b) it probably <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/10/did-early-easter-islanders-sail-south-america-europeans" target="_blank">happened post-contact</a>.</p>
<p>What Kon-Tiki did was show that the voyage was possible, even by coddled modern people (badass though they may be) who lacked the historic Polynesian seafaring expertise.</p></div>		</li>
