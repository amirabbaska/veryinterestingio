			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  If the moon were replaced with an actual mirror that reflected 99% of the sunlight, I feel sure you could start a fire using a lens.  I don't see any reason it would depend on the temperature of the mirror.  So the real question is, is the Moon a good enough mirror.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why couldn't we devise a system of mirrors and lenses to place on the moons surface to beam sun rays down to a system of motorized lenses on earth to create 24 hour solar energy?  Sounds like something so easy Elon musk could do it..... (or pay for it).  There. I just solved the energy crisis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not only the sun, it's also the Earth and all the empty space which heat can be radiated into. The sun can be excluded for all purposes, we could just assume that Moon radiates in the same way on its own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excluding the sun is just doing the spherical cow physicists are infamous for. Sure, it makes the math easier, but that's just not reality, and when you make the situations not physically impossible but still absurd, the differences between the two matter. The moon's albedo is not zero, and we know that you can use a mirror to heat something to a temperature higher than its own temperature, so in principle we can filter off the moon's blackbody radiation entirely and consider it to be a poor mirror. This obviously means that the reflected sunlight does have an effect that you can't just ignore without having good reason to ignore it.</p></div>		</li>
