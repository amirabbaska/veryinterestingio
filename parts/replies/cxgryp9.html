			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Everyone seems to be answering the question about why there is a lower limit for cold and why the upper limit for heat is so far away, but very few people seem to be addressing the question the OP asked about why we biologically exist so close to the cold limit.  You touched on the answer when you said that chemistry is not possible at higher temps.</p>
<p>The answer is that life, and organized processes, require stability, and <em>consistency</em> to function.  Look at what happens when metal gets hot: it melts, loses form, and spreads out.  Look at what happens when wood catches fire: it turns to flame and the constituent atoms of carbon and hydrogen go flying away from each other into the air.  And neither of those examples are really very hot on the heat scale of the universe.</p>
<p>Temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of some amount of atoms.  Average kinetic energy is basically just a way of saying &quot;how fast the stuff is moving&quot; on an atomic scale.  When atoms start moving too fast, they become less organized.  That is why the changes from solid to liquid to gas involve both higher temperatures and less organization.  </p>
<p>When things get too hot (they start vibrating faster and faster) they basically go flying away from each other.  When atoms are moving around too quickly, and/or too far away, they can't react together in a sensible or efficient <em>or reliable</em> way.  This happens even before the problem of electron stripping becomes an issue.  </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> If life were much hotter we would melt / catch on fire, turn into a gas, and spread out.  How do you expect individual organisms to exist under those conditions?</p>
<hr />
<p>On the flip side, chemical processes also usually require <em>some</em> energy (sometimes in the form of heat) to function, and they often produce heat as a byproduct of their chemical reactions as well.  If everything were super cold, all the atoms would be frozen in place, and would not be able to interact.</p>
<p>So life exists at this balance point where everything needs to be cold enough to maintain structure, coherence, consistency, and proximity, but also just slightly hot enough so that things can move around a bit and interact.</p>
<p>Think of the word &quot;process&quot; and apply it to &quot;biological processes&quot;.  A process involves changes and movement.  You start with one thing and you end up with something else.  But it also requires steps, and order, and organization.  That is the balance point where we exist.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>ELI5 summary:</strong> Imagine your body as an office, and your atoms as office workers.  Now imagine that none of your workers can move, <em>at all</em>.  That is life at absolute zero temperature.  Would any work get done?  Now imagine an office where all your workers must <em>always be running at full speed all the time</em>.  They can't stop running for anything, not even to pause for a moment at their desks.  That is life with just a little more heat than we have now.  Now imagine that all your workers are literally (not metaphorically) strapped to their own personal cruise missile, and all the cruise missiles ignite at the same time flying off in random directions with your workers.  That is life with significantly more heat than now.  Would any work get done in either of those scenarios?  </p>
<p>Now think about the kind of office <em>where work actually gets done</em>.  Most people don't move very much.  Most of the movement that does happen is in a very small area.  They sit / stand at their desks for long periods of time, diligently typing and clicking away, organized by floor, department, and function, only occasionally getting up to consult with someone at a nearby desk, and, rarely, someone in another department.  When you compare this office to the two extremes, you see that a functioning office is much closer to a frozen office than to a cruise-missile office.  Yet, to get work done, there still needs to be <em>some</em> movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a balance point in terms of temperature and states of matter: most importantly water.  Life in general needs a good mix of solids, liquids, and gases to function.  Solids generally represent life itself, and the building blocks (nutrients, foods) used to sustain that life.  Liquids and gases both serve as methods of transportation, both for the life itself, and for the chemicals needed to sustain biological processes.  Think about how our Earth has such a mixture of solids, gases, and liquids.  Now compare that to a hotter planet, and you get something like a gas giant, where pretty much everything has become much more disorganized.  At the other extreme is an ice planet, where everything is frozen solid and very little moves.</p>
<p>Water is the big key here though, in that it serves as a fantastic transport mechanism for all the other types of atoms that life needs to produce chemical reactions and survive.  It also serves many other functions, sometimes as a solvent, sometimes as a catalyst, but all you really need to know is that water is only effective in these roles as a liquid.  As a solid (ice) it becomes relatively inert and can't serve to transport anything when it isn't moving, and as a gas it is too spread out to absorb much and too random to transport anything <em>in a predictable, reliable way</em>.</p>
<p>Again, look at our Earth and notice how water exists here in all three states: ice (mostly at the poles and high elevations), liquid (oceans, rivers, lakes), and gas (atmosphere, clouds).  But the majority of water that we come into contact with is in the form of liquid.  We are right at that balance point (which on a universal scale is actually a very narrow band of temperature) where most water tends to stay liquid.  Notice how precarious our existence is, in that when things get just a little bit colder, water freezes, and when things get just a little hotter, water boils away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'goldilocks zone' around stars is a result of exactly this; it's a physical zone defined by the 'sweet spot' of being just warm enough but not too hot, as described.</p>
<p>One sobering way to look at it is to take the total volume of space around a set of stars, and then look at the vanishingly small little donuts* of space around each one that is habitable. It's a very very very small percentage of the total space in a solar system; and an unbelievably small percentage of the space in a region, once you include interstellar space.</p>
<p>Boy are we rare, to be here using the internet to talk about ourselves!</p>
<p>(*oriented on the ecliptic plane; technically the habitable zones are hollow spheres; and then there are potentially life-supporting liquid oceans within e.g. otherwise frozen moons, even in our own solar system... but even so. Almost nowhere, statistically speaking.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be a stupid question, but youre answer is basically &quot;there is a point of stability for many aspects in the world at &quot;our&quot; temperature&quot;. Are any other points of stability known? (Either colder or hotter)? Even if only theoretical possibilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  My answer was not really human-centric.  It was intended to be atom-centric.  Life requires processes.  Processes is another way of saying &quot;consistent yet complex chemistry&quot;.  Complex chemistry is another way of saying &quot;interaction between atoms&quot;.  At significantly lower temperatures, interactions either stop completely, or slow to useless rates.  At higher temperatures, interactions become more random, less predictable, and it becomes increasingly impossible to maintain structure and order.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There <em>may</em> be other stability ranges, we don't know. His point is still correct / valid though, because those other stability ranges, if they exist, would be relatively close to ours on the grand temperature scale. They wouldn't be hospitable or necessarily even survivable by us, but they would be much closer to our range of temperatures than a stars.</p>
<p>I'm thinking the possibility of, say, methane. Of course, if life existed using methane as a medium for chemical reaction instead of water, it would likely be not only very different, but much less complex, due in large part to the speed and breadth of chemical reactions available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even simpler, water only exists at this temp range. Water has a great deal of properties that life needs, but along with other liquids, are comparatively very rare in the universe. Most things are cold enough to be solid or hot enough to be gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More fundamentally, all solids and liquids only exist pretty close to the 'absolute zero' end of the temperature scale. Once you get into anything even 'slightly warm', in the grand scheme of things, molecules have too much energy to bond, and everything is a gas or a plasma. </p>
<p>Over ~6000K, everything is a gas, and that's a minuscule fraction of the theoretical maximum temperature. </p></div>		</li>
