			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really no, because the human eye adapts to falling light levels much faster than the slow creep of moon across the sun's disc. We hardly notice thick clouds almost completely obscuring the sun unless when its happening in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>With a light-meter on the other hand, you could easily measure the significant and steady drop in light levels.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What? I always notice... and I'm pretty sure that's defined as &quot;gloomy&quot; so I don't think I'm unique.</p>
<p>It's <strong>very</strong> noticeable if it's quick, but you can still tell the difference if it isn't.</p>
<p>As far as it pertains to his 65% question, I have no idea... just saying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's actually pretty funny... bright sunlight can be upto 120K Lux. A run of the mill overcast day is easily less than 1K Lux. That's a difference of 120 times between full sunlight and your 'gloomy' day. 120x i.e. 12000%... </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've now seen 3 partial solar eclipses (60-80%), and all 3 times it was extremely obvious that it was getting darker. The first time (as a kid) I didn't even know there was supposed to be an eclipse. I was just outside, noticed the dimming, and realized that there were no clouds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You will not notice a difference in brightness unless you are paying very close attention. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/GSp7kHH.jpg" target="_blank">Here is a picture I took during a 0.5 magnitude eclipse</a> in <del>2013</del> <a href="https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/OH2014.html#SE2014Oct23P" target="_blank">2014</a>. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/0U02SSt.jpg" target="_blank">Here is a picture of the sun itself around the same time</a>: you can see in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_flare" target="_blank">lens flare</a> (which is just a reflection of the sun within the optics of the camera) that about 50% of the sun is covered, yet it looks like any other late-afternoon photograph otherwise.</p>
<p>The main difference that will be apparent without viewing devices would be <a href="http://www.solareclipse2015.org.uk/solar-eclipse-phenomena/" target="_blank">strange-looking shadows</a> from any object that has small gaps for light to pass through, acting like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera" target="_blank">pinhole camera</a></p>
<p>There was a partial eclipse on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_December_25,_2000" target="_blank">Christmas Day 2000</a>, with a similar magnitude in Massachusetts, and I doubt anyone noticed anything different except those who were looking for it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! Great response. Is there anything you can think of I can use to &quot;simulate&quot; those weird shadows? Maybe like a doily or something? Haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's only a total esclipse if you're in the umbra of the eclipse, the darkest part of the shadow. The further away you get, the less of the sun is blocked from your point of view as an observer on the ground. If you're in the penumbra, you will be partially shaded from the sun by the moon, but not enough to notice unless you're going out of your way to check. The sun is <em>really</em> bright.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To chime in with the rest, even if you're in the totality, that only lasts for two or three minutes. Before and after, it'll be partial for quite a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To follow along with the other answer, the path where a total eclipse will be seen is comparatively very small, only a small strip across the country about 100 miles wide will see a total eclipse. The rest will see a partial eclipse only.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer: don't point your camera at the sun for long periods of time: you can damage the light sensor. Probably not a problem for a camera phone, but for cameras with an optical zoom, avoid zooming in too far and for too long on the sun.</p></div>		</li>
