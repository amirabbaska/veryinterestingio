<p>people who regularly eat less than is required to maintain their weight don't actually cheat too bad during the cheat day so maybe they figured the morale boost outweighs the little setback.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is on the mark in my opinion. </p>
<p>Cheat days give you a break from thinking about food, they make it seem less of a chore and because you're regulating your intake 6 of 7 days, after a couple of weeks your body won't want to consume <em>that</em> much more than what you consume normally. </p>
<p>If your body needs 2500 calories to maintain it's current weight, and your diet has you consuming 2000, over those 6 days that's a a deficit 3000 calories. It's highly unlikely you're going to want to eat 5000 calories worth of shit on your cheat day, just because it's such a huge increase in your normal intake. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there's also something that happens at some point during the fasting which makes you not feel that hungry anymore.
The night of the fasting days you feel like you're going to eat the entire supermarket and are vividly dreaming of food. Next morning though, you feel just fine and kinda go &quot;meah, I'll just have a normal meal&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your body does this with all of your basic needs: Food, Sleep, Sex, etc.<br />
Remember, you are the result of millions of years of evolution in a feast &amp; famine environment. Your brain is wired in a way that encourages you to stuff yourself because there's no guarantee of another meal the following day.<br />
Of course, relatively few western people go without food unwillingly in the modern world, but human physiology is, for the most part, still prehistoric.
#
So when your brain sends a signal telling you &quot;I'm hungry, it's time to eat&quot; and you ignore that request for long enough, your brain will eventually stop sending the signal because it figures there must not be any more food in the environment and it is not advantageous to disturb your efforts at finding more.
#
Imagine trying to hunt with your stomach grumbling and that nagging hungry feeling. Pretty distracting, right?<br />
Imagine trying to run away from a predator while your body is like &quot;Nope, I'm tired. Time to go to bed.&quot; Pretty detrimental, right?<br />
Imagine trying to chat up the cute girl from english class while trying to hide a raging erection? Oh wait...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is counter to what they say about fasting diets. The studies I read say that the every other day participants felt far more hunger and it did not decrease.  It also showed that the fasting every other day participants had raised LDL cholesterol levels.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not surprising that people disliked alternate-day fasting. Previous studies have reported that people felt uncomfortably hungry and irritable on fasting days, and that they didn’t get accustomed to these discomforts. Interestingly, in this study, over time people in the fasting group ate more on fasting days and less on feasting days...........</p>
<p>At the end of the 12 months, there was only one difference between the two diet groups: the alternate fasting day group had a significant elevation in low density lipoprotein (LDL), an increase of 11.5 mg/dl as compared to the daily calorie restriction group. LDL is known as a risk factor for heart attacks and strokes, so that’s not good.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely,  on my cheat day it's like &quot;yay, I get to stop at Burger King on the way home from work.&quot;  I'm used to eating less food anyway that by the end of the burger I'm full to the point where I really don't even want the last few bites.  I'm definitely not scarfing down 6000+ calories just because it's &quot;cheat day,&quot; I'm not that hungry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can relate as well that on my regular days I'm eating more veggies and fruit, so when I do order a big cheat meal, probably something fatty, by the end I'm just like meh. It's not as appetizing. A nice burger will hit the spot every time though. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Good for weight loss, not so good for the study though since they were looking into ways of incorporating regular fasting into daily lives due to its health benefits and not everybody needs weight loss.</p>

<p>That's an example of good science. The study findings ran contrary to the expectations/wants of the researchers or of those who commissioned the study but they accepted the evidence and published. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll admit I don't know a lot about nutrition and good diets vs bad diets, but I feel like not eating for an entire day can't be a great thing. Aren't nutrients needed to feed your brain and organs? Sure if you're just sitting at home playing video games then I understand. But if you work a job that requires you to use your brain, I don't see how neglecting food for a whole day could be good. </p>
<p>Also I know it doesn't happen to most people but I'll get a migraine if I skip a meal like lunch. I always thought that the healthiest way of eating is many very small meals. I find it hard to believe that eating 150% of your daily amount of food one day and 0% the other could possibly be healthier than trying to cut back and eat less/healthier every day. Plus, exercise is a big part of losing weight. Who the fuck is exercising after work on a day where they didn't eat a single thing? </p>
<p>I feel like fasting is the worst &quot;fad diet&quot; I've ever heard of. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is from a study with alternate day fasting, may be the one that was mentioned.</p>
<p>Looking at these results, this may be a rather bad way of losing weight, for 800g of fat mass, 600g of non fat mass was lost. It does not specify the amount of muscle mass and some of the weight may also be water, but cannibalising muscle for fat loss, is almost never good. Though that could also be better if the subjects had weight lifted on their eating days and the researchers would have bothered to determine muscle mass.</p></div>		</li>
