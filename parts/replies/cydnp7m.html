			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer : not really.</p>
<p>There is somes studies (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16513370/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17655784/" target="_blank">here</a> that focuses on the specificity of high IQ brain, but we are not really able to give you an approximation of your IQ with just an MRI for example.</p>
<p>But there is some studies that focus on the difference between low/average/high IQ and cerebral activation during specific tasks (one example <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2820702/" target="_blank">here</a>). With all these kind of tasks, we should be able to potentially give an approximation (high vs low) of the IQ, but we would need true specific tests, and higher number of participants to create a norm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>would it be fair to say IQ is more of a measure of your (for the lack of a better phrase) 'pure brain power' which is only one aspect of who a person is? Like an anti social, lazy person could have a high IQ but be unsuccessful in most facets of his life including the amount of actual information he knows while still having the ability to process information slightly more quickly than an average person?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily &quot;pure brain power&quot;, but I see what you are asking for. IQ mesure one aspect of what a person is (some very specific cognitive functions, or the opposite some very large groups of multiple cognitive functions).</p>
<p>I would say that the perceptual reasoning indice is the most similar to &quot;logical brain power&quot;. It is the natural logical reasoning, and is the most difficult to teach/learn (compared to verbal comprehension that rely heavily on the environnement/learning/socio-cultural background etc). The working memory (more of a &quot;how many information can you manipulate at the same time&quot; kind of &quot;brain power&quot;) is also difficult to train, as the processing speed (&quot;how fast can you interact with information&quot; kind of &quot;brain power&quot;). </p>
<p>So, at least for the Weschler scale, IQ is a mesure of a small part of some &quot;natural brain power&quot;. But with your description, the intelligent anti-social lazy person would likely have one of his indice higher than the average (processing speed), but not necessarily all (verbal comprehension would be potentially average or low if he doesn't read because he is lazy and watch netflix all day).</p></div>		</li>
