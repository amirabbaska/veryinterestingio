			<div class="markdown"><p>my granddad has been using the same mixture of grease, goose fat and oils for his roast potatos for well over 30 years. he keeps it all in one tray which he never washes and only uses for potatos. </p>
<p>pretty gross when i found out but easily the best potatos i've ever eaten, his argument is that he cooks with it so regularly that it'll never get bacteria on it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I don't know any exact numbers but the idea is sound. The food in question would probably get pretty unpleasant for non bacterial reasons though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of. The problem ia, though, that often it isn't directly the bacteria that makes you sick, but the waste produced by live bacteria.
When you heat food, you kill the many of the living bacteria, but the waste is still there. And everytime the bacteria are allowed to regrow, they produce more and more waste. </p>
<p>Optimal solution is keeping the food above a certain temperature at all times. In Denmark, we have a law about this for restaurants, if they keep the food above 65°C, it can in theory stay out, for example in a buffet, indefinitely.</p></div>		</li>
