<p>This might explain why DeepDream images look so close to what people see under the effects of LSD.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream" target="_blank">Wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The software is designed to detect faces and other patterns in images, with the aim of automatically classifying images. However, once trained, the network can also be run in reverse, being asked to adjust the original image slightly so that a given output neuron (e.g. the one for faces or certain animals) yields a higher confidence score. However, after enough reiterations, even imagery initially devoid of the sought features will be adjusted enough that a form of pareidolia results, by which psychedelic and surreal images are generated algorithmically.</p>
