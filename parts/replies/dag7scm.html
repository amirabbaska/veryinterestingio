			<div class="markdown"><p>A long time ago a colleague who wasn't the brightest spark switched the PSU input voltage. While it was plugged in. And on. There was a very loud high pitched squeal and a very loud bang,  accompanied by some acrid smoke. The fire alarm went off,  thankfully the sprinklers didn't come on but a whole building of 400 people on three floors had to evacuate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious when I hear stories like this, because I have no doubt it's true yet it absolutely blows my mind trying to work out what they were hoping to achieve by doing it. Were they just randomly playing with switches out of curiosity? Was there a problem they were hoping to solve that they thought needed &quot;a few more/less volts&quot;?</p>
<p>It's people like this that are the reason we need those fucking annoying security screws on things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did the same when I was little. PSU exploded slightly and didn't turn on again. We have no fire alarm at home so just that. Parents were not at home. I went to their room and disconnected their electronic clock from the outlet, connected it again. When they came home, I said that the lights went off and PC blew up (because of some kind of power line malfunction). A minute later my mom said &quot;our clock is reset, indeed there was a power outage&quot;. They then bought a new PSU. Nobody knows the truth to this day. Hehe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't explain why more consumer goods don't use detachable plugs. Like hair dryers and ACs and heaters. Do companies not want to make these appliances as cheaply as possible?  Seems that making one appliance and shipping it worldwide would be a cheap solution. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electronic power supplies these days are almost always able to operate at every voltage and frequency combination in the world, simply as a byproduct of their design for efficiency and cost. The best type in pretty much all other metrics has the bonus feature of a wide input range. This type is called a switching power supply, as opposed to a linear power supply.</p>
<p>On the other hand, large appliances usually contain mains-powered motors and heaters, which must be designed for one voltage and frequency. A 120V American hair dryer producing 1875W would produce 7500W plugged into 240V Britain. A 60Hz American washing machine would spin 20% slower in 50Hz Japan. You can buy e.g. travel hair dryers with a switch and circuitry to handle different voltage, but it's usually not economical to do this for every product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inside of a desktop computer is a module called a power supply. The entire job of this module is to take in AC power (the power that comes out of the wall) at whatever voltage it may be (110v-240v) and turn it into DC voltage at 5 volts and 12 volts, because every component inside of the computer requires either 5vdc or 12vdc to function. </p>
<p>Since power supplies have such a simple job, and have a fairly decent amount of space to work with, this isn't difficult and is definitely worth the money to have a product that works everywhere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how much the connector cost is relative to the cost of all parts.  It's very easy to make two different products / part numbers if it saves pennies. </p>
