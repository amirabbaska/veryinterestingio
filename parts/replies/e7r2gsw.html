			<div class="markdown"><p>Proxima Centauri is far, far too small to supernova.</p>
<p>But even were it big enough, the shockwave itself wouldn't have much effect. It moves the interstellar medium well enough, but Earth's atmosphere is about 20 orders of magnitude denser--not to mention that much of it will be blocked by our own sun's solar wind.</p>
<p>There would be other dangers; I don't think (but I'm not sure) that the light alone would be lethal, but the radiation and charged particles could degrade the ozone layer enough to be a problem, and to cause some aurora-type effects in the upper atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If Voyager had a microphone capable of measuring 'sound' at the level of single molecules, yes, we could. At least in theory. The 'sound' would be be overwhelmed and lost in the normal chaos of any atmosphere, however; and probably even lost simply passing through the sun's heliopause [where the solar wind/bubble terminates somewhere waywayway out past Pluto]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Proxima Centauri can't undergo a supernova, it's not big enough.</p>
<p>The closest known supernova candidate is IK Pegasi at a distance of 150 light years. It's a binary system with a main sequence star and a white dwarf, and could undergo a type I supernova in the distant future after the star expands into a red giant. However, by that time it will likely have moved even farther away.</p>
<p>The closest known candidate for a core collapse supernova is probably Spica at a distance of 250 light years. It has a mass of about 11 times that of the Sun (a star requires at least about 8 solar masses in order to undergo a core collapse supernova) and is also part of a binary system.</p>
<p>Even if Proxima Centauri were a large star that could undergo a core collapse supernova, and did, the interstellar medium is extremely thin and the shockwave would have no noticeable effect on the Earth's atmosphere. The burst of light from the supernova would be a much greater danger, because the high-energy photons could cause chemical reactions in the atmosphere and damage the ozone layer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>E=MC²</p>
<p>Yes, the speed of light is huge, but also hydrogen is really tiny</p>
<p>I'm not sure how much energy it takes to blow apart the earth but I'd bet it's a fair bit more than you'd get from a single hydrogen molecule at 99.999999% the speed of light</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually since you can never actually get an object with mass to move at the speed of light if you were to put more energy into it through some means it would get effectively heavier due to relativistic stuffs, so that's actually irrelevant. Theoretically, realistically this is not going to happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible - though extremely improbable even in the vastness of space - for a single atom to have enough energy to pull a planet apart. That said, the atom would almost certainly pass through the planet leaving a little atom-sized hole that would quickly fill itself. It might heat the atmosphere and scatter some particles at high velocity on its way down, but it would never actually damage the Earth significantly.</p>
<p>Extremely high energy particles strike the Earth's atmosphere pretty much every day, and mostly just result in a shower of high-energy particles travelling through the atmosphere. The energy levels of these particles, however, are on the scale of the kinetic energy of a baseball moving at 100mph; nowhere near enough to damage a planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My math could be off, but I just calculated using relativistic kinetic energy [E = mc^(2)*(1/sqrt(1-v^(2)/c^(2)) - 1)], and earth gravitational binding energy (2*10^32 J) and a proton mass, that the speed v would be about (1-10^(-85))c. That's 0.9999...(85 nines) the speed of light! And the lorentz factor would be 10^(42), so from the proton's frame of reference time would be 10^42 times slower!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Single atoms or molecules that float around in space. There’s dust and smaller particles too. Think of a stadium. Fully packed and standing room only. That’s the kind of density of matter in the upper atmosphere. Now same stadium, but only three people in it. That’s the interstellar medium.</p></div>		</li>
