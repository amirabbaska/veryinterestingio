<p>n the Midwest, famously known for its deep topsoil, some areas have lost up to half of their topsoil since the end of the dust bowl because of intensive industrial farming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's quite terrifying.</p>
<p>Has anything been done to address this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conservational farming practices are being tested and implemented all the time.  In that regard, we have made progress.  Things like no-till, reduced-till, and cover-cropping.  The goal is to mitigate loss of topsoil by water and wind erosion.  But, the topsoil isn't simply being depleted by volume.  Intensive ag also depletes organic matter and nutrients, which are what take hundreds of years to regenerate.  We counteract this by adding synthetic fertilizer.  The abstract here shows the &quot;carbon savings&quot; from conservation tillage:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The late P.A. Yeomans, developer of the Keyline system of land management, recognised that the sustainability of the whole farm was dependent on living, vibrant topsoil. The formation of new topsoil using Keyline principles, at rates not previously considered possible, was due to the use of a tillage implement designed to increase soil oxygen and moisture levels, combined with a rest/recovery form of grazing and pasture slashing, to prune grass roots and feed soil biota. Yeomans was able to produce 10 cm of friable black soil within three years, on what was previously bare weathered red shale on his North Richmond farm (Hill 2002)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that no-till reduces fuel consumption in farming, but doesn't tilling help generate topsoil? You are increasing the organic content of the soil by mixing organic matter in.</p>
<p>Also, tilling could increase rainwater absorption because it makes the soil more porous. This could have an effect in reducing erosion because of the reduced run-off. Although the soil surface is pulverized, the organic matter gets pushed down into a deeper layer where it's not as vulnerable to erosion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! Schools like Purdue and Texas A&amp;M have huge farming and environmental studies, and are incredibly involved in educating farmers in sustainable agriculture. Modern farmers are very aware of the fact that they need to conserve their land in order to keep making money in the future. American farming theory is light years ahead of where it was in the 1920's, especially in regards to land conservation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While there's no denying that soil conservation is a critical long-term project, those numbers--while accurate--can create a much more pessimistic interpretation than is likely warranted. Pedogenesis, or soil development, isn't exactly known for its speed. But the thousand year number also includes many processes that might not be relevant for farming purposes, and obviously doesn't consider the implications of artificial intervention. That intervention can drastically lower the timeframes involved to ones that are economically viable.  </p>
<p>In the most basic of terms, the problem of soil degradation is the loss of key materials from the soil. To combat it, we need to put those materials--carbon, nitrogen, microorganisms, etc.--back. That's an engineering problem. And while it's clearly a difficult one, it's not an insurmountable one. Already, we can see many of the individual pieces that will likely be part  of those efforts. Biochar (along with other soil conditioners), for example, will likely play a significant role in the near future. And it's a carbon sink, which is nice. Continued improvement in conservation methods, genetic engineering of food crops, and other work will all play a part as well.</p></div>		</li>
