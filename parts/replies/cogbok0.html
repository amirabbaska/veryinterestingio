			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add a note about the PC's of that time that most people miss.  Back in the early days of computer technology everything was custom hardware.  Most of the pieces were designed to calculate a specific task whereas modern technology relies on generic processors that use software.  So even though that old hardware may not be as powerful as today's equipment it was extremely efficient and quick at calculating what it was designed to do.  If he doesn't understand point him towards a ICU 101 course where they can show him how fast electrical signaling can crunch numbers in a simple circuit.  </p>
<p>I want to add one more thing that your boss may not understand. The circumference of the word was <a href="http://www.windows2universe.org/citizen_science/myw/w2u_eratosthenes_calc_earth_size.html" target="_blank">calculated in 240BC</a>.  This is a perfect example of how powerful human ingenuity really is.  We can do a lot without the need for computers even thousands of years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your phone is more powerful than those computers, but it's running a (bloated) multitasking OS and dozens if not hundreds of (probably bloated) apps, managing Internet connections and telephony, GPS, wifi, bluetooth, and your fancy wallpaper. And (at least for Android) most of this is written in Java, so there's an extra abstraction layer for everything to go through.</p>
<p>NASA's computers, on the other hand, were running low-level (probably assembly) code which performed one task: calculate trajectories and angles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The computers on the moon landing were doing a lot more complex stuff than calculating angles, in addition to the assembly code, they were using a virtual machine to enable more complex calculations and additional instructions, asynchronous magic, and complex error handling that was able to automatically recover.  There's a pretty fascinating story about how the main programmer of the software on the apollo mission, Margaret Hamilton, saved the moon landing by including the capacity for the software to recognize when it was being overloaded by data, and prioritize.  A few minutes before landing, some radar piece malfunctioned and was giving the processor extra data.  Because of her foresight and genius in designing the program, the processor gave an alert and then launched a recovery program, which reprioritized the landing tasks over the tasks involving processing the extra data.  All before it was possible to take a software engineering class at a university, because Margaret Hamilton had only recently invented the phrase and it was not in wide use yet.</p>
<p>But, yeah, the phone you play angry birds with while you're on the toilet is impressive, too, I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely right. Orbital mechanics is not that computationally intensive, compared to many other fields. Remember what Jim Lovell told his young son when he asked who was driving the spacecraft on the way to the moon: &quot;I think that Isaac Newton is in the driver's seat right now&quot;. Newton would have been immediately able to grasp the computations used for the Apollo missions.</p>
<p>Another good example to use is the atomic bomb. Figuring out how to get the subcritical masses together quickly and cleanly enough to set off a real atomic explosion took a fair amount of number-crunching, but it was done with 1945 technology. The folks at Los Alamos would have fainted with joy if they could have had 1969 computers, but they got it done with what they had.</p>
<p>As for the hardware that your boss has seen in Florida, the Saturn V is actually a terrific rocket. Not a single launch failure, despite being by far the largest and most powerful thing of its kind ever built. (Contrast that with the Soviet N-1, their own shot at a manned moon launcher, which failed every single time, catastrophically on at least one occasion). The Saturn was a beast indeed.</p>
<p>Now, the LEM is pretty alarming. You can see one in the Air and Space Museum in DC, and it looks like it's made of aluminum foil and duct tape. It nearly was. The LEM was never designed to operate in any sort of atmosphere - we're not used to seeing anything like that. It was designed to be the lightest possible thing that would get two people down to the surface of the moon and back in one piece, and it would flex and crinkle as it pressurized (see Andrew Chaikin's book &quot;A Man on the Moon&quot; for some of the alarmed reaction of the early test missions!) Here's a good shot of the LEM with and without its skin: <a href="http://space.stackexchange.com/questions/5899/why-does-the-ascent-stage-of-apollo-11s-lunar-module-look-like-its-made-of-pap" target="_blank">http://space.stackexchange.com/questions/5899/why-does-the-ascent-stage-of-apollo-11s-lunar-module-look-like-its-made-of-pap</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And also relating to the hardware for Apollo: Maybe it's because I was a young boy or 9 or 10 when all this was going on but I've always thought that all the Apollo equipment was rather elegantly designed. Just to dismiss it as &quot;junk&quot; shows, to me at least, a complete lack of understanding of engineering, ergonomics and functionality.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, I think it's simply ridiculous to describe the Saturn V as &quot;a piece of junk.&quot; The F1 engines were nothing short of an engineering marvel. I've had the pleasure of working with a number of current-generation rocket designers, 30 year old guys, and their goal is to hopefully create something half as impressive as the F1s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had to make the F1s so large and powerful because we knew what would happen otherwise. We'd get something like the N-1, but with more engines and points of failure because we didn't have an engine with the kind of impulse and thrust to weight ratio that the Soviets had in the NK-33.</p></div>		</li>
