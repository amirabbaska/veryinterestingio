			<div class="markdown"><p>As a programmer, that's pretty accurate.</p>
<p>We could also actually estimate how long would it take to move a pillow instead of a freezer and apply that to the loading bar, but it takes a lot of work for something not that useful. So, it's usually not a priority.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, the move times can depend on the computer and even on what the computer is doing. If your movers are particularly good at moving heavy stuff then your 20 pillows to one chest prediction is going to be inaccurate and your bar's going to jump anyway. Or if one of your movers has to go work on something else halfway through, all of your predictions from the second half are going to be too short because you thought you had more movers.</p>
<p>So not only is it a lot of effort for something that doesn't matter much, it doesn't even give you thaaaat much benefit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In theory, every byte should be transferred at the same speed. In practice, it never happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation. Often I find &quot;ELI5&quot; is actually just a technical explanation. I can wrap my head around what you are saying. Thanks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you are saying is that sometimes the random rationale in my brain isn't ALWAYS complete nonsense, and often the simple logical answer is close enough. Haha. Thanks for the reply!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is fairly close to the truth. Updating the progress is always done intentionally. The developers have decided some points in the loading process that will send an update to the progress bar. They can be as simple as every loaded item being 1/n of the work done or estimated to more closely represent the actual time it took.</p>
<p>Things like sending data over a network are easy to estimate as bitrates stay fairly consistent over the course of the action. When you are performing operations with warying runtimes on the loaded data or you make multiple requests to an online source etc., estimating how much time each step takes becomes very difficult.</p></div>		</li>
