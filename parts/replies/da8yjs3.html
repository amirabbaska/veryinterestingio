<p>I take medication that kills my libido</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That feel, man. I was taking an anti-depressant and it COMPLETELY removed my sex drive. I forced myself off of them and I'm trying to recover my libido (it's been weeks; I'm at about 20% libido).</p>
<p>It removed more than just my sexual appetite, like it made me not care for the opposite sex at all. I had a girl, <em>waaaaay</em> out of my league, who was very into me, being assertive, vocalized her feelings- basically the perfect situation for me- yet I couldn't reciprocate anything because I couldn't care because of that damned medicine.</p>
<p>PRO TIP, kids: do your research before taking possibly personality altering medication (anti-depressants, anti-anxieties, etc).</p>
<p>EDIT: I REALLY REALLY hope that I didn't turn anyone off of meds that probably they should take because of my story. Any type of meds can not work for someone. This is just my experience with one. I'm sure there are pills out there for me that will work. If you're suicidal or have incapacitating panic/anxiety attacks PLEASE go to your doctor and get some help.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Having other issues regarding appetite and mood though. Just switched, fingers crossed that this one is a better match.</p></div>		</li>

<p>See, I avoided them for years because some people have that side effect. Started taking them and got it immediately. </p>
<p>But I don't want to kill myself and life is pretty good, so that's cool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, do what you gotta do. I was past my suicidal stage when I started to take them, but I was having <em>literal</em> incapacitating panic/anxiety attacks. Like my body involuntarily forcing itself into a fetal position with my hands and wrists crumpled inward where I couldn't move, I would go in and out of being numb (pricklies), unable to speak, and lose all motor functions.</p>
<p>Never had anything ever made me so terrified. Losing almost all functions of my body besides my bowels and bladder.</p>
<p>After a few times I decided &quot;fuck that&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was never really afraid of that specific side effect area (it happened then on Zoloft, Trazodone and many others) and can tell you compared to anti-psychotics especially longer term (year+) it's way nicer.</p>
<p>APs do not affect libido/sexual function as much (if at all) but are psychologically much deeper to set in having major personality effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's worth noting that birth control (at least in women!!) has been shown to decrease libido. It definitely affects me. And sucks because what's the point of preventing pregnancy if I dont even want to have sex! I don't know the science behind it, would be interesting if someone had insight on it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the form you're using (assuming hormonal here), it's either progesterone or progesterone/estrogen. Higher than normal amounts of either, but especially progesterone, suppresses androgen production in females. Low androgen levels will kill libido in both men and women. If you took a replacement dose of testosterone along with the BC, not only would your libido stay normal, but the side effects commonly associated with BC would be largely eliminated. But sex hormones by and large are still &quot;taboo&quot; in this society which sucks for men and women. I could go into more detail but it wouldn't be ELI5 at all, and even this explanation isn't very ELI5 </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you tell me more about increasing Testosterone intake on BC? Would that come with its own set of side effects since now you'd have more Testosterone than Androgen? </p>
<p>Don't worry about not being ELI5 when you're several comment chain deep. </p></div>		</li>

I also lost weight I didn't even realize the pill was making me hold onto and it's so much easier - so I'm very very happy with my choice.
