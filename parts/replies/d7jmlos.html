So many people are answering matter of factly but in reality their answers are best guesses.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neuroscience researcher here. While my publications are regarding hippocampal signaling via the endocannabinoid system, transduction has always fascinated me. Alhough my education and experience with it is <em>very</em> lacking. If I recall correctly, doesn't the brain have a fetish for finding edges of stuff? Maybe that is part of what's happening here, so many edges that the brain is just getting caught up trying to figure them out and the dots get filtered out of our awareness as irrelevant in comparison.</p>
<p>Totally pulled this out of my butt, only speculating. Thanks for your hypothesis with crowding, I think that's gotta be involved somehow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's partly due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_inhibition" target="_blank">parallel inhibition</a> which is a mechanism underlying attention to unusual visual features, like interruptions in a uniform visual field. Not to contradict /u/aggasalk, but I think that's part of what's haoppening here. Feel free to correct me if you spot an error, admittedly it's been a while since I took perceptual psychophysics.</p>
<p>Basically, since the dots are located at the juncture of grey lines, their location coincides with the location most subject to lateral inhibition. As soon as your fovea (central focal point of the eye) is not directly attending to an individual juncture, your peripheral vision is tasked with it, at which point lateral inhibition becomes much more of a factor do to reduced optical focus and cell density. You can see the effect of lateral inhibition at the junctures without black dots: they appear more white than the other grey line segments. This &quot;whitening&quot; causes the black dots to perceptually fade to grey, especially in your peripheral vision, which is the primary cause of the disappearance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that <em>kind</em> of thing might be part of the explanation; but lateral inhibition between what neurons, and where? and why so absolute in this case (lateral inhibition doesn't <em>usually</em> completely extinguish visual features)?</p>
<p>on the other hand, you can explain these kinds of illusions completely without lateral inhibition, using scale-space feature encoding models, i.e. you have lots of filters in early visual areas, LGN, V1, etc; these are wired into higher stages to pick out particular phase coincidences that are encoded as &quot;edges&quot;, and this is what the observer sees (a set of edges bounding surfaces); if such integration mechanisms are biased in the right way, they can inappropriately pick out edges where they don't exist, and fail to encode other features that are there. similar models can give you Mach bands, White's illusion, and other illusions that are traditionally - but without real evidence - classed as examples of lateral inhibition (actually White's illusion is one that's usually used as a counter-example).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Interesting side-note: I inverted my screen's colors after closing the illusion, then re-opened it. With the inverted colors, the dots appeared white, with a black background. And suddenly i could see every dot at the same time. This seems to make sense with your theory; because the dots are now white and therefor cannot be altered by this &quot;whitening&quot;</p>
<p>That raises another question though. What causes the whitening, and why does it not work the other way (i.e. darkening)? With the colors inverted, why do the white dots not perceptually fade to black?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there are models out there that can kind of predict what you see in a Hermann grid illusion (the posted image is one type of Hermann grid); these models always involve involve some relatively low-level processes that integrate different bits of information about local brightness, scale, and position; a critical ingredient is usually some strong nonlinearity in some step of the integration. but the thing is, you can build these models in many different ways and get similar results at the output, and very few such models have a real resemblance to actual neurophysiology (they are 'functional' or information-processing models).</p>
<p>edge perception, surface perception, depth perception, object perception, all work in this way, and crowding (etc) is an example of the limitations of those kinds of processes. the Hermann grid is another example. but we barely understand crowding, and it's a huge focus of vision research; the Hermann grid is a sideshow, and we don't really have anything but ungrounded models and hypotheses..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny fact but it is not the brain, but the eyes themselves who have a fetish for lines. In the oscilation of the eye, the rezeptors communicate whit each other, to find out where lines are, if they are in consense, then there is a line. So the picture that the brain gets is already partly processed, and lines get a higher resolution then the amount of rezeptors would allow as every line is not a collection of dots but more a vector Image made through analyzing dots in a vibrating picture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It kind of depends on your definition of the brain, though. In embryonic development, the retina develops directly out of the brain. Also due to the complexity of the processing that the retina does (one part of which you described), some consider the retina as brain tissue, part of the CNS, not PNS. </p>
<p>Semantics aside, I believe you're absolutely right. The eye is really an incredible thing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a little while ago this video about a new nvidia tech for vr which might be related to why this is happening:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/lNX0wCdD2LA" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/lNX0wCdD2LA</a></p>
<p>Essentially, as they create a sort of increased contrast bleed on the periphery of the display inside the headset, and away from where the eyes are looking (this technology requires eye motion tracking inside the headset), the tunnel vision effect created by a progressive lowering of the resolution away from the focal point is basically cancelled. That would seem to suggest that our eyes and/or brain are more sensitive to contrast and movement away from the center of the vision than detail itself. In that case, what is happening here is basically that the contrast between the grid and the dots is too low to register in the periphery whereas in the center detail is prioritized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this idea, if we include eye tracking in VR headsets we can easily lower the gpu power it takes to run VR video games!</p>
<p>Even better is that the eye moves really slow, and they don't really record information while they're moving, you have around 100 ms to figure out the eye is moving and where.</p></div>		</li>
