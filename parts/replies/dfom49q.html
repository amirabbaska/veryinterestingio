			<div class="markdown"><p>Icelandic names still work like this. Your surname is based on the first name of your parent of the same sex. </p>
<p>So, if you're Anders, son of Sigúr, you're Anders Sigúrsson, etc. </p>
<p>I'm pretty sure this is why Iceland has restrictions on what you can name your kids, since the generation after <em>them</em> would be stuck with the name too, like &quot;Ikeasdottir&quot;, or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Welsh names worked in the same way. Rhys Ap Gruffudd means Rhys the son of Gruffudd. This went on for centuries until everyone conformed with the English way in (I think) the 19th C. </p>
<p>You still find people with the old patronymic names, especially in fiercely Welsh-speaking communities. Some have kept them throughout and some have reverted and 'cymrucised' their names. </p></div>		</li>
