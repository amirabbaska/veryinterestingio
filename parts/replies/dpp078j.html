			<div class="markdown"><p>I get that sentiment completely. I live in the Vancouver, BC area, and in the suburb where my home is, you'd never be able to approach a pigeon, but downtown near a train station that's always got a lot of foot traffic, there's always a huge group of them chilling in one particular spot. I can get really close to them (I'm talking like centimetres away) if I'm just passing by, as most people are just trying to get from point A to B in that area, but if you walk directly toward them or try to interact with them they try to put some distance between themselves and you. They're used to the presence of people, so they're not alarmed unless the human is interacting directly with them.</p></div>		</li>
