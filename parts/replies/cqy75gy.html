			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, so what is causing the heat in, say, a re-entering space shuttle? Is it simply heating up of the atmosphere due to compression and relaying this heat onto the craft? </p>
<p>For our feather problem, the outcome would be the same: Since it has such a low mass, the negative pressure gradient because of the compression at the front of the feather would slow it down very fastly, in contrast to more massive objects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically pv=nrt, jack up p in front of the aircraft and the t goes up </p>
<p>There are torpedoes that use this to create boiling water in front of them and so the torpedo travels through a gas pocket and avoids a lot of the friction of going through water </p>
<p>Edit:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VA-111_Shkval" target="_blank">The torpedo in question</a></p>
<p>After reading more it looks like its a result of supercavitation, not how I thought it worked, but I'm no physicist...still really cool:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This speed is a result of supercavitation: the torpedo is, in effect, flying in a gas bubble created by outward deflection of water by its specially shaped nose cone and the expansion of gases from its engine.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The re-entering shuttle rapidly compresses the air in front of it, just as with a capsule or meteor.  This results in adiabatic heating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_process" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_process</a>, mostly behind the shockwave.</p>
<p>Both capsules and the shuttle have control authority (offset CoM for the capsule, lifting body and wings for the shuttle) that allow them to take reentry profiles that make things happen more gradually.  The shuttle, however, has more lift and can descend more slowly.  Thus, it uses insulating tiles to deal with the radiative and conductive heat.  Capsules deal with more intense heat, so use ablative heat shields that both remove heat through the ablation phase change and use the ablated material as a layer of insulation.</p>
<p>As for the feather, it really comes down to how quickly it slows down vs. how quickly it descends.  If a feather travelling nearly 8km/s (orbital velocity for low earth orbit) suddenly slammed into sea-level atmosphere, it would explode.  It seems that normal re-entry would be survivable, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The heat that the shuttle has to endure during re-entry is mostly due to the pressure wave that the shuttle creates in front of it as it moves at extreme speeds into the atmosphere. It is commonly thought that this heat is due to friction but the heat caused from friction is really not what causes the extreme temperatures on the shuttle. </p>
<p>Essentially air molecules in the atmosphere cannot get out of the way fast enough and so compress. Think of this like a speedboat going through the ocean. The small crest of water at the front of the hull as the boat goes through the water is a wave of water which is pushed by the boat. This wave of pressure occurs with the air molecules as the shuttle hurtles through the atmosphere.</p>
<p>We can use basic thermo-dynamics to model this phenomenon in order to better understand. </p>
<p>As an oversimplification let us assume the molecules in the atmosphere act as an ideal gas.</p>
<p>The relationship between the pressure and temperature of the gas is given by:</p>
<p>PV=nRT </p>
<p>Where P is pressure and T is temperature.</p>
<p>V is volume. The volume does change but the affect is negligible to the far greater affect of the pressure change. </p>
<p>So let's simplify to say:</p>
<p>P = ♧T</p>
<p>Where ♧ is nR/V but this has essentially no affect in this situation. We assume it remains constant for simplicity. </p>
<p>So, as the pressure increases, the temperature must also increase. The temperatures become so extreme that they facilitate in creating a plasma in front of the shuttle as it is &quot;falling&quot; through the atmosphere. </p>
<p>This heat/plasma is a problem for the space shuttle if it is absorbed by the structure of the space craft. The plasma would simply melt the space shuttle.</p>
<p>This disastrous situation is prevented by those infamous foam-like tiles that line the bottom of the shuttle. There are plenty of videos around of them being taken out of ovens glowing red hot and then immediately being handled. The person usually has an expectant look as if having just performed a stunning trick at the circus and awaiting the applause. </p>
<p>The tiles have an extremely low thermal conductivity. That is a measure of how well heat transfers through a material. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is patently false. Total density behind a shock can rise up to 6x its original value, IIRC. You can't use the Gas Law here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's only kind of true. This is a strategy used by spacecraft to reduce the problem of the friction heat accumulating, not something that is always the case. Cutting through the athmosphere like supersonic planes doesn't work because of too much friction heat, so someone had the unintuitive, but brilliant idea to make capsules <del><em>blut</em></del> <strong><em>blunt</em></strong> (<em>large cross-section rather than trying to minimize it</em>). That way, most of the heat &quot;stays&quot; in the shockwave and is transported away continuously.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: It's true for the spacecraft we built, but not necessarily for any arbitrary shaped object entering the athmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nuclear reentry vehicles came back pointy end first, with huge thermal loads. </p>
<p>Faget and the Langley group realized by turning the capsule around, the increased drag would actually decrease the heat rate, which was more important than the total heat load (the shuttle took this to the extreme, with a very long reentry and a low heat rate). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iisn't the biggest reason for ships burning up not their downward terminal velocity, but the horizontal velocity they had previously been carrying in order to remain in orbit?</p>
<p>So they don't burn up because they're traveling &quot;down&quot; at a couple hundred kilometers per hour, they burn up because they're traveling horizontally at a few thousand kilometers per hour (Google says 7.8km/s is required for Low Earth Orbit which, if my math is right, would be 28,080km/h).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but in essence it's all about the a) time the craft spends at which b) velocity at which c) altitude/air density and the negative heat transfer away from the craft that is associated with c). </p>
<p>Since the feather gets slowed down very gradually (the atmosphere density gradient with altitude is not very abrupt, but gradually), there shouldn't be any problem with burning up. And since the mass, again, is very small, it also doesn't take a long time to slow down, in which the feather could enter higher density regions where the friction values could become dangerous. The whole problem really calls for a simulation to attach values to the variables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like you're making a lot of assumptions.  I'd like to see someone decompose the actual dynamics of a feather moving through air at extremely high velocity and extremely low air density.  It must be possible to do a back of the envelope friction calculation or something to get a ballpark temperature.</p>
<p>My intuitive sense would be that becuase a feather has fairly high drag (compared to something like a space shuttle), and because proteins decompose at much lower temperatures than spacecraft heat tiles, there's a good chance the high velocity of entry would counteract any &quot;gradual slowing due to air pressure&quot; and turn the thing into a glob of proteinaceous slag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends, it's a different set of challenges. Traditional drag-slowed re-entry needs a lot of engineering to go into heat-proofing the hull and insulation the crew against the outside temperatures, but only requires a tiny bit of fuel to kick the process off. A vertical re-entry just requires a suitable array of parachutes for the actual re-entry but does require a lot more fuel to slow you down to a zero relative velocity to the Earth.</p>
<p>So slowing yourself down n the atmosphere is preferable from an efficiency perspective with our current technology, but a straight down re-entry is preferable from a safety perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but you would require a rather large amount of fuel to do that (almost as much as a normal rocket launch), which in turn would require lofting that rather large amount of fuel into orbit, which in turn would require a truly mind-boggling amount of fuel to be loaded into a rocket of utterly herculean proportions on the launchpad...</p>
<p>No, seriously, try to imagine a rocket that could loft a fully loaded <em>falcon 9</em> into orbit without burning <em>any</em> of the fuel in it...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about that: if they have the same trajectory (OP stated decaying orbit) but the feather has more air resistance, the feather will have proportionately more air resistance so it will decelerate more quickly and have to &quot;dump&quot; the kinetic energy more quickly. The kinetic energy per unit mass would be the same so the <strong>average</strong> amount of extra thermal energy would be the same but over a shorter time so there will be less time to radiate/conduct the extra energy.<br />
Of course a feather would have a larger surface area:mass ratio so it would be able to radiate the heat comparatively faster and with a larger craft, the thermal energy is mainly in the heat shields on the outside rather than more evenly distributed as it would be in the feather. The temperature at which the feather will burn and the specific heat capacities of the feather vs. the larger craft are also things that need to be taken into consideration.<br />
I may have made invalid assumptions about the way in which the air resistance varies and this is a vastly simplified model but I think it has its merits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I agree with you. However I think the presumption of OP is not entirely correct, since two different objects such as a feather and the ISS, for example, would have vastly different decaying orbits. </p>
<p>My main point in believing the feather is not destroyed by heat is that it would begin decelerating much sooner (at higher altitudes) than a more massive and more aerodynamic object would. That means that the trajectories would in fact not be the same, but the description of a decaying orbit is still correct. Of course the orbit for both objects at the same speed would be at the same altitude, but maybe OP imagined the feather being in a higher orbit where the feather wouldn't be slowed down relatively fast. But I think we are fishing beyond the scope of the question here.</p>
<p>Now if you assume the feather is put right besides the ISS and gets deacelerated on its own, you could be correct, but again I think even at the altitude of 150 km , the deaceleration of the feather isn't fast enough to generate enough heat (which is only a guess, simulations could tell us more).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a 1g feather at 8 000m/s (low earth orbit, gravitational potential energy would be relatively little) would have 32 000J of kinetic energy which would raise a gram of water by 7 000K (ignoring state changes and other relevant stuff) so there is definitely enough energy to destroy a feather. The question is whether or not the energy can be lost to the surroundings before the it gets hot enough to catch fire. That will depend on the resistance provided by the atmosphere which will affect the shape of the trajectory etc.<br />
Edit: fixed maths</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>If I can wave my hands as well for a moment here, intuitively a non-aerodynamic feather experiences a lot of friction with the air.  Wouldn't this therefore imply that the heat generated at high speed on contact with a light atmosphere be higher than that of a more aerodynamic object?</p></div>		</li>
