			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but remove it entirely, and you lose the most stable and trustworthy forms of investment that exists. If you paid off the national debt, the government would still issue more bonds so that the baseline investment instrument didn't disappear from the economy. The financial industry would beg them to do so. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds too good to be true. Anyone with knowledge of how things actually work care to comment on why this isn't true? Or is the figure of $10 trillion too much to fathom any entity possessing at this time and making the point irrelevant.</p>
<p>Now having typed out this comment, I feel the latter is true, but lets play what if...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Low, but that's not really the point.  US bonds are basically the lowest risk investment other than a savings account, and more importantly bond returns tend to inversely correlate with stock market return.  Bonds are a hedge against poor stock market performance.</p>
<p>They also pay a fixed interest rate for the duration of the bond, which is useful for a retired person who is more concerned with paying bills out of their investment than growing the portfolio value.  The &quot;risk&quot; with US bonds isn't that they are going to tank, it's really that the market/economy will change and higher rate bonds will be available (e.g. who would pay you $10k for your $10k bond paying 1% if they can buy a $10k bond paying 2% direct from the government?) and you'll miss potential earnings.  If you've got enough interest income to pay your expenses in the last years of your life that's not really a concern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this.  I find portfolio risk ratios really interesting.  Bonds would be a safe but conservative investment to balance out some riskier but potentially highly profitable market action.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something like 1 to 2%. Very small so that people will invest their money in companies (stocks) because you can make more money there which stimulates the economy. As the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, it's more attractive to just buy bonds (because they aren't risku like the stock market) which takes money out of companies and slows economic growth. This is essentially how the Fed helps us out of recessions and controls rapid inflation by setting the interest rates based on how are economy is doing.</p>
<p>Like in the 80s before the crash, bonds would give you something crazy like 20% because the Fed wanted to slow the stock market badly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't even begin to speculate about what the end results would be. I'm not sure that it would be complete economic collapse, but I don't think anything good would come of it.</p>
<p>As to your second question, it's not nearly as bad as you would think. As much as it's used as a wedge political issue, it actually makes a ton of sense for the US to borrow that money. </p>
<p>Yes, the debt's somewhere over $18 trillion, but annual revenue for the US government is over $3 Trillion a year. Due to the stability of the US's economic system, and the absolutely massive resources of the US as a country, we can essentially borrow money at a negative real interest rate. That means that borrowing that money and investing it into the economy in pretty much any practical way makes the US more money than spending our own money to do the same thing would earn. </p>
<p>So yeah, we'd pretty quickly return to a heavy debt load, but it'd be due to smart economic policy, not fundamental problems in our economy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One potentially unforeseen consequence of paying off the US debt would be that markets would scramble to find alternatives that are safe &quot;risk-free&quot; investments. The market actually has quite a high demand for US debt for the simple reason that it is seen as being so bulletproof.  Risk free assets that provide modest returns are extremely useful in many areas of finance as a tool, and removing the availability of the debt would probably put a strain on the market.
You might even see bond yields become slightly negative when bond prices go up as desperate investors try to buy up the remaining debt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We would immediately go back in debt because there is a deficit in the federal budget.</p>
<p>As long as the spending made on that debt returns more money over the term of that debt than is owed, this is actually the entirely rational thing to do.</p></div>		</li>
