The reason Roman soldiers were loyal to their general and not Rome is because most of them weren't even Roman, but more importantly, the general paid the soldiers. </p></div>		</li>

<li>
<p>Caesar never became Emperor; he became dictator for life. The first Roman emperor was Augustus, his nephew.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caesar's troops were raised about half in Roman territories, and half in northern Italy which did not hold Roman citizenship. However, they were not considered &quot;barbarian&quot; troops as the term used in the later Roman Empire</p>
</li>
<li>Caesar did not start it. It started with Marius and Sulla, and the addition of The Head Count (poorer) citizens into the army. Their fortunes became intertwined with their general's after the Senate refused pay outs for retirement ( land, mostly)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is and isn't. They weren't from Rome, most of them, but at that time they came from the provinces, which mostly  consisted of what is today the Italian peninsula. They weren't &quot;as Roman as the Romans&quot;, but technically those who didn't come from outside Italy were Roman citizens. Provinces included also Greece and parts of France and Palestine and northern africa for example. So of course a Greek soldier wouldn't hold so much for the Eternal city itself as an Roman soldier. </p></div>		</li>

A lot of constitutions around the world mirror the US Constitution, however armed coups are very common but the US has never had one afaik. What multitude of factors prevent or discourage US armed forces to displace the government but not other countries? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may have an idea: the United States was founded on a separatist movement, not a coup and so it's in our national identity to rebel/seek separation/independence. If you look at it that way, then we have had at least two wars (Revolutionary and Civil) because of that national identity. Even to this day, there are still separatist movements within the USA. </p>
<p>I assume actual coups may have been tried/schemed in the past, but at this point in our history, there is a vast majority of US military personnel who would fight to defend the republic against domestic coups.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, we had the Civil War, which was pretty nasty. But nobody was trying to overthrow Lincoln; in fact he was defending the Constitution by preventing the South from seceding.</p>
<p>Anyway, we're really getting out of my area here so if somebody else who knows more than I do wants to tackle this one, they should do it! That said, I would love to attribute the survival of the US solely to the genius of the founding fathers in writing the Constitution and setting a good example of the peaceful transfer of power between parties, Washington stepping down after two terms, etc. But if I really had to guess, I think it has to do with the US basically being created brand new as a country. Trying to impose a constitutional democracy on, say, Germany after 2000 years of history is going to meet a lot more resistance, both in terms of power bases that don't want things to change and the complexity of racial identity in Europe, where you might feel like you're part of a &quot;people&quot; that doesn't match any national boundary.</p>
<p>I dunno, I don't have any, like, evidence for that. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that the idea of peaceful transition of power is a core part of the American ethos, and that almost every military man/woman knows this -- such that they would virtually never even think of a military coup.</p>
<p>However, that specific aspect of the American ethos seems to degrading based on the comments in this thread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually know one person who wanted Obama to take over the government to stop the Republicans from holding the government hostage.  </p>
<p>And no, I do not suggest that this is a common viewpoint from the Left, but I was surprised to hear that from a progressive.  </p>
<p>There are definitely still people out there who don't really understand why we don't roll the tanks in, or why we tolerate the gridlock that we have in DC.  To that I answer that gridlock is by far preferable to what we'd get with a government created via coup, no matter how progressive they intended to be.</p>
<p>It is important that both sides of the political sphere get a sense of perspective about what is happening.  The inconveniences of governance are never worse than having your country run by those who take power when they have been granted any sort of resources that allow them to challenge the duly elected government.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you about it being part of the ethos. That stops the military in a number of ways. First, a military overthrow would likely meet civilian resistance and be unable to govern. That makes a coup less appealing. But even more importantly, the people who comprise the military share that ethos. They do not by and large want to rule by force. I've long thought the two most important things George Washington ever did were stepping down from the presidency and his defusal of Â the Newburgh Conspiracy and subsequent disbanding of the Continental Army.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because our ethos of &quot;inclusiveness&quot; is being eroded day by day. My father is an immigrant who was nationalized at 18 after taking his oath. This was a core belief of what made America &quot;The United States&quot;; we come from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences but we all want one thing: equal freedoms for all.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, that ethos has become &quot;all people are equal, but some are more equal than others&quot; and, while completely hyperbolic, it makes me sad to think that the &quot;nation of immigrants&quot; is now even slightly xenophobic.</p>
<p>&quot;Give us your tired, your poor, your huddles masses yearning to breathe free.&quot; What happened to that?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe you weren't around when Nixon left office, but there was a brief instance when a military man, General Alexander Haig asserted &quot;I'm In Charge&quot;. He was countermanded by civilian leaders, whether Gerald Ford or someone else quickly, and I don't that there was ever any real indication that he was trying to seize power, but the incident did raise this issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haig said that not when Nixon resigned, but while he was secretary of state in the Reagan administration after the Reagan assassination attempt. Not quite the same situation, although he was criticized for the amount of power he exercised in the Nixon White House ( as chief of staff) in the last months of Nixon's presidency. In both cases however, he was acting in a civilian and not a military role.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should also be said that George Bus, the vice president was in the air flying back to Washington when Haig took the podium and announced that after Reagan was shot.  Haig WAS in the chain of presidential succession but not until after the VP, the Speaker of the House, and the President Pro Tempe of the Senate.   He was definitely jumping the gun, but the world didn't know who all was involved in the assassination attempt (and many thought the Russians were involved) so some people viewed Haig's declaration as a message to the world that there was no interruption in the control of nuclear weapons should anyone attempt an attack during the chaos in the hours after Reagan was shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it has been corrected that this event happened during the Reagan administration and not Nixon one, The amendment that created the &quot;clear order of who takes over for the president&quot; wasn't created until after the Nixon presidency. Specifically because Gerald Ford was able to become president after Nixon resigned and he was never elected. He is and forever will be the only unelected President of United States.</p></div>		</li>
