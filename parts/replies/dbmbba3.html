			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I'm on mobile so I can't find it but there is a documented case of an individual hurt in an accident that severely damaged his frontal lobe.  He was pretty normal except for extreme mood swings.  It's one of those cases you learn about in psych 101 classes it's that well known.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, in some dreams I suddenly see something that makes me realise &quot;wait, I'm in a dream&quot; (an example was seeing a friend with a cyclops eye) and then I can start to control my actions in my dreams. I believe it's called lucid dreaming.</p></div>		</li>
