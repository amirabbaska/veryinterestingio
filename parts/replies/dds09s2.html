<p>The illigal market of stolen art piecies is a very importanto source of money for ISIS too. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/feb/26/western-art-funding-terrorism-isis-middle-east" target="_blank">x</a> <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/18/italian-mob-trades-weapons-with-looted-art-from-isis-in-libya.html" target="_blank">x</a> Although this may not be what you (r/SirolfUpaw) were thinking about, let's just think about how easier it's to acquire a stolen painting in Europe or America than to get a statue from a far away country.</p>
<p>Obviously less famous/precious items are easier to sell if you know the right people, but the theft of more &quot;interesting&quot; items is done for commission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also is a token representation of &quot;yup, I'm offering you a $100,000 stolen painting, so, I'm probably on the level with you and not a cop that just happens to have authentic $100,000 artwork to hand out&quot; as opposed to $100,000 in cash, which can still hide motives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't even say they like looking at it. I think they probably like being the person who has it. </p>
<p>Let's say you had Pablo Picasso's Nude, Green Leaves and Bust in your house. At first you'd probably like looking at it for whatever reason you did but eventually it would just be background to you as you make coffee or watch TV or walk past it to head out for the day.</p>
<p>What you get out of it is that it's YOURS. No one else has it and it's incredibly valuable.</p></div>		</li>
