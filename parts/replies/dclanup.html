<p>Could you (or someone) expand on this a bit or suggest some quality reading?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought all you had to do was need a vector that pointed &quot;downwards&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The electromagnetic field can be described by a single 4D vector in spacetime. The gravitational field on the other hand (or the metric if you wish) must be described by a rank-2 tensor. You can loosely think of it as a 4x4 matrix in this case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there's an operation you can do with tensors that you can't with normal vectors? I'm confused because matrices <em>are</em> vectors (which I'm sure you know, but I'm not sure what distinction is being drawn).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a perfect explanation, but the time derivative of the dipole moment associated to a mass distribution is just the total linear momentum,  which is conserved. Radiation scales like the second time derivative, so you get nothing from the dipole. </p>
<p>For electric charge, the time derivative of the dipole moment need not be conserved. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe this is the physical explanation.</p>
<p>Talking about rank-1 vs rank-2 tensors is obscuring the physics---they are mathematically represented a certain way because the underlying physics works a certain way, it is not an explanation, but a fancier re-iteration of the same empirical phenomenon. </p>
<p>An electric dipole is, in principle, a positive charge, slightly offset from a negative charge.   Oscillate this relative position and you get EM radiation.</p>
<p>There is no negatively gravitationally charged mass-energy as far as we are aware.  If there were, then I believe that presumably we could make dipole gravitational radiation, and likely with quite a bit more efficiency than gravitational waves in the universe we know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. GR leaves open the mathematical possibility of negative mass which would act repulsively. Also, some matter fields act repulsively anyway (e.g., dark energy) if their associated mass density and pressure satisfy a certain relationship. </p>
<p>The real difference is that the center of mass (mass dipole) has a constant second time derivative. The center of electric charge does not. </p></div>		</li>
