<blockquote>
<p>if you used firehoses that could spray water at nearly the speed of light, you could probably shut the thing off and eventually freeze us all</p>

<p>Wouldnt firing anything at near the speed of light accomplish this as well? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The CNO cycle is not a  &quot;Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen fusion sequence&quot; and does not &quot;burn the oxygen&quot;.</p>
<p>First off if it was a Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen fusion sequence it wouldn't burn the oxygen, it would be burning Carbon into Nitrogen and Nitrogen into Oxygen. Oxygen would be the product not the fuel. Secondly the CNO cycle is actually a Hydrogen-Helium fusion sequence that uses Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen as catalysts.</p>
<p>This is made clear in <strong>the first sentence in your source</strong>...</p></div>		</li>
