			<div class="markdown"><p>Although my ENT doc didn't say so, I'm guessing that's what I have. I presented with complaints about constant throat clearing, especially after eating. He suspected my nose was draining into my throat after eating and that irritated my throat enough to cause phlegm build-up.</p>
<p>He prescribed Ipratropium Bromide (nasal spray) and that has actually helped quite a bit.</p></div>		</li>
