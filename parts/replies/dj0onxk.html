			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting that these days ghost songwriting is actually ghost songwriting, not just writing a song someone else sings but you get the songwriting credit -- instead the songwriting credit gets sold as well, because often thesedays the big names want to have a PR narrative that they write their own songs. This is especially true of big pop stars who cater to preteens.</p>
<p>When it says Katy Perry or Taylor Swift wrote something: guess what they didn't (usually.)</p>
<p>It's kind of offensive for the songwriting community to be honest, but a paycheck is a paycheck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't know you could legally say you'd written a song you didn't? My understanding of what was happening is that songs would say &quot;by Taylor Swift and Monkeysneed,&quot; and the dirty secret is that Monkeysneed wrote 99% of it and Taylor Swift made one inconsequential change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks to auto tune and concerts with playback you don't need a voice anymore and a PR-Team can create you a public image. So you only need to look good.<br />
If you look to the past songwrite and interpreter always got separate credit. But this has fadad away.</p></div>		</li>
