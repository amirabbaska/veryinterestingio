			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  I went a 70mm showing of Lawrence of Arabia and it was absolutely the best picture I have ever seen.  Definitely one of the best films ever produced in technicalo achievement, writing, and acting. </p>
<p>When MASH was on Netflix the first 2 seasons looked horrible, and then it suddenly got much sharper in the third season.  Do you know if they just had a bad scan for the first seasons, or if there was a change in filming?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea about MASH but one possible guess is the first two series might have been shot on notorious Eastman 7381/7383 which was prone to fade and rot. They introduced low fade film in 1979.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saw Lawrence of Arabia in 70mm in a special screening in some town north of Dallas around 1990. The opening scene was just jaw dropping. Friend in film studies at UT-Austin found out about it, he said the theatre was the only one in Texas that could handle the reels, at the time.</p></div>		</li>
