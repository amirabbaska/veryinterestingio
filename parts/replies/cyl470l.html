			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't necessarily mean a &quot;RGB-style&quot; mapping may not be possible; if you take out red then a color is going to look vastly different. There could still be a mapping, just something like &quot;RBGASDFHJKLZXCVBNM-style&quot; mapping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well... the trouble is that our brain circuits for odor processing are a lot more like the video game puzzles where you flip a switch and a set of lights switch their on/off state. So removing an odorant doesn't just take away G, it takes away G and makes B much larger and A larger which in turn makes R smaller and S smaller. But we have no way of predicting which letters relate to eachother (the spatial relationship for each odorant receptor as it projects into the brain is not consistent on the fine scale where lateral inhibition occurs), nor can we predict the strength of that interaction.</p>
<p>In many ways, how I process an odor is similar but distinctly different from how you or anyone else would (though eventually with 3 billion people on the planet we're getting close to having a odor map twin out there).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but that <em>still</em> doesn't mean that its impossible to have a mapping. Even with the restrictions you describe, you can still generate a mapping &lt;-&gt; scent relationship where the scent is perceived differently by people.</p></div>		</li>
