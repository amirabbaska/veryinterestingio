<p>Due to the weapon focus effect (in negative experiences we remember central details better than peripheral ones), this might seem so, but there is a ton of research showing that even trauma memories might not be better than positive ones (Dorthe Berntsen would be one researcher to look up).</p>
<p>It is true though that emotional memories 'store better' (what do you mean by that actually? Better encoding, memory maintenance, or retrieval? Because these are separate processes involving the hippocampus) - the hippocampus and amygdala work together when encoding highly emotional experiences. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My neuroscience curriculum nor books went into the questions you raise here. The memory consolidation proces is not completely understood. So although details are sometimes memorized incorrectly, there are also ptsd cases where memories are relived. Thus, the subject remains under investigation. </p></div>		</li>
