			<div class="markdown"><p>well, not saying coldeeze specifically does this, other than their marketing claims.  </p>
<p>Just mean, the hopes of most of those cold killing remedies, all the zinc and fluids and oj and whatever, is simply aimed at providing your body with the materials it needs to do what it does naturally</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean I think medication technically could, antivirals are just ridiculously expensive and it's not exactly priority one to try making safer ones to treat something that goes away in a weak or two and just gives you the sniffles.</p>
<p>For reference, some herpes medications cost 150$ a day. The big Hep C medication cost 84'000 dollars over the year and something long treatment period.</p>
<p>Antibiotics don't cost nearly as much. Antivirals aren't usually worth it when you can clear the virus itself and the side effects things since viruses generally hijack our own machinery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cost is part, but we'd also just be throwing random antivirals at an unknown virus.  Bacteria we can culture and find an antibiotic that it's susceptible to.  (Though we do that too often as it is)  A cold virus changes too much, and your body fights it off in time anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We wouldn't be throwing random antivirals. People are looking into this stuff. </p>
<p>The most common causes of the cold are part of the picornaviridae family, specifically rhinoviruses. That means they do all have the same methods of entry, replication. See my other reply to this, there is research on this stuff, it is not a priority because the viruses are usually so easy to clear ourselves.</p>
<p>Cold virus changes sure, but another huge part of the whole &quot;no vaccine for it thing&quot; is that even if it somehow didn't change, there's over 200 virus serotypes, not all of the same family, causing symptoms of the common cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. While although it may not be worth as much putting lots of money in to find a immediate cure, regardless there isn't one for the &quot;cold&quot; because it mutates quickly, effectively, and efficiently, and the sheer number of viruses we call the cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm well aware how many viruses make up the common cold and how viruses mutate rapidly. Though even with rapid mutation seen in viruses, you can often find more conserved regions. I never said there'd be a &quot;cure&quot;, if we had antivirals, they'd merely reduce symptoms and infection time. Vaccines would be near impossible to make(though it depends on the virus family).</p>
<p>For instance, look at adenovirus. It has the potential to cause common cold symptoms, and worse. The army distributes a vaccine for it(not sure which serotypes), while the general populace gets none. While the virus spreads quickly, the regular person isn't doomed by a sick day or 2, but it is pretty terrible in crowded army environments.</p>
<p>Although the common cold symptoms usually also comprise of rhinovirus(picornaviridae) and coronaviruses, you do have other virus families thrown in like adeno.</p>
<p>Make no mistake though, people are looking into antivirals for these things. They just aren't top priority. The types of drugs they look at are also very general: capsid inhibitors, proteases, drugs that would affect viral entry, etc.</p></div>		</li>
