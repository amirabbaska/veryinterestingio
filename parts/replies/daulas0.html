The amount of estimated resources left can change as new deposits are discovered, or even as existing sources are found to have more or less capacity than previously estimated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you even read the article you quoted?</p>
<p>&quot;Even though 365 years of reserve supply sounds very comforting, the point of the EV and stationary storage revolutions is that current demand will shoot up, way up, if these revolutions do happen. The 100 Gigafactories scenario could come true. And if that happens, the 365-year supply would be less than a 17-year supply (13.5 million tons of reserves divided by 800,000 = 16.9 years).&quot;</p>
<p>Here's my two cents:</p>
<p>&quot;...at current production rates&quot; should always raise a red flag. This means the data assumes zero growth over the entire 365 year period.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigafactory_1#Output_goals" target="_blank">annual output of Tesla's Gigafactory</a> is predicted to be the same as the entire global production in 2013. Tesla has already announced they're going to build a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/08/tesla-adds-german-firm-grohmann-to-european-operations" target="_blank">second Gigafactory</a> in Europe.</p>
<p>So, our consumption of lithium is going to explode over the next few decades. The &quot;365 years&quot; number is totally unreliable (which is stated in the article you linked to).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The average lithium cost associated with Li-ion battery production is less than 3% of the production cost. Intrinsic value for the Li-ion recycling business currently comes from the valuable metals such as cobalt and nickel that are more highly priced than lithium. Due to less demand for lithium and low prices, almost none of the lithium used in consumer batteries is completely recycled ... Recycled lithium is as much as five times the cost of lithium produced from the least costly brine based process. It is not competitive for recycling companies to extract lithium from slag, or competitive for the OEMs to buy at higher price points from recycling companies.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But recycling cannot offset growth - only current consumption. If consumption increases 200%, where is the extra 100% coming from? If consumption keeps growing and the supply is finite, it will eventually be exhausted.</p>
<p>Edit - by &quot;exhausted&quot; I mean further growth will be impossible.</p>
<p>Edit 2 - When I said &quot;consumption increases 200%&quot;, I really mean 100%, since that requires supply to double in order to meet it.</p></div>		</li>
