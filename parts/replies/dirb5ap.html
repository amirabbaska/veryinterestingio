			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there is a pretty significant overlap between MLM's and the kind of people that follow or believe in &quot;prosperity gospel&quot;. My parents were involved in Amway several years ago and they would listen to these motivational tapes that were recorded at big Amway conventions. These were just like a Joel Osteen church service or one of those big arena revivals that you see on television. My experience of Amway was also that religious, particularly Christian, faith was interwoven into everything they do. Amway itself may be on overtly Christianity oriented organization but there was definitely a lot of talk about the &quot;blessings&quot; of a successful Amway operation. It was really off-putting to me as a child because it was very obvious that they had turn the worship of money into something aspirational and positive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's probably the best tl;dr for MLMs. As to why people do it: Same reason people buy lotto tickets. They suck at math and <em>truly</em> believe the universe cares about them -- that their 'hard work' and 'good character' will pay dividends. It's one of mankind's oldest delusions. MLMs are growing right now because of a convergence of several social trends. </p>
<p>Our standards of education are falling like a lead balloon. There's active hostility towards science and eschewing the opinions and thoughts of intelligent people. A lot if this is fueled by the popular media portraying scientific results as either absurd (&quot;A glass of wine a week might be good for baby!&quot;) or balanced -- ex. the &quot;global climate change debate&quot;. There is no debate, and your kid's going to be born stupid. But pop media can't figure out how to convey information in a non-adversarial context. If it's not controversial, it's not news. &quot;World to slowly cook itself until everyone dies&quot; isn't as interesting a headline as &quot;World ending because Europe won't re-negotiate Paris Accords, sources close to president say&quot;. There's also a huge slant in viewpoint caused by our unique political system -- because of the electoral college, only about 28% of the total population has a vote that counts, and most of them are in rural areas. Rural areas have a few things urban areas don't have: Lower wealth, lower levels of education... and lots and lots of God. So the popular media gets huge donations and support for anything that will sway the opinions of people living there on our mass media -- which gives a highly unrealistic and slanted view. </p>
<p>Mix all this together and you've got a mix of people that (a) don't have good critical thinking skills, (b) are skeptical of any fact-based methodology, and (c) are poor. It's the perfect breeding ground for these sorts of endeavors -- because deprived of those things, all manner of &quot;faith-based&quot; idiocy can bloom. MLM's surge in popularity is a consequence of this ongoing skewing of social values, and our country is uniquely vulnerable to it because our election system is uniquely broken. </p></div>		</li>

In fact, when I worked them, they had to settle with the recording industry (RIAA)  for millions of dollars because they were illegally using songs without obtaining copyrights. </p>

<p>They would also keep people up very late into the night and started early the next day, making sure people took Amway's &quot;Triple X&quot; energy pills.  By Sunday, those people were zombies and many of them &quot;saw God&quot; during their Sunday services.  I know - I filmed them.</p>
<p>How blatant was Amway?  </p>
<p>I was sent to a video store one day to purchase Disney's Aladdin so they could use &quot;A Whole New World&quot; for a mix down during a Triple Diamond  Weekend convention.   </p>
<p>We would shoot highlights of the weekend, they would put the song to them and sell tapes for $20 without ever having the rights.   On the last day of the convention, every one of those 17,000 people in attendance bought it because of Amway's  &quot;Edification Process.&quot;  In other words - do you want to be successful or not?  Buy the tape.</p>
<p>BTW - the founder of Amway if you didn't know?  Richard Devoss.</p>
<p>His daughter - Betsy - Secretary of Education and friends of Donald Trump.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, first off she needs to change denominations. The Church of God, Pentecostal Movement and Charismatic Movement (all the same) are run by evil con men. The Bible doesn't support any of their prosperity gospel. Get your mom to read Mathew 5:17 and then the whole book of Job. Afterwards ask her how that relates to prosperity preaching. Its not compatible is it mom? It's directly opposed to the teachings in red letters, the actual words of Jesus isn't it? It's what is called tempting god in the Bible and in itself is sinful. There has never been a prosperity preacher who wasn't an evil piece of shit and every single one of them will burn in hell. The speaking in tongues is fake and it's a mockery to god. That's another sure fire way to know someone isn't saved when they speak in gibberish and collapse on purpose and pretend it's a divine revelation. It's such evil vile shit and totally foreign to the teachings of the Bible.</p>
<p>These MLM things are sort of pyramid schemes in which the people who get in first can sometimes profit because they take in money from their inferiors. For late comers it functions essentially as a pyramid scheme. Instead of selling a shitty product that no one wants why not convince her to start selling cars. If she can make $500 a month selling radiation free phone cards or whatever dumb shit.... how the fuck would a phone even work without radiation, she could make $5000 a month selling cars. If not cars, some kind of real desirable product. That and stop being Pentecostal. If she is resistant or likes her pastor a lot atleast get her to talk to a Southern Methodist preacher and set up a quick private scriptural debate over the differences in the religion. The penecostal won't do it because it's an a theological non sense cult and the guy running the show knows it. He knows more about sales and motivational speaking than he does scripture, I'll bet you that one for sure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Many pyramid schemes attempt to present themselves as legitimate MLM businesses. Some sources say that all MLMs are essentially pyramid schemes, even if they are legal. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) states: &quot;Steer clear of multilevel marketing plans that pay commissions for recruiting new distributors.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's surprising that they haven't become illegal yet. The principle the business is built on essentially relies on a majority of people in the business to be in debt to the business. If everyone in the world was in a single MLM (Amway, for example), only 1% of the entire world's population would make more than 12k per year, and that one percent would all be making more than 100k per year if everyone had the same size downlines. Essentially, if you want to succeed in this business, you must have people under you who are in debt to you. In order for them to get out of debt, they must have people under them who are in debt to them. It's incredible that the FTC hasn't seen this. It's an unsustainable business model, and leaves countless people in worse shape than they were before they joined.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a pretty brief and brutal break down I've used on people successfully before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General rule of thumb.</p>
<p>If there was that much money to be made selling this shit, why are they offering it to you when they could pay you minimum wage to stand behind a cash register in a retail store?</p>
<p>Answer: There isn't that much money to be made.</p>
<p>Follow up; Every sales job ever has you selling somebody elses shit. Either on commission, or with performance goals, or both. If they want you to pay them to sell their shit instead of them paying you to sell their shit, you are the customer not the salesman, and its a scam.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as a person who has worked for the corporate office of a MLM company, the reason they don't want to sell in retail stores is because it us extremely expensive to sell in retail.  Itcost a lot of money in packaging, real estate, overhead, and marketing to sell products in stores, then you only get 50% of the retail price.. IF they sell it.</p>
<p>To make a product for a store, you have to design very expensive packaging that sells to the customer exactly what the product does and why you should buy it.
that packaging by itself adds $2 - $3 to the retail cost of any given product.</p>
<p>You also then have to pay for ads and commercials and pay retail stores to place it in premium spots so that your sales go up, on top of paying for sales people to actually convince the stores to stock your product in the first place.</p>
<p>with a MLM style business, the products are sold through people who don't get compensated for their marketing, only their sales, and that commission is way cheaper than going through a retail outlet.</p>
<p>granted, this was a company that focuses more on selling products than selling businesses. companies like Amway, whose focus is more on selling a business than selling their products, and Herbalife, who forces salesmen to buy their own inventory, really puts a stain on the entire business model.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Labor expenses are the <a href="http://smbtn.com/bizratios/" target="_blank">most expensive part of running a business</a>, and depending on the industry, the difference is staggering. In many countries the tax burden of hiring an employee can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll_tax" target="_blank">easily go over 25% of the cost of labor</a>.</p>
<p>Packaging and marketing are fixed costs, and if you do them well, you only need to do them every once in a while, meaning their costs are spread over many months/years, thus making them even cheaper.</p>
<p>So: if they are not paying you to stand behind a cashier, then the product doesn't make enough money to cover labor costs. So they've cut away the most expensive part of the business and &quot;relabeled&quot; it so people who don't understand how business works sells their products basically for free.</p></div>		</li>
