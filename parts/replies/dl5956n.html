			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite the same but two of Saturn's moons, Epimetheus and Janus, have roughly the same orbit as each other. This <a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2006/janus-epimetheus-swap.html" target="_blank">article</a> explains it better than I could. Another possibility is that a planet could orbit in earth's Lagrange points. These are relatively stable points in earth's orbit with one being on the opposite side of the sun. However these points aren't entirely stable and I imagine that a planet sized object wouldn't be able to stay there. Smaller asteroids do cluster at these points and NASA even sent a satellite to one of them.</p></div>		</li>
