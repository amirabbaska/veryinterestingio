			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be higher up. To go into a little more detail, the bacterium forms a spore when the rice is initially cooked and survives the heat. When the rice cools to room temperature, but is not refrigerated, the bacteria &quot;emerge&quot; from the spore state and start to form the toxin. When the rice is reheated the bacterium may die or reform a spore, but the toxin remains. Refrigerating within an hour or so prevents the organism from being able to grow/produce enough toxin to make you sick. It's very quick acting (unlike most food borne illness takes a few days before symptoms), with some instances occurring before a meal ends. Also, unlike a toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, the toxin from Bacillus cereus probably won't kill you, but it will make you want to die for about 12-24 h.</p>
<p>I can add sources, but I do that all day and am feeling lazy. So please just take my word for it as a PhD in food microbiology. But if not, I'll get off my ass and find some sources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say I cook a batch of rice to be consumed at a later date. (within a week) is it best to instantly freeze it or refrigerate?  Is there more of a chance for the bacteria be spread in the cool down within a refrigerated environment as it is a slower process?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And I just realized I didn't fully answer your question. You can do either. A refrigerator works fast enough as long as it's not a HUGE batch of rice. It just depends on when I'll eat it. The next couple of days... refrigerator. 4 or 5 days... probably freezer. A lot of people have this idea that you shouldn't put hot food in a fridge because it raises the temperature of the fridge but literally, it's job is to cool your food. You won't raise your refrigerator temperature enough (if it's working properly) to cause a food safety risk to the rest of your food. It will cool back down well before that happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, cool it down as fast as possible. Ideally, put it in smaller containers when you refrigerate it (instead of the whole pot) so rice in the middle cools down quickly, too. We generally say you have about 2 hours to leave things at room temperature...after that, you're increasing your odds of getting sick. Now I say increasing, because most times you probably won't get sick. But why risk it?</p>
<p>When outbreaks occur at restaurants, it's usually because they made rice up for the day, or even used yesterday's rice, and left it out at room temperature. They pull a glob of cooked room temperature rice, toss it in a wok for an order of fried rice, and while the bacteria die the toxin remains. So in reality, in most cases it will probably take more than two hours. But in my house, food that is not actively being eaten is in the refrigerator (which has a thermometer inside to make sure it's at the right temp!).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it sat out overnight at room temp then I reheated it for breakfast (maybe dinner?) It was years ago. I remember the lesson from it if not the details, I never reheat rice at home now just to be sure.</p></div>		</li>
