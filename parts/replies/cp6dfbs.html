			<div class="markdown"><p>Generic coin mining. Basically, coin mining is using your computer to try to solve hard math problems. If I asked you tell me if 17 was a prime number, you could figure it out by finding saying its not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7,11 or 13, therefore you know its prime. Now if I ask you to tell me if 16593826571 is a prime number, you have to test every prime number. Computers are good at this, but it takes time. </p>
<p>This information is valuable for computer security. Think about coming up with word puzzles where a puzzle maker replaces one letter with a symbol or another letter. These new messages are encrypted, meaning that someone needs to know what to replace letters/symbols with. You might say your good at that and can break those easily, so its not very secure. Computers are really really good at those, as they can check hundreds or thousands of combinations quickly.</p>
<p>Cryptokeys are mined by having computers figure out what numbers they can use to modify the word puzzles by that make it extremely difficult for other computers to break. The coin aspect is the currency the person who commissions you to find a good number(the key) gives you. This is worth money like a dollar is worth money, its not actually worth anything but it can be exchanged for goods/services. </p>
<p>So, utorrent now wants to use your computer to help figure out these keys and thus get coins. An automated system sends instructions to your computer, along with thousands of others to do these math problems. That means utorrent gets coins from the companies and is making money from your computer. </p>
<p>The reality is your computer is terribly inefficient in figuring out these problems. In fact, if you &quot;mined&quot; a coin right now with your computer, it would take quite a while and when you were done the coin you would get, when converted to cash, probably wouldn't even pay for the electricity your computer used figure out the key and earn the coin. But if its your electricity bill and utorrent gets the money, they don't care so much about the cost do they?</p>
<p>Edit: I should point out that the key mentioned above is not just a big prime number, the process of creating the actual key is fairly complex as detailed by  eye_can_do_that states below. </p>
<p>I also forgot to mention that many people are working on the same problem at a time and so using just a single desktop computer for this purpose is a horrible idea as your efforts will nearly always be wasted as someone else will find the answers faster. That's where using a network of computers let's multiple people band together and multiple computers can work towards the same answer and increase the speed of solving problems as a team. There are groups you can join that do this, but they normally share any earnings the group gets between participants or you join one where all proceeds go towards a charity. In this case utorrent is keeping the money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Who or what determines the math problems. Also have they been answered already? Who or what validates the answer? And whats stopping a computer from just plugging in an answer we already know. Not trolling. For my reference and understanding. Noob IT admin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crypto-currencies, such as Bitcoin as an example, are made available in a process of using computer processing power to solve calculations. This process is called &quot;mining&quot;. Different crypto-currencies vary in the algorithm, difficulty, and structure of new calculations to perform. The proof of work of a completed calculation is represented as a &quot;coin&quot; or unit of the applicable currency.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true at all. Epic Scale is its own privately owned company separate from uTorrent. I stopped using uTorrent quite some time ago, but we need to keep the facts straight here. Everybody is jumping to the worst possible assumption, which is that uTorrent is using our computers to mine cryptocurrency, for their own benefit. This is false.</p>
<p>Epic Scale is its own company and although it has the ability to mine crypto-currency, it is false to assume that is its sole purpose. From Epic Scale's website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Solving math problems for weather prediction, physics simulations, cryptography (including cryptocurrency mining) and more has real world value. We solve these problems on behalf of our trusted partners, and donate proceeds to your favorite charities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for blaming uTorrent for silently installing it, this was not done on purpose, proven by the many people who keep posting that it is not installed on their systems. This is because it is happening selectively and could very well have gotten past their testing. It also shows why uTorrent doubled down in saying that they do not silently install software. They weren't able to reproduce the silent install in-house.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/utorrent-quietly-installs-riskware-bitcoin-miner-users-report-150306/" target="_blank">Torrentfreak</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update: The silent install appears to happen selectively, and not on all machines. TF had confirmation from various sides and with screenshots of every step of the install process where no Epic Scale screen appeared. In one case, the opt-out screen was eventually shown after several re-installs.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because the installation is optional. It's &quot;bundled&quot;. When you install uTorrent, unless you uncheck the options, you get the bundled software installed along with uTorrent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue here is that some people apparently didn't get the opportunity to opt out of EpicScale. And the policy of BitTorrent Inc is not to allow that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As somebody else has stated in reply to your comment, that is not the issue at hand. The issue is that people were not getting an optional &quot;uncheck&quot; option for the &quot;Epic Scale&quot; software.</p>
<p>Per the quote I provided above, that is why TF is referring to it as a &quot;silent install&quot; and that it was happening selectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if you can find an older version or if you are on an older version you should be fine. utorrent used to be a very good client, but something changed a while back - maybe it was sold to someone else or something - and they started added all these ads and other useless BS to the client to where now it's just some bloated malware. </p></div>		</li>
