<p>The reason Hillary eschews the term liberal is because in the 1970s, a bunch of violent radicals took the label and applied it to themselves, making it very, VERY unpopular with people who are now in their 60's and over</p>

<p>Do you have a source for this?</p>
<p>It is the case that American conservatives <em>today</em> call groups like the WUO &quot;liberal&quot;, because Americans -- sometimes deliberately -- conflate &quot;liberal&quot; with &quot;leftist&quot;. (NB: Liberalism is <em>not</em> equivalent to leftism, especially not internationally but also not among leftists, activists, or political scholars in the US.) But I have never heard a radical communist refer to themselves as &quot;liberal&quot;.</p>
<p>I am not an expert on these Vietnam-era Western revolutionary groups, but I know that the Weather Underground in particular was inspired by Marxism-Leninism. It's difficult to imagine adherents to Leninism or its offshoots (like Marxism-Leninism and Maoism) taking on the label of &quot;liberal&quot; given that Lenin and other notable figures in the movement had a prolific body of work attacking liberalism. Some of Lenin's writings on the subject include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Deception of the People by the Liberals</em></li>
<li><em>The Liberals' Corruption of the Workers</em></li>
<li><em>The Separation of Liberalism from Democracy</em></li>
<li><em>Old Problems and the Senile Decay of Liberalism</em></li>
<li><em>What Our Liberal Bourgeois Want, and What They Fear</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In these works Lenin said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for the development of the independent political thought of the peasant masses, the development of their initiative as a class, this is something the liberal does not want; more, it constitutes an outright danger to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every class struggle is a political struggle. We know that the opportunists, slaves to the ideas of liberalism, understood these profound words of Marx incorrectly and tried to put a distorted interpretation on them. Among the opportunists there were, for instance, the Economists, the elder brothers of the liquidators. The Economists believed that any clash between classes was a political struggle. The Economists therefore recognised as “class struggle” the struggle for a wage increase of five kopeks on the ruble, and refused to recognise a higher, more developed, nation-wide class struggle, the struggle for political aims. The Economists, therefore, recognised the embryonic class struggle but did not recognise it in its developed form. The Economists recognised, in other words, only that part of the class struggle that was more tolerable to the liberal bourgeoisie, they refused to go farther than the liberals, they refused to recognise the higher form of class struggle that is unacceptable to the liberals. By so doing, the Economists became liberal workers’ politicians. By so doing, the Economists rejected the Marxist, revolutionary conception of the class struggle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The point of view of the Marxist, however, will always require a profound and not a superficial &quot;appraisal,&quot; will always expose the poverty of liberal distortions, understatements and cowardly concealment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mao, who also advocated (his particular interpretation of) Marxism-Leninism, even wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Liberalism is a manifestation of opportunism and conflicts fundamentally with Marxism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you visit any of the leftist subreddits -- for example, /r/LateStageCapitalism, /r/ShitLiberalsSay, /r/socialism, /r/Anarchism -- you will find that leftists today <em>continue</em> to reject liberalism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, you're confusing philosophy with branding. The communist writers are very precise about philosophy. Political parties are not. They're not run by intellectuals, they're run by politicians and pollsters. When Marx &amp; Lenin attack liberalism, they're addressing the classical liberal philosophy with its roots in the Enlightenment. If you honestly believe that the Democratic or Republican or Tory or Labour party leadership care even the slightest whiff about what John Locke wrote, you're in for some deep disillusionment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And nobody on the other side of the spectrum a) game a **** what their ideology was or b) took pains to not paint their political rivals with the same brush. It's a routine act of political attack. Pick the most vociferous nutjob who purports to speak for the opposition, and then use that person's statements to attack someone else who's on their 'side'.</p></div>		</li>
