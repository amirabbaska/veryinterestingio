<p>Edit: Seems it's a New York thing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lived in NYC, in the fall and winter you can go down a street and it's nothing but steam, steam from the subway, the sewer, the dry cleaners who vent the steam pipes... the whole ally will be engulfed in  steam and you can watch people walk into it and it looks like a movie scene as the clouds swirl around pedestrians as they fade away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've spent a lot of time in Manhattan and remember looking out onto the streets at night and it seemed like steam was seeping from every other manhole.  </p>
<p>I was all &quot;yup, Sinatra was right -- this city never sleeps.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is partly because much of Manhattan has steam pipes underground piped in from the utility Con Edison Steam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a big thing in New York. During the 1800 they installed industrial boiler and steam pipe systems to heat the city. London, Paris, and other cities in Europe had similar systems built but two world wars destroyed a lot of European infrastructure and when they rebuilt heating was done with electric and gas heaters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an added FYI bonus, the smoke/atmosphere effects are created by the special FX department. They handle wind, rain, smoke/fog. One of the best methods of creating smoke/fog are the &quot;tubes of death&quot; which are long black tubes run along the ground around a scene with tiny holes punched in them. The fog is pumped through the tubes continuously. The tubes can be hundreds of yards long and surround the entire set so no matter which way the wind is blowing you still have fog. </p>
<p>Another good method are converted lawn mowers that pump thick layers of smoke out of their exhaust with a special fuel. They can be pushed all around the perimeter of a war scene to create thick clouds of battle scene smoke. </p>
<p>Low budget features can use a mosquito fogger bought at wal mart and filled with special fluids. </p></div>		</li>
