<p>Active matrix refers to how the pixels are arranged on the display. &quot;Organic&quot; refers to the materials used to produce the pixels. </p>
<p>Wikipedia has a very illuminating article on the topic:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most modern oleds use active matrix displays, so it's mostly used as a marketing term. Same deal with LG's p-oled: the P refers to a plastic substrate that is used in the display, as opposed to glass. Also found in most modern displays.</p>
<p>In the end, most terms that make it to advertisement is just marketing fluff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;<strong>Advantages of OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) Display</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The plastic, organic layers of an OLED are thinner, lighter and much more flexible than LCD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the light-emitting layers of an OLED are lighter, the substrate (the material holding the display) of an OLED can be flexible instead of rigid like an LCD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OLEDs are brighter than LEDs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OLEDs do not require backlighting like LCDs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OLEDs are easier to produce and can be made to larger sizes much easier than AMOLED.<em> </em>(I'm not 100% sure about this one, but it was in the article)*</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OLEDs have larger fields of view than TN LCDs, about 170 degrees. IPS LCDs are the same.</p>
</li>
<li>Whites on IPS LCD are better than OLED, while blacks are better on OLED.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages of AMOLED/Super AMOLED (Active Matrix OLED) Display</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It can be used to any display size (regular OLED can't be made to the size of phones <em>at high resolutions</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Produce faster refresh rate vs OLED as well along with dark and inky blacks.</p>
</li>
<li>AMOLED ones provide exact color contrasts.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken from <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-OLED-and-AMOLED-What-are-its-advantages" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<p>LG also has their own pOLED display (Plastic OLED) which is an AMOLED with a bendable plastic substrate. Google and Apple are investing big time into pOLED so that they have a source of OLED for their phones other than Samsung's Super AMOLED.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, getting conflicting info from the article. I'm thinking though that back then it was easier to make normal OLED displays for smaller screens because the screen resolution wasn't as high. Probably now that phones use 1080p and 1440p displays they need AMOLED displays.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yup, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/poled-vs-amoled-792869/" target="_blank">this article confirms it</a> in the &quot;OLED, the basics&quot; section.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the main reason this happens is that the lifespan of the organic pixels in an OLED lasts shorter than an LCD. The blue, red, and green sub-pixels in OLED displays also have different lifespans, with the blue being the shortest. This means that if you leave an element on an OLED display in the same spot all the time you will start to see the colors fade away in that specific spot.</p>
<p>The main way to prevent this is to change what color is being shown around the entire display frequently enough that the color fading happens more uniformly, and not just in a specific spot to specific colors. </p>
<p>You can read more about it and ways to prevent it <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/screen-burn-in-801760/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The AM stands for Active Matrix. All OLEDs have active matrix. AMOLED is just Samsung's trademark just like pOLED is LG's trademark. Same tech, different brands. Samsung is just better at manufacturing small displays right now and LG invested more into large displays.</p></div>		</li>
