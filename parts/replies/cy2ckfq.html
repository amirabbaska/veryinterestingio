			<div class="markdown"><p>This is likely the future of our country but yet to happen. Still, on the same note Political Espionage is the biggest current threat. Any politician, nonprofit, or social group that threatens the status quo can now be blackmailed by the government for anything they say in private conversations. </p>
<p>People say they hate Obama and the Dems others hate Bush and the Reps. Most hate Congress. You really expect that these people can be trusted with this kind of power. </p>
<p>If it isn't going on already there will be honest congressmen, businessmen, judges.. all being blackmailed by those in power to get what they want. You have a social justice cause? Guess what.. if that cause challenges the status quo you better believe they are being watched. </p></div>		</li>
