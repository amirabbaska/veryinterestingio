<p>All the deleting and banning you guys have to do is clearly a necessity, but it is very cool to see active steps to increase good content vs just fighting the bad stuff.</p>
<p>Not trying to criticize in any way... just saying that the touch of positivity brightened my day a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a clear and thoughtful answer! If I can add a couple of comments (I am a psychiatrist specializing in psychopharmacology) - the leading theory for what the common element of just about all effective treatments for depression is that they improve the function of neurons in the mood regulating areas of the brain, likely by stimulating neurogenesis (growth and connectivity of neurons). Antidepressants and other biological treatments like ECT, TMS (magnetic stimulation), and DBS (deep brain stimulation) all appear to have this commonality of effect. This is probably also true of behavioral changes like increased aerobic exercise, and increasing cognitive flexibility through psychotherapy. </p>
<p>So back to the original question, I'm also not aware of any case reports of depression improving with a brain tumor. Tumors and other neurological disorders like strokes and dementias are <em>destructive</em> processes (even tumors which are growth of cells end up destroying or interfering with normal communication of neurons and neuronal pathways). Improving depression appears to require a biologically <em>constructive</em> process in one way or another (medication, neuronal stimulation, behavioral and/or cognitive changes). And not just random growth but neurogenesis that renormalizes the communication in the mood centers and related structures. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Engineer here (no specialized knowledge of neuroscience in any form).</p>
<p>Your comparison of &quot;destructive&quot; vs &quot;constructive&quot; processes with respect to causes and cures of depression is very interesting.  I am immediately reminded of classic textbook explainations of entropy.  Kind if like how in theory, a tornado could stack a random pile of bricks into a perfectly ordered stack, but in practice we are <em>much</em> more likely to see it do the opposite.</p>
<p>Given your description of well ordered neurogenesis as the common mechanism of depression cures, can we actually think of depression in terms of increasing entropy?  Is it simply a specific case of order breaking down in the brain?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a psychiatrist, what do you think of the current model of treating someone’s depression? Mainly, just trying different meds randomly and hoping one combination ends up working? It’s a very long, frustrating process for most patients to have to get on something, then wean off, then try something new. And sometimes can take years to find the right combination that will actually help</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s frustrating for me, too. Unfortunately we just don’t have any evidence to guide us with respect to medication management. Meta analyses and some head-to-head studies of antidepressants have repeatedly shown that any one antidepressant is just as likely as any other to get a treatment response. Depending on the study you look at, only 30-50% of patients will experience remission in their symptoms following a trial of an antidepressant. That’s obviously unimpressive. Another 20-25% will respond to a second medication if tried. Past that, we get diminishing returns with respect to response rates for each sequential antidepressant tried. In other words: the more antidepressants you’ve tried and failed, the less likely you are to respond to the next antidepressant you try. Studies have also looked at various treatment strategies - for example, if a patient doesn’t respond to an SSRI, are they more likely to respond to a different SSRI or a medication from another class? - and these, too, have not identified any differences in treatment outcomes. </p>
<p>With respect to the other comment discussions MAOIs, this applies to MAOIs, TCAs, and other less commonly used antidepressants compared to SSRIs. There is some evidence that specific subtypes of depression are more likely to abate with specific medication classes, but this is by far the exception, and the number of people that experience these subtypes is fairly low.</p>
<p>It would be nice if we had a better way to go about managing depression. Unfortunately we just don’t with the knowledge and tools that we have. It’s frustrating for physicians. I can’t imagine how frustrating it must be for someone actually dealing with the condition. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It just makes me not trust the psychiatrists I’ve been to. Because they all pretend they know what they’re doing, but in reality no one really does. All while charging $500 an hour.</p>
<p>I’d rather a psychiatrist be upfront with me and say “hey I have no idea what I’m doing but let’s try this random medicine that may help but may also give you a ton of horrible side effects, I have no idea and neither does anyone else you’ll go to. And if it doesn’t work you’ll have to go through horrible side effects while coming off it before we can try a random second medicine that also I have no idea will work”. At least that would be honest!</p>
<p>It’s hard for me to trust a psychiatrist that will mess with my brain’s chemistry, if he/she pretends they know what they’re doing when they really don’t.</p></div>		</li>
