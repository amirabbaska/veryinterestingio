			<div class="markdown"><p>Ideally, religions are charitable organizations, and provide many other important cultural roles (see European unity under the Catholic church during the middle ages and renaissance period for a more large-scale example) and while some other non-religious organizations could arguably fill the same roll, it also comes down to how to tax various organizations, and for what (that's justifiable), while taking into consideration that (again, <em>properly</em>) are non-profit, and operate via volunteer work and voluntary donations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: a side benefit of this is that their finances end up a matter of public record. Which would mean that the church of Scientology would either have to release their finances for public scrutiny or give up tax exemption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I didn't say it was ideal during the middle ages, what I said was that it provided a sort of unity of culture among European nations, which benefited them in the long run, especially compared to other regions which lacked such a unifying factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kind of the whole point of inventing intelligent and demanding entities as the reasons for anything that folks don't understand. Sure you're not officially the guy in charge - that's the king or president or emperor or whatnot - but it's an incredibly powerful backdoor to power of your own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a European, the tax exemption doesn't seems that unfair </p>
<p>By definition a religion should be a non profit and shoul not do benefit that aren't re-invested (the donation are to pay for the church -building- cost or for religiously driven charitee) So the money shouldn't go in the priest pocket (no more than a fair salary for his job). So what can you tax ? (I know that some U.S. &quot;churches&quot; don't work that way). I assume that the same should apply to a not for profit (the one where trainers are volunteers) sport club or a not for profit charity. </p>
<p>In most of the European country religion get  Taxpayer money (i.e. spain), the right to raise an extra tax (Germany) or the permission to gather in publicly own historical building (France despite a strong secularism). in comparaizon not paying taxes seems to be a very small advantage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you're doing with the money. It's a small advantage if you're doing tons of charity... but if you're scamming folks out of their money while also having them volunteer for lobbying duties? Scientology and the various 'Megachurches' are not exactly feeding the homeless there, but their leaders <em>are</em> snorting private jets off cocaine while flying in their prostitutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it's a non profit establishment like many other not for profit establishments and charities who are exempt from paying tax.</p>
<p>The only difference is that it has a 'religious stamp' on it which gets people riled up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not why people get riled up:  Being recognized as a church by the IRS means you get to by pass all of the stuff the other charities have to do in order to be tax exempt.  In fact, it is so loose that you don't actually have to be a charity at all under the current structure.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y1xJAVZxXg&amp;t=1037s" target="_blank">Here it is explained more entertainingly.</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, the real reason why churches are tax exempt is more about establishment clause of the first amendment as per the 1970 supreme court opinion in Walz vs. Tax Commission of the City of New York case.  The idea being that if churches are taxed then the government is in some sense getting involved in the religion game.  I personally don't see how giving churches special treatment (compared to other charitable organizations) isn't doing the exact opposite:  It forces the the government to adjudicate upon which organizations are churches and which aren't (topic of this thread) instead of one based on fiscal dealings.  Further, it creates an asymmetry as religious organizations happily get involved in all matters of governance (government tries not to interfere with religions, but religions certainly interfere with government) .  But hey I am not a lawyer so what do I know.  </p></div>		</li>
