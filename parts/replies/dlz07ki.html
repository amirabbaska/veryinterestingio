			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation, I'd like to add a way to visualize this, building from the ball metaphor. </p>
<p>If you think of the explosion as a ball itself, imagine detonating it in atmosphere, the explosion spreads equally in all directions and you get a sphere. </p>
<p>If you detonate it on the ground, only the upper half of the sphere is made, as the lower half is absorbed by the ground. So, &quot;half&quot; of the energy is lost. The upper half flings things upwards and outwards against gravity.</p>
<p>If you detonate it above the target, then the force from dropping the bomb is still active, the ball is exploding outward, and essentially flattens everything below it. Think of an impact crater. Imagine a flat surface, then have the bomb explode, the shockwave of it will create a shape similar to an impact crater. This way a lot of the energy isn't lost on impact with the ground. </p>
<p>Now, there are munitions that are designed to impact, penetrate, and <strong>then</strong> detonate. These are generally armor piercing in some way, anti-tank, or &quot;bunker buster&quot; missiles for attacking either nuclear silos or hardened structures. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggy back off of this, there's some pretty cool shit happening with shock waves that make this happen.  </p>
<p>To &quot;ELI5&quot; (with cool parents that let them hear curse words):<br />
When compression waves travel through air, they impart some energy into that air which changes its static properties(<a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/K-12/airplane/normal.html" target="_blank">and is basically a physical discontinuity, which is kind of a mindfuck in its own right</a>) and ultimately increase the speed of sound in the air that had a compression wave pass through it.  This means all of the compression waves bunch up on top of the first compression wave, making one powerful shockwave.  </p>
<p>Here's the trick, though!  If the same shockwave bounces off of something and passes through the air again, it almost doubles the amount of energy it put into the air (and also why being close to a wall is a bad place to be if an explosion goes off)!  When they do an airburst, the reflected shock wave will catch up to the first making one humdinger of a shock wave <a href="https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/doctrine/dod/fm8-9/fig3-I.gif" target="_blank">(you can see where they meet here)</a>.  I tried to find a cool gif and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vShkSIM.gif" target="_blank">this was the closest I could find</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes me curious as to what would happen if a nuclear weapon used two denotations/warheads together. One warhead would explode on ground impact, the second warhead would air burst right above it a few hundred or 1000ft or so (probably a drag chute to slow it down) at the exact same time together.  What happens to the air in the middle? How do the shockwaves cross each other? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would require some damned tight timing. </p>
<p>I'll take a stab at it, and I'm fairly sure of my answer, but not certain. </p>
<p>You detonate one bomb at ground level, and a second 100 meters above the ground. The two are of equal size and composition, and for the sake of this we will ignore the kinetic energy of the falling bomb relative to the bomb on the ground and the effect of gravity on the situation.</p>
<p>The two shockwaves would travel at approximately the same speed, expanding in a sphere towards each other. The peak of the spheres will touch first and then the area of contact will expand in a circle from that location. </p>
<p>As the two fronts are of equal energy, the air molecules will come to a stop when they come into contact. This causes a massive spike in pressure beyond the increase in pressure from the blast wave. The kinetic energy of the molecules will be translated into heat from friction. This is where I'm not sure what would happen, it would likely depend on the actual size of the two bombs, but you've now got a small area of highly compressed, very hot air. Which of these two forces will win, I don't know, but the atmosphere could conceivably flash into a liquid due to the compression. This energy would build as the shockwaves continued to push against each other, until the energy contained in this area is greater than the shockwaves compressing it. At that point it would then, well, detonate, the compressed atmosphere would then erupt either parallel to the ground in a ring, or explode outward in a sphere. </p>
<p>I think it's more likely that the ring will occur, but I think it would depend on the power of the two explosions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it's a lot easier to hit a target like a plane with an explosion with a 10m or so kill radius than to hit it with a missile a few cm across.</p></div>		</li>
