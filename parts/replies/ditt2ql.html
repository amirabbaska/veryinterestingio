			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of ohms like the size of the pipes, low resistance is akin to a large pipe. A small pipe wouldn't allow a lot of water to flow, high resistance.</p>
<p>Think of volts like a pump, or water pressure. It pushes the water thru the pipe like voltage pushes electricity thru a wire.</p>
<p>And think of amps like the amount of water that goes thru a pipe.</p>
<p>So when you want a lot of water (amps) you need a large pipe (low resistance, or minimum ohms) and a nice big pump (voltage). </p>
<p>The old saying (ohms law) is it takes 1 volt to push 1 amp thru 1 ohm. It's not a great saying because it's easy to get volts and amps turned around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/question501.htm" target="_blank">A neat analogy to help understand these terms is a system of plumbing pipes. The voltage is equivalent to the water pressure, the current is equivalent to the flow rate, and the resistance is like the pipe size.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same can be said about mechanical and rotational systems. In a mechanical system (such as a mass damper system), the spring is the capacitor, the force applied is the voltage source, a mass would be the inertial element (the inductor), the damper would be the resistor. For a rotational system, the beam is the capacitor, the friction between the bearings is the resistor, any rotating mass would act as an inductor, and the motor (or any force) supplying the torque would be the voltage source.</p>
<p>Everything can be related to an electrical system. Even the way heat travels through objects is modeled by thermal circuitcs where the different materials the heat travels through are resistors with different resistance values (conductivity).</p></div>		</li>
