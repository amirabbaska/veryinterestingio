			<div class="markdown"><p>As a construction worker I really liked your response.  In the last couple weeks the cop assigned to our site got 2-3 people thinking they couldn't wait in line and went into our lane drop to speed by people.  They were close enough that by the time they were pulled over, they were parked right behind our equipment.  We appreciate it, and have a laugh about how y'all bust those idiots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a question: I was speeding a few weeks ago, didn't realize it until I saw the lights, got pulled over, had a pretty normal exchange with the officer (turned the car off, keys on the dash, asked before I reached over to my glove compartment, etc) and he didn't ask if I knew what I did. He stated &quot;you were going about 45 in a 35 back there, no ticket just a warning, thanks be careful&quot; and so forth. Is there any significance (legal, practical, or otherwise) in explicitly omitting the question? Does it suggest something like &quot;okay this kid's cooperating and knows what he did was wrong, no need to fine him&quot; or similar? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So here's my question: I have no desire to incriminate myself, but I also don't want to be rude or escalate the situation at all, so what's the best response to this question without doing either of those things? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One time I was stopped for speeding and I said &quot;Oh, I could probably guess...&quot; That seemed to work well, though I don't think he was going to ticket me anyway. </p>
<p>If he pushed further and asked me to guess, I could say &quot;Was I speeding?&quot; or &quot;I bet I was speeding--was I?&quot;</p>
<p>But my thinking was that I would have sort of the best of both worlds: I'm sort of owning up to it but not confessing, and injecting a bit of coy humor, which in this one case played pretty well into the officer's personality or mood.</p></div>		</li>
