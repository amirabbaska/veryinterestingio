			<div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear forces are not relatively weak, they have a relatively small radius in which the force is present. With a small range, as the nucleus gets bigger, the force is not able to reach the outer neutrons and protons, therefore, making the nucleus weak. Source: am a nuclear engineer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like the nuclear force emanates only from the center of the nucleus, but wouldn't every particle that carries a charge exert it? Shouldn't outer neutrons and protons attract each other all the same?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nuclear force doesn't only come from the center of the nucleus. Each individual nucleon exerts a nuclear force on others. But the force is so short-ranged that nucleons only primarily interact with their nearest neighbors.</p>
<p>In <em>mean field theory</em> approaches, you consider nucleons in outer shells moving in some average potential due to all other nucleons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my understanding, the competing forces in the nucleus are the electrostatic forces of repulsion between protons, and the nuclear force between nucleons. The nuclear force is very short ranged, but the electrostatic force is long ranged, so its affect &quot;accumulates&quot; as the number of protons in the nucleus increases. For nuclei that are too large, the electrostatic force becomes greater than the nuclear force, so the nucleus is unstable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is the eletro-magnetic repulsion of nucleons (protons/protons) is much strong then the attractive strong nuclear force outside of a very very narrow gap. See this <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/ReidForce2.jpg" target="_blank">image</a> for Strong Nuclear Force Behavior.</p>
<p>This can be mitigated by additional neutrons to increase the nuclear attractive force without increasing the electromagnetic repulsive force.</p>
<p>Also you shouldn't think of nucleons as being in a tightly packed ball. They also have wave particle duality. So protons and neutrons sit in different orbitals, and the nucleus is a weird quantum cloud. This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_shell_model" target="_blank">Nuclear Shell Model</a></p>
<p>The reasons you see the decay of neutron heavily elements is because of this. As a neutrons get added to higher orbits that neutron can <em>tunnel</em> into becoming a proton and decrease the potential energy of the system (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay" target="_blank">Beta Decay</a>). The same is true for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_capture" target="_blank">proton electron capture</a> where an electron tunnels into a proton, and the two become a neutron. </p>
<p>You can also have proton/neutron ejection (and double ejection) which is where a mostly un-occupied shell just bails on orbiting the nucli. As the free particle + other nucli will have less potential energy then the item remaining the bound system.</p>
<p><strong>Effectively half life of an atomic nucleus is a measure of how much energy it will be shed by ejecting (or absorbing) a particle.</strong>  </p>
<p>The real issue with the nuclear shell model is it makes no predictions for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_decay" target="_blank">cluster decay</a>. Which is where an atomic nucli splits into 2 or more nucli. The most common form of this called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_decay" target="_blank">alpha decay</a>. But there are higher order emissions of heavily elements too. Also for a lot of atomic nucli it's predictions are flat wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ah ha! but aren't atomic nucleons just collections of quarks!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well yes. But Helium3 has 3 nucleons, or 9 quarks. So modeling it from first principles is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem" target="_blank"><strong>9 body problem</strong></a>. A 3 body problem will generally display chaotic properties it just gets worse as you add more. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics" target="_blank">QCD</a> is <em>decent</em> but it takes a serious super computer months to calculate a proton mass within +/- 1%. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't work like that.  There isn't a finite barrier where it goes from working to 'not-working'.  It just decreases with some radius of the distance. At anout 1 femtometer of seperation, two individual nucleons have about 25,000 N of force pulling them together. But at 2 femtometers tgat drops to 5000N, and asymptotically goes towards zero.</p>
<p>The problem is this force drops off with distance very quickly, while the electromsgnetic repulsion between protons only drops off with the square of the radius.</p>
<p>So only adjacent nucleons in a nucleus gave a strong attraction to eachother, but non-adjacent protons will still have a strong repulsion from eachother.  The bigger the nucleus, the more the balance tilts in favor of the repulsive forces acting on any one proton.</p>
<p>As a side note, Iron <em>might</em> be the answer to your question.  Both fissioning and fusing Iron into an element with a larger or smaller nucleus takes energy, so Iron is probably the nucleus with the lowest energy state.  That suggests some sort of balance and stability with its size of nucleus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting fact is that even in unstable nuclei, the repulsive force is less than the attractive force. You might ask how particles are able to escape, if there is a net binding force on them. The answer is that sometimes particles can &quot;tunnel&quot; out of regions you would normally think they are bound in, due to quantum weirdness. Particles' ability to tunnel depends on the difference between the binding and repulsive forces (obviously more tightly bound particles are less likely to escape, all other things being equal) as well as the size of the area over which the binding force is greater (generally speaking, the wider this area is the less likely a particle is to escape, but this isn't always true). So if quantum mechanics weren't a thing, we wouldn't see radiation at all*!</p>
<p>*also we wouldn't exist because atoms wouldn't be stable but ignore that bit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Helium has nine isotopes and only two of them are stable. The A = 3 isobar only has two bound nuclides in it. Whichever has a higher mass will be unstable to beta decay into the other. It just so happens that the mass of a ^(3)He nucleus is lower than the mass of a ^(3)H nucleus, so tritium beta decays to helium-3.</p></div>		</li>
