<p>&quot;Pascal-A was supposed to have a yield of 1-2 pounds, but somebody got his slide rule wrong: the true yield turned out to be 55 tons, about 50,000 times greater than expected&quot;</p>
<p>That's a big miscalculation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was a one-point safety test, in which they took a nuke that ought to have been &quot;safe&quot; if you set off its high explosives at only one point, as opposed to the simultaneous detonations needed for a true nuclear explosion. Apparently the weapon was not one point safe — 55 tons, while quite a bit smaller than the &quot;normal&quot; yield, is still pretty huge (the Oklahoma City bombing was like 2.3 tons of TNT equivalent). The full-yield of the device, had it detonated &quot;properly,&quot; would have been more like 10,000 tons of TNT (10 kt), so it is still better than <em>that</em>, but 55 tons is pretty extreme for a safety test — that bomb was clearly <em>not</em> one-point safe. </p>
<p>Pascal-B, for what it is worth, was <em>way worse</em>. Same sort of setup, same sort of goal, same expected 2-3 lbs... but it was <em>300 tons</em> of TNT equivalent. So not 50,000 times greater... 300,000 times greater!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Looks like the 66km/s was a rough estemate thrown out by some calculations he made where he wasn't concerned about the plug and didn't even factor in an atmosphere. they did find the footage with but one frame of the plug and calculated a <em>lower</em> bound based on framerate but I can't find a source that actually lists that lower bound.  so who knows how fast it was really going. </p></div>		</li>
