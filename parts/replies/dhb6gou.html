			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer. Might I also add, it can get a little hairy when executive branch agencies are responsible for investigating, enforcing, and prosecuting potential violations allegedly committed by the legislative branch. Certainly not an insurmountable balance of power issue, but could potentially get complicated depending on who is the head of the executive branch. I bet Nixon would have loved to have prosecutorial discretion to enforce laws that apply to Congress. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would make for a pretty interesting battle. Congress working to stop everything the president attempts and attacking the executive staff while the executive staff starts pouring resources into rigidly enforcing legislation affecting Congress. </p>
<p>Probably self destructive, but it would certainly be interesting times</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not quite how current Equal Protection jurisprudence works.</p>
<p>That said, under current Equal Protection jurisprudence, I rather doubt SCOTUS is going to decide that &quot;Congress members&quot; vs. &quot;non-Congress members&quot; is a suspect classification, so under a rational basis test for constitutionality like prreeettty much anything goes.</p></div>		</li>
