			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically. As the object in motion approaches its apogee it slows down  under constant acceleration due to gravity so it really just passes through zero just the same way it passed through 1 m/s, 0.5m/s, etc. There is a measureable amount of time during which the object is moving very slowly and almost stationary, but it's only ever motionless for an instant (zero time).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. However it's an illusion based on human eye tracking, and is apparent even in automatic tracking systems. The object stays inside the recognition frame of the sensor longer as the sensor slows down tracking.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly. It can’t hang in the air the way bricks don’t for any measurable amount of time.</p></div>		</li>
