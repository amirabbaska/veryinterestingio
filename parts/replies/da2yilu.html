			<div class="markdown"><p>The situation with metric in Canada isn't <em>that</em> far off the US, to be honest. Reagan killed the process of metrification in the US three years earlier than Mulroney killed it in Canada. Fortunately we'd gotten further than the US by that point, but because the government stopped pushing for progress, we're in a really stupid situation where we use a horrible mish-mash of units. What's the temperature? Celsius for weather, Fahrenheit for cooking. How large is something in the grocery store? Kg and mL for processed goods, but produce is primarily listed by pound.</p>
<p>Personally, I'd really like the government to finish the job, even if it means that my generation and older think in the &quot;wrong&quot; units for some things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The one that bugs me the most is that all building materials are Imperial. Sure, you could remeasure them in metric, but the default sizes are awkward, non-whole numbers. Basically forces you to work in Imperial. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the mish-mash is great! When I go diving I feel very special being able to know my air in both bar and psi. Europeans roll their eyes at psi and Americans are, like, <em>huh, wha--?</em> when it comes to bar. We Canadian scuba enthusiasts are, like, <em>bar, psi--phsst! I can run out of air underwater in imperial OR metric!</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Australian reporting in - interestingly enough we use metric for just about everything in our everyday lives except there's still a strong tendency to give one's height in feet and inches. For instance, when asked my height I find it much easier to say 5'8&quot; than 173cm. That, and a lot of our hand- and power-tools still use imperial sizings but they're often converted to metric (6.4mm, 12.7mm, 25.4mm etc.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I think its a generational thing too. Aus switched over in
1966(?), so anyone born from before 1950 or so is likely to have worked in imperial for their formative years. My parents for example still use stone for measuring weight, and in conversation dad will still use feet and yards etc. An elderly neighbour of mine gave no fucks and demanded I convert everything to imperial when I was helping with something, despite me being only 10 years old at the time. Most people regardless of age still measure in feet and inches for height though.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sort of. 1966 was the beginning of decimal currency but metrication didn't begin in earnest until around 1970. My parents were born in the mid 50s and still think in feet and inches. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the younger generation is moving away from quoting a person's height in feet and inches, and in general we aren't very fluent in imperial measurements. I wasn't taught in school how many inches are in a foot or how many feet are in a yard. As a child when people from my parents' generation quoted peoples' height in imperial measurements I had no idea what they were talking about. So when someone says &quot;she is 4 foot 3 tall&quot; I don't have a precise idea how tall that is without converting it I my head. If someone said &quot;she is 133cm&quot; tall I would immediately be able to picture her height. I can do conversions now because of interacting with Americans on the internet, but I'm still not super experienced with it. I still have no idea how many yards are in a mile, and it's perplexing that distances over a mile are sometimes quoted in feet rather than yards. I'd say that young Australian people generally view imperial as a weird, archaic system and it's becoming increasingly less relevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, but it's only the height of a person. The height of anything else is given in metric. That wall over there? about 2 and half metres high. The cliff would be at least 15m high. That guy is fucken huge! He must be 6'5&quot;.</p>
<p>Woodworking is a really annoying one. I absolutely hate seeing plans or videos on youtube and people are talking imperial measurements. Especially when they're talking fractions of inches... like sure I'm not used to it so it makes it that bit harder as well, but surely they could have realised it's so far from the best way to be measuring anything it's not even funny.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The funny thing is that we still cook using Fahrenheit, or at least many of us seem to. The 350 degrees that you set your oven to to cook your chicken ain't in Celsius.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised it's not the opposite way around. I think Celsius is a useful measurement for anything with higher numbers like that, but find Fahrenheit to have better gradations for discussing day to day temperatures; i.e. its 0 to 100 is a lot more useful at describing comfortable living temps than Celsius'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just because you are used to it.</p>
<p>Celsius makes a lot if sense as well in the everyday life. Negative is generally cold and positive is generally warm. That's it. 0 you get snow.</p>
<p>There is beauty in early winter and waiting for the day which temperatures hits 0 and you might start getting some snow. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do not think Fahrenheit is easier for day to day temps. 0 c is when water freezes when in Fahrenheit it 32 f, seems like some arbitrary number to me. -40c is fucking cold and +40c is fucking hot and 0c is in the middle and comfortable  within +/- 20c â˜º.</p></div>		</li>
