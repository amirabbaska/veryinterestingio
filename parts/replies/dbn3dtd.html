			<div class="markdown"><p>a ball of water the size of the sun would firstly be undergoing nuclear fusion all by itself due to its own gravity fusing the hydrogen in water in to helium, also it would be of a comparable mass to the sun as the oxygen in H2O is heavier than pure hydrogen and would be making up alot more of this &quot;ball of water&quot; than the trace elements in the sun makes up the sun itself. Therefore, the ball would have to have a higher mass than the sun to be of the same volume. Also, a ball of water couldn't possibly be that big as its gravity would break down the water in to pure hydrogen and oxygen and start nuclear fusion, therefore making it in to a star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no source but my guess is that on the whole the water object with the bigger volume would be denser than the sun because the vast majority of the sun is gas. In fact the corona (the outer layer of the sun after the photosohere) is actually thin enough that on the earth it would be considered an,excellent vacuum for testing by scientists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, a giant ball of water larger than the Sun would be self-gravitating and collapse and start fusion. Actually, if the ball of water has radius larger than the distance from Sun to Jupiter, it would collapse into a black hole!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically any mass would mess upnwith the planets.</p>
<p>But to answer more seriously, the death star apparently has a diameter of 150km or so. A very very small moon, so itsneffect on planets would be ignorable.</p>
<p>Dyson sphere on the other hand is something absolutely immense and heavy - though with it being concentricnaround the sun, its centre of gravity would be there too. So...in teory, and I might be horribly wrong here, it should not alter things too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! A lot of people have been responding, but the answers seem to be pretty scattered. To answer your questions in order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>is there a way to cool a star?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two important temperatures in a simple star: core temperature and surface temperature. To cool the surface, all we need to do is expand the star! This is because a small star has a lot of light shining through a small surface area, making the surface hot. Imagine 100 people trying to get through airport security, and they're all going through one lane. That Lane would be very busy. Likewise, a small star has a lot of photons flowing through less space, so that space is very busy, and thus energetic, and thus, hot. If we inflate the star, you can think of it like opening up more lanes at the airport. Open 4 lanes total and 25 people go through each lane. In our star, this means that the photons are spreading out more, and so the surface is less busy, and thus cooler.
Core temperature is trickier- stars keep a constant core temperature because of the way nuclear fusion works. To cool the core, you would have to stop doing fusion, and the only way to do that is to take away mass.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>what sized water ball would it take?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As some others have said, adding any kind of mass will make it hotter, because you're adding more pressure and making the fusion hotter. The sun isn't on fire, it's crushing things together at the middle because there is so much more packed on top of it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>could it never happen with water?</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Correct- simply dousing the sun in water will not cool it off for any significant amount of time, nor will it cool the core. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Does it need a giant fan blowing air on it?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a pretty interesting question! Stars create their own wind, so a fan would have to be <em>preposterously</em> powerful to overcome it. It's not impossible, but <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwmiWdmzqE" target="_blank">even another, larger star</a> usually isn't powerful enough to affect a star through wind alone. Hypothetically, though, with a powerful enough gust, you could overwhelm a star's solar wind and blast away its outer layers. If you did that, there might not be enough of the star left to keep doing fusion! But then you haven't so much cooled a star as destroyed it!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>do we need a giant freezer to stick it in?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another good question! To answer it we should consider how freezers work. Freezers are just cold boxes that take heat out of whatever is inside them. Interestingly enough, space is about as cold as you can get- just a few degrees above absolute zero in some places. In other words, space <em>is</em> a giant freezer! And given how well stars work in space, it doesn't seem likely that a giant freezer would do much to cool a star beyond its temperature in outer space. </p>
<p>I hope this has helped, and you feel a little better about your understanding of stars!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does! I appreciate actually trying to answer what would happen in my scenarios rather than trailing off on the 'a waterball that massive would collapse and form a blackhole' or whatever. Those answers might be what would really happen but don't get at the spirit of the question. Thanks for the feedback! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really make sense to talk about the temperature of outer space. Temperature is a measure of the non-organized motion of atoms/molecules. In space there are not enough atoms/molecules to take a meaningful average. </p>
<p>I think if you did manage to surround the sun with cold air, the air would just get sucked into the sun and used as fuel. </p>
<p>If there was enough cold air to connect Earths Atmosphere with the Suns atmosphere, we would be deafened (and perhaps destroyed) by approximately a bajillion decibels of noise from the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK here's a thought... My understanding is that the progress of particles from the centre of the sun to the outside is very slow.</p>
<p>Assume we have access to exotic materials that would not melt at solar temperatures or collapse from the pressure (super ceramics) and so left open channels to allow faster escape to the outer surface. This would make the surface hotter (at least for a while until a new steady state is reached). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could theoretically cool the star by increasing it's fuel consumption thus making it momentarily hotter (momentarily being subjective due to celestial time being much longer than out concept of it)</p>
<p>TL:DR - using up it's fuel source faster would cool it quicker than it's actual lifespan. </p></div>		</li>
