			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be much to heavy and expensive to work on large scale wind turbines. There is also the fact that the second blade is only ~70% (rather optimistically) as efficient as the first blade in such an arrangement creating a lot of cost for not a lot of gains.</p>
<p>Small scale ducted turbines though, such as the ones that power water pumps on farms and private homes, sometimes do use more exotic blade layouts in order to minimize their footprint and get the most power out of a single unit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect it's because the air flow doesn't work the same way. With airplane props you're trying to drive as much air as possible, with less concern for the fact that you're making turbulent flow. Wind turbines are trying to extract energy from the wind. To do this you want to create very minimal turbulence to maximize extraction. Counter rotating blades aren't good for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without doing the math, I suspect that this confirms u/TheEngineer09's theory. </p>
<p>If you add 100% more blades, plus a fairly complex gearbox (and second generator? Dunno how that works) to collect energy from said blades, it probably doesn't pay off for just 30% more energy. Might as well just build another windmill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not surprised a study was done. (I'll read it in full when I'm home). But the fact that no one has built one would indicate that there are complexities that negate the benefits. For one I'll throw out that adding a counter rotating set of blades requires a fancy gearbox to line up the rotational input to the generator, or a second gearbox/generator. Both of which add weight and cost. </p>
<p>I'm trying to remember my physics here, but there might be some interesting forces imparted on the tower as well, depending on where you place the second set of blades (near the first like the airplane engine, or on the back side of the naccelle.)</p></div>		</li>
