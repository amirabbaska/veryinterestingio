			<div class="markdown"><p>I've suffered from this for about 20 years and thought that I am just not meant to be a morning person.  The nausea is so bad I can barely function some mornings. I never put the sneezing, coughing and wheezing together with the nausea. I'll be talking to my Dr about this next visit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>CTE can cause morning sickness, it's called Central Apnea. Your brain literally doesn't tell your body to breath in REM. </p>
<p>If you played HS or hifher tier football for a few years I would look into. (much love) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually had West Nile neuroinvasive (meningitis/encephalitis)! Technically “non-traumatic brain injury” So I have lots of weird CNS-damage conditions. I didn’t know this though, very interesting for athletes and other neuroinvasive disease survivors out there! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy smokes. Some times I sneeze like crazy in the morning, but nowhere near as much as the nausea. I'd say 5 out of 7 days of the week i wake up and I'm nauseous. </p>
<p>Most people wake up and go pee or poop. I wake up and vomit. It's terrible. And I'm not sure what to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry you get it too; I continually experiment with things. I eat first thing in the morning, like crackers or a breakfast bar. I use CBD oil. I change the way I eat before bed the previous night because I have certain foods that trigger me worse - although, no specific patterns identified yet. I use antacids, PPIs, H2 agonist, and antihistamines. Always experimenting with brands and timing (taking night vs morning) and keeping an eye on side effects research so I don’t mess myself up worse by using something for too long without rotating. In sum
-lifestyle/diet changes
-identifying triggers

<p>I'm in full swing of my daily morning sickness caused by CTE (brain injuries). The bowl I'm loading right now will allow me to get feeling better, get my ass upstairs, be a dope dad and get some little girls to school. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep scientist here. Not sure if this is what your doctor is getting at but histamine is produced in the tuberomammilary region of the brain. This brain region is highly active and releases histamine during wake. However during sleep it is far less active. Thus it is known as a wake promoting region. This is why the first generation anti histamine could make you drowsy. New generation of antihistamine medication does not BC it fails to cross the blood brain barrier. Cheers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does that mean you can have allergy symptoms just from waking up? My friends has bad sneezing fits in the morning but was tested for allergies and it came back negative... So I wonder if it's just the process of waking up that's causing this? </p></div>		</li>
