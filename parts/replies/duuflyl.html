			<div class="markdown"><p>Most toothpastes have a fluoride compound to them to help strengthen enamel and prevent cavities.  It takes some time to work and do it's thing, eating and drinking can wash away the fluoride before its finished.</p>
<p>This treatment is similar to that godawful treatment your dentist uses, with the foam mouth guards filled with paste.  That's a much stronger version of the same treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite a lot of food is acidic, which can result in a build up of acid in your mouth. Give it enough time and your saliva will slowly bring it back to the right level. </p>
<p>If you brush your teeth before that has happened, then you just spread it around, wiping acid all over your teeth. This is especially true after drinking something like orange juice or coke.</p></div>		</li>
