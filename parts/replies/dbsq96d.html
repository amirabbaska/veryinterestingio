We can strap the thing with seismic sensors and monitor for different types of volcanic earthquake. Some of these are associated with fluid movement, or with brittle fracture as rocks crack at depth for example. We can tie this in with gas and groundwater monitoring to see if there's and change in chemistry or temperature that might indicate new magma is entering the system or rising up through the system.</p>
<p>But ultimately none of these can give you a definitive &quot;eruption coming&quot; signal. Something like 80% of the magma injected into the crust never makes it out to the surface. Volcanoes are constantly gurgling, burping, swelling and so on with no eruption taking place. This makes eruption forecasting highly problematic. And that's just for the monitored volcanoes; there's neither the funding nor the staff to properly monitor most volcanoes.</p>
<p>One of the things that is really helping is the ever improving application of seismic tomography; this is basically using seismic waves like an ultrasound so we can see inside the volcano. This is allowing us to image the plumbing system and better understand how individual volcanoes are fed. The problem here is that the seismic arrays are placed along the surface, and most of the features we're interested are vertical or sub-vertical, which is the most difficult geometry for a surface array to image. As that tech gets better and we are able to deploy more and better arrays, this kind of data will hopefully improve significantly.</p></div>		</li>
