			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was pregnant with my second child my husband had to make the coffee in the garage, the only foods that didn't make me sick were pizza and Thai food (so heavily seasoned), oatmeal and dry crackers gave me ridiculous heartburn and nausea, and all stores reeked like floor cleaning solution. The day I gave birth it all went away, so I assumed it was because of the hormones being produced by the placenta. Like you said it is likely a mechanism to keep the mother from ingesting dangerous food. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With my first pregnancy I had an  obsession with chemical smells like fertilizer or cleaning solution, it definitely wasn't pica, I just found them really pleasant. Often I would go to the grocery store and walk up and down the laundry aisle and smell the different laundry detergents. I also had a obsession with washing my hands and lathering I spent a lot of time at Bath and Bodyworks washing my hands to try and smell all the different soaps. Ones with a woodsy type smell are my favorite.</p></div>		</li>
