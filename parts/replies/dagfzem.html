<p>What exactly do you mean by this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DNA polymerase naturally makes some errors when synthesizing DNA. However, there is an error-correcting domain in the protein that removes mismatched bases (actually an incredibly fascinating mechanism based not on the mismatch itself but on the kinetics of the polymerase post-error). There are also other proteins that correct errors. </p>
<p>Once all of that is accounted for, the error rate is 10^-10, meaning 1 in 10 billion base pairs is incorrect (assuming perfectly functioning machinery). The human genome contains about 3 billion base pairs, so essentially an error is passed on every 3 or so cell replications if we go with these numbers. </p>
<p>But we can't predict where that mutation will be, because it's a random process. However, by the time you are 18 the cells in your body have replicated so many times, that even by random chance alone, every single base pair in your DNA has at some point been mutated. Those cells might not have survived long after being formed if the mutation was bad, or they might have done fine or only slightly worse than other cells if the mutation was neutral and didn't really affect anything. But you would expect if the mutation was somehow beneficial, that the cell would do better. But this doesn't always happen, even when mutations are present that we know can lead to cancer. And that's where it gets tricky and where CHIP can come into play </p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can we get a citation for this claim?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's really tough to have a clear list of people who have a greater risk of cancer, especially since people can live really healthy lives and still get cancer. I would have to do a bit of research to check on this, but my guess is that while they may have a slightly increased risk of cancer, the bigger concern is that they are more susceptible to infectious diseases. I would be curious to see if any studies have been performed that examine immune-compromised people over their lifetimes </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I think is really fascinating is that outwardly healthy people can harbor cancerous mutations, and some may go on to develop cancer while others may not - and that's why it's called Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential, since currently there isn't a way to really know whether these cells will go on to be neoplastic since there are so many other factors that can influence it </p></div>		</li>
