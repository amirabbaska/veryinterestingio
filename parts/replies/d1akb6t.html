			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun Fact: Right now, commercial airplanes are being developed to travel at supersonic speeds. The Concorde was a commercial plane that flew a bit over a decade ago, and it broke the speed of sound (currently no longer in service). However, the sonic boom was devastatingly loud, so the Concorde could only travel from western Europe to Eastern US (Loud booms can't bother anyone since nobody lives on the ocean). I've heard that a plane is being developed that can travel over land at supersonic speed, because they've designed it so the shock wave travels upwards, leaving residents on the ground comfortable.</p>

<p>Concorde flew <em>until</em> 2003 and entered service in 1976. It was also flown regularly to the Caribbean, South America, Bahrein, Singapore, Africa and more, until noise complaints and, mostly, oil prices kinda killed most of the routes because Concorde was <em>exremely</em> thirsty in subsonic flight. </p>
<p>It more than broke the speed of sound, it had a cruising speed of Mach 2.02 (a little over twice the speed of sound). It also happened to be one of the most beautiful airplane ever flown. </p>
<p>Regarding the noise, I used to live under its approach/departure path and it was really, really loud. Planes were loud back then but Concorde made windows rattle! </p></div>		</li>

<p>Shit, it's really sad to see that, even if this is ELI5.  As a kid, I used to watch Concorde land from Riis Park Beach during the summer and hear it take off each morning.  When the last one departed JFK, I stood in the parking lot of Home Depot on Erskine St with my wife and best friend and listened to her sound for the last time.  We knew, at that point, that for the first time, aviation was actively choosing to take a step backwards.  it was surreal to think that we wouldn't be able to buy a ticket and break the sound barrier.</p>
<p>I still love airplanes (heck, I own one), but there's nothing like Concorde.  She was graceful, beautiful, loud and demanded your attention.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When an aircraft goes supersonic, it creates two shockwaves, one from the nose and one from the tail. It's these shockwaves that create the sonic boom you hear. Most supersonic aircraft are so small that the two shockwaves hit you in such quick succession that you hear it as only a single sonic boom. The shuttle is so much larger that its two shockwaves are spread out far enough for us to distinguish the two booms as separate sounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Apollo vehicles were faster than the shuttle. The shuttle never had to break out of Earth's orbit. And if you're talking space craft in general, the Helios 2 is the fastest space craft ever at nearly 10 times the speed of the shuttle. But if you're talking fastest man made object, it's a manhole cover over a nuclear test. It was blown off, possibly into space when the device was tested. Nobody knows where it went or if it ever came down.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here's a video featuring one of my profs, which uses Schlieren photography to allow you to see changes in air density. Yes, exactly like the wave of a boat, and you can see how a clap in air is not dissimilar to dropping an object into a pond.</p></div>		</li>
