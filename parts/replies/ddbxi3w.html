			<div class="markdown"><p>This right here needs to have waaaaaayyyy more visibility than the top comment on a front page article of Reddit. This right here is why we will never &quot;defeat&quot; ISIS the way we have been &quot;fighting&quot; them, and others in the Middle East, for decades. This right here is exactly why this will be a forever issue until either one of us (or both) die out, or until we contribute in a way for long enough to be viewed as a positive instead of a negative. </p>
<p>Making it into a religious war is how we are making the people killable. In reality, they have every logical reason to want to destroy the western world - its basic human nature to lust for revenge, eye for an eye. </p>
<p>My dad once told me a very wise quip when I had just started working at my job first job. &quot;Sometimes, no matter how much you hate to do it, and matter how bad you want to retaliate, the best course of action to get ahead is to let them punch you in the face over and over again while you smile with your bloody teeth&quot;. It was graphic, intense, but most importantly valuable advice. I think this same advice applies here. We need to discontinue this retaliation bullshit and instead finds ways to embrace the youth of these nations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral; begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it. Through violence you may murder the liar, but you cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. Through violence you may murder the hater, but you do not murder hate. In fact, violence merely increases hate. So it goes. Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.&quot; </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>King also said “a riot is the language of the unheard.” So at the same time, it's important that we understand that violence WILL happen, so long as there are unheard, vulnerable sections of the population being seized upon from all directions (including violently). I'm saying that asking &quot;is it right to punch a Nazi&quot;, for instance, is the <em>wrong question</em> at this point. Conversations about whether or not such actions are moral or necessary are not useful in the face of the fact that they're <strong>symptoms</strong> that will reliably manifest themselves so long as the underlying conditions under which they germinate are NOT eliminated.</p>
<p>Thus, we need to collectively educate ourselves as to how to effectively deal with those conditions, whether they're the ones we massively helped to create in the middle-east that prompt the flight of planes into buildings, or simple-minded fascists getting clocked in the street. If we do not significantly alter the conditions that promote these behaviors, then we'll be pissing in the wind with our philosophical Internet-debates while entire families continue to be wiped off the public record by elite American terrorism (eternally disguised under the powerful propaganda of &quot;benevolent intentions&quot;), and while crowds get machine-gunned in clubs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I agree. But I sincerely hope Trump does not read this.</p>
<p>&quot;Why can't we just nuke them?&quot;</p>
<p>Didn't he say something like that?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you genuinly believe the government wants to defeat ISIS? These Middle East wars are not about beliefs, terrorists,... It's just geopolitics, and natural resources. Trying to implement democracy and gain control over oils and minerals to boost own economy. This and the fact that war let's you test certain new weaponsystems to check where the competition is at. Why do you think Russia is with Assad in Syria and &quot;against&quot; US &amp; NATO troops. Just to keep Assad in charge so Russia has and ally in the region.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post. I have the same perspective too. I was a 53 guy. Upon take off from small villages and remote fobs near peoples farms, the rotor wash would blow animals over, chickens would be tossed 50 yards away, laundry would go every where. This would happen. All.the.time. and everywhere. This was also in 2012, and we are STILL there. Imagine YEARS of shit like this happening to your home from the &quot;good guys&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my students was in Afghanistan, and he was an &quot;intelligence gatherer.&quot; His team was in charge of, almost every night, though-out the entire night, walking into people's homes and questioning the civilians for intelligence. Some of the guys on his team couldn't really cope well with what they were doing or what they saw, so they took it out on the civilians. </p>
<p>He told me countless times that civilians would be beaten and homes would be completely trashed, and there would be no intelligence gathered. He eventually volunteered for look-out duty, standing, often, on the rooftops looking out for the team so that he didn't have to witness what was happening inside. </p>
<p>He was the guy who told me to say &quot;I'm glad you're home&quot; to a vet instead of &quot;Thank you for your service.&quot; A lot of guys, a fuck ton, thought the mission and the situation FUBAR. </p>
<p>So, I'm glad you're home and safe.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> Thank you for the gold! I've never been gilded before! I am humbled. Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;I'm glad you're home&quot; I love that. As a vet it is pretty awkward to respond to &quot;thank you for your service&quot;, There's not really anywhere to go as far as conversation is concerned.
I'm kind of a smart ass and usually respond with, &quot;No, thank YOU.&quot; Because wtf do you want me to say?
Also, it means nothing to a combat soldier, because the phrase pretty much applies to anyone who ever wore a military uniform, and only about 20% of service members saw any sort of action.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly what was happening. I served in iraq in 2004. Soldiers were frustrated and some took it out on the locals. Running them off the road, trashing their homes, firing randomly into the village, throwing piss bottles at their windshields. Sometimes the locals retaliated. I had only been a sergeant for a few months. If I tried to say anything about how they brought it on themselves and put us all at risk with their behavior, I would get chewed out by my supervisors. It was victim blaming. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I understand if you can't/don't want to answer this, but do you have any insights as to what pushed his team to extremes? I just can't imagine myself in their shoes, inflicting their pain on helpless civilians. How common was this behavior? Which people in the army knew about it?</p></div>		</li>

Civilians have great insight on many things.  but if you've never been there, it's hard to understand.  Especially when so much info is out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An important fact. This is relevant to Afghanistan, not Iraq, but I'd imagine it would be similar. </p>
<p>92% percent of young (read:combat age) men didn't know what 9/11 was.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904103404576556531604340742" target="_blank">https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904103404576556531604340742</a></p>
<p>So they've been invaded, their lives have had a foreign military presence for over a decade, and they don't even know why. Is it any surprise they view us as devils?</p>
