			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also due the martian dust being extremely fine. It's actually incorrect to call it &quot;dust&quot; as they are technically referred to as &quot;fines&quot;. They are not much larger than smoke particles. The Martian atmosphere is so thin, only particles as small as fines can be lofted by winds, and once in the air can soar very high because of their extremely low weight. On Earth particles this fine would typically be aggregated or cemented together into coarser particles by humidity and chemical reaction. They do exist though in some very dry areas, like the Sahara. And speaking of the Sahara, dust and fines from the desert do get lofted high into the atmosphere and carried across the Atlantic. It actually happens frequently right about this time of year (late June) and can affect air quality / clarity in the southeast united states. Here's a <a href="http://abc13.com/weather/hazy-houston-skies-blame-saharan-dust-this-weekend/2169820/" target="_blank">news piece</a> from last June discussing Saharan dust creating haze in Houston</p>
<p>--EDIT--<br />
Here's a <a href="https://go.nasa.gov/2JCuFmC" target="_blank">link</a> to the NASA worldview system with browse data from the EOS satellites showing an especially thick dust cloud blowing off the Sahara over the Atlantic (and the Azores). If you pull the slider on the bottom you can watch the cloud progress across the ocean and new dust storms blow out. The ones in June don't look as big as this one in April but the dust is visible as a brownish haze all the way across the ocean. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you have a source for that? Isn't &quot;fine&quot; a size category that is totally compatible with dust, as in &quot;fine dust&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Colloquially &quot;fine&quot; is a size category, yes, but that's not what is being referred to. &quot;Fines&quot; is a well-defined category in the Unified Soil Classification System used in geology that describes extremely small particles and applying it to lunar and Martian 'dust' is correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s mostly from experience with the Apollo mission lunar dust and theories projecting to mars. I’ve seen in multiple sources though. The spirit and opportunity rovers experienced bearing failures traced to fines in the bearings. There’s this paper</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23505-toxic-mars-dust-could-hamper-planned-human-missions/" target="_blank">https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23505-toxic-mars-dust-could-hamper-planned-human-missions/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those missions showed that lunar soil has been ground into fine, sharp-edged grains that cling to just about everything, thanks to bombardment from micrometeorites and charged particles from the sun. Although Martian dust has been somewhat protected by a thin atmosphere, it has been blowing around for 3.5 billion years, and that has worn down the particles into very small, round grains.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but that's a tautology. Of course your instrument will be in trouble if you don't prepare it to the exposure in the target environment. If there is a hypothetical Martian native civilization, their instrument will be in trouble as well when they try to colonize earth without preparing them for the earth humidity. </p>
<p>Realistically, in a multi trillion dollar expedition to send humans to Mars, at least one person in the engineering team would remember to Mars-proof their machines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also very little on the surface to break up the storms. Think of the Dust Bowl but instead of just the plains it’s the entire planet. The dust bowl was caused partially by farmers cutting down all the trees and planting crops that sucked all the nutrients out of the soil. Combined with drought the plains turned into a dessert. That’s why the government passed laws requiring crop rotation and more importantly in this case wind breaks. This is why if you drive past large farms, you see lines of trees planted in the middle of the fields every couple hundred yards</p></div>		</li>
