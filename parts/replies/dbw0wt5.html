<p>This is true for integers and real numbers, but when you implement floating point numbers in a computer, the base do effect what numbers you can accurately express. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the universe simulation was using floating point, we could expect that the possible accuracy changes depending on the magnitude of the number. The Planck constant seems like the lowest level of precision we can achieve... does it change as the absolute amount of energy is larger/smaller? I don't think we've seen any evidence of this yet, but rather, evidence of the opposite (it's called a constant, after all). Then again, I'm not too familiar with all the experiments used to measure it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the universe was a simulation, wouldn't it always be constant from our frame of reference?</p>
<p>I imagine it would just be x in the code, but it would be displayed as a real number in the simulation. That would allow me to write down the constant at a point in time, and come back later after the value has changed, and see the new correct result without violating causality, since I really wrote x and not 2.3*10^-16 or whatever. </p>
<p>I just woke up so I apologize if that's rambling and incoherent, but I think it'll stick to the wall.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's an algorithm for computing an arbitrary digit of pi without computing previous digits, but only in base 16: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe_formula" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe_formula</a></p></div>		</li>
