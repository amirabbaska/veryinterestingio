			<div class="markdown"><p>Since we have discovered planets around neutron stars, it is reasonable to expect some black holes to have planets around them as well. We have never detected any, but then we aren't really able to. &quot;Interstellar&quot; relied on planets around a massive black hole that did not form from a supernova, which is, I think, far-fetched but who knows for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So with the recent observation of the neutron stars merging and the possibility if planets around neutron stars, is it possible for two neutron stars to merge into a black hole and would it be possible for those planets to survive something like that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read before that the biggest of stars can actually collapse into a black hole instead of going supernova. Like if you were looking at one in the sky it would look like it just suddenly disappeared.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not with such extreme time dilation. It just isn't realistic for a planet to stay within 1.0000001 black hole radii of the black hole without being torn apart in some way. You could certainly have a black hole planet, but it would not experience significant time dilation. The only significance of the black hole for the planet would be its very low temperature.</p></div>		</li>
