So just hope that there is no interference and for full public disclosure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the beauty of all conspiracy theories!  Nothing I (or anyone else) says will dissuade those who believe in the conspiracy!  But we're not under obligation to tell the gov't or military first, second or ever.  In real life (as opposed to movies), whenever we get an interesting signal, the newspapers, radio and TV stations start calling within a few hours.  There's no secrecy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it doesn't help when you have some of those theories become reality when leaks and disclosures happen.  The FISA Court is a great rubber stamp example of exactly why the answer to the question in the format and forum that it was stated is simply always unable to be trusted.</p></div>		</li>
