You'll rarely see trimmings at grocery stores because it typically isn't sold directly to us &quot;end consumers&quot;. You might still spot the occasional layer of fat on wholesale cuts (e.g. at Costco, Smart &amp; Final) or racks of ribs, and tubs of beef tallow (fat rendered for shelf stability).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>10 year ex butcher here. As you cut the meat you make it look nice and because of that you develope trimmings. You toss those aside and anything that has red on it focus to a meat grinder to make your 80/20 burger. We used our discretion a lot. If it looked too fatty just toss in some  red meat. You get an eye for the color it's suppose to be eventually.  The city would come in every month and grab  3 packets of ground beef and they did this test where it cooks the meat for a specific time and it collects all the fat. We had to be within 3 points to pass. If we didn't we had to pull the ground beef and make new stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the cut and grade of meat. Most cuts that are well marbled are used for grilling steaks (rib eye, new york, flat iron) and you won't find that in everyday ground beef. Grade matters a lot too, select is the lower of the consumer grades and it's the least marbled, choice and prime are more marbled and generally not used for ground beef. Chuck is a fatty cut but it's in very predictable areas. Trim the fat, weigh the lean, add fat back in to get the desired ratio. Top round and eye of round are very lean cuts. You can use those and add in fat trimmings from grilling steaks you dressed earlier in the day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is, but not in that large enough proportions on the cuts that usually get ground up for hamburger.  Plus fat is attached by connective tissue, and separating fat from muscle is fairly easy if done correctly.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly sure why, but there are regulations on how much fat can be in ground beef. Could be consumer protection, so places can't sell ground that is mostly fat, but that is just a guess off the top of my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rather than being illegal, I'd imagine that it is simply not considered &quot;ground beef&quot; anymore (similarly to how you can't add intestines and still call it ground beef, or how you can't add products of other animal)</p>
<p>While it is perfectly legal to sell potatoes, you cannot claim that they are carrots and sell them (although in that case, the consumer would instantly recognise the fraud)</p></div>		</li>
