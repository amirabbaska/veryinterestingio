<p>Material science over the last few hundred years has culminated in wondrous things like Stainless Steel, tungsten-carbide, or anodized aluminum. Impressive materials whose properties for strength, hardness, corrosion resistance, magnetism, etc we can tune by adjusting the balance of alloying metals contained within, or by changing the smelting temperature or cooling rate, or by giving it a surface coating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It occurs to me that these materials are largely used in construction and heavy industry, meaning they consume a vast amount of it. Could it be the case that these advances are the result of demand for the product? I can't imagine the demand for spider silk clothing is nearly as high as materials serving in more critical roles. </p>
<p>If society valued spider silk sufficiently, could we pour enough resources into tackling the problem of  &quot;spontaneous assembly&quot;? Or is the problem that we haven't yet developed the technology or techniques yet? Or am I way off base here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a slight correction on this great comment - Nature's materials are not built perfectly. There are flaws/defects at multiple scales just like engineering materials. However, they are high performing because Nature has developed micro structures that are extremely flaw tolerant. This is seen in silks, nacre, bone, etc. We can actually replicate spider protein sequences quite accurately... We just can't assemble them in the right structure.</p></div>		</li>
