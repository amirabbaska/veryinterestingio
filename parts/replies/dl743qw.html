			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, they have white noise in the background at work. I've been there 2 years and I didn't even realize until one day it stopped working. Suddenly you could hear every word everyone was saying in the entire office and it was super awkward, people started trying to speak quiet and were just aware that the entire room was listening in</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty regular tech job in an open office layout. I think it's pretty common, I always thought the background noise was just the ac but they add static noise and it makes a huge difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most modern offices, especially with open cubicles, will have those now.  If you listen very carefully, you'll hear the slightest hiss coming from speakers likely in the ceiling.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it's very common in offices with lots of cubicles in the US. They build discrete speakers into the ceilings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which part? Being in a large open floor with cubicles? Or being in such a place with [or temporarily <em>without</em> -- trust me, it is much worse without] some background noise? Or the fact that they play white noise instead of music [I could imagine problems if they started playing music instead of noise...]?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guess that would be more noticeable and people have different taste in music. Because white noise is constant the brain filters it out and you don't even hear it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this, and I'll add that it makes pauses in conversation less awkward because you can just listen to the music or even talk about whatever song is on. Plus, music is dope; it can make people feel calm, happy, excited or sad depending on the music, and everyone in the room can share the feelings. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I usually did back then is have the bathroom fan on â€” the one in some bathrooms where it sucks up the steam so the whole room doesn't fog too much. Felt more relaxing despite a constant rumbling but it definitely made imagination / roleplay in the tub more vivid as a child.</p></div>		</li>
