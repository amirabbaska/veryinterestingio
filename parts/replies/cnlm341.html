			<div class="markdown"><p>From my experience, yes. Sleep is all about diffusing your focus and allowing your thoughts to pass around you without grabbing your attention. When you keep focus, you tether yourself to the waking world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very nice breakdown. You may want to note that in recent years, stages 3 and 4 have been combined into one stage (just stage 3) where SWS (slow wave sleep - delta wave) is the main characteristic. This happened due to the minor differences between stages 3 and 4 and the large variability among individual sleep architectures.</p>
<p>Additionally, while you are correct that REM duration increases per cycle as the night goes on, it is worth mentioning that duration in SWS decreases. The amount of SWS is inversely proportional to REM quantity when discussing the time course of an entire overnight's sleep.</p>
<p>These are all newer findings, though.</p>
<p>Oh, almost forgot. It is a stretch to say that alpha rhythms equate to daydreaming. The activity from alpha waves actually arises most from your occipital cortex and is heavily involved with vision. This is why people emit alpha waves when the close their eyes (even for a second!) and then emit beta when their eyes are open. Beta is the typical resting wakeful frequency. You would probably exhibit these faster frequency waves (such as beta) while daydreaming. A lot of people think that daydreaming is relevant to the Default Mode Network (DMN). Check it out on Wikipedia it's really cool <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network</a></p>

<p>when we wake up, feeling refreshed and ready or the day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except when woken up during REM/DeepSleep, that can make you feel really wasted for a while after wake-up.</p>
<p>It's helpful to set alarms to multiples of 90 minutes to prevent that (sleep 6 hours but not 5.5 or 6.5 for example)</p>
<p>When taking naps do it for 20 minutes only (to never leave light sleep) or for 1.5 hours to get one full cycle. Nice trick for preventing phasing into deep sleep: Hold your Keyring or something like that in your hands above free ground. As soon as you start to relax the hand the noise of the Keys impacting the floor will wake you up again. Source: Do short  napping 1-2 Times per Day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;Sleep Cycle&quot; &amp; &quot;Power Nap&quot; apps changed my life! Best $2 you could spend if you have problems feeling like a groggy piece of shit when wake up in the mornings or after naps.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleep-cycle-alarm-clock/id320606217?mt=8" target="_blank">Sleep Cycle</a> app lets you set an alarm and it gives you a wake up window (my &quot;window&quot; is 30 minutes) for when you are most awake -- only then will it play your alarm. It does this by using your phone's accelerometer and monitors your movement in bed so it should rarely, if ever, sound your alarm when you're in deep sleep. It also shows you <a href="http://pcluv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Sleep-Cycle-2.jpg" target="_blank">really cool statistics</a> on your nights sleep.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleep-cycle-power-nap/id813493308?mt=8" target="_blank">Power Nap</a> is pretty much the same concept except for naps. You can take a power nap (20 min), recovery nap (45 min), or sleep for 1 sleep cycle (120 min). I actually just took a recovery nap about an hour ago and feel much better after I got a poor night's sleep last night (went to sleep way too late).</p>
<p>If you're trying to get better results from your night's rest, I highly recommend both of those apps or similar ones!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems cool, thanks for sharing.  I've had friends say similar things with sleep tracking apps. I always wonder: what do you do with this information to positively impact your sleep? How does knowing your sleep patterns and such allow to improve them? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>+1, this app is awesome. I can wake up at any time for work and feel rested. Just make sure you plug your phone in, the accelerometer can use a decent amount of battery and if your phone is already low it may die and not wake you up at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you mentioned the keys thing - both Salvador Dali and Thomas Edison used that trick to think. They would relax and Dali would hold his keys (in the case of Edison, he would use ball bearings) and they would just sit and clear their mind, mildly concentrating on one thing until they would fall asleep. Then they would get up and work. This helped Dali with his art and Edison with his inventions.</p></div>		</li>
