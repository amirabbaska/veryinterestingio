<p>Furthermore, in cases like <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/27/politics/nsa-snooping/" target="_blank">this</a> where victims have been stalked by NSA employees using NSA technology, do they have the potential to get it heard in court?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>To be a victim (legally) something material has to happen to you. If somebody hollers, &quot;you're an asshole&quot; out in the street you can't take them to court over the slander. But if somebody writes it in a job performance review and it affects your income then you can sue. The issue has to be tangible.</p>

<p>...in cases like this where victims have been stalked by NSA employees....</p>

<p>Again, unless some tangible damage is done there isn't a legal action to take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is the idea of 'taxpayer standing'. That you, as a taxpayer, have an interest in your government not enforcing unconstitutional laws. It has been used in 4th amendment challenges before. But usually the courts only accept it for 1st amendment challenges.</p>
<p>One case in particular was in Seattle. Taxpayer standing was used to challenge city government hiring practices that had a blanket requirement for a drug test for all new hires instead of restricting it to just new hires in certain safety critical jobs.</p>
