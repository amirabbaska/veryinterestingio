			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I work at the hospital in a Speech, Voice and Swallowing department. It is called Globus Pharyngeus. When you are stressed or anxious your muscles tense up, including those in your throat. Everything constricts and become tighter in your throat which gives you the feeling of swallowing over a lump.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this explain why I suddenly start sounding like the Muk and Luk polar bears in the movie Balto when I get sudden anxiety or anger? My voice gets higher and more shallow, and will even start going out, especially if I am doing a verbal presentation in front of a crowd. This also happened if my parents confronted me about their suspicions of me doing something wrong or behind their backs. I always thought I was such a bad liar because if I was guilty of something my voice would give it away, so I usually confessed. Haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is also a muscle-tightening reaction. When I am anxious/upset/shocked and I have to speak, my voice is very high and weak. All the muscles I use to breathe and speak just clench and everything comes out all squeaky. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It feels like I almost always have this.
I choke often when I drink or eat something.
When I try to swallow I'll feel saliva stuck in my throat and have to drink water to get rid of it. </p>
<p>And I can feel my muscles move a little when I swallow while laying down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on this, I have (had?) an anxiety disorder and had near-constant globus, to the extent that I actually believed it was a digestive problem or form of nausea, and nearly stopped eating for fear that the &quot;globus&quot; would make me throw up. It didn't seem like such a persistent thing could be primarily psychological. I got my anxiety under control and started taking a low-dose of antidepressants, and it went away in about a month. I still get it occasionally, but since I know it's not anything serious, it's easy to ignore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had the same thing, for the exact same reasons. I also sometimes got it just by thinking about it (I'm guessing because I got anxious about it) but these days I rarely get </p>
<p>It's somewhat comforting to know it's not just me haha. My doctor had a very hard time figuring out what was up so I was concerned I was just broken. </p>
<p>I was lucky enough that fixing it just involved try to be calm and focused, I'm thankful I don't have other depression issues - I know it is extremely tough. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad to hear I'm not alone, but yeah, it sucks. For me, the key to ignoring it is knowing it isn't anything real - that doesn't necessarily make it go away but it means I can sort of block it out and concentrate on other things. The medication has no doubt helped too.</p>
<p>I wish this was a better known thing, otherwise I wouldn't have wasted $500 on doctor's visits - but oh well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently, this can also happen if you injure a muscle in your shoulders/neck area. i pulled a muscle close to my neck when i was shouldering roof shingles up a ladder, felt like i had a golf-ball in my neck a few hours later.</p></div>		</li>
