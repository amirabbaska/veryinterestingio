			<div class="markdown"><p>There doesn't have to be two layers - considered e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:John_Dee's_Aztec_Scrying_Mirror.jpg" target="_blank">polished obsidian</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Schwarzer_Trauerschmuck2.jpg" target="_blank">jet</a> (or just a sufficiently thick piece of black-tinted glass). The important thing is the distinction between diffuse and specular reflection.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes I'm surprised how much focus the piano got, it was just meant to give people a good picture of a black, yet shiny, surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It kind of is, because a piano is just really shiny polyester, not 2 layers.</p>
<p>Of course a wood finish polish piano is 2 layers, the top one being really shiny clear polyester. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because when it comes to &quot;deep&quot; finishes like that on a piano, or a &quot;candy-apple&quot; finish on a vehicle, there's more than just 2 layers of color and clear. There's multiple layers that are sanded and leveled to form that mirror finish, sometimes with tint added to them as in the &quot;candy-apple&quot; look. </p></div>		</li>
