<p>Note that in my internal idea of what's going on, the speed of light or the direction of time is being violated. The entire wave of probabilities collapses at once, no matter how large it is. So either it happens at infinite velocity, or something is going backwards in time and removing the rest of the probability wave.</p>

<p>Not really, if my understanding is correct. Essentially at the quantum level you view everything as a &quot;wavefunction&quot; of probabilities. So at each point in space you have a defined probability of how likely it is that the photon &quot;exists there&quot; in some sense, and sets of probabilities for its properties at that point (like polarisation etc).</p>
<p>So in a sense, the photon &quot;exists&quot; everywhere in space, as do all quantum things - it's just that in some places a particular thing &quot;exists&quot; more, and in others less. The state of the electromagnetic field is the sum of the wavefunctions for all the photons there are. This is kind of hard to understand, because at the scale we exist at, these complicated spaces of probability combine and cancel out so that we view existence as something linked to a particular location.</p>
<p>So when something interacts with a photon and collapses its wavefunction, what's really happening is that one complicated wavefunction, which exists everywhere, interacts with another wavefunction which exists everywhere. Because both objects &quot;exist everywhere&quot; in some sense, you're not breaking causality at all - the information doesn't have to travel anywhere, because it's already everywhere, so it's not traveling at all.</p>
<p>Hopefully that makes some sense, I can try to clarify if it doesn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that kind of like pilot wave theory? Particles spread out in infinite directions until they find the point where they're &quot;supposed&quot; to be, then go back in time so that it looks like they were there all along.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>... eh, probably. I'm not a physicist, quantum or otherwise.  That's just my layman way of thinking about it from what I've read, mostly from pop sci type books like 6 easy pieces and whatnot.</p></div>		</li>
