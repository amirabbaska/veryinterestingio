			<div class="markdown"><p>This, 100%.
Little known fact: Color film was actually invented <em>before</em> sound film, but nobody really saw it as being worth the cost until <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>. Color film could cost three times as much as b&amp;w, but nobody thought you could charge three times as high ticket prices. </p>
<p>Here's an example of a color silent film starring Douglas Fairbanks: </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taking a wild guess to say no. </p>
<p>I make this comparison due to it's similarity to <em>Gone With the Wind</em>. Same lot, same (final) Director, same color process, same release year...etc.</p>
<p>First of all, both it and <em>Gone With the Wind</em> were released in a time where the US was still in a state of depression. Makes little sense to make a movie that will cost 3x as much for the public to see in that case.</p>
<p>Secondly, Oz was a flop when it first came out, whereas <em>Gone With the Wind</em> was (and with inflation still is) the highest grossing film of all time. I'm pretty sure more people saw <em>Gone With the Wind</em> than any other film in history. If that's the case, would a 3x as expensive ticket lead to those kinds of sales? </p>
<p>Maybe. I suppose the 3D prices of <em>Avatar</em> hold a similar weight. Both released in a time of economic hardship in the US. But, somehow I still doubt it.</p>
<p>I'm gonna say there really isn't any reason why the tickets should be more expensive, and that perhaps the merit of color was enough to get people to see it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comparison makes me wonder, did people avoid color movies on purpose as some people today avoid 3d showings of a movie?</p>
<p>Also, were any movies shown in color also available to theaters in black and white?   </p>
<p>Also, did playback of color film require different equipment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone already commented that the transition from black and white to color didn't have any negative reaction but I remember hearing that the transition from silent film to talkie is much like what we experience now with transition to 3D.  It required special equipment, people definitely showed polarizing preference in some cases, but I don't believe that anyone ever had the option to watch a movie in talkie or silent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Transitioning to sound negatively impacted filmmaking in other ways as well. The cameras themselves were noisy and this was initially dealt with by enclosing them in soundproof boxes. When you can't move your camera easily, the shots become a lot duller. It wasn't until quiet cameras were developed that talkies started to enjoy the same skillful camera work that silent movies could employ.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the answer is no to all three questions. </p>
<p>I've never heard of people deliberately avoiding color in general. Some might criticize it as losing the art that many B&amp;W films had, or perhaps the sort of movies that were most common in color weren't the genre they liked. The bold primaries might make it too artificial or childish for some tastes. But there wasn't a choice of the same film in color or B&amp;W, so people choose a B&amp;W version to save costs or because color gave them headaches, the way some might choose 2D today. </p>
<p>Color projectors didn't require special color-specific equipment, though it's possible they benefited from different bulbs, either to be brighter or have better color balance. This is unlike wide screen technologies like Panavision that needed special projection lenses to work at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Until the mid sixties color was seen as garish. Black and white was for serious film and color was spectacle. So, you get films like Twelve Angry Men and Psycho in b&amp;w and Ben Hur and Lawrence of Arabia in color. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ben Hur and Lawrence were both filmed in 70mm panavision though. Which is a whole other ordeal from standard color films. Special cameras, special theaters, etc. The last movie filmed in 70mm was Hateful Eight, and there were only 3 or 4 cameras in the world that were working to shoot it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Psycho was shot in B&amp;W to do it cheaply and quickly using his TV crew.  The artistic choice came second.  The decision was made by Hitch the producer, not Hitch the director. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. Modern films like <em>La haine</em> (1995) were even filmed in colour only to be later converted to B&amp;W. <em>Schindler's List</em> (released two years earlier, in 1993) was apparently filmed in B&amp;W even though some executive at Universal Studios wanted to use a colour negative so that it cold be released in colour in VHS.</p>
<p>Wikipedia says that Technicolor was ~3 times more expensive than the traditional B&amp;W techniques at the time, until some technological advances made it cheaper (cheaper than before, that is) when it was about to be dropped. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons for Technicolor being more expensive is that it was shot on multiple reels of film simultaneously. So just in terms of film stock it would cost a multiple of the same film in black and white shot on a single film</p></div>		</li>
