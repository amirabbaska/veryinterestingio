			<div class="markdown"><p>This definition is what makes our modern world possible.  GPS <em>requires</em> that can keep track of time unbelievably accurately. </p>
<p>It's also how we're able to define a meter, as our modern definition of the meter is defined by the distance light travels in a vacuum in approximately 3*10^-8 seconds.  </p>
<p>This definition of a second is REALLY crucial, as it lays the foundation for so much of our modern world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost all basic units have reduced down to a specific scientific representation. Length, volume, and heat energy are all examples that have a similarly specific values for their base units. Grams is currently the last one that scientists are trying to nail down. Scientists in France have a cylinder of a specific metal they want to be exactly one Kilogram, then count the number of atoms in that cylinder. Once a consensus on this number is reached by the scientific community, that should be all the basic SI units of measurements.</p>

<p>We chose the caesium-133 atom because it has an extremely regular periods</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just would like to point out that this doesn't make sense. It's a common misconception to think that the caesium atom is vibrating at some frequency. The period is related to the radiation emitted, and thus the energy difference of the hyperfine states, and will always stay &quot;regular&quot;. The reason caesium is used is because it's the most practical element out of the group (one valence electron) which have very clean transistions i.e. won't be affected much by enviromental conditions.</p></div>		</li>
