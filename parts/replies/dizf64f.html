			<div class="markdown"><p>I ate some toast that was delicious except one bite which I thought was burnt it was so bitter. Did not experience nausea.</p>
<p>Later I went to eat the remaining slice of the loaf and found that it was totally moldy. The memory of the flavor from earlier paired with the knowledge that it was mold made me gag and I became nauseous.</p>
<p>To feel better, I had to reason that I felt fine before and I still felt fine until I learned that, so I must be fine and should forget about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many times avoiding disease is also a factor, whether or not it can be eaten.  This reflex around dead human bodies is probably such a reflex, since a dead animal body should also be unhealthy to eat. </p>
<p>However, a human body would have diseases we can catch by touch, fluid transfer, or possibly the remnants of airborne disease.</p></div>		</li>
