<p>If you think you can - you can make it physically happen? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To a certain extent, yes.</p>
<p>To use your example of blood pressure, there's a phenomenon known as white coat hypertension.</p>
<p>Apparently, doctors in the US where white coats (whaaaat?) and so, when patients get their blood pressure checked by doctors, their anxiety activates their sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight response) to raise the blood pressure!</p>
<p>That's why a lot of doctors will check the patient's blood pressure over a series of visits before diagnosing hypertension. </p>
<p>This normalises the examination for the patient so that they're less anxious, so they don't have that sympathetic response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I asked because whenever I'm in the hospital or hooked up at a doctor appointment, I try to WILL my heart rate, blood pressure, etc. down.  It usually works.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if we use this same logic in another scenario, in order to cope with a stressful event all you could do is either think to calm yourself down, or experience it enough to start feeling normal about the situation </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always feel as though I have this fight or flight response.. my pupils are heavily dilated, I struggle to produce saliva, my stomach never feels hungry, my heart can sometimes be up to 120 resting bpm (usually around 90 with a healthy bmi).. i've seen doctors but they don't seem to take it all that seriously. </p></div>		</li>
