<p>H2O2 does not kill cells with a free O atom going about grabbing up different things</p>
<p>When H2O2 breaks they create two OH radicals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>........
And the oxygens in those free radicals react with things in the cell which can directly effect the integrity of the cell or mutate the genome. </p>
<p>In other words... the oxygen &quot;grabs up&quot; things.</p>
<p>You literally just said &quot;It doesn't do x! That's ridiculous! It does X!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I️ think his point was it’s not H2O2 changing to water and oxide where the oxide destroys the body. He is also right in his explanation of free radicals. While the oxygen in the hydoxy free radical is the reaction site, it is not “O” that is grabbing electrons from the other molecules. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone in the thread is describing oxidation-reduction reactions. A radical reaction is completely different. For example a normal hydroxyl ion will take up a hydrogen ion and stop. A hydroxyl radical will constantly perpetuate the process until an outside reaction stops it. </p>
<p>O2, OH, and even O-2 is benign, they do not contribute to cell death. It is always ROS species of oxygen molecules that cause cell death. So yes my explanation sounds the same as the others but it would be like saying planes and cars are the same because they both get you from point A to point B</p></div>		</li>

<p>...hydrogen peroxide breaks into two components producing 2 OH molecules. <strong><em>Now OH isn't bad.</em></strong> In fact our body is full of OH- molecules. </p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>When H2O2 breaks they create two OH radicals [...] Molecules/Atoms HATE this. In the body biologists call these Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS). Radicals will then go through radical reactions with any molecule in their way. So these reactions caused by ROS are <strong><em>incredibly detrimental</em></strong></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water poisoning occurs with osmotic pressure change. As you drink a fuck ton of water your blood becomes more and more diluted. Your kidneys then compensate by flushing the system (time to pee!) if you overwork the system the kidneys fail aaaaaaannnnd you die. Water itself can not kill you</p></div>		</li>
