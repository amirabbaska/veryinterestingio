<p>A bit of a misconception. I'm fairly sure that you're already aware, but Jupiter does have a solid core underneath all those storms.</p>
<p>Edit:<a href="http://www.space.com/18385-jupiter-atmosphere.html" target="_blank">This</a> indicates that deep, <em>deep</em> into Jupiter the pressure gets to be so great that the <del>helium</del>hydrogen goes from a gas, to a liquid, to a metallic substance. It may not be a conventional solid, but I'd say that it counts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Metallic doesn't necessarily mean solid.  Liquid hydrogen can have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_hydrogen" target="_blank">metallic</a> properties.  I think the solid or liquid nature of the core is one of the things they hope to learn from the Juno probe, although how the probe will determine that I don't know.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I had read that, was just trying to convey that Jupiter's atmosphere is so thick that it would be even less likely than Earth's to coalesce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The presence of water vapor in our atmosphere condensing into clouds only visually occludes the fact that all these &quot;roiling, tumultuous mess of vapours, updrafts, downdrafts, jet streams, storms, ect&quot; results in our atmosphere being thoroughly mixed. Everywhere on earth we have approximately the same ratio of gases; No matter your latitude you'll encounter the same mix of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. Local differences are temporary and minor, quickly being diffused into our relatively smooth and well mixed atmosphere. That's why cloud formations aren't stable, they get mixed back in rather quickly. Warm air and cool air, pressure differences, and our churning mess of chaotic wind patterns make sure coulds dump their water and disperse.</p>
<p>Jupiter's ammonia clouds are quite different from our own. The difference being permanence. The great bands are persistent over decades and may wax and wane in width and intensity but are nonetheless stable. Orange and brown coloring is from differing chemical makeup. The addition of Sulphur, phosphorus, and possibly hydrocarbons into the ammonia clouds create the differing bands. These bands don't like to mix and haven't dispersed precisely because the atmospheric currents don't lend themselves to mixing; The atmospheric currents lend themselves to permanent banding.</p>
<p>As a side note, our atmosphere is really really thin, if it were much thicker we would see much more consistency in cloud formation, perhaps even that continuous grey cloud you mentioned. As it is now our atmosphere behaves much like a 2 dimensional flatland. More like two flatlands stacked one atop the other with the interactions between the two creating the sorts of conditions that hurricanes and tornadoes form from. For perspective, the clouds decks alone on Jupiter are 50km thick, earth's atmosphere is 60km top to bottom (the meaningful bit that isn't just almost space) and most of it is far above where our clouds form. Jupiter's atmosphere is 5000km top to bottom. Other planets with thick atmospheres have fairly uniform appearances, well mixed and smooth. Earth would look similar if our gas layer wasn't absurdly thin. Jupiter looks the way it does because it's weather patterns are quite different from our own, not because they are similar.</p>
