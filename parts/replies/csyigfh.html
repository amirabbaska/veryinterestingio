			<div class="markdown"><p>when I was a kid, we had laying hens. I had one that was a pet, because she only had one lower leg and a stump from wintering in a crowded coop with her foot in the water. </p>
<p>But butchering the other hens when the slowed egg production was very informative. I helped dress the birds and noted that the ovary was filled with eggs at various stages of size. They were few, but it was an interesting mechanism. I remember noting how older hens had less forming eggs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The concept that mammals are born with a certain number of oocytes is actually controversial and has recently been challenged. In <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120726180259.htm" target="_blank">this study</a> the authors provide evidence that there are progenitor cells capable of forming new oocytes in adult mice. I haven't kept track on any follow-up papers or other organisms, but this one made a big splash when it came out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a PhD student in this specific field and attended last year's Germ Cell meeting at Cold Spring Harbor- The general consensus in the field seems to be that there isn't compelling evidence for oocyte renewal in humans. Even in the study that you mention, there are plenty of ambiguities in their interpretations. For instance, the appearance of &quot;deeper oocytes&quot; following ovariectomy was interpreted as evidence to support their hypothesis that post-natal oogenesis occured. I would argue that it is more likely that ovariectomized mice displayed an increase in oocyte maturation in the remaining ovary in order to compensate, so you have doubled the amount of oocytes in the single ovary that are selected for maturation, and therefore the &quot;deeper&quot; oocytes they observe are probably just ones that were generated during embryogenesis that had undergone more mitotic divisions prior to meiotic entry.
I'm not saying that it isn't possible, just that there isn't enough evidence at this point to disprove the current dogma. Furthermore, several of the other studies cited in the publication weren't reproduced in follow-up studies performed by other groups. </p></div>		</li>
