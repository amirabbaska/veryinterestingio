			<div class="markdown"><p>I rewrote this as if I were talking to a 5 year old. Simplicity gets in the way of complete accuracy, but let me know if anything is wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have a headache, it isn’t actually the brain that hurts. The pain from headaches is probably pain from this thin stuff around your brain called the meninges. Your brain has lots of folds and the thin stuff is wrapped tight around it. This is why it can sometimes feel like the pain is deeper. Why do the meninges hurt? Well, it could be a lot of things and it’s hard to say which thing is the actual cause. Most of the time, headaches are caused by muscles in your neck that get too tight. This can squeeze some of the tubes that send messages in and out of your brain, so the brain gets confused.</p>
<p>When people get really bad headaches, it’s called a migraine. No one’s sure, but a lot of smart people think that problems with some tubes that carry blood near your brain can cause those. They’re not sure though. Wanna see a gross picture of a brain, champ? <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Xx6lIuoF4Tw/TbuKAuuRNvI/AAAAAAAAA8I/Dvu1FydAfvY/s400/31415_NpAdvHover.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a>. If the brain has that thin stuff around it, it looks like <a href="http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/jpeg5/CNS322.jpg" target="_blank">this.</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Massage therapist here. There's actually additional reasons you can get them. </p>
<p>Connecting your sternum, clavicle, and mastoid process (that bump under your skull just behind your ear) is the sternocleidomastoid muscle. You might recognize it as the ropey band that pokes out of people's necks on the front sides.</p>
<p>When people use their muscles, the sarcomeres (muscular threads) shift between on (tensing) and off (relaxing). Sometimes they get stuck in the on position. When a bunch of them get stuck, they start to adhere to one another. Get enough of them stuck together and they suffocate the fibers between them, cutting off blood flow, oxygen, and nutrients. This is what causes your muscles to hurt. When you get a cramp, it's because a cluster (triggerpoint) is firing on.</p>
<p>If the center gets enough pressure the nerves send pain responses, often times to other areas of the body. The line connecting your mastoid and your sternum refers this pain to the head, often causing headaches. You find this more often in people who have a tendency to lean forward and practice poor posture, such as computer users and desk job workers.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR: Watching your posture and squishing your neck can help with headaches. (In my experience, other than rehydration)</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I <em>think</em> this is the kind of headache that can easily ruin an entire day for me, one which I wake up with. It's as if the source of the pain is almost at the actual cranium, sort of where my spine connects. Uugh. I've found that the best solution to this is a long, brisk walk, 1+ hours. Always seems like a horrible idea at the start since the pain becomes pounding until it slowly gets better. It seems to get the blood flow going and re-oxygenates the... tissues involved. It sucks when it happens on a work day though. Then I'm basically S.O.L. and need to go home early. I don't get opportunities for long walks there. Sometimes naproxen based pills help but not always or well enough. Worst is lying down or sitting; for as long as I do this, the pain worsens until it gets unbearable. Massaging the scalp never seems to help much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MT here also,
Headaches of this variety or tension headaches are much more likely to come from upper trap muscle fibres and lav scap then scm, this also supports the physio underneath stating it's more likely to be pressure on nerves, these nerves have to move up and the superior fibres of traps. Therefore traps being tight and adhered is going to put more pressure on then...
While I believe a tight SCM sis prevalent in headache suffurers, I don't believe for a minute it's strong enough to negate the effects of the posterior neck muscles.
As SCM's name dictates (sternocleidomastoid) it's attachment on the cranium is the mastoid process. Where as most tension headaches radiate from the occipitut, and follows the  superficial back fascia line, which goes over the cranium to finish behind the eyes, which funnily enough is where the headache also seems to sit in most people.
A good way to test if this is the culprit of your headache is to get your thumbs, jam them into the base of your skull where your neck and skull seem to meet, should be a squishy spot under a bony hard plate and move your thumbs along that Ridge while pushing up and in, if the pain starts to become similar to what a headache feels like when it comes on. You've most likely got tight neck muscles and are prone to tension headaches.
If not. Then we'll done you're a minority in today's society. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chronic migraine patient here. Go see a neurologist. Most people with migraines have clean brain scans and good blood work. Migraines are really hard to see on tests, so a lot of internists will give you that &quot;nothing is wrong&quot; reaction. </p>
<p>A good neurologist can give you the correct medication and treatment, that's targeted toward headaches, instead of general pain. There's a lot of new treatments out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. It's worth the pursuit. Chronic to less than 3 migraines a month here. Just had one or two headaches every month for the past few months with just a couple migraines here and there. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's always psychedelic treatment, too. No joke. LSD and psilocybin mushrooms might be an effective treatment for cluster headaches and migraines.</p>
<p>Better yet, you might not even have to &quot;trip&quot;... you can take sub-psychedelic doses and it might work. Lots of anecdotal reports out there, and the research is beginning to look into it and the outlook is good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One night while lying in bed and suffering from a fairly terrible headache and desperate for an end to it, I tried some visualization. I imagined the pain as a gauge pegged at 100%. I very slowly but surely imagined that number dropping, telling myself the pain was reducing with it. Eventually, when I got to 0, I felt alright. Nowadays, I can pretty much get rid of the pain just by directing my attention to it, though it tends to come back if my attention shifts away, and it only works best on pain around the forehead.</p>
<p>Dunno if any of that will help ya, and I'm sure there are better solutions, but who knows. I've had a bit of success with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can also do this with most headaches, if they aren't caffeine withdrawal related.  What I do is think about where the pain is located and think about what/where it is actually hurting (I have no idea what it's called, I'm trying to locate it with my thoughts).  After a minute or so I'll be fine!  I also relieve myself and other's headaches by putting medium pressure on the skull with my fingertips spread out, squeezing the head.  Works for myself and others.</p></div>		</li>
