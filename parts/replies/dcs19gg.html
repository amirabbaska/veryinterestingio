			<div class="markdown"><p>Never knew the difference, and never really listened to hip-hop because I always thought the terms were interchangeable. Thanks for the explanation.</p>
<p>Could you (or anyone else reading this) suggest any songs or albums that are purely instrumental examples of hip-hop.  Being convinced that rap was necessary to the music, I never knew there was such a thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instrumental hip-hop artists with examples:</p>
<p>Bonobo: El Toro </p>
<p>Little People: Start shootin', gravitas, moon </p>
<p>Lunice: Bricks, Fancy forty</p>
<p>Proleter: a million dollar</p>
<p>Also some usually not instrumental hip-hop that works great without vocals: wu tang clan &quot;lyrical swords&quot;, &quot;slow blues&quot;, &quot;cars on the interstate&quot;. Childish Gambino album &quot;because the Internet&quot;, Dr dre Album &quot;2001&quot;, Marsimoto &quot;ring der Nibelungen&quot;. </p>
<p>If you have Spotify, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/galazam_jones/playlist/7tjvbuwfGtAV1LLR16c7n9" target="_blank">here's</a> my instrumental hip-hop playlist. It's all relatively chill cause I mainly listen to this stuff while studying. </p></div>		</li>
