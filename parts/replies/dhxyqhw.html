			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work on dive* boats in the Keys. On a staff only night dive, we once played Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot;. A very otherworldly experience. </p>
<p>And we did the Jaws thing too. Freaked a bunch of people out on multiple occasions. </p>
<p>edit: dive, not rice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Synchronized swimmer here. We use diver recall speakers too, and they carry really well underwater although the quality is a bit different. </p>
<p>Though I feel our OP should know that there is a big difference between an underwater speaker and a &quot;waterproof&quot; one. Waterproof speakers can make sound waves through air, but not very well in the water because it is so much more dense.  Conversely, underwaters are useless on land because of the way they are made-- though I don't know much about the details there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess would be that the underwater speakers would adjust themselves so that the sound seems &quot;normal&quot; underwater. </p>
<p>When a regular speaker makes noise underwater, it would be trying to oscillate at the actual frequency of the noise it wants to produce, but the water would slow down the oscillation of the diaphragm. I'd imagine this is what makes it sound muffled and, well, &quot;underwater.&quot;</p>
<p>I would think you could do some relatively simple calculations (if you're knowledgeable on the subject) that would account for the dampening of the sound while underwater. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: I have a college understanding of wave physics, and an average Joe's understanding of speakers. I just think it's fun to guess how stuff works and nobody else has explained it yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the speaker is self contained so there is no influence of the water on the diaphragm. You'd really be surprised how clean the sound is with a full range. </p></div>		</li>
