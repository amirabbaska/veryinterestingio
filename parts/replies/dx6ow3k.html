<p>it is possible for someone with tinnitus to become deaf and still retain the tinnitus.</p>

<p>So what you mean is that the statement exclusively points to the conclusion that the individual can lose hearing and continue to suffer from tinnitus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the original question is whether a deaf person may have tinnitus or not. A person with tinnitus can become deaf and retain the tinnitus, but can a person who is born deaf develop tinnitus or can a person who becomes deaf who does not currently have tinnitus later develop tinnitus? Without going back and reading the latest answers it seems to me the question hasn't been fully addressed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We need some monuments for patients who've gone through these cray experimental treatments. A bunch of poor fuckers had to go completely deaf in order to show there was an unpredictable link between tinnitus and hearing. Uggh.</p></div>		</li>
