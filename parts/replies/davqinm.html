			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, with some serendipity. The English comes from Latin by way of Norman, from the phrase &quot;status rei publicae,&quot; or <em>condition</em> of the republic. The German (and Dutch, etc) oddly <em>also</em> comes from the Latin, in a rare (though not unheard of) borrowing of an imperial Roman term by what we used to conveniently call &quot;Germanic peoples.&quot; </p>
<p>[Interesting side note: another example of this pathway is the German <em>kaufen</em>, to buy, which originally traces to Latin <em>caupo</em>, a shopkeeper or innkeeper, allegedly because northern Europeans were relatively unaccustomed to purchase by medium of exchange when the Romans introduced their markets to conquered territory.]</p>
<p>The Persian word, as well as other eastern IE cognates, comes from the same Indo-European root *<em>steh₂-,</em> meaning to stand. (again &quot;status rei publicae:&quot; the way things <em>stand</em> in the republic.)  But in the case of Persian, the sense evolved directly from *<em>steh₂-</em> as a <em>place,</em> a physical standing. </p>
<p>So <em>Stadt</em> and <em>state</em> are from the root meaning stand as in how a community is faring, while Persian ـستان is from the same root, but diverging long ago to mean a place, as in a standing location.</p></div>		</li>
