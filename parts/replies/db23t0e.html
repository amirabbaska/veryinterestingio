<p>Tl;dr: Once the clock-hands (wheels) rotate faster than our eyes can process</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your explanation up to here was spot on, but this is very wrong. Our eyes do not &quot;process&quot; in this fashion - they're continuous (with some weirdness due to the way our squidgy organic brains work, but that weirdness doesn't cause the wheel reversing effect).</p>
<p>This effect is seen in the presence of a specific perturbation by another factor - usually by the strobe of artificial lights when we see it with our eyes rather than on cameras. On cameras it would be due to the shutter.</p>
<p>Artificial lights strobe at the frequency of the electricity - in the US this is roughly 60 Hz. This means if the wheels' rotation is just off from 60 Hz, or some multiple of its rotation is just off from 60 Hz, the wheel will be highlighted at specific points that are slightly less than one rotation apart, so your brain will latch on to those highlights for cues to how the wheel moves, and the wheel will appear to be rotating backwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is this the top comment when it's  wrong? Our eyes don't (normally) see in samples, so while this may be correct for cameras, it's definitely wrong for eyes. </p>
<p>This effect happens when something else causes your eyes to sample, like AC power causing lights to strobe at 60Hz, or vibrations.</p></div>		</li>
