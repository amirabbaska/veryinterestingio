			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. One particular night when I was depressed I overdosed on Seroquel. It wasn't a proper handful but enough that it covered the palm of my hand.</p>
<p>I woke up twice catching my breath, and it made me scared so I stayed up. I also had these random, uncontrollable twitches.</p>
<p>I already knew from reading the paper that comes with the package that an overdose can lead to a condition (that I think includes the twitches) that is irreversible. I feel so dumb and ungrateful for life when I think back to that moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad you're still here buddy. I'm prescribed seroquel and it's no joke, and yeah I had to get an EKG and shit because of the irreversible twitching shit. I have a chipped tooth that I already run my tongue over too much, so I've been really wary of taking too much and exacerbating that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much. A chipped tooth? I assume it's because of the mouth dryness caused by the Seroquel?</p>
<p>I was specifically recommend certain products at the pharmacy for the mouth dryness, perhaps you should try out some of those? They have certain tablets and mouth washes to help prevent it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are called extra pyramidal symptoms.  Also the twitching is called myoglobin activity.  Both of these probably lead to the gasping for air.  I take seroquel go insomnia.  Glad you hung in there though, keep pushing life gets better thatâ€™s for sure!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. It's so nice to see such kind words on reddit sometimes.</p>
<p>I thought that in general a large amount of Seroquel could slow down your breathing and eventually lead to cardiac arrest, but I'm honestly not too smart when it comes to this.</p>
<p>One group of people I don't understand are the people who drink a lot of liquor when taking Seroquel. I never knew how bad it could be when I got drunk one night, then took the prescribed 400 mg of Seroquel and hallucinated. Never again.</p></div>		</li>
