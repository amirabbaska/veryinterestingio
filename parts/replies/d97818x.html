<p>That would be a very difficult determination to make, it seems to me, because often traumatic experiences are repressed.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For clarification - and please forgive my reductionist phrasing (I'm on mobile) - are you saying a person actively avoids dealing with traumatic experiences or that a person represses the memory of a traumatic experience? I ask because my understanding of memory repression is that the phenomenon is not a generally accepted one (lots of disagreement) and that the research that's been done to examine the existence of repressed memories is far from conclusive (and in some cases, conflicting).</p>
<p>Would you mind clarifying and possibly giving your take? It'd be much appreciated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not the OP you replied to, but I would say that perhaps a better term for describing this phenomenon is avoidance. This is a hallmark cluster of symptoms in PTSD, and is also a major component of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226779802_Emotional_Processing_Theory_EPT_and_exposure_therapy_for_PTSD" target="_blank">emotional processing theory;</a> the theory that prolonged exposure therapy (one of the most evidence based treatments for PTSD) is based upon. </p>
<p>To paraphrase grossly, it is reasonable to avoid trauma salient information because it's aversive. However, by continuing to avoid trauma information, we prevent ourselves from learning that many of the details of our trauma memories are not objectively dangerous. In other words, we prevent new learning through avoidance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I was referring to when I mentioned not processing/avoiding processing something - the avoidance of dealing with potentially psychically/emotionally damaging or difficult experiences which is not an altogether uncommon coping habit/strategy/mechanism. Wondering if this is what OP was actually referring to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the person to whom you were asking, but I would be glad to give my views and experience. As you said, repression is a topic and defense mechanism that is widely controversial in the psychological profession. There are many cases of repression that are thought to be verified, yet other cases that are thought to be fabricated. Repression is inherently difficult to document seeing as the entire concept rests on memories and the unconscious- two concepts that cannot be quantified. See: </p>

<p>In layman's terms, repression happens when an event occurs that is so traumatic and so debilitating that the brain is unable to process and so to speak &quot;contain&quot; it (dissociation), so the brain then protects itself by &quot;sending&quot; that traumatic memory to the unconscious part of the brain- where the memory cannot be accessed by conscious effort or thought.  Now, a lot of criticism of psychology and its efforts are because there's so few evidence based practices within the profession- many of the theories and techniques operate off of anecdotal evidence and the parts of the therapeutic process that cannot be quantified or measured. In my experience, this does not make the anecdotal evidence any less valid. About 95% of the population I work with is made up of children who have experienced sexual abuse. Many of the clients I see are unable to recall the whole or exact memory of the sexual abuse because of the severity. This is because trauma is &quot;recorded&quot; in a way that is not sequential (again, see dissociation). Further, many clients with extremely traumatic sexual abuse- I.e. Cult rapes, rape from family multiple family members at one time- seem to &quot;place&quot; these memories in a safe place where they cannot hurt them anymore. Still, these memories- or portions of them, or symbolism and metaphor from them- will often arise in dreams, as the OP suggested. Again, indicative of repression and unconscious thought emerging in a way that is still separate and, sort of, safe. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The DSM 5 criteria for PTSD are less restrictive than past criteria in a number of ways. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems closest to a real answer.</p>
<p>It all comes down to the definition of &quot;trauma&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
