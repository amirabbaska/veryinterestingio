			<p>So I've got a severe allergy that causes asphyxiation, and I have Type 1 diabetes which is an auto-immune disorder that makes my body eat its own pancreas.<br><br>Everyone sees me as &quot;Sick all the time&quot; and that I must have a &quot;horribly weak immune system.&quot;<br><br>But what you're saying is... I actually have a massively strong immune system that's got... roid rage or something and is beating up everything in sight with its massive strength?</p>		</li>

			<p>It's not really massively strong. It's more of a defect of self-tolerance. Your immune cells normally undergo a couple of selection steps to remove any that might be able to recognize your own cell components and provoke an immune response. So in Type I diabetes, there's a failure somewhere in preventing self-recognition which causes T cells to destroy your pancreatic beta cells specifically. In fact, your other endocrine/exocrine pancreas cells are probably fine. Your immune system isn't any stronger, it's just acting where it shouldn't. It's not beating up everything in sight. It still has specificity, but just toward something it shouldn't.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'd call your immune system barbaric. An immune system is like an army and they're only supposed to fight rivaling armies. Except your army runs out your castle to go to war with the trees and the more trees they see the angrier they get.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, beating up everything in site, but since your immune system is inside your own body, its beating up yourself from the inside. </p>		</li>

			<p>You probably have a mutation which affects your immune system. There are several major mutations that do this. By mutating certain immune proteins your body becomes less effective at detecting viruses and also detects normal human proteins as foreign. This is why people with one autoimmune disease often get others. You'll want to be on the look out for hypothyroidism and pernicious anemia as well since these are also common auto immune diseases. If you're &quot;sick all the time&quot; it could actually be a byproduct of some of these disease which look like you have a virus but actually don't. Also if your glucose contour isn't quite good you might become acidotic which will also make you fee like crap :/ luckily some easy blood tests can quickly identify all I've mentioned above (apart from the genetic tests they're a bit more specialised but not overly so) :) </p>		</li>

			<p>Actually yes. Autoimmune disorders are caused by an overactive, too strong immune system. There is a fine balance between having a large enough immune response and too much of an immune response. Women's bodies actually tend to err on the side of caution and therefore have overactive immune systems and tend to have more autoimmune disorders. </p>		</li>

			<p>So I asked this in a very similar post that got deleted by the mods here and ignored completely in /r/askscience.  How has anaphalaxis survived natural selection?  Wouldn't this horrible trait have been weeded out a long time ago?</p>		</li>

			<p>People ask biologists this question all the time about any &quot;negative&quot; traits. The answer is that natural section is not that simple. It's not just &quot;you have one bad trait, so your overall fitness is lower,&quot; there are all these different traits at once. The genes which &quot;cause&quot; severe allergic reactions might also be correlated with another highly &quot;positive&quot; trait which will essentially outweigh the effect of the allergy. <br><br>The example often used in biology courses is sickle cell anemia. It's an incredibly painful, damaging genetic disorder. But it's incredibly common in Africa. Reason: malaria is also very common in africa and it just so happens that sickle cell gives one a natural immunity to malaria. This has kept the sickle cell genes in the gene pool. <br><br>We pull out simplified examples like this one because they help people grasp the general concept of natural selection. But in practice it is far FAR more complicated. </p>		</li>
