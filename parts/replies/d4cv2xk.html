<p>Everyone sees me as &quot;Sick all the time&quot; and that I must have a &quot;horribly weak immune system.&quot;</p>
<p>But what you're saying is... I actually have a massively strong immune system that's got... roid rage or something and is beating up everything in sight with its massive strength?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really massively strong. It's more of a defect of self-tolerance. Your immune cells normally undergo a couple of selection steps to remove any that might be able to recognize your own cell components and provoke an immune response. So in Type I diabetes, there's a failure somewhere in preventing self-recognition which causes T cells to destroy your pancreatic beta cells specifically. In fact, your other endocrine/exocrine pancreas cells are probably fine. Your immune system isn't any stronger, it's just acting where it shouldn't. It's not beating up everything in sight. It still has specificity, but just toward something it shouldn't.</p></div>		</li>
