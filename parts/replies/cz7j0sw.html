			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a documentary which said that the cartridge being flung around could give way your position (apparently more than the loud &quot;bang&quot; you just let off). Is that at all true?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I think if you'd hear &quot;<em>thud, BANG</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>BANG, thud</em>&quot; (super sonic/sub sonic) and you're still alive you'd think &quot;Fuck! Sniper! Where?!&quot; </p>
<p>But if you'd hear &quot;<em>BANG, clink clink clink</em>&quot;, you'd probably think &quot;Sniper!? Oh, close by! I'm gonna get you, motherfucker!&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a sniper, but a sound can echo, making it difficult to pinpoint the source of the noise itself.</p>
<p>So in effect, the loud bang the sniper rifle produces gives away the existence of the sniper, but not always their position. </p></div>		</li>
