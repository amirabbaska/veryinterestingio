			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree work kind of goes along with that. You'll never experience a true hangover until you have to jackhammer concrete at 7 am on a bridge overpass while the smell of stale cigarettes and the echoing of &quot;I'll just have one more&quot; runs through your brain as concrete chunks hit your safety glasses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only go out drinking Friday nights if I have the Saturday off. Kids have left home, I can sleep it off all Saturday. My hangovers are still way worse than when I was younger.
Not so much the headaches. Years of drinking have taught me which alcohol I tolerate best. I actually don't get much of a headache at all. But I feel sick, have an immense craving for carbs and junk food, can't think straight and the complete tiredness and lack of motivation to do anything. Urgh.
Actually that does sound like being a teenager again. Maybe my adult me can't handle that. I rarely drink much nowadays. In the winter it's not so bad. I don't mind having a day of sleeping on the sofa before going back to bed, but in the summer I'd rather be out and do stuff on weekends. </p></div>		</li>
