<p>the content providers themselves must pay AT&amp;T (unless, of course, they happen to be owned by AT&amp;T)</p>

<p>It's actually more devious than that. Rather than say that some subsidiary gets it for free, they <em>bill</em> the subsidiary an amazing amount, and then give a kick back.</p>
<p>This way they can tell competitors it's an &quot;open&quot; platform, and anyone willing to pay can join in... Except the competitors won't have the benefit of being owned by the same company, and thus getting the kick back.</p></div>		</li>
