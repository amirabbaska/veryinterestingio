			<div class="markdown"><p>ah, so it's like how many English speakers say things like &quot;I could care less&quot;, or use the phrase &quot;begs the question&quot; to mean &quot;raises the question&quot;? (except much more frequently, and with much weirder/older idioms)</p></div>		</li>

<p>...they'll use it wrong. there are hundreds of idioms like that, and some have even changed meanings during the years. This is by far the most common &quot;typo&quot; or grammatical mistakes in Chinese imo. </p>

<p>so essentially, Chinese <a href="http://trailerpark.wikia.com/wiki/Rickyisms" target="_blank">Ricky-isms</a>. noice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fun part of the English language would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggcorn" target="_blank">eggcorns</a></p>
<p>An example would be:

<p>Now that I think of it, I wonder if Chinese has eggcorns? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a sort of offbeat question for you:</p>
<p>How do most Chinese people feel about older kung fu films? Specifically the ones like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_36th_Chamber_of_Shaolin" target="_blank">36th Chamber of Shaolin</a> or other Shaw Brothers' films. </p>
<p>I imagine it varies from person to person; but I also wonder if the overall attitude is just that they are silly action films (like how Westerners see Die Hard), or if it's more akin to watching a fantasy/medieval story (like watching Brave Heart or Lord of the Rings). </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's my attitude exactly. I don't really like kongfu movies, period. I'd watch them when there is nothing else to watch. There must be some people who think it's some kind of fantasy, but medieval, no. It's too recent to be considered medieval. Films based on events from Ming dynasty and before that are usually considered medieval.</p>
<p>I do like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Yong" target="_blank">Jin Yong</a>'s novels though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I remember being really ignorant and naive as a kid, and thinking that other cultures were really into what sort of &quot;defined&quot; them to outsiders. Like all Chinese people must love kung fu and the cool clothes that they wear. But when I was like 12, I watched Rush Hour 2, and one line from the bad guy (Ricky Tan) really blew my mind. Here's the quote from IMDB:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ricky Tan: I enjoyed that little story you told about the dragon and the treasure. My mother used to tell it to me all the time. Do you know the moral of that story?</p>
<p>Steven Reign: Greed will imprison us all.</p>
<p>[Ricky stabs Reign]</p>
<p>Ricky Tan: I hate that fortune cookie shit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time it suddenly dawned on me that there's probably a lot of Chinese people that find stereotypical things to be silly, or just outright stupid. </p>
<p>I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=592EiTD2Hgo" target="_blank">Big Trouble in Little China</a> captured this pretty well.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I feel similar with certain genres of film, so I can understand this. </p>
<p>When I was child I enjoyed kung fu films because I thought that they were realistic, and if only I believed in myself and learned their secret techniques. But now as an adult, I watch them because they are either really badass or really silly. </p>
<p>Half of the kung fu films are so cheesy that I enjoy them like watching any bad film (example: &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M4buXG3Qmw" target="_blank">Duel to the Death</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGNo2RHPzfI" target="_blank">Food of the Gods 2</a>&quot;). The other half I enjoy because they are badass (example: &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd0bqLQrtdE" target="_blank">Red Cliff</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-HSoOFdJ3s" target="_blank">John Wick</a>&quot;).</p>

<p>I'm going to have to check for some of his translated books. Which ones would you recommend I start with? </p></div>		</li>
