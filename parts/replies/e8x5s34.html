			<div class="markdown"><p>> All animals were vaccinated with MVA before ethanol exposure to ethanol and then again after 7 months of 22 h/day of “open-access” drinking of 4% (w/v) ethanol. Our results indicate that animals whose blood ethanol concentration (BEC) chronically exceeded 80 mg/dl had lower CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation as well as IgG responses following MVA booster than control animals. In contrast, relatively moderate drinkers whose BEC remained below 80 mg/ml exhibited more robust MVA-specific IgG and CD8 T cell responses than controls.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that the two groups are really good comparison.</p>
<p>The control group includes the full population of monkeys.  The &gt;80 mg/dl group of monkeys and the &lt;80 mg/dl group of monkeys are self-segregating since this is an open-access environment.  </p>
<p>Perhaps the heavy drinker monkeys have other correlated problems that affect their immune systems, or their immune systems are poorer resulting in poorer health, general unhappiness, tendency to drink?  </p></div>		</li>
