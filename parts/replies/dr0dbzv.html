<p>The 4WD system can be turned on/off by the driver so the car is only driving two wheels normally, but engages the other two for difficult conditions</p>

<p>This isn’t always true, I drive a 100 series LandCruiser and it has all time 4WD. What separates it from an AED vehicle is the ability to lock the centre diff so equal power can be sent to the front and the back. </p></div>		</li>

and 4WD. Interesting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that Audi Quattros, which have always been referred to as &quot;all wheel drive&quot;, for a decade or so had a set of selectable locking differentials. You could lock the center and rear independently.</p>
<p>On the later models, there was a button the selectively lock the rear differential up to a certain speed, and some models had a limited-slip center differential.</p>
<p>Your Landcruiser, to me, fits the definition of &quot;AWD&quot;, because all wheels are permanently powered and the vehicle is intended to be driven that way.</p>
<p>Even if you can engage all four wheels - if the system isn't designed to be driven in all conditions and speeds like that - it's not all wheel drive. To me, at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. We have a similar set up in our kia. AWD with a 4wd lock switch. Both modes suck compared to my subaru though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Subaru's symmetrical AWD system is plenty capable on difficult off-road terrain. In fact, other than straight up rock climbing or deep mudding, it's better than 4WD in a lot of situations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AWD is generally better in any temporary slippage situation, so rain, snow, ice. Places where you need <em>traction</em>, but not necessarily torque.</p>
<p>4WD is better for offroading, where you say only have 1 wheel on the ground that is getting any decent traction to push you forward, and you need to get power to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it is a good symmetrical AWD system it will be better in dirt, gravel, sand, and especially rain, snow and ice. Subaru is probably the best system out there right now and there are plenty of time's I've seen 4x4 trucks in a ditch and Subaru's doing just fine. </p>
<p>edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7EF2Cdlv8M" target="_blank">here</a> is a great example. Subie can go just about anywhere the truck does, and with more ease and stability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just cheaper to manufacture because the rear driveline doesn't have to handle the same amount of torque as the front driveline equipment; which means you get more car for your money instead of more driveline for your money. The top parent comment of this is incorrect anyway. 4WD systems can have completely open differentials, it's just down to the sum torque distribution of the front and rear drive systems, they do not have to lock to be a 4WD system.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a shaft with handle in the middle and it is attached solidly to the ground at each end of the shaft, you pull on that handle and it twists the shaft and provides equal force to either mounting point at either end of the shaft. Now move the handle 90% of the way along the shaft and do the same, now you have a torque bias to the closest end of the shaft.</p></div>		</li>
