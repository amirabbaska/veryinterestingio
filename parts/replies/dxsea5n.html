			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe so. If  you've ever been in a situation where youve been in danger or vulnerable in some way you may notice sounds are heightened, and you especially notice noises outside normal background sounds. I go camping and have noticed ill wake up in the middle of the night and hear a sound much quiter than regular back ground noise but it stands out because it doesnt belong. In my case once specifically a small sound that turned out to be a nearby snake getting close to the camp fire for warmth. No way should I have heard the sound over various night noises in the woods, but there it was.</p></div>		</li>
