<p>It's possible to drill wells in the chalk that yield millions of gallons of clean water a day.</p>

<p>I'm a grown man and I don't think I will ever be able to wrap my head around the sheer, ludicrous, unfathomable amount of water on Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual total amount of water on Earth is truly incomprehensible. Millions of gallons is still absolutely trivial compared to the total (a billion trillion litres is a nice place to start).</p>
<p>Then again, you could start thinking about all the Earth that <em>isn't</em> water and things get kinda silly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The chalquifer, as you've so elegantly dubbed it, is a really good aquifer.  However, people do get a bit annoyed at the amount of calcium carbonate (or hardness) in the water. Your kettle begins to fur up almost immediately, which sadly isn't conducive for a nice cuppa tea.</p></div>		</li>
