<p>To add, when we tap, we're engaging our other senses (touch).  We move our finger, we feel it hit the table and we hear it.  Whereas others solely get the sound.</p>
<p>Plus, we have control over the beat or intensity of the tapping, so we're likely subconsciously choosing a beat/speed/rhythm/loudness that is not bothersome to ourselves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>People like having control.</p>
<p>When your dog barks in the yard it's less annoying (or not at all) because you can bring her inside (make it stop) when you want. Your neighbor has no control which makes  the barking much more annoying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I tap on things (which is all the time, can't help it), I don't just hear the tapping, I hear an actual drumkit in my head! My mind adds in the sounds automatically.</p>
<p>Other people hear the same one or two tones (finger nail vs skin), while I've got this amazing beat going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drumming has ruined me.<br />
On my wedding day, my soon-to-be mother-in-law thought I was really nervous because I wouldn't stop tapping my feet. Little did she know that I was drumming this awesome double kick beat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do close to the same thing! Not really a drum kit though. If I tap out the rhythm to a song, let's say &quot;Let it Be&quot; for this example, I can hear the different beats in my head and it changes the way/number of fingers that are tapped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>same here! I also do a similar thing with my breath: I'll make breaths in and out to mimic a melody and I'll hear an instrument in my head as I'm doing that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all about the music in our head. Same thing goes with assholes that mumble-dee-hum the music in their heads or whistle, it interferes with the the music in your head. The music in my head is fucking awesome whether It's crap I'm making up or some old rag from turn of the century. But when I try to share that with others by creating some audible noise that's all everyone else hears, noise â€” and it interferes with the awesome music in their heads. That's why I try to keep my awesome music to myself, so everyone doesn't think I like shitty music.</p>
<p>Also, non-musical thoughts have a cadence that gets thrown off by noises that sound like they're supposed to be music but just sound like shit because you can't also hear the music in the noise-maker's head. You can follow along with speech even if it's a foreign language. You can follow background music in a crowd like store or restaurant because usually it's something you can follow. If someone put on some wiry, incomprehensible jazz the space would soon empty of all those that didn't like wiry jazz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually when I'm tapping my fingers and feet, it's to a rhythm in my head. I &quot;hear&quot; the complete song so it sounds good, others just hear <em>tap tap tap tap</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how to say this, because it sounds like a really good answer. But after reading a couple times, the only thing I'm picking up from this is, &quot;It sounds good to you because you're making noise, and it annoys other people because they aren't.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
