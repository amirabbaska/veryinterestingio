<p>The active ingredients in your mouthwash are non-polar molecules — they're oils. Water is a polar molecule. Polar molecules and non-polar molecules don't mix well, with a few exceptions — alcohol is one of those exceptions. It's a non-polar solvent with a polar region, that mixes well with water, allowing the oils that are the active ingredients to remain dissolved in the water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would have helped to preface with something like this before digging in:</p>
<p>Mouthwash has three main ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Alcohol</li>
<li>Mouth-cleaning oils</li>
</ul>
<p>Oil and water don't usually mix, but if you include some alcohol - they mix!</p>
<p>So mouthwash makers add some alcohol to make sure the oil and water mix together in the bottle.
(then explain polar / non-polar)</p></div>		</li>

I'll read what he posted to a group of 18-30 year olds on Monday and I'm sure that the only ones that will get it are those with Chem backgrounds. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Many of the comments I am now receiving on this are &quot;this is a shitty ELI5&quot; and &quot;this is fine if you're a 17 year old Chem I student.&quot; Aside from the fact that this subreddit is supposed to be for layman-friendly explanations and not for literal five-year-olds:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People are mainly complaining because it simply is a shitty answer. Here are a few problems:</p>
<p><strong>A) Only a small subset of mouthwashes use oils</strong> (specifically certain antimicrobial essential oils) as the active cleaning ingredient. Most use surfactants, hydrogen peroxide, Cetylpyridinium chloride, Chlorhexidine, etc, which are not oils.</p>
<p>So your answer only applies to a small amount of mouthwashes. The average ones like Oral-B, Crest, etc do not use oils as the active ingredient(s). They instead either include it for it's antimicrobial activity (more on that next), or because it &quot;adds bite&quot; (read: placebo, makes our mouthwashes seem more intense than others). </p>
<p><strong>B) Alcohol <em>is</em> an active ingredient, though it may not be <em>the</em> active ingredient</strong> (in some cases it's added for it's solubility-increasing effect as you mentioned). Alcohol in mouthwash is effective as a bacteriacidal agent at sufficient levels, as it is extremely toxic to gram-negative bacteria. It's also incidentally effective against many viruses (i.e influenza) though they aren't really a concern in regards to day to day oral health.</p>
<p><strong>C) You really could have made your explanation a lot more accessible without any work or reduction in quality.</strong> All that you'd have to say is:</p>
<p><em>&quot;It's added to certain mouthwashes using essential oils as the primary ingredients, so as to ensure they remain mixed rather than separating. Additionally, it helps those oils to better coat the tissues in your mouth and hence be more effective.&quot;</em></p>
<p>If you feel like adding some technical background, by all means elaborate more as your answer goes on. But as it is your answer starts in a weird place (explaining polar molecules), and doesn't even get to the actual question until the end, and even then it's extremely lacking in detail actually relevant to the question.</p></div>		</li>

Something tells me his son doesn't know what polar vs. non-polar means, or probably even what a molecule or solvent is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: thanks for popping my gold cherry! It's appreciated, and I'm sure il figure out how to use it lol</p></div>		</li>
