			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you hit the head on the nail with the first part. I work in a union facility and up until 6 months ago was part of the union. (Moved into management which is non union) while in the union, it fought to get every dept more money but mine (maintenance) and they got it. Usdd to be there was a 2.50 gap in pay. This made it only 50 cents. </p>
<p>Then i watch people point out for attendance, sleep, steal, lie, and violate policies get their jobs back. Yet i got suspended for something i didnt even do, lost a weeks pay bc of it and the union was making backroom deals that were in complete disagreement with my grievances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I wasn't in the union, I know exactly what you're talking about.
My last job had a bunch of workers sleeping,stealing,texting in the bathroom, drinking on site and much more while never getting written up but I was written up and suspended pay for not putting a label on a package.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert, but I have a strong sense that the &quot;at will&quot; employment is one of the biggest differences between American and European unions. In many European countries, it's really difficult to fire people. They either have to goof really bad, or the employer must go through strictly controlled process where they can only fire people if the business is facing certain criteria (e.g. lay-offs due financial issues).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.  Union contracts upend this US standard and impose a just cause standard.  Just cause is not defined so it creates unpredictable results.  Just cause is still a lower standard than in most EU countries (i.e. still easier to fire people than in Europe)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At will is portrayed as a benefit to the worker but it is 100% not the case. Job security is vital for people to be able to plan. As long as you carry out the work you are contracted to do, why should your employer be able to drop you with no notice? The threat of losing your job on the spot means that the employer owns all the power especially when you have no safety net of free healthcare.</p>
<p>Here in the UK you can be fired immediately only if you are in breach of contract (gross misconduct) or you have been issued warnings etc and gone through the process. You can also be made redundant if the work is no longer needed. That comes with a notice period and a severance package. Conversely, you can't just quit a job, you give notice to leave. This allows the company to find a replacement. It's beneficial for both parties. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>union workers are paid six figures despite not having even finished high school some time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He never made more than 50K/annually, we lived hand-to-mouth the majority of my formative years.  And now that he's retired, they've cut back on all those &quot;great benefits&quot; he was promised through negotiations:/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>union has to represent a terminated employee and will try and get jobs back for members who hide all day and sleep, cause massive damage due to laziness and incompetence, fight, bully, are insubordinate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OR even deal drugs in the parking lot, get into shoot outs with people (on company property) and the reps went to bat for them no matter what.  Oh you have to go to your annual re-hab(edit) to dry out, ok see you in two weeks!
And who picked up the slack?  People who obeyed the laws like my dad.</p>
<p>So if there's no love for unions, I think it's more from experience &amp; having to deal with them,  than &quot;talking points&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I added a couple words because an awful lot of people would be in a lot worse shape if not for unions. </p>
<p>They have drawbacks and behaviors that can incite a lot of justified hatred, and both you and OP have called some really major ones out, but unscrupulous employers would absolutely take advantage of things like unfairly low wages and unsafe working conditions to increase their profits and save money if unions were altogether absent.</p></div>		</li>
