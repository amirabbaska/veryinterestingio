You get used to all kinds of things that your brain just ignores. The blood veins inside your eyeball actually pass over the receptors, so your vision is actually obstructed by your blood veins, but your brains filters that out as well. </p>
<p>You can test this out yourself, if you create a tiny hole by curling up your index finger, look through it at a bright surface with one eye and then move your finger from side to side quickly while looking through it. </p>

For example, as a sommelier you are encouraged to use scentless hygiene product, not load up on perfume, smoke, use (scented) fabric softener, have a highly perfumes house, etc.
Basically, if you smell a smell often, your brain starts to ignore it. This can lead you to be biased in your perceptions of taste/smell.</p></div>		</li>
