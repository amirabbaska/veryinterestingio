			<div class="markdown"><p>Most adhesives act via Van der Waals forces. This is a completely separate phenomenon from chemical bonds. Only a few adhesives (like epoxies) actually chemically bond with their substrates, and even then only with some substrates. Van der Waals forces are caused by random molecular charge distribution patterns.</p></div>		</li>

If you interlace the pages of two books they would be nearly impossible to pull apart due to friction. It has nothing to do with the pages chemically welding together. Just friction.</p></div>		</li>
