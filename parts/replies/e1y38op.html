<p>He won't have a cost basis for capital gains.  If he sells them and reports the income, it would be taxed as regular income.  My guess is he would eventually sell them for cash.  I'm not an accountant or finance person, this is just what I think based on what I know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He was underreporting his income. It’s tax fraud (in the US, anyway). </p>
<p>All income is taxable unless otherwise specified in the US tax code. The IRS is unlikely to learn about it without a paper trail though. The people paying the cash probably aren’t filing a 1099 to report paying the lawyer (as is undoubtedly required because there’s no way a $599 watch is gonna appreciate in value).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue would be if he ever gets audited and has tens of thousand of dollars in income that he can't account for. With how understaffed the IRS is he will probably be fine unless he does something else to attract their attention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.  The lawyer should be reporting that as income.  Likelihood of being caught is low, but since he apparently <em>tells</em> people about his illegal behavior it goes way, way up.  Particularly since the IRS rewards tipsters with a cut of the unreported money.</p></div>		</li>
