			<div class="markdown"><p>Best Pizza Delivery Sim I have ever played. 10/10 would fight crime and deliver pizza again. For real though, between Spider Man and Armored Core my childhood was pretty fantastic. So, thank you for your impact on gaming and my life.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother and I loved that game to death. You are the reason why I love open world games. Anytime I play open world games as an adult I think back to the amazing feeling I had climbing to the very top of the Empire State building. It was transforming and made little me feel like I was on top of the world!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks for giving my son and I hours upon hours of enjoyment. We even got our Gamecube copy signed by Bruce Campbell, and played the new Spiderman at E3 I think...7 times?</p></div>		</li>
