			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a grocery store and occasionally have customers complain about how much they hate self-checkout because it's taking the place of human cashiers (we only have 4 self-check machines and 6 regular registers, so at most it's taking the place of one extra cashier). I just tell them &quot;Well, that's how capitalism works.&quot;</p>
<p>With the way things are going, our country has three options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make legislation to restrict how much automation a business can have, effectively forcing them to hire additional employees</li>
<li>Set up a universal basic income (or something like it) so that people being replaced by automation isn't as much of a problem, and unemployment is no longer a road to poverty</li>
<li>Do nothing, let capitalism do its thing, and watch as more and more jobs are lost to robots</li>
</ul>
<p>The first will be fought tooth-and-nail by those whose wealth comes from automation, the second will be fought by the populace for the same reason welfare is looked down upon now (&quot;freeloaders leeching off the government&quot;), and the third is probably what's going to happen because the current administration (and potentially future ones) are just blaming the loss of jobs on something else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have any wealth in automation, and even I would fight against regulating it tooth and nail.</p>
<p>We should strive to do the highest quality of work in the most efficient way possible. That means using machines. The less companies have to pay for labor, the cheaper their products become, which benefits society as a whole. The less companies have to pay for labor, the more money they have to invest in new technologies, which benefits society as a whole. We should not hold back productivity or innovation simply to keep a few people artificially employed.</p>
<p>The government would probably lose more money by regulating automation (thus limiting productivity/income/taxable revenue) than from implementing UBI.</p>
<p>So yeah, I'm fully against option one, I'm hoping for option two, and am preparing for the worst-case: option three. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first point is forced inefficiency in order to save jobs. It's just dumb, especially in a global economy where more efficient companies overseas will wipe the floor with their US competition. </p>
<p>Reminds me of states like Michigan which don't allow direct to consumer sales for car companies in order to save the dealerships. This has been a problem for Tesla as you may know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Companies overseas already wipe up the floor (and their asses as well) with US competition by using basically slave labor (even children work long hours with no overtime, sick time, or vacation).  The precious metals used in computers and cell phones and tvs etc are mined by adults and children in Africa.  People are dying so we can have cheap electronics and those people are considered expendable by all.  Indian programmers replace American programmers because they work at a cheaper rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's no different than a tariff to restrict trade and protect an industry within you're own borders. It's forced inefficiency to save jobs at the expense of the consumer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No company on earth will build a new factory and staff them with manual labor. Everything that can be automated will be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Capitalism also happily would support grocery stores that have human only cashiers, so long as consumers are willing to pay more for the experience.</p>
<p>Capitalism moves markets toward what consumers want. If consumers want cheaper groceries more than human tellers then that's what we'll get. If consumers want human tellers more than cheaper groceries then that's what we'll get. </p>
<p>(And here's the best news - the marketplace is big enough that we can support both!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consumers have a limited amount of money. Consumers are forced to be frugal.</p>
<p>The businesses are making the consumers poor by making their employees poor. Everyone is fucked in their workplace, everyone goes and fucks other businesses. This cycle will continue, because no one is being ethical here. Regular people cannot afford to be ethical and businesses cannot afford to be ethical. </p>
<p>Humanity will be much more 'compact' and 'efficient' once this process settles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point about other companies is really important and needs to be emphasised.</p>
<p>In the past there was often a very obvious and visible process where a company would replace workers with machines and a load of people would be laid off and that's what people would notice.</p>
<p>But what seems to be happening a lot now is that new companies are turning up with no history of employing large numbers of people or old machines, they are setting up with the best available tech and processes and beating the incumbents. Sometimes they are doing things in a totally different way. For example, accountants are not just having their jobs automated away, companies are being built around ways to avoid hiring them in the process.</p>
<p>This process is often a lot less visible than the old, mass-layoff, approach.</p>
<p>Edit: Another example is online banking. It isn't that bank tellers are being replaced by robots that sit behind the counter, it's that much of the need for having physical branches has simply disappeared thanks to online and mobile banking. Once apon a time you used to have to physically go to your bank to find out how much money you had, doing that now would get you weird looks. I go into a bank about once every six months, if that.</p></div>		</li>
