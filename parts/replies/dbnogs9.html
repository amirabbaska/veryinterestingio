			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a porn website that was free but you had to solve a captcha. Actually, the captcha was by a legitimate website to prevent bots from creating emails for spamming and the porn site displayed the captcha for the porn site visitor to solve. Free labor. Have to hand it to them. They don't yank you around.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'll grab an example in a sec  </p>
<p>Edit: Sadly I can't find the original paper I read that had some good examples but from what I remember this is what they should look like</p>
<p>Hard: (can have some variations in how hard they are)

<p>In this case text is the hardest challenge, images the medium challenge and the check box the minimal challenge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Images are harder than text - OCR can be coded. &quot;Click on the cats&quot; requires a human eye (as of now).</p></div>		</li>
