			<div class="markdown"><p>Phones have accelerometers that the algorithm used to determine steps. Almost all smartphones have them.</p>
<p>Edit: Expanding on what I said. An easy and simplified example would be to plot the acceleration versus time when walking. In general, it would have some sort of sinusoidal shape with peaks and troughs that line up with when you lift your foot and when you step down. The phone can count the number of peaks and troughs to determine how many steps. Throughout the day, you may shuffle around and introduce some amount of acceleration that may look like a step. A good algorithm will be able to determine whether it is actually a step.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And even if they don't; they use similar tech and can be incredibly accurate. </p>
