			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. In fact this is the case in most food-poisoning. This is called intoxication in contrast to an infection (which for examples happens with salmonella).  </p>
<p>A common bacteria causing intoxication is Staphylococcus aureus. Note that this is the same bacteria responsible for many hard to impossible to treat &quot;hospital acquired infections&quot; (MRSA = methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus). It occurs naturally in the nose and skin on humans. This and other bacteria produce toxins that stay in the food and are heat resistant.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness#Enterotoxins" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness#Enterotoxins</a></p>
<p>So cooking the food then has no effect on the toxin. A common food poisoning food is potato salad because of the main heat-cool cycles. You heat it to cook the potatoes. Then it gets cooled for preservation and then heated again before it's served and so forth. Especially during the cool-down there is a temperature window ideal for bacteria to grow. Therefore you should always cool-down foods as quickly as possible. Lettign them cool down at room temperature for couple hours first before putting in the fridge is a dumb idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Little of column A, little of column B. Sometimes bacteria get toxins from other bacteria too, like in the case of strains of <em>E. coli</em>, which is usually relatively harmless, obtaining the Shiga (or Shiga-like) toxin from another bacterium. Shiga toxin (or verotoxin) comes from <em>Shigella dysenteriae</em>, which is pretty damn awful. If I remember correctly, we don't know if <em>E. coli</em> got the toxin directly from Shigella or via another bacteria that produces the same toxin (or that got it from Shigella). </p>
<p>Sometimes toxins can also cause the body of the infected host to do things that make the bacteria easier to spread and find new hosts. If a bacteria is spread via the fecal-oral route for example,  causing your host to have diarrhea could be advantageous, as it increases the chance of spreading to a new host (more pooping=more shedding, especially in areas with low sanitation). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soap and fire works OK.  They were also acidophilic and lived at pH 2. You can't even culture on agar and need to use a complicated matrix that withstands the heat and pH.  They also don't grow without filtered purified mineral water directly from the volcano lake. We had to hike it out and process it so we could use it in the lab.  Crazy, right? What's really crazy is that there was biodiversity and density close to what you see in fresh water or ponds. We had exclusive access because it's a dangerous place (dead animals around it that drank it) and so nearly everything we worked on was undiscovered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They avoid the rays basically - if they are lucky. Anything bigger gets hit more likely (that's also why they have the rotating plates) - so even if a sponge is not hit everywhere, they will heat up... and the bacteria dies from the heat, not the rays.</p></div>		</li>
