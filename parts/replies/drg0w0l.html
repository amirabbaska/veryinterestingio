<blockquote>
<p>Contrary to popular belief you don't catch a cold just because you went out in cold weather, or you were sweating and some wind happened to blow at that time, or you were walking around barefoot on the cold floor. It's silly, how can cold temperature produce a virus out of thin air in the first place?
The cold (and flu) virus are flying all around us, and really like snuggling in our respiratory tract. They are usually in inactive form. Meaning they are just waiting for the right conditions to start reproducing, by invading your body and hijacking your cells. Every time you come in contact with another human, it's likely you'll exchange virus particles. But they are inactive, so it's fine.
However, the virus particles will activate if there's a significant drop in temperature. Particularly at 30-32 C (body normal is 36-37 C), is the perfect temperature for their proteins to start acting up and invade living cells of a host organism. This is why you are more prone to catch a cold if you are feeling cold. Inhaling the cold air in your environment will drop the temperature in your respiratory tract and cause the virus particles to activate.
Winter is a nasty period for cold, not just because of the weather, but because we tend to all stay inside with other humans. More contact and breathing the same air over and over, maximizes the chances that you get some virus particles residing in your respiratory tract, waiting for a chance to strike.
So, you need to make sure you are somewhere warm, make sure you air the rooms you occupy whenever the outside weather allows, change environments, avoid packed rooms and always cover up your chest, neck and mouth/nose with warm clothing. Take the precautions and you'll minimize your chances of catching a cold.</p>

<p>Not to mention all the people who work crappy jobs that force them to come in even when sick (or don't pay sick days so they can't afford to stay home), which are most often the lower end retail/food service jobs, meaning they have a ton of contact with the public as well as their co-workers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently suffering from the flu right now.</p>
<p>Started as a scratchy throat yesterday morning and by this morning, it was bad enough that I had to call into work.</p>
<p>By this morning, my flu leveled up a few times and went down the Whats Work? skill tree. It used a Skill Point to gain the over powered damage over time Max Mucus ability and then upgraded it with the Sounds Like Shit perk. It also chose the Haaaave You Met The Chills? ability.</p>
<p>So I've been watching Netflix and Prime all day and still feel like shit so I fear I may have to call out again tomorrow.</p></div>		</li>
