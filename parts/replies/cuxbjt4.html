			<div class="markdown"><p>As I state further down this thread, even if you could release all the CO2 at the poles, it's still just not that much.</p>
<p>As it is, Mars has about 5 degrees C of greenhouse warming from its 96% CO2 atmosphere, raising the average temperature from -55 C to -50 C.  Even if the amount of atmosphere doubled from sublimating everything at the poles - a very, <em>very</em> optimistic estimate - you're only going to raise the temperature a few more degrees. (It will not be another full 5 degrees, since a good deal of the main CO2 absorption line is already saturated.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the permafrost in the Martian soil? I've read that as the average temperature increases from co2 released from the poles it would begin a feedback process that would release co2, methane, and h2o trapped in the Martian permafrost which would cause further warming. </p>
<p>My personal favorite idea for terraforming Mars is taking asteroids rich in h2o, co2, and ammonia from the asteroid belt and smashing them into the planet. Each impact raises the atmospheric temp 2-3 degrees and adds greenhouse gasses and other important elements. The heating and gasses trigger a greenhouse effect and if aimed correctly could do a better job of melting the poles than nukes. This triggers  the aforementioned feedback loops that releases even more greenhouse gasses from the permafrost.  About 10 impacts, one every 10 years for a century, would put mars in a much more favorable condition for colonization. At least according to this guy: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Zubrin" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Zubrin</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that the absorption line being saturated would mean that adding more CO2 causes less warming, proportionally.  This argument is something that the climate change skeptic crowd use, but it's incorrect (At least on Earth).  Reason being that as you add more and more CO2 you start to optically saturate higher and thinner layers of the atmosphere.  These layers, which previously would've let the IR radiation through, now absorb most of it instead.  This means that the layers of gas which <em>do</em> radiate heat away end up being higher up and colder and since colder bodies radiate less energy less overall heat is lost to space.  Realclimate did a post on this <a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/06/a-saturated-gassy-argument/" target="_blank">a few years ago</a>.  As such I don't think your assumption that doubling the amount of CO2 would double the forcing is necesarilly correct, and I think it might be a somewhat more complex calculation with some big nonlinearities in there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer your actual question, Mars could not hold onto a thicker atmosphere. Mars's planetary core has cooled causing the planet's magnetic field to become very weak, thus allowing the solar wind to strip away the atmosphere.</p>
<p>&quot;Evidence collected by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) indicates that the planet may have once had a global magnetic field, generated by an internal dynamo. Evidence suggests that the planet’s magnetic field reversed direction, or flipped, several times in its early days as conditions in the mantle and core of the planet changed. But that dynamo faded, leaving only faint traces of its magnetic past locked in the Martian crust.&quot;

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why there is no oxygen just sitting around is because it is a light molecule. Co2 is not, that is why it is still there and became ice even. So no, as long as the carbon is bound to the oxygen it will not be blasted off into space. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Moreover, if you did use that many nukes, you would've just strongly irradiated the largest source of water ice we know of (found under the dry ice), making colonization that much more difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modern nuclear bombs do not cause that much fallout. Certainly not as much as people think. If they did, they would be inefficient, since the whole idea is to burn up the payload. Water itself is not easily made radioactive (hence they use it to cool and moderate nuclear reactors).</p>
<p>If radiation is a concern, Mars already has a radiation problem even without the nukes, due to a lack of a strong magnetic field like Earth has. I don't see any way for astronauts to avoid that problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water itself is not easily made radioactive but saltwater is and other water with a lot of minerals in it. So yes, if you nuked the poles the resultant fallout would be radioactive along with the water because it's not pure water. </p>
<p>And even though modern nukes are more efficient, they still can generate lots of radioactive fallout, especially when they are detonated in dusty areas, much like Mars. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The elements involved would only produce short lived isotopes, and not in great abundance since neutron capture is very unlikely except for thermal (room temperature) neutrons. If you detonate a nuke under seawater, that's a different situation than on mars.</p>
<p>For example, Na-24 (radioactive sodium) has a half-life of only 15 hours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to get an idea.</p>
<p>I'll use the assumptions listed in most articles, that the goal is to sublimate the 9500-12500 (say 10k for simplicity) km^3 CO2 that's in the South Pole. </p>
<p>I can't find an article anywhere that lists the  enthalpy of sublimation of dry ice at the temps/pressures on the martian poles, so let's take a best case scenario of it being equal to STP (561 kJ/kg) , that a nuclear blast will magically transfer <em>all</em> the energy to the CO2 phase change and that we're talking about pure CO2 and not carbon-dioxide water clathrate. </p>
<p>So, 10000km^3 CO2(s) = ~ 1.5 x 10^16 kg CO2(s), so 561x1.5x10^16 kJ needed = 8.41x10^18 kJ.</p>
<p>Total energy that has been released from all nuclear testing on Earth since 1996 amounts to 2.13500 × 10^15 kJ. So we just need 400 times as much. </p>
<p>Of course it's way more complex than that but as I said in the beginning, just to get an idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to see how 10 Mm^3 of CO2 released into the Martian atmosphere would do anything. The mass of the current Martian atmosphere is 25 Pg, mostly CO2. 10 Mm^3 is something like 15 Gg, less than a millionth of what's already there.</p>
<p>I think the idea is to try to start a chain reaction that warms the planet enough to release frozen CO2 from the regolith, which is orders of magnitude more than what's at the poles. But I think you need a much larger trigger than this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if it was that easy to warm up Mars it would have happened already through vulcanism or comet impacts...although I guess some of those signs of flash floods could have been from temporary warming in the past.</p></div>		</li>
