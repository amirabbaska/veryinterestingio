			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several methods for visualizing the vocal folds via laryngoscopy, including rigid and flexible scopes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngoscopy</a> </p>
<p><strong>NB: These videos show views of the inside of the human body; some people find viewing such material to be uncomfortable</strong> : </p>
<p>The most common way to visualize the motion of the vocal folds is to use stroboscopic laryngoscopy. Here, a light is rapidly flashed to &quot;freeze&quot; the motion at various points along their open-close cycle, allowing the full cycle to be visualized in slow motion.</p>
<p>Here is an example of stroboscopic laryngoscopy: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tlpkdq8a8c" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tlpkdq8a8c</a> </p>
<p>High-speed video is great because you can see the motion as it unfolds (haha) but it is much more data intensive. Here is a nice youtube video of a high speed video of the larynx in action: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kHdhbEnhoA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kHdhbEnhoA</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The maximum speed can be much higher because as you sum up several harmonics, the combination can move a lot faster</p></div>		</li>
