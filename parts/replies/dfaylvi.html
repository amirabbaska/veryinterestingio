			<div class="markdown"><p>Pulling a hand away from a stove is actually a reflex, not an instinct. The muscle jerk happens due to a spinal cord reaction <em>before the brain consciously registers pain</em>. Which is pretty neat! It's called the &quot;pain-jerk reflex&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have pretty severe social anxiety and I'm constantly catching myself holding my breath or just breathing incredibly shallow. It's the most difficult thing about being in a stressful social interaction (which is most of the time unfortunately)..</p>
<p>Do you know of any ways I can help to combat this? Trying to stay in the moment (mindfulness) hasn't been very affective for me :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing about the ~mindfulness~ is for you to realize what are you doing at the time. For example, breathing. The moment you realize you are holding your breath or being shallow, you change the pattern. Just that. And it is not a problem if is hard or if you have difficulties, you just realize, think &quot;oh, I am breathing bad&quot; and change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea that's definitely the train of thought I've tried to have when I catch myself doing it, it's just that while I'm in the moment, trying to focus on calming/slowing my breathing down diverts all my attention to that, which then takes me away from the conversation almost entirely. I'm sure I just need more practice, it's just been pretty disheartening</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I count.  If you focus on the numbers, your subconscious will take over and you'll breathe normally.  Maybe.  If I'm super stressed, I count by 5, or count backwards.  Something different to throw me off.  Hope it helps.</p></div>		</li>
