			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's amazing how many people (whom I couldn't actually see until I paid) 'liked' me before I subscribed to match.  It was like 5-10 a day... not so much now. I guess I got uglier after I paid for a subscription.</p>
<p>Match.com is the absolute worst too.  I have no idea how they are popular <em>at all</em> except for the very lucky URL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried match. I agree it’s terrible. Only talked to a few people and never actually met anyone. They would constantly give me “matches” of people who were not at all what I said in my preferences that I was looking for. Either far away or much older. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s too bad. I don’t know what they’re doing now, but they used to be good. I met my husband through Match almost 20 years ago. </p>
<p>You could create/update a profile, do the survey, view and save matches for free. You had to update your profile at least once a week to keep your profile near the top of someone else’s list of matches. </p>
<p>You only paid if you wanted to initiate contact. I think it was like $10/month or less for unlimited first contacts (i.e. the fee was to message them first, but then you could message and respond to the other without any further charges, so person you contacted didn’t have to pay anything to respond to you)</p>
<p>It was mostly free/cheap because online dating was still mostly seen as somewhat of a last resort so companies wanted to make it as free as possible to get customers and have those customers bring in more people through word-of-mouth. </p>
<p>My husband used to tease me that I still owe him the $10 he paid to contact me. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But then again I live in a major metropolitan area so your mileage may vary. It was also like a decade ago, so who knows what it's like now</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone that has actually worked as a Text chat operator - you have to change the subject, give excuses (“Its too soon”, “I’ve had scary experiences before, I want to take it slowly”). And always reply with open answers and questions, always sending messages that need a reply. </p>
<p>There is a huge amount of money in those sites, sadly. With some users spending around £2.50 just to send a message and sending hundreds and hundreds of messages. </p>
<p>And obviously it is the vulnerable people that are more likely to be taken in. Though when you see some of the explicit messages that 75-80 year old guys are sending to “18 year old girls” you do sometimes lose sympathy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Worked for one of these sites. Often the prettiest women are profiles are labelled as &quot;hostess&quot; profiles but are not those women but actually Indians. and completely legal to do so (read the terms and conditions). They pretend to be the hostesses to keep the conversations going so monthly renewals carry on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually met with someone who ran one of these sites before. There's a lot of variation among the sites but the scam typically works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy a bunch of domains and set up fake dating profiles, especially catered towards fetishists (e.g. &quot;BBWParadise.com&quot;, &quot;SexyAsianSingles.com&quot;)</li>
<li>When a user signs up, they can browse through the fake profiles and start a chat.</li>
<li>The chat reroutes them to a brief 3-5 min conversation that's been outsourced to a 30 year old guy in the Philippines or India that's getting paid under 5 bucks a day. (This is the most outrageous part, but in this case it's true)</li>
<li>Right when the conversation is getting good (it's all scripted), the convo is locked and you need to pay a high subscription fee.</li>
<li>After you pay, you can message again. Most of the time, things go silent and no matter who you 'message', you don't get answered at all, or a script takes over shutting you down pretending to be the girl. </li>
<li>Most people forget about the site and keep getting billed forever.</li>
