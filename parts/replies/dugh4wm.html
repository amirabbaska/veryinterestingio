			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the problem here is exactly in terminology.  Synthetic in every other industry and product implies manufacturing artificially from chemical processes unrelated to the naturally occurring or naturally grown genuine item; ie synthetic diamonds which generally involves carbon plasma deposits. Or synthetic gasoline or oil which are chemically modified from coal or natural gas feedstock.  Synthetic implies it was manufactured from chemicals instead of just grown in a tank.  But of course 'lab-grown' will frighten all the ignorant housewives and tinfoil hat Brigade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No I'm just going off of what he mentioned and what I know about animal development.</p>
<p>There are a whole lot of complex operations that use a combination of organs, hormones, and what have you to grow muscle and manage nutrients. My understanding of lab grown meat is that they take a muscle tissue sample and give it nutrients to keep it alive and allow the muscle cells to grow and replicate. From what I take, there is no system to store fat. And even if there is, adding fat isn't all it takes to make a great steak. What makes a steak a prime is the amount of marbling it has, and marbling is storage of fat between the muscle fibers. And that is something fairly difficult to do. Not all animals do it well and not even all breed of cattle do it well. That why you always hear about Angus beef, because they are very good at marbling and are more likely to develop higher quality cuts of steak. And diet also affects the marbling. A 100% grass fed cow or steer is not going to get you a lot of marbling. That's why cattle is fed corn at the very end of their production. This introduces a lot of calories in a short period and puts on a lot of fat. I would imagine that would be a very complex and difficult system to replicate. So that why I suspect if it was used for steaks they would be very lean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've heard as of results testing this is indeed the case.  Lab grown meat tends to be under stressed, which seems an obvious enough conclusion considering the circumstances.  Fortunately there are already solutions underway that will probably eventually be implemented.  If you think about it, all physical exertion on an animals muscles are, at their core, electrical stimulus.  Therefore electrically stimulating the meat as it's being grown can, in theory, produce similar muscle development, fragmenting, and regrowth that would result in a tough cut of beef or overly hardened steak. </p>
<p>For now though, and in the foreseeable future I would imagine most synthetic meats will be sold under a label for mechanical processing, IE. grinding and reforming, liquidizing and reforming (think hot dogs and sausages), pre-cooking and compressing (microwave meals), or pre-prepped meals (ready to eat products.)  I could be VERY wrong about this but I think it'll be a long while before we see any synthetically lab grown prime cut steak slabs on the market </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's one hell of a cut in the meat-market though. Can't speak for everyone, but I know I, my family, my friends, and my coworkers eat more ground beef than steaks.</p>
<p>If this can eliminate antibiotic misuse, carbon footprint, and ethical issues, I don't see fewer people wanting to eat synthetic meat than do ground beef. I'm no vegan and yet, like many other danes, I already go for ecology when shopping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not 100% sure but i think this &quot;lab broth&quot; you are refering to is Fetal Bovine Serum.
FBS, as the name implies, is a byproduct made from the blood of cow fetuses. If a cow coming for slaughter happens to be pregnant, the cow is slaughtered and bled, and then the fetus is removed from its mother and brought into a blood collection room. 
The fetus, which remains alive during the following process to ensure blood quality, has a needle inserted into its heart. Its blood is then drained until the fetus dies, a death that usually takes about five minutes. This blood is then refined, and the resulting extract is FBS.
The more you know amiright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially yes, the lab broth I was referring to can indeed be FBS, but it doesn't necessarily have to be.  Unfortunately my  &quot;source required&quot; qualifications come from a lab I worked in at university where part of what they did was work on synthetic meats.  It was rabbit, not beef, and part of my duties working there initially was to extract the blood from adult rabbits in much a similar method you described above.  Yes they are alive, yes it is not a pleasant or particularly gentle process but I guess it's how the science was being done.<br />
I didn't enjoy the process in any way, and actually eventually resigned from that lab to work for another that was focused on GMO corn advancements.
The goal in large for many people including myself is to eventually wean animals out of food altogether.  'Reduce suffering for sustenance' is the primary tag line.  It'll likely be decades if not generations before lab grown meat and lab produced nutritional products overtake today's common animal food sources but in the meantime the best we can do is look for meat products that are produced clean label and hope the animal that died for the food didn't suffer too much. </p></div>		</li>
