<p>So what is energy then? In my description above, energy will be stored as the kinetic energy of the final constituents, which you can extract (into heat for example). Say there is a hypothetical process that results in excess energy, but no mass; where would it go? The only way to store the energy somewhere would be to use massless particles: the photons. So then I would refer you to the other answers and discussion threads under this here question regarding particles--anti-particles. But to summarise the problem there: anti-particles are not easily accessible; not easy to create in large amounts.</p>
<p>The strength of fusion (and fission) is that you have an abundance of, say, hydrogen, and even though you only use ~0.3%, when repeating it a lot (say realistic amounts, ~10^{23} or so [1]) you would get a lot of energy in total. A single particle--anti-particle annihilation would not be much energy, so you'd have to repeat it a lot, which would be the hard part. You'd only get a factor 100 increase by using a single particle--anti-particle pair [2], so you'd have to create ~10^{21} (23-2 = 21) anti-particles to even be able to start competing.</p>

Assuming comparable masses, which is not a good assumption, since building whole atoms of anti-matter is even harder.</p></div>		</li>
