			<div class="markdown"><p>YES! Thank you so much. You've officially made me scared to go anywhere on the internet haha. This was the type of response I was looking for, even though, I started getting lost at the end of Post 3 to part way into post 4. I need to re-read it, I think I need to take some time to actually absorb all this new info. Thanks for the links, I'll be sure to do some research on those!</p>
<p>Mr. Robot was an amazing show, partly what drives my interest. I love seeing the battles of intelligence that take place (Although, tv/movies embellish this) over a computer realm that can have seismic implications. </p>
<p>I would follow anything you do with regards to a 101 course/blog or anything else along those lines. I realize you are busy, and other people have asked you to do the same. It's ultimately up to you, as long as you aren't too busy, but I understand you're doing this out of your own volition. I'll PM you with anymore questions that arise from this discussion. Thanks again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please never delete this 4-part rant, you're a fucking god. I will repeatedly come back to this as I am in the process of learning netsec,pentesting, etc and this is the most comprehensive thing I've read. Everyone else already commented shit I know but this, this is pure gold. If I wasn't so broke I'd gild the fuck out of you. Thank you for this. </p></div>		</li>
