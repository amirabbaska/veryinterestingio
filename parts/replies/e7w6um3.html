			<div class="markdown"><p>For a reason as to why you can’t tell (why couldn’t you just follow each particle and thus keep track of which is which?), the trajectory of a particle in quantum mechanics just isn’t defined. All you have is a joint wave function that gives the probability of finding a particle at A and another at B.</p>
<p>So the particles truly are indistinguishable. In fact, this behaviour places constraints on the wave function that leads to things you might have heard of like the Pauli Exclusion Principle or Bose-Einstein Condensates: it’s really a fundamental part of QM.</p></div>		</li>
