			<div class="markdown"><p>Will your adaptive immunity trigger every time you are infected with a new strain of (rhino) virus? Meaning you are less likely to get seriously ill as time goes by?</p>
<p>I know several teachers and kindergarten employees - they mention they get ill a lot the first few years....then they stop getting ill. So there's something about it, question is how often it is triggered, tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general your body does remember what it's been infected with and this can help build immunity for the future, however these viruses are like the flu and mutate regularly so your chances of getting another bad cold at some point doesn't really change.</p>
<p>From what I remember there's evidence to suggest that being too clean when you're young can impact the effectiveness of your immune system (especially regarding allergies and asthma) but I don't know too much about it - look up the Hygiene hypothesis.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm useless at grammar and proof reading</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Parents threw me outside and made me play in the dirt growing up, got sick a lot then, but now I barely get sick (usually a minor cold once a year, and I work in a convenience store 9.5 hours a day so it's not like I live in a bubble). I tend to believe the Hygiene hypothesis :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe I have experienced it too .... I never even knew what allergies we're until I moved to Canada. They just weren't as prevelent in India, and I often don't get really sick when some bad shit is going around town. I don't get sick often either, and I am not necessarily leading a super healthy lifestyle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you acquire lifelong immunity like with the Standard Childhood Diseases, there are apparently over 10,000 types of rhinovirus, and nobody will ever have or want to have enough colds to acquire broad-spectrum immunity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That matches my own anecdotal experience too. I used to fly a lot for work (2 flights per month roughly) and did that for 4 years. The first few years, I would catch a cold from someone on maybe 50% of the flights I took. It was a miserable time of my life because I felt like I was constantly getting sick. The upside is that I rarely get colds now. I'll hang around with my friends and they'll be suffering with a bad cold but I usually end up with significantly milder symptoms to the point where I question if I even have a cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly when I moved to Korea for the first time (from the US) I would get sick like once a month.</p>
<p>The food made me stomach sick almost on a weekly basis, and I would get a bad cold/sore throat monthly, usually lasting 2~ days. Even got bad fevers multiple times. It was really hell.</p>
<p>After a few years, I completely stopped getting sick. I think my imnune system fought off pretty much every Asian cold virus in existence, lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same way, and I chalk it up to 2 things</p>
<p>1: My parents <em>rarely</em> putting us kids on antibiotics. Sorry, gotta tough it out and let your body fight it.</p>
<p>2: A large family of 11. Lots of sickness to go around.</p>
<p>I'm a bit over a decade in with my employer and their sick time never expires.  I have over 800 hours of sick time built up now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've convinced myself that at first symptom of a cold, all I have to do is down a ton of Vitamin C, some nyquil, and then sleep for as long as possible and I'll wake up symptom free and no cold follows... it works 99% of the time.</p>
<p>Edit: I have no scientific, data driven, lab tested proof. But it works for me. I've been doing this since I've been teaching (over 13 years) and I've kept a cold... maybe twice.</p></div>		</li>
