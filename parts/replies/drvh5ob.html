			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of  “Use my sign in info to automatically finish setting up my device”, that default setting was causing huge problems. Up until I disabled it, periodically no matter what I did, the start menu and pretty much any Windows menus would not open.  A lot of people are having this problem too</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not in Windows anymore, but I know the folks who implemented that. It was a super tricky feature to inplement, because they didn't want to just save your password to disk.</p>
<p>I'll check with the main dev and see if it's a known issue and/or if there are mitigations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It happens to me and every time you boot up and your system has auto logged in your start menu and alt+tab will be totally broken. To fix it all you do is hit ctrl+alt+delete and click sign out and then when you log back in it'll be working. I worked it out as this happens to me every time I boot my PC. Now I know it's caused by that tick box maybe I can fix it by untick that.</p></div>		</li>
