<p>For example, research by Arne Ohman at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, you can teach people to associate an electric shock with either photos of snakes and spiders or photos of flowers and mushrooms—but the effect lasts a lot longer with the snakes and spiders.</p>

<p>Seems like we aren't afraid of much from birth, but we're predisposed to develop a fear of spiders and snakes much more so than other animals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spiders and snakes are plentiful (they're everywhere) and can be poisonous and they do bite. Avoiding and fearing them is a learnt and evolutionary trait - avoid things that can kill you or make you sick. As a child, you're naive to the dangers, then you're enlightened and avoid danger. Same thing with cliffs - you don't need to experience the danger in order to know that you will die if you step off one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like really flawed research. You're going to be exposed to flowers and mushrooms a lot, which will desensitize you to these stimuli and diminish the conditioned fear response, whereas witnessing other people's negative reactions towards spiders/snakes will reinforce it. I think this is a more plausible explanation than genetic predisposition.</p>
<p>If we wanted to make sure these biases don't happen, we'd need to keep the subjects isolated from the tested stimuli (no mushrooms/flowers/snakes/spiders at all) for the duration of the research</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to consider that young children don't have the same sorts of survival instincts that someone with a more developed brain does though.  Someone through observation and obtaining additional information they can comprehend, may rationally develop a fear or distaste of certain kinds of animals or environments because they can comprehend what makes them potentially dangerous to their safety (and the fact they won't have qualms about attacking/biting compared to the nature of other animals).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like there is a lot of room for fallacies there. Flowers and mushrooms are static objects that you see every day, but a child would only see spiders weekly/monthly[if they see spiders at all] and snakes almost never. Of course the stimulus has a deeper impact with a much smaller, almost 100% painful encounter rate. Between the fact that only one group can actually approach YOU, and only one group can be habitually seen, I don't think this is a equal comparison.</p>
<p>The guy who got bitten by a pit bull when he was 6 is going to be infinitely more scared than the guy who had a stuffed-animal pit bull in his play room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>this shows that fear of this type of stimulus is learnt and not hereditary</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not at all convinced that the study is good evidence of that.  Babies often show no fear towards all kinds of things that they later develop a fear of in early childhood (heights, strangers, scary images, darkness, bugs, predatory animals, objects moving towards them too quickly, etc.).  I'm not convinced those fears are all learned, I think it's entirely possible that some of those fears are inherent, but babies just haven't yet developed the brain circuitry to process those stimuli fully yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read something awhile back about humans sharing a trait with other primates about being able to more easy distinguish <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164342" target="_blank">grass movement that resembles a snake</a> -- and that it's a reflex, not a learned trait. </p>
<p>I feel like the study linked in the parent comment is interesting, but not definitive. Especially because reflex and reactions aren't fully developed in babies. </p>

<p>snake fear is one of several innate, universal fears,
including fear of heights, water, spiders, and strangers.
Learning is not required for the emergence of these
fears: Rather, ‘most members of a species will show fear
to a set of biologically relevant stimuli from early
encounters . . . without any relevant associative learning
experiences’ (Poulton &amp; Menzies, 2002, pp. 127–128)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not all genetic traits are expressed at birth, or rather, the aspect that would exemplify/indicate the trait expression might not itself appear or develop until a later stage. Thus, an innate fear of something might not emerge until a certain age regardless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good first step. The next step is understanding the interplay of genetics, brain signaling, and everything in between. That requires a dynamical systems perspective where both genes and learning and state have very clean, very defined representations.</p>
<p>Learned and not hereditary don't have to be mutually exclusive. Learning takes time, and can be affected by hereditary factors over the course of years/decades. In which case, it's both.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What do you mean by babies? Certainly a famous experiment, the [Visual Cliff]( <a href="http://www.wadsworth.com/psychology_d/templates/student_resources/0155060678_rathus/ps/ps05.html" target="_blank">http://www.wadsworth.com/psychology_d/templates/student_resources/0155060678_rathus/ps/ps05.html</a>) by Gibson and Walk made with babies of 6 months and some earlier (crawling age) and they most definitely did not like heights. The experiment used plexiglass covering a dropoff of 4 feet or so. The babies preferred to avoid the drop.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And yet you could probably hold them over a large height and they wouldn't be bothered in the least.</p></div>		</li>
