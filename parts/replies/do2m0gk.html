			<div class="markdown"><p>This.  It's great to have actual garden-fesh veggies but the time to get them from the garden to your table can be a bit much.  We had fruit trees growing and producing at the house we bought, and while I love having peaches and cherries and apples, I can't say I'd commit to replacing them if they died or stopped producing.  If gardening is your thing and you have time for extra stuff like canning/pickling etc than go for it, but at that point it's almost more of a hobby than something practical.</p></div>		</li>
