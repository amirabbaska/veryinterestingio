			<p>Just to give people a better idea about what's involved...<br><br>crystal growth is interesting.  You want to grow an ordered and perfect large crystal of something- if you have a nice sheet of it to start with, it's usually not so tough.  That's one reason that Silicon was used, because it's relatively easy to grow a large single silicon crystal and slice it up to get an ordered plane of it.<br><br>But when you have a new material, you need to grow it on something else first.  Imagine trying to build a lego tower but your starting plate is from another toy company and the bumps are juuuuust a bit different from regular lego spacing.<br><br>You can try and get them to connect and order up, but there will be tremendous stress on those pieces.  It's the same with crystals... you are trying to grow a material with a 2.3 angstrom spacing on a plane of atams that has a 2.2 angstrom spacing.  Depending on the other properties of all these materials interacting, you MIGHT get it to work.  Or you might not.  And there are A LOT of substrates to try.<br><br>A lot of research is seeing what can be grown on what, and the quality and properties of the new films that emerge.</p>		</li>

			<p>What does growing a crystal actually mean? So you talk about the base being something but what is the process of making something on it? Is it a gas, some solid or what? </p>		</li>

			<p>There's a lot of information needed to answer your question!  I'll try and give you a high-level overview...<br><br>There are MANY ways of growing crystals.<br><br>With silicon, for example, they melt a bunch of really pure Si into a tub, and then dunk in one small crystal of Si.  Then they SLOWLY pull it out.  The molten Si slings to the surface, and if the temperature and speed and everything else is perfect, all that Si lines up with the existing crystal when it solidifies.<br><br><a href="https://www.mersen.com/uploads/pics/carbon-carbon-composite-cz-method-mersen_06.jpg" target="_blank">https://www.mersen.com/uploads/pics/carbon-carbon-composite-cz-method-mersen_06.jpg</a><br><br>Another  way to grow crystals is to do it in a wet (not always water) solution.  But that usually ends up incorporating impurities (the solution itself, for example) into the crystal.  And impurities change the spacing of the atoms around them.  So they can screw up the crystal (not to mention all the other properties).<br><br>So one really good way to grow thin films is to lay them down by reacting a gas on the surface.  For example, if you have SiH4 and you heat that up on top of a Si wafer, it will decompose and deposit Si on the surface- and if you do it at the right conditions, it will line up with the crystal and grow continuously.<br><br>BUT if you do the same reaction on an SiO2 (silcon oxide or silica, essentially sand) surface?  There's no reason for the new layer to grow in any specific way.  So you get all these little spots in different orientations that eventually meet up and you get polycrystalline silicon, which has different properties from single-crystal Si.  If you deposit Si on another single crystal, say GaAs, the spacing is not the same, so Si again has no reason to line up the same way across the surface.<br><br>Some times the spacing is close enough between the two materials that they do line up and grow the way you want, but there is stress in the film, which can cause other problems (poor optical properties, delamination, electrical issues, etc).<br><br>There are MANY ways of growing these films.  Plasma, heat, cold, chemical reactions, etc.  These days, most modern processes use vacuum chambers with one of those.  The old days (70s and into the early 90s) there were sill solution dips to grow films, but at this point, I only think that the copper wires on chips are laid down that way (they aren't single crystal, so no biggie), and not in all processes (it's probably Chemical vapor deposition now, or CVD.  When I was working at those places, we did some electro-plating and some electroless plating, but I don't think those were going to work for the really small architectures we have these days).<br><br>Does that help?<br><br>Edit:  Some images for fun!<br><br><a href="http://www.mechanicalengineeringblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/01chemicalvapordepositiontechniqueschemicalvapourdepositionCVDgrapheneproductiongraphenefabricat1.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.mechanicalengineeringblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/01chemicalvapordepositiontechniqueschemicalvapourdepositionCVDgrapheneproductiongraphenefabricat1.jpg</a><br><br>Polycrystalline Si after reaction:<br><br><a href="http://esl.ecsdl.org/content/7/5/G108/F4.large.jpg" target="_blank">http://esl.ecsdl.org/content/7/5/G108/F4.large.jpg</a></p>		</li>

			<p>We're talking about semiconductor substrates here. <br><br>Think about the CPU in your phone/computer. Under all the heat spreaders, it's a tiny silicon rectangle with teensy transistors etched on it. That silicon rectangle was cut during production from a flat, circular, <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Silicon_wafer.jpg" target="_blank"><strong>single silicon crystal</strong></a> (aka wafer). <br><br>Semiconductor lasers (and by extension, LEDs) function very similarly to electrical diodes, but they emit photons instead of passing electrons. It just so happens that silicon does not work that well for the light frequencies that we want, so we have to choose different semiconductor materials. <br><br>And the issue with that is that we had the manufacturing infrastructure in place for silicon, (and silicon is CHEAP!), but we didn't have anything in place for Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) or Gallium Nitride (GaN), which is what we need for blue and violet wavelengths, for blue LED's. So until the demand for blue LED's and lasers brought manufacturing costs down, we were stuck with a new semiconductor mix but hardly anybody to manufacture crystals of it â€” at first, it was literally just the researchers who developed that element mix, and they were custom producing tiny batches of it. </p>		</li>

			<p>Actually, unless things have changed in the 10+ years since I was growing crystals, most complex structures are built with Molecular Beam Epitaxy. It's essentially shooting molecules at a surface and making them stick in nice little lines. It was my area of research, and I still thought it was magic.<br><br>The problem with MBE is that it's slow and expensive. It's - relatively - simple to grow crystals with liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). You just fill up containers with the right melted material (InP, GaAs, Si, etc.) and move the substrate underneath the container for just the right amount of time and you can grow crystals pretty accurately. It's the &quot;pretty&quot; part of accurately that makes one move to MBE, which is much more precise.<br><br>Gallium Nitride (GaN) has been well known for quite some time. It is used, for example, in high power circuits. It's getting it to grow economically and in the right layers and with the right doping (impurities that make the LED layers work ... just trust me on that) that was tough.</p>		</li>

			<p>So from initial discovery to widespread public adoption - what are we talking about?  I don't think I recall seeing many blue LEDs in the 90s so I feel like it had to be not until maybe even late into the 2000s that I started to see blue LEDs more commonplace.</p>		</li>

			<p>I used to get a lot of electronics component catalogs in the early to mid 90's. When the blue LEDs first became available, they pretty expensive compared to the common amber/red/green ones ($50-ish compared to just a few cents (in bulk)).<br><br>I remember one of the first places I saw them in use was in Star Trek: The Next Generation when they would open Data's head. There were a few in there blinking away.</p>		</li>

			<p>I remember some companies would also fake blue leds by encasing ones that emit white light in blue plastic to give it the shading.  I have a few like this.  Then I got my true blue LEDs and the plastic on those is clear.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think you're mistaken.  WHITE LEDs came later still, and were also very expensive initially.  <br><br>A &quot;white&quot;  LED is actually a blue LED with a white phosphor on top.  &quot;White&quot; requires a mix of wavelengths and an LED die produces only one wavelength.  The phosphor absorbs the single blue wavelength and reradiates a wide  range of wavelengths that make &quot;white&quot;.<br><br>So there's no cost advantage to making a blue LED with a white phosphor and adding a blue filter.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's actually a yellow phosphor that absorbs the blue light and emits broad yellow radiation. This combined with the original blue light makes white light. The phosphor itself emits yellow light, not white.</p>		</li>

			<p><em>Maybe</em>... The phosphor certainly could absorb some sunlight and emit yellow light, but I would think that the plastic that encases the LEDs could also color over time from sunlight exposure.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Oznog99" target="_blank">Oznog99</a>
			<p>Yes and no.  A lot of the original blue line from the die does transmit through, and consequently there's a 455nm blue spike in the output spectrum.  <br><br>But the &quot;yellow&quot; phosphor is not just yellow.  It's a wide bell curve from ~500nm to ~700nm, green to red.  <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>White LEDs are just short-wavelength LEDs (blue or UV) with a phosphor to shift some of the blue light to longer wavelengths. There are plenty of blue LEDs with blue enclosures, but those aren't white LEDs inside.</p>		</li>

			<p>I've found that it takes many years before laboratory materials can be mass-produced.<br><br>I was in college in the mid-90s, and GaN processes were still being refined.   Maybe in the late 90s you get to the point where people who want them <em>can</em> actually order them- but the cost is still high.<br><br>As another example, carbon nanotubes were discovered around that time too.  They are only just making their way into electrical cabling (very light compared to copper) in military applications.  Another 10 years of development and cost recovery and we might see it in high-end cars, etc.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think you mean GaAs?  I don't remember any hype about GaN wafers- though I could be wrong.<br><br>Everyone always looks at the base electical properties of a new substance and gets excited.  GaAs has much faster electron mobility, so we can have faster chips!  Yay!<br><br>But nevermind the fact that it's mechanically much more fragile than Si, and breaking wafers as you move them around a factory is a huge problem.  Nevermind that right now, the entire industry is geared towards Si production, and moving to GaAs is like replacing all the gas pumps with electric charging stations.  Nevermind that the number one reason why Si is so easy to use is that you can grow a gate oxide so damn easily on it.<br><br>I have been working with semiconductors since 1994, and I have seen many awesome discoveries that all lead towards moving away from Si... but it's just not happening.  We know how to do Si so well, that the barrier to entry for another material (to replace Si wholesale) is just too high.</p>		</li>

			<p>I like that you know the reason we started with silicon in the first place is a nice native oxide (otherwise it probably would've been germanium).  But that's out as a reason since we moved to high k years ago.  Now it's all the other things you said: we're so damn good at silicon now, switching wholesale is just silly.  At most, we just starting putting a later of a III-V down on the silicon, but even that's a stretch.  </p>		</li>

			<p>In another comment I made the point that maybe cutting edge semiconductors would push for an alternative material, but most manufacturers are making microcontrollers and smaller chips for coffee makers, etc.  Native oxide is just fine for them, they have no reason to switch.  And so there's not a lot of pressure on tool makers to find something new.</p>		</li>

			<p>I did a co-op at AMD in 1996, in the group that evaluated new technology.  I brought up GaAs and they chuckled.<br><br>There's probably a billion man-years of R&amp;D on Si devices; Honestly, isn't silicon processing arguably the most advanced mature technology there is?  The idea that an entire industry could turn left like that is pretty hard to swallow.<br><br>And to get that coordinated?  The model right now is that the chip-makers buy each stage of technology from other vendors.  In the past 10 years there's been a bit more of &quot;solution&quot; sales rather than just individual machine sales, but no one vendor is going to be able to come up with a complete GaAS line of process equipment (and I used to work for the biggest tool maker).<br><br>Meanwhile, we would still have to have Si chugging away and growing and innovating while the parallel technologies came up- technologies that would be even more expensive.<br><br>I think what we MIGHT see is a way to incorporate small GaAs (or probably, another unknown as of yet) material into the Si process, on Si wafers.  Really, the advanced processes have changed enough that many of the major advantages for Si are not there any more- for example, gate oxide is no longer thermally grown Si- they lay down a new film of another material.<br><br>But also recall that this might make sense for Intel to change, the rest of the industry is making microcontrollers for your coffeemaker.  They have no reason to move to an exotic chip.</p>		</li>

			<p>Honestly, I think my gas/electric analogy is the best one.<br><br>There's so much infrastructure for Si that solving those problems for Si is going to enable more powerful devices in the same amount of time as trying to change the industry.  A cutting edge microprocessor requires 500-1000 processing steps to create it- every one of those steps is well known for Si.</p>		</li>

			<p>Also just to expand on OP's statement of green LED's; green LED's require a bandgap energy that is difficult to produce, and therefore it is actually a struggle to produce green LED's and green lasers with a high energy output. <br>However, green LED's and green lasers appear quite intense, and this is due simply to the fact that he human eye is more responsive to green light than any other color.</p>		</li>
