<p>crystal growth is interesting.  You want to grow an ordered and perfect large crystal of something- if you have a nice sheet of it to start with, it's usually not so tough.  That's one reason that Silicon was used, because it's relatively easy to grow a large single silicon crystal and slice it up to get an ordered plane of it.</p>
<p>But when you have a new material, you need to grow it on something else first.  Imagine trying to build a lego tower but your starting plate is from another toy company and the bumps are juuuuust a bit different from regular lego spacing.</p>
<p>You can try and get them to connect and order up, but there will be tremendous stress on those pieces.  It's the same with crystals... you are trying to grow a material with a 2.3 angstrom spacing on a plane of atams that has a 2.2 angstrom spacing.  Depending on the other properties of all these materials interacting, you MIGHT get it to work.  Or you might not.  And there are A LOT of substrates to try.</p>
<p>A lot of research is seeing what can be grown on what, and the quality and properties of the new films that emerge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of information needed to answer your question!  I'll try and give you a high-level overview...</p>
<p>There are MANY ways of growing crystals.</p>
<p>With silicon, for example, they melt a bunch of really pure Si into a tub, and then dunk in one small crystal of Si.  Then they SLOWLY pull it out.  The molten Si slings to the surface, and if the temperature and speed and everything else is perfect, all that Si lines up with the existing crystal when it solidifies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mersen.com/uploads/pics/carbon-carbon-composite-cz-method-mersen_06.jpg" target="_blank">https://www.mersen.com/uploads/pics/carbon-carbon-composite-cz-method-mersen_06.jpg</a></p>
<p>Another  way to grow crystals is to do it in a wet (not always water) solution.  But that usually ends up incorporating impurities (the solution itself, for example) into the crystal.  And impurities change the spacing of the atoms around them.  So they can screw up the crystal (not to mention all the other properties).</p>
<p>So one really good way to grow thin films is to lay them down by reacting a gas on the surface.  For example, if you have SiH4 and you heat that up on top of a Si wafer, it will decompose and deposit Si on the surface- and if you do it at the right conditions, it will line up with the crystal and grow continuously.</p>
<p>BUT if you do the same reaction on an SiO2 (silcon oxide or silica, essentially sand) surface?  There's no reason for the new layer to grow in any specific way.  So you get all these little spots in different orientations that eventually meet up and you get polycrystalline silicon, which has different properties from single-crystal Si.  If you deposit Si on another single crystal, say GaAs, the spacing is not the same, so Si again has no reason to line up the same way across the surface.</p>
<p>Some times the spacing is close enough between the two materials that they do line up and grow the way you want, but there is stress in the film, which can cause other problems (poor optical properties, delamination, electrical issues, etc).</p>
<p>There are MANY ways of growing these films.  Plasma, heat, cold, chemical reactions, etc.  These days, most modern processes use vacuum chambers with one of those.  The old days (70s and into the early 90s) there were sill solution dips to grow films, but at this point, I only think that the copper wires on chips are laid down that way (they aren't single crystal, so no biggie), and not in all processes (it's probably Chemical vapor deposition now, or CVD.  When I was working at those places, we did some electro-plating and some electroless plating, but I don't think those were going to work for the really small architectures we have these days).</p>
<p>Does that help?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're talking about semiconductor substrates here. </p>
<p>Think about the CPU in your phone/computer. Under all the heat spreaders, it's a tiny silicon rectangle with teensy transistors etched on it. That silicon rectangle was cut during production from a flat, circular, <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Silicon_wafer.jpg" target="_blank"><strong>single silicon crystal</strong></a> (aka wafer). </p>
<p>Semiconductor lasers (and by extension, LEDs) function very similarly to electrical diodes, but they emit photons instead of passing electrons. It just so happens that silicon does not work that well for the light frequencies that we want, so we have to choose different semiconductor materials. </p>
<p>And the issue with that is that we had the manufacturing infrastructure in place for silicon, (and silicon is CHEAP!), but we didn't have anything in place for Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) or Gallium Nitride (GaN), which is what we need for blue and violet wavelengths, for blue LED's. So until the demand for blue LED's and lasers brought manufacturing costs down, we were stuck with a new semiconductor mix but hardly anybody to manufacture crystals of it â€” at first, it was literally just the researchers who developed that element mix, and they were custom producing tiny batches of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So from initial discovery to widespread public adoption - what are we talking about?  I don't think I recall seeing many blue LEDs in the 90s so I feel like it had to be not until maybe even late into the 2000s that I started to see blue LEDs more commonplace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to get a lot of electronics component catalogs in the early to mid 90's. When the blue LEDs first became available, they pretty expensive compared to the common amber/red/green ones ($50-ish compared to just a few cents (in bulk)).</p>
<p>I remember one of the first places I saw them in use was in Star Trek: The Next Generation when they would open Data's head. There were a few in there blinking away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found that it takes many years before laboratory materials can be mass-produced.</p>
<p>I was in college in the mid-90s, and GaN processes were still being refined.   Maybe in the late 90s you get to the point where people who want them <em>can</em> actually order them- but the cost is still high.</p>
<p>As another example, carbon nanotubes were discovered around that time too.  They are only just making their way into electrical cabling (very light compared to copper) in military applications.  Another 10 years of development and cost recovery and we might see it in high-end cars, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also just to expand on OP's statement of green LED's; green LED's require a bandgap energy that is difficult to produce, and therefore it is actually a struggle to produce green LED's and green lasers with a high energy output.
However, green LED's and green lasers appear quite intense, and this is due simply to the fact that he human eye is more responsive to green light than any other color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was surprised to see little about this in the comments. Green LEDs have some of the lowest efficiency of all LEDs, it is termed the &quot;Green Gap&quot; and I believe it is something they are still actively trying to fix. </p>
