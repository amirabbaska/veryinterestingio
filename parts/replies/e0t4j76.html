			<div class="markdown"><p>In essence he holds that the mind is the brain and the brain is the mind. The brain is made of several types of neurons and long term information that makes you you is stored in the pattern of connections that the neurons make. If you cut all connections between a person's neurons you kill them. If you rearrange the connections you transform one person into another.^1 He has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA7GwKXfJB0" target="_blank">20min ted talk</a> if you are interested.</p>
<p>In relation to freezing brains (of frogs or humans) what is important is whether the connections of the neurons are destroyed or not. If they survive then the personality of that brain could be reconstructed even if the brain cannot restart naturally. He discusses brain freezing and the people who do it in chapter 14. Most of the book is about the standard neuroscience but in chapter 14 and 15 he discusses cryonics and mind uploading. He basically shows that both are currently science fiction. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome_\(book\)" target="_blank">This page gives a short summary of each chapter of Seung's book I linked</a>.</p>

<p>I find this really interesting.  A lot of people seem to assume that this would be the 'same' person.  This issue arises in relation to informational (rather than physical) teleportation.</p>
<p>To me it's obvious that a perfect reconstruction of your brain is not 'you', any more than (say) a perfect copy of a DVD is the original DVD.  So in the above scenario, 'you' die and a perfect clone of you continues with the impression that it previously existed as 'you', when in fact it did not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean...  I don't think anyone thinks we're successfully brain-uploading or freezing-and-defrosting people <em>now?</em>  So that's a much more trivial statement than &quot;it's almost certainly impossible.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
