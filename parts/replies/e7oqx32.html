<p>The paper: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-018-0044-7" target="_blank">Single-shot real-time femtosecond imaging of temporal focusing</a> </p>
<p>&quot;Existing ultrafast imaging techniques, however, are incapable of providing real-time, femtosecond, passive imaging capability. The current mainstream technique used in ultrafast imaging is based on pump–probe measurements. Although having achieved femtosecond temporal resolution and passive detection, these multiple-shot imaging techniques depend on precise repetition of the targeted ultrafast event during temporal or spatial scanning. Hence, in cases where temporal focusing must be recorded in a single measurement, these imaging techniques are inapplicable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;we have developed single-shot trillion-frame-per-second compressed ultrafast photography (T-CUP), which can image non-repeatable transient events&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just as wrong as the current top comment. They specifically say they don't use the multiple pulse technique to put together a video of the light moving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I can gather from reading: <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/optica/abstract.cfm?uri=optica-5-9-1113" target="_blank">https://www.osapublishing.org/optica/abstract.cfm?uri=optica-5-9-1113</a></p>
<p>It is indeed one pulse of light passing through multiple filters that are changed by the pulse depending on what they're measuring. Fig. 1 in the article shows 2 kinds of detection methods; active, and passive. I'm not sure what kind the researchers used, but both approximate the total image. To define it more clearly they used &quot;...another camera that acquires a static image. Combined with the image acquired by the femtosecond streak camera, we can use what is called a Radon transformation to obtain high-quality images while recording ten trillion frames per second.” <a href="http://www.inrs.ca/english/actualites/worlds-fastest-camera-freezes-time-10-trillion-frames-second" target="_blank">http://www.inrs.ca/english/actualites/worlds-fastest-camera-freezes-time-10-trillion-frames-second</a></p></div>		</li>
