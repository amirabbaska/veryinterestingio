			<p>The NEW GTLDs process was pretty bad in the start, but the IETF bonked their head pretty hard, it is much better now. For a long time the problem with ICANN was that they did very little, this is a good way to expand their activities. Most of the money paid to get domains is going to the hands of the big registries, it is a very good thing they are getting competition.  The process was criticized because it was under control only of the registries and registrars, without listening to the other stakeholders. Saying ICANN was doing it for their own profit is just untrue, they are  very open: <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/financials-2012-02-25-en" target="_blank">https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/financials-2012-02-25-en</a>. It was being done just for the profit of the registries and registrars.</p>		</li>

			<p>Newer Registries like for CO, XXX, ME etc made money during sunrise/premium names/blocking prior to launch. After launch it dies down quite abit profit wise. Not saying they don't make money, they do certainly, but the new gtld program in the end is more bank for ICANN than anyone else.<br><br>New gTLD program is neat, and I'm in favor of it. Will be interesting tho to see if the public actual buy these new names and use them, or if the people of the interwebs just continue to use google search to get what they want. <br></p>		</li>
