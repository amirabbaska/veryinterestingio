			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't heard of that. They did mention something injectable but given his size, 133lbs, it's no cheaper than the pills and as long as he takes the pills with no problems, then we would just stick to that. </p>
<p>We had him on VARL injections for about 18-20 months, front loading from the beginning and then maintaining at a rate of a home injection every 3 weeks. They seemed to help a touch at first and then didn't seem to have any effect on him. He didn't enjoy that, I didn't enjoy stabbing him with a needle every couple weeks, so we canned that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dog gets cytopoint injections it works amazingly well. Before she was on apoquel, hydroxyzine and medrol. She has never been happier on cytopoint and she only needs it every 4-5 weeks. I don't think it's very expensive but she is a small dog. It would definitely be less expensive than apoquel though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cytopoint for a dog that big will be well over $200 per injection. It isn't any cheaper than Apoquel unfortunately. It does work well in a lot of dogs that Apoquel doesnt. I was involved in the clinical studies for Cytopoint, and use it on a daily basis, so I can answer any questions! I do not find it to be as effective as Apoquel in the majority of patients. </p>
<p>You can try sublingual allergens. I prefer injectable but sublingual can help in some cases. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How was the bentonite used?  Most to all the health claims regarding bentonite are bunk and none are proven.  Because of its large specific surface area it is great at absorbing moisture and has a large cation exchange capacity.  But oral doses will moat likely only result in constipation if anything.  It is just really plastic clay.  Soil hummus (highly decomposed organics) has a better CEC and sucking up lots of water out of your digestive system probably isn't a good thing.</p>
<p>On the plus side it probably isn't harmful as long as it was tested for heavy metals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diluted with water and added to his food. It wasn't expected to be much of a benefit but we tried it anyways. </p>
<p>We did notice some positive changes on the Chaga (brewed as a tea and added to their food) for a couple weeks but then it seemed to settle into the norm. We might sporadically go back to that because it did seem to make an energy difference in my older berner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dog has atopic dermatitis. I use Temaril P. How is Apoquel ive been apprehensive about it because I think its a new drug. Is there any side effects to your little buddy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temaril P has a steroid in it;  I would not use that long term if it was my personal pet. Far too many long term side effects </p>
<p>Apoquel isn't a steroid. It can have immune-modulating effects so it isn't recommended to dogs undergoing cancer treatment or with immune-mediated disorders. I haven't seen much in the way of side effects from it. </p>
<p>Cytopoint is the safer option, side effect wise. But in my opinion, it doesn't work as well. </p>
<p>My work was involved with the clinical studies of both Apoquel and Cytopoint. We have been using Apoquel for many many years and have had no issues with side effects. There is a lot of scary stuff out there about Apoquel, but we have not experienced any of that. </p></div>		</li>
