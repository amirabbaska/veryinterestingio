			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit, but it's ELI5.  My main point was that you didn't have the kind of disputes of individuals and local governments over who belonged where that you did back east, because there weren't enough people living there with enough of a voice to bicker over it.  The full history of all the state lines is actually a lot more complicated than that, but it's a good, broad stroke to cover why Europe looks different from the eastern US which looks different from the western US.</p></div>		</li>
