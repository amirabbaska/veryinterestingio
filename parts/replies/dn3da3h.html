			<div class="markdown"><p>Speech Therapist here. This is pretty accurate, but it's more due to the inability of the inflamed vocal folds to vibrate in a smooth wave rather than inability to adduct (come together). Think about when you lose your voice when you are sick. You can still cough, but can't produce voice. Coughing is done by bringing the vocal folds together forcefully to build up pressure, which you then release. In fact, the coughing and frequent throat clearing are part of what cause your VF's to become/stay inflamed as it causes them to slap together harshly.</p>
<p>Here's a neat video of them in action. YouTube's algorithms are gonna think you're looking for vagoobers though.</p>
<p>Edit: for clarification.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That flap on the lower part of the video is what closes the path to your lungs when you're swallowing, right? What's that that string part bellow the flap connected to? It isn't dividing the esophagus into 2, is it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially that connects from the epiglottis (the flap) to the tongue base. The upper esophageal sphincter is actually opposite of that (it's at the top of the video and is closed at rest). When you swallow, the larynx moves up and sightly forward, the flap inverts and the opening to the esophagus is &quot;pulled&quot; open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume that this is why smokers cough causes low scratchy voices. Can you explain in any more detail? Does this cause permanent damage, or is it  a perpetual irritation?  Or am I way off base entirely? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The inflammation causes the vibrations to be slower and irregular (so lower and scratchy). It can go away if you remove the source of irritation, but you can also develop vocal fold polyps, nodules, and other lesions that change the way your voice sounds. Smoking definitely ups the risk of these.</p>

<p>Which fucking sucks, because the inflammation is what makes me feel the need to cough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not too sure but I think it's the increased air pressure in your torso which helps to push down the organs by the diaphragm. This then pushes your poop out. ye</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Fun fact: some people who've had laryngectomies have trouble pooping cause their vocal folds have been removed, so they can't push and/or strain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called the valsalva maneuver. It's what happens when the flaps close and pressure increases, like during lifting something heavy or sometimes a bowel movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to point it out, it's not your vocal cords that help you lifting/shitting, but a membrane on top of them called epiglottis. That's the one that doesn't let you choke when you swallow. Vocal cords are used for phonation only.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned that the vocal folds' most essential function is to protect the airway during swallowing (as does the epiglottis) and that they do in fact adduct to keep air in the lungs while straining.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit, I never realized that when I'm trying to squeeze a poop out my vocal chords(folds) close up to try and help build the pressure. Even though I've felt them doing this my entire life I never made the connection. Absolutely wild.</p></div>		</li>
