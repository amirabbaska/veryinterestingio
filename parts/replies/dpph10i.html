			<div class="markdown"><p>The recommendation for energy saving purposes is to set the thermostat at 78, which makes me think that’s the edge of comfortable for most people.</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer it far hotter than most people, which is frustrating sometimes. If my comfort were the only factor, I think 85 is about ideal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah if it's 80 degrees in the office people will strike/get no work done because they're complaining or discussing with each other that it's too damn hot.</p>
<p>75 gets people wondering. 68 gets the women grabbing sweaters and shawls. </p>
<p>69-72 is typical. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think it's safe to assume this is a function of comfort (so, a psychological optimum) more than a physiological optimum?</p>
<p>The body works pretty hard to maintain that 98.6F internal temperature, which implies a couple things:</p>
<ol>
<li>we maintain that same internal temperature across a wide range of external temperatures (i.e. until you hit extremes your body temp won't change much)</li>
<li>if the <em>body</em> temperature departs much from that optimum then various biological processes will degrade, including cognitive function</li>

<p>This is a interesting point. Individuals can overcome psychological barriers, which suggests that &quot;I'm cold&quot; is a state of mind. An old Outside magazine I read once had an article that stated &quot;cold&quot; is a state of &quot;fear&quot; and that, to a certain degree, we could overcome the impulse (like members of the polar bear club or that loveable Norwegian who skates around in Speedos and drinking Vodka).  This can even extend beyond the point when we are losing muscle and neurological control of extremities due to non-functional enzymes (which work within a small window of temperature).  Those who are adept and practiced at meditating can potentially assume this state.  But in the end your body needs a controlled temp in order for enzyme-mediated chemical reactions to continue occuring.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think &quot;I'm cold&quot; is a statement of fact --- but whether it's &quot;pleasantly cold&quot; or &quot;uncomfortably cold&quot; is a state of mind.</p>
<p>On a ski team I was on, we'd sometimes use the phrase &quot;pleasantly cold&quot; for spring skiing when it was in the 30(°F)'s and high-20's and sunny, while skiing shirtless.  Ski lifts were unpleasant, though, so we carried a sweater for those.  When I moved to a warmer climate, I'd hear people complaining about 65°F as being uncomfortably cold.</p>
<p>At least for some range of values, many things are state of mind.  For example food that's &quot;too spicy&quot; for some is &quot;bland&quot; for others.<br />
Or for a &quot;no-pain-no-gain&quot; weightlifter --- &quot;sore muscles&quot; that would make many lay in bed feel good to him.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That reminded me of Wim Hof. That guy really blows my mind. Some of the stuff he does really doesn't seem like it should be possible. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting element. I've been seeing an Indian girl, it's &quot;cold&quot; where I live in Canada land, but our takes on it is different. She's bundled up for the cold when we go to walk to the bus stop -- big jacket, toque, gloves -- and I don't even bother to zip-up my jacket. It's only -10C or so. Or we'll get inside and she'll comment on how cold my hands are: which is a surprise to me, I'm pretty comfortable.</p></div>		</li>
