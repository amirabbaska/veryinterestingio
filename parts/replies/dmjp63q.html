			<div class="markdown"><p>But I'm trying to understand excactly what property that states if it's a 0 or 1, when there is no power. Some transistors are only made up of a few hundred atoms or less, and have no moving parts. Is it simply the position of electrons that determines this? Or are so small transistors simply not used for memory?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Transistors are powered devices.  With no power, they don't do anything.  Also, transistors by themselves don't store anything, the circuits they are in do that, like a flip/flop latch.</p>
<p>Flash drives rely on a tiny bit of stored energy in a capacitor to maintain the state of each bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't this mean that a flash drive will eventually lose that charge if not plugged in for a period if time and lose the data stored on it? If so how long does take for this to happen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's happening in flash memory is basically static electricity, like when you rub a balloon against your hair.</p>
<p>Flash memory uses a type of transistor called a &quot;field effect transistor&quot; or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor" target="_blank">FET</a>. FETs have three contacts: source, drain, and gate. The source and drain on the ones carrying the current to be controlled (when the power is on). Now, FETs come in different types, but for one particular type, there is a sort of barrier between the source and drain so no current can flow. The barrier can be removed if an electrostatic field is induced through it... and that is what the gate does. When a charge is applied to the gate, it creates an electrostatic field which moves the charges around the barrier, making it conductive... then current can flow between source and drain.</p>
<p>For most uses of a FET (the majority of transistors in a computer are FETs now), the gate is directly connected to other devices, so the charge changes all the time, and so does the current between source and drain. In other words, the transistor turns on and off depending on the rest of the circuit. In flash memory, on the other hand, the gate isn't directly connected to anything. It's insulated from the rest of the circuit or is &quot;floating&quot; electrically. Any charge applied to the gate will remain for a long time, because there's really no way for the excess charge to flow away. So if a charge is somehow applied to the gate to turn the transistor on, the charge will still be there even after you have turned the device off. When you turn the device back on, the charge will still be there, and the FET will still conduct if the circuit sends current to it (that is, tries to read the state of the transistor).</p>
<p>How does the charge get there in the first place? In a flash memory transistor, there is a fourth contact: a control gate. It's next to the regular gate but it's separated by a thin insulator. A strong electric field is applied to the control gate which then injects a charge across the insulator and into the floating gate. The process can be reversed to remove the charge so that either &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot; can be written to the transistor.</p>
<p>That's a rather long description, but believe it or not I'm skipping over a lot and generalizing a lot. A more detailed description can be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>
<p>As an aside: if you've heard of EPROMs and EEPROMs, these work on the same general principle as Flash memory. They differ on several specific details, however, but concept of charge being stored on a gate is how they work at the basic level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, the electrons <em>are</em> moving...</p>
<p>either way, there are plenty of correct answers here, but worth noting is, that for example the data in your RAM (presumably what you mean by memory stick) does get erased upon losing current when turning off the PC or unplugging the RAM.</p></div>		</li>
