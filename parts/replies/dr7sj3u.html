<p>Any time you're working with audio, you have to think in the scale of wavelength. With low frequencies, wavelengths can be several feet long. This means the microphone, your ear, and the speaker in the headphone are spatially in almost the exact same location. This makes cancellation accurate and effective.</p>
<p>With high frequencies where the wavelengths can approach the centimeter scale, the ear, speaker, and microphone  can be nearly a wavelength apart, making it impossible to know exactly what the phase difference between the microphone and the ear is (because now the direction the sound is coming from matters) and therefore impossible to produce a cancelling tone.</p></div>		</li>
