			<div class="markdown"><p>I assumed as such, but Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazoku" target="_blank">Kazoku</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 1946 Constitution of Japan abolished the kazoku and ended the use of all titles of nobility or rank outside the immediate Imperial Family.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, by law it <em>seems</em> as though anyone not in the royal family is a &quot;commoner&quot;, but this can't be right, can it? If that were the case, news articles would say Princess Mako is being forced to quit the royal family for marrying, period. Adding the fact that the spouse is a commoner would be obvious.</p>
<p>Marrying foreign royals/nobility seems plausible, but it seems equally plausible that marriage to a foreigner is grounds for expulsion as well. I'm not really familiar with Japanese royalty, but it seems like it would have happened before in the past if it were a positive  or neutral thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article you linked does say that she is forced to quit for marrying period. Women in the Royal house of Japan leave their house and join the house of their husbands. When there was a titled aristocracy that means they jointed those noble houses losing their royal titles. Since the titles were eliminated in the 1940s they now become commoners. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the truth; since legally the Japanese royal family is the ONLY family to have ever ruled Japan the other aristocracy don't effect succession since the throne doesn't change hands.  And since only males can succeed, it doesn't matter that females leave the family.  If the family thought it might face a succession crisis it wasn't uncommon for the emperor to adopt multiple son's as a just in case measure.  </p>
<p>It also was quite common for the throne to change hands every 10-30 years even if the current emperor was retired, because it's almost always been a formal job with little power (excepting the early years and maybe the Meiji era).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prior to the reforms there were cadet branches (descended from the original male line) of the Imperial Family who were eligible for marriage as &quot;nobles&quot;. They'd serve as ultimate backups if the direct Imperial Line failed as they still could claim descent from Ameratsu and Emperor Jimmu. They weren't &quot;the&quot; Imperial Family but they were still of royal descent and not commoners for the purposes of marriage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is exactly right and is why this isn't big news within Japan. The only &quot;royal&quot; family left after WWII is the current male line from the emperor, so all women will become commoners when they marry. This was done by the Western powers to basically ensure the nobility would die off within a few generations as a check on leaving the emperor enthroned.</p>
<p>The only reason people care at all is because before her cousin the crown prince was born there were no male heirs to the throne, so there was discussion of changing laws to allow her to become empress, though that never got any real traction amongst the fairly conservative Japanese parliament.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm I googled this and saw tons of western news stories headlined &quot;princess mako to lose royal status,&quot; and &quot;princess mako gives up royal status,&quot; as if it was some abnormal occurrence, but it's not abnormal in Japan so it's a little weird that that is the headline in these articles unless they are intentionally attempting to rile up feelings of &quot;that's not fair!&quot; From western audiences who will assume without researching that this is some sort of sexist ousting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be because the titles are rarely lost in the West, and when a royal marries a commoner they are normally brought up in status. So the concept is somewhat foreign to us as the few royals left in the West would not lose their status in this manner. </p></div>		</li>
