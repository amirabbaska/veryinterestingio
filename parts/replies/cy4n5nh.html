<p>It was naturally occuring in the Kola nut, and the cocoa leaf that were used to flavor the original products.

<p>They used the leaf from the plant that is used to make Cocaine, not the plant used to make chocolate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know I've told all those people at BK and Wendy's that Barq's has caffeine yet it's still in the &quot;caffeine free&quot; section of the select a flavor soda dispenser. I contend that this may end up hurting someone that can't have caffeine for some heart issue and a lawsuit will develop. Not that I would sue over it but someone will. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Barq's that is dispensed from Coca-Cola Freestyle machines is caffeine-free. This is because the system uses the same concentrated, microdosed ingredient for both Barq's and Diet Barq's; the only difference between the two is the sweetener that is added.</p>

<p>Also, anyone who is that sensitive to caffeine should know those variants aren't safe for them.</p></div>		</li>
