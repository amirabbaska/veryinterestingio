			<div class="markdown"><p>Recently I watched or read an interview with a top tier cyclist who was talking about training and how long breaks between sets was beneficial.  He was also talking about the benefits for athletes to drop the weights instead of letting them down slowly (eccentric). Apparently when you only load the muscle during contraction, and then let it go free during the return phase, you get most of the strength benefit without the increased mass.  </p>
<p>The less weight on your body is more beneficial that peak strength in many forms of competition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on the load you are dealing with. If it feels heavy and you have been pressing near your max, at least 5 minutes is understandable. </p>
<p>Maybe the idea is that after 13 minutes 100% of the ATP is back. </p>
<p>After 5 minutes, only 95% of the ATP has been restored. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are on the right track.  (and it's not ATP, is PCr.  ATP regenerates almost instantly).  It takes about 5 minutes for PCr to recover to near-baseline levels following high-intensity exercise.  ATP returns to near baseline within about a minute (Of course, training can influence all that as well).  </p>
<p>I would hazard a guess that the 13 minute figure was for 99% percent restoration of PCr, since recovery rate nearly flat-lines after that 5 minute period.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in the process of doing some strength and conditioning certifications, and I was shocked at the amount of rest recommended. But yes, it seems that in order to maximize results, extended rests between work cycles is optimal. I don't know many people willing to stand around for 8 minutes between sprints, or 13 minutes between deadlifts, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're finally teaching proper recovery for those things?  It's about time!</p>
<p>I generally recommend 5 minutes recovery as it allows for 95% recovery of PCr compared to baseline, which seems to strike a pretty good balance between standing around being bored and full recovery.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what about circuits/doing different body parts back to back? Does the available ATP count for the whole body or can it be available in different parts at different times? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So that comment was a copy/paste from a book I'm reading, and the following is my understanding/assumptions, so take it with a grain of salt. (Am CPT &amp; have been lifting 10 years though)</p>
<p>Doing different body parts will leave more energy to do work with other parts of your body, but not as much as if you hadn't done any work at all. If you want a more technical explanation, I can link you several exercise physiology textbooks or answer further questions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent question!</p>
<p>It depends on the type of work you're doing.  Generally speaking, if you are doing short-duration, near-maximal loading, there isn't a lot of systemic involvement in terms of recovery.  If you are doing that type of work, then the substrates necessary for the cells to do their thing are generally stored intracellularly or in the extracellular matrix (AKA right next to the cell.  An example would be intramuscular glycogen).  For that type of work, as long as you are using muscles that generally ignore each other (IE push ups and squats, something like that), the muscles will recover <em>almost</em> as well as if you were at complete rest.  However, if you are doing an exercise for more than 30, maybe 40 seconds, you probably are not in the 'near-maximal' range for that all to work.</p>
<p>If the individual exercises are taking more than 30 or 40 seconds, they are going to become increasingly reliant on more systemic energy pathways - the substrates necessary for the cells to do their thing are coming from far away.  That's going to slow down the ability to recover, so the circuit training is going to sacrifice some strength/hypertrophy building in exchange for training those metabolic pathways to be a little more efficient.  </p>
<p>As an aside ATP basically only exists in your cells.  It is the molecule from which your body gets energy.  Your body doesn't shift ATP around, it shifts around substrates to make ATP out of other molecules.  </p></div>		</li>
