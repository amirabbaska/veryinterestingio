			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it's not just depressants, cocaine and amphetamines delay ejaculation even more than alcohol, lots of porn stars use them for this. And opiates too for that matter. Any drug that tends to give people a sense of well being seems to also delay ejaculation. </p></div>		</li>
