<p>In 1999, the Glass-Steagall act, which prohibited the mixing of commercial banking with investment banking and other nonbank activities, was repealed. Fewer commercial banks than expected moved into mixed banking when Glass-Steagall was repealed.</p>

<p>Barely any banks did mixing. There was no reason to. Mortgages falls under standard banking practices.</p>
<p>Investment bank side was already incentivized to make riskier bets. They could have easily done insider trading with or without GS.</p>
<p>If AIG underwrites a shit loan and gets a Triple A+ stamp for risk from the Raters and resells that repackage of a shit loan to a bank with fancy financial instruments who uses it as their basis of having money (standard practice) who do you think comes out smelling like shit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The institutions that didn't fail (Citi, etc.) were the ones that were bailed out. Lehman, AIG, BS failed because no one came in to rescue them. </p>
<p>The reason that the banks didn't fail was precisely because they were determined to be &quot;too big to fail&quot;. The repeal of Glass-Stegall was the symbolic end of rules that prevented banks from becoming too big to fail. </p>
<p>To be brief - A corrupt cabal of financial institutions (including banks) and abject lack proper regulation of ratings agencies caused the 2008 recession because they got greedy. The world economy also played a large role.</p>
<p>I mean - securitized assets of shitty mortgages should never have gotten AAA ratings. I've never seen any investigation into that yet, which is... rather curious to say the least.</p></div>		</li>
