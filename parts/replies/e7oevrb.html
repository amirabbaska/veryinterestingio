			<div class="markdown"><p>Epoxy is simply a liquid that cures into a hard plastic. It doesnâ€™t stick to smooth surfaces unless they are porous enough that some absorption can happen. A dollop of dried epoxy can be scraped off of a piece of smooth metal with a putty knife, the same dollop chipped off a concrete floor will remove a chunk of the concrete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Epoxy is actually noteworthy because it DOES directly chemically bond with the surface it's applied to, unlike more basic glues such as wood glue.  That's why they're used in all kinds of permanent metal bonding applications, from structural adhesives to soda can linings.  You're right that you'll get an even better result if you have a rough surface to add mechanical bonding and some specialist additives to enhance chemical bonding, but if your epoxy comes off of metal with a putty knife you're using the wrong epoxy or the wrong metal.  JB Weld is an epoxy and nobody would say that doesn't stick to metal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other response, epoxy needs a corresponding bonding site on the substrate, like a lock in a key. Metals don't have a lock that fits typical epoxy (unless it's designed for metal). Epoxy has the potential for lots of covelent bonds, but if the potential isn't realized it just forms those bonds with itself, or leaves them dangling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The weaker bonds are normally from van der Waals interactions between the substrate and the adhesive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't forget about H bonding. While Van der Waal forces are certainly a factor, with most things we traditionally think of as tacky (such as sugar or syrup) it is actually dominated by H bonding</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, H bonding is classified as van der Waals, it's just got a special name to it because it's so much stronger than the other types.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any idea what the stickiness that allows several species of frogs and geckos to climb vertical surfaces be classified as? I know it's caused by the properties of their toe pads, but would it even qualify as any of the kinds of adhesion you mentioned? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the van der Waals forces to the max. Geckos have hairs with hairs with hairs, it's like compound leaves, except <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Micro_and_nano_view_of_gecko%27s_toe.jpg" target="_blank">four or five levels down</a>. But, instead of a tangled polymer bulk, all the hairs are physically attached to the gecko, which lets them crank up the adhesive forces. Without any crosslinking, polymers will start to detach from the bulk when the adhesive forces surpass the cohesive forces. Gecko feet don't have to worry about cohesive forces because it's literally attached to them.</p>
<p>Also, the little hairs give an insane amount of surface area, similar to the Tg idea. The hairs can wrap and tangle in the crevices of the substrate which gives an astounding amount of surface-to-surface contact.</p></div>		</li>
