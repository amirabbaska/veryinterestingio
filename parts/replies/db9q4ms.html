			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a small correction to this, the octane rating is based on how the fuel acts compared to a fuel that was composed of n-heptane and iso-octane. So if you octane rating is 80, the fuel would act the same way (in regards to knocking) as a fuel mixture of 20% n-heptane and 80% iso-octane. It does not necessarily mean the gasoline actually contains 80% iso-octane. This is how you can have octane numbers of 130 for example, this fuel is more resistant to knocking than pure iso-octane is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>regular will have less of the longer-chained hydrocarbons in the mix than super</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally speaking the longer straight chains are bad for &quot;octane&quot;.  Shorter chains are problematic because of their volatility, which is probably why C8 hits the sweet spot (as far as straight-chains go).</p>
<p>Anyway, refineries try to make very branched alkanes, some alkenes, but especially aromatics (not benzene) as octane boosters since they are a lot more valuable.</p>
<p>OP: Gasoline contains varying amounts of hundreds of different compounds, and most certainly will vary based on your oil source.  Gasoline is basically just a group of molecules with similar boiling points separated out of crude through distillation.  It roughly standardizes by molecular weight,   Of course refineries also will try to make more specific types of molecules for octane, or increase the number of molecules in this range by splitting longer ones.</p>
<p>While there is a great amount of variance at the chemical level, all of the macro properties of this mixture (like octane) are standardized so that you won't be able to tell the difference at the pump.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK, diesel (and its relatives jet fuel, RP-1, and the other kerosenes) is obtained through fractional distillation of crude. Gasoline, on the other hand, requires catalytic cracking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't require cracking, but a lot of cracking product is directed towards gasoline (if it's more profitable).</p>
<p>Crude naturally contains a lot of C4-C12 that doesn't need modification.  But again, depending on prices, distillation ranges can be modified and sent into other products, as they overlap:

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always called gasoline a &quot;witches brew&quot;. It is sort of like &quot;what do we have in the crude&quot; and how can we mix it, crack it, reform it to make a product that performs to a specification for the market we are going to send it to. It is even varied from month to month and low to high altitude to fit the end use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one could say whether any specific fuel reseller is any good or not just based on brand. Often gas stations are independently owned franchises, so one owner might be very conscientious, another not so much. If your vehicles run well on that gas, why not continue using it? </p>
<p>I used to hear about &quot;bad gas&quot; quite often in the 1970's and 1980's - rusted storage tanks, dirty tanks, water in the fuel, things like that. Cars in general were quite a bit less reliable in that era, and suffered poor or rough running more often, which would often be blamed on &quot;bad gas&quot;, but I'm not sure it wasn't just bad engineering and manufacturing.</p>
<p>I haven't heard much in recent decades though - there were changes required to tanks and pumps in recent decades for environmental reasons - double walled tanks to prevent ground leakage, vapor recovery pumps required replacing hoses and pumps, etc. Just replacing all that equipment might have the effect of improving the fuel by eliminating old and dirty components.</p>
<p>I've also heard you don't want to buy gas when the fuel tanker is refilling the station's tanks - the process agitates the fuel in the underground tanks and causes sediments and impure fractions to be stirred and mixed into the fuel going to the pumps. This is just anecdote I've heard word-of-mouth - anyone out there know of a proper study proving or disproving?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as sediments go. There is a filter on the pump. Which is also a reason why some pumps pump pretty damn slow, while others run along at a pretty brisk pace. The slow ones haven't been replaced in a long time, and need to be replaced.</p>
<p>There is also a filter in your car. You really shouldn't worry about that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no longer any bad gasoline sold in America, but there is better gasoline. There is a standard if gasoline called Top Tier that was developed by various car companies, that tends to run better in the long term. Well, more accurately, it is a standard of additives. It is cleaner and produces less carbon deposits in the engine. Certain brands meet this standard, while certain brands do not. For your average economy car, there is so little difference that it is not even worth the slight inconvenience of making sure you only use gas that meets these standards, but for some obscure or older engines, it may be worth going out of your way to use. I know that wankel engines are a tad pickier about gasoline, for instance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew a guy who delivered gasoline to gas stations (Chevron, I believe). He said various brands' trucks would line up at the refinery to be filled from the same pipes. After being filled up, the various brands would dump a &quot;bucket&quot; of their brand's additives into the tank to mix as the driver made delivery rounds.</p>
<p>While there may be a question of whether eg Chevron's &quot;Techron&quot; additive is better than Texaco's, the gasoline itself is the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, they try to limit their outlets to those with very high sales volumes of gas, saving on transportation, and they base a lot of their profits on sucking you into their convenience store to sell you pop, cigarettes, and hot dogs. They've been doing that since the 1990s. The gas is the same, pretty much, especially the unleaded regular. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they are cheaper because they use the minimum amt of cleaning additives mandated. It is pretty easy to differentiated between cars that fill up with arco and chevron by a mechanic by taking a look at the fuel injectors.</p></div>		</li>
