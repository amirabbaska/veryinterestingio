			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems accurate for something with objective measurable units, but isn't speciation a bit more complicated than square footage? I have a passing recollection of Anthropology class and it seems like the lumper-splitter debate, extrapolated across all organisms and all history could come up with vastly different numbers for the &quot;size of the room&quot;. Like exponentially different numbers it seems, not to mention the different ways of categorizing the organisms we've discovered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well weâ€™re talking about carbon and oxygen consumption, surface area of the earth itself and quite a few other variables that are quantitative to determine a reasonable probability for x number of organisms. But I agree with you, I think that our numbers may be off, or that we have a bit more to learn. </p></div>		</li>
