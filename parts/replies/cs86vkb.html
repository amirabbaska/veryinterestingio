			<div class="markdown"><p>Superb point, but there is another notable exception to this age advantage. Namely, it mostly only applies to anglophone universities. </p>
<p>Take German and Italian universities for example, Heidelberg and Bologna. They teach in a language that isn't English, often publish in journals perceived as 'lower' impact and much of the research goes untranslated. It's actually a pretty big issue. These two examples are two of the World's oldest universities (bologna is literally the oldest) yet their reputations suffer simply due to the hegemony enjoyed by English speaking universities. </p>
<p>Additionally, it is worth noting that as far as I remember shanghai compensates for the 'age bias' by only including Nobel laureates since 1919. It did lead to a funny argument over Einstein's work at Berlin as the institute has subsequently split. They both argued to count the Nobel prize as their own and if I remember correctly it was calculated that by not having the prize on their record the ranking would suffer considerably due to the insane shanghai weighting system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. In the French system, the best scientists don't work in universities but in organisations like CNRS. And the best schools are very small in size.</p>
<p>So you end up with a shitty ranking for presigious schools and top ranked French universities that sucks.</p>
<p>ENS is world n°1 in Nobel price per student but they are tiny so they are not well ranked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The French system is especially unfriendly to rankings. Most of the best students that want to stay somewhat general end up doing 2 years in a &quot;classe préparatoire&quot; (which are part of high schools so all teachers here, and they are excellent in the best school, don't count towards any ranking) , then usually 3 or 4 years in a &quot;grande école&quot; (or ENS) and then if you which to continue after your master it's usually back to the universities.</p>
<p>Each school is already kind of small and doesn't even do the whole curriculum. So if your ranking has anything to do with the school size France system simply mean there is no hope to compete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you missed a point or two. First, CNRS scientists are attached to a lab which are often attached to a university. Consequently, the reputations of the universities also take into account those scientists. Moreover, ENS students are encouraged to do their thesis elsewhere than in the ENS. So, once again, universities' reputation also take into account those Nobel prizes/Field's medals. If the schools may not have the full credit they deserve, universities reputation usually take into account most of what French researchers produce. </p>
<p>IMO, the reason French institutions, and probably most the other institutions in the world, are falling behind the american ones is because the american ones were maybe the first - and still are - to invest so much resources to recruit the best scientists (or equivalently athletes) they can all over the world.</p>
<p>Since this shift of mind was processed more lately elsewhere, a more relevant statistic for prestigious universities is the top 100 universities of under 50 years old, in which France is doing pretty alright.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not true. Actually, people working in CNRS or french  universities are often the same people, working in UMR (90% of the CNRs staff). The main difference is that the  researchers from universities are only half time researchers, whereas researchers from CNRS are full time.</p>
<p>And this is a problem  with the Shangaï ranking, because for an unknown reason, <strong>the number of publications is divided by 2 if an article is cosigned by the university and CNRS</strong>.
Not really fair...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm studying in Heidelberg. No one here would ever consider publishing something in German, at least not in the natural sciences. In my department, probably around 50% of us aren't even from Germany, and quite often people will talk to each other in English even if there are only Germans present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you young upstarts in the <em>Feld</em>... we over at the Altstadt campus do things a bit differently. For many fields oft ancient history, e.g., German, French and Italian are more important international languages of scholarship, though that's changing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But academics have always had to publish in other languages- for years all papers were written in Latin and I'm sure for a while it was French. They should be publishing in the lingua franca. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not wrong, but it does place some people at a massive disadvantage relative to others. I'm a grad student at a high-ranking Japanese university. A Japanese student has to devote thousands of hours to developing her English skills to the level of academic discourse, in addition to reading all of the relevant research (in English) in her own field. Meanwhile, native English speakers can read all the research more quickly, accurately and easily, and don't have to spend nearly as much effort developing academic discourse skills, so they can devote more of their time to other things. They can read outside their field, or publish more often, or just go for a walk and clear their head more often.</p>
<p>Native speakers can also avoid fatal slipups when emailing faculty. I know of one Japanese student who emailed his professor: &quot;I want you to write me a letter of recommendation.&quot; He intended to be polite, but the rules for what constitutes politeness are different across cultures and languages. A native speaker would have the good sense to preface his email with &quot;sorry to trouble you&quot; and &quot;I wonder if it wouldn't be too much to ask&quot; and other sorts of politeness padding. The native speaker makes a good impression, gets invited to talks or asked to join research meetings, while the Japanese guy gets saddled with a reputation for being 'cold', 'distant' or 'demanding'.</p>
<p>It adds up to a massive advantage for native English speakers. Harvard students would not keep their advantage for long if top journals started demanding that all papers be submitted in Japanese. I'm not saying there's necessarily a good solution to this problem, but I wish more native English speakers would at least acknowledge the huge structural advantages they enjoy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As for research, it's not even fair. Harvard hires only superstars, then discards 4 out of 5 of them. People who would be the top of their department at another school are routinely denied tenure at Harvard. On top of this, they poach the best faculty from around the world. You're department spends years building someone up and supporting them, then poof... along comes Harvard knocking. </p>
<p>Then, once the profs are there, the monetary support they get is insane. Many PIs have multiple assistants in addition to people hired to write and optimize grants. The money that comes into these labs is incredible. Most of it is wasted as rich labs tend to spend their way out of problems, but what this allows the labs to do is to always be first to the punch. You're competing with George Church or Whitesides on <em>anything</em>? May as well give up. They'll put a small army of the world's brightest on the project with a pile of money and overnight delivery of anything they want.  </p>
<p>Seriously, it's just incomparable. The Asian schools are trying to catch up by poaching big names with HUGE contracts (normally, it takes giving them their own institute, ala Sunney Xie) but I still don't think that they will ever catch up. The creative culture in those institutes is dead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from Korea and as far as I'm concerned related to anything education related, it's all about going in somewhere. All the students try to go to the best universities in the World with a piece of paper in your hands that indicate that they had a high score in a entrance test. There were many cases of news where freshman students commited suicide in Seoul National University because they just couldn't catch up. In here, they is this unbelivable high standards that you doubt if anyone can even apply for universities only located in the city because out of Seoul, it is known that the standards are complete garbage. Ivy League is diversely located near Boston and Georgetown but such a small country like Korea, most of the universities are in the city hence the following extraterrestrial standard. Nobody in the Department of Education dares to fix it because millions of applicants are applying in universities like a small crack in a dam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also problem in Asia where application is more important than research because research is a luxury many people cannot afford. </p>
<p>Let's take India and Physiology and Medicine. Lots of doctors, little research. Why? They need roughly a 100 times the number of doctors before they can say that they can do research like the USA. </p>
<p>They barely  have enough cash to pay the doctors they have right now. </p>
<p>Then there is the bias. Indian writers don't get published as much because India doesn't produce as many papers which is just a circular problem. </p></div>		</li>
