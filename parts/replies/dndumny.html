			<div class="markdown"><p>I was taught to do this in high school art class, like many people, probably, and still remember the lesson. I've found that it applies to both pretty much every kind of creative process as well as learning and understanding in general. Not the upside down part—but that you have to disregard your brain's ubiquitous shortcut representations so that you can see what you're really looking at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is weird, but this exact experience is something i have one in a while. my house is cluttered, not especially dirty– but i'm so used to seeing it that i genuinely don't even see it. i go to invite a friend over and suddenly i realize, i need to look around my house because i can't see it properly from just inside my head– typically it's a yup, gotta clean up holy shite.</p></div>		</li>
