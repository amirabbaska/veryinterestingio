			<div class="markdown"><p>Then to solve the problem, just pop your ears yourself. Like FujiKitakyusho said, your eardrum is pushed outward by higher pressure in your ear than outside it.</p>
<p>To answer the second part of your question, no, you aren't causing more wear on your ear. The pressure isn't blocking the sound however, your eardrum just isn't hitting the malleus (the bone right behind your eardrum) as hard as it would when the pressure is relatively equal in and outside your ear.</p></div>		</li>
