			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly, though it seems unlikely the animal was a pure scavenger. It would certainly be comfortable eating scavenged remains, and would not face much competition once it arrived at a corpse, but tyrannosaurs as pure scavengers doesn't make much sense.</p>
<p>There is fossil evidence of tyrannosaurs suffering and recovering from wounds inflicted by large herbivores. Scavengers don't suffer from such wounds- only predators. </p>
<p>Its immense jaw size and strength is unnecessarily specialised for a scavenger. A scavenger doesn't need such an arsenal.</p>
<p>An adult couldn't run, but they could certainly walk fast enough to keep up with or surprise large prey (elephants can manage a 30 km/hr walk easily- and silently, too). Tyrannosaurs also have larger legs for their body size than other theropods.</p>
<p>The growth rates of tyrannosaurs, and the skeletal structure of adolescents, is unusual for a scavenger. Adolescents had fairly long legs, smaller jaws, and could run well. There are theories proposing that tyrannosaurs did engage in pack tactics- using younger members as runners to herd and harass prey, and adults as ambush predators actually performing the kill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dinosaur bones have rings in them like trees, and by comparing juvenile bone cross sections to those of adults, it was determined that tyrannosaurs have roughly the same life timeline as humans, spending their teens as long legged, speedy 1-2 ton hunters. They then reach a growth spurt in their late teens and hit there adult (ish) eirhgt around 19/20 years old and live to about 30</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jack Horner is not particularly well respected in the paleontological community. T. rex was almost certainly a predator and a scavenger. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment will get removed anyway, but there is precedence for the scavenger theory based on how the Komodo dragon hunts. They sit around in packs and happen across prey, which they then bite and wait for the venom to kill the prey, before walking over and feasting. My guess is that a large predatory reptile like the T-Rex would also do the same, conserving energy for a decisive chomp on the tail or hind legs of a large sauropod, then tracking the lumbering giant slowly before finally eating it.</p></div>		</li>
