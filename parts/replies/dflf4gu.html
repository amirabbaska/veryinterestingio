			<div class="markdown"><p>In the UK, you can lobby all you want. You can give politicians as much as you want. The crucial difference is that there are controls on how much politicians can spend in an election campaign, as well as limits on what form of advertising is allowed. Political advertising on the TV and radio is unheard of -- campaigning in the UK is done through local leafleting, knocking on doors and billboard advertising. TV stations are required to be politically neutral, so all major parties get equal TV coverage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hillary Rodham Clinton is aiming to raise at least $1 billion for her presidential campaign. Mr. Obama and his opponent in 2012, Mitt Romney, combined to spend nearly $2 billion. Mr. Obama’s campaign spent $25,000 on flower arrangements months before the general election even got underway; in 2008, his campaign shelled out at least $140,000 to companies that make American flags.</p>
<p>In Britain, by contrast, each party is limited to spending $29.5 million in the year before the election. The last time around, in 2010, the Conservatives actually spent about $25 million, and Labour less than half that. American presidential candidates spent about as much money on raising money in 2012 — around $37 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics — as the two main British parties spent on their entire campaigns in 2010.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Complex rules also govern spending by the parties’ local candidates for the five months before the election. There is a ceiling of about $60,000, plus an amount calculated according to the number of voters in each region and whether they live in a rural or urban area.</p>

<p>What?</p>
<p>&quot;You are now watching a party political broadcast from the conservative party.&quot;</p>
<p>Have you never seen that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's what the comment meant by all TV networks being neutral, so the parties are all allocated slots in (presumably) equal numbers, and no party is allowed to advertise outside those party political broadcasts? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this needs to be more well-known. From a British perspective, the US election system seems laughable. I'm not saying our own system is 100% fair, but it's a million times better for sure. Campaigns here are much more like a distribution of information; everyone has access to leaflets, broadcasts and TV debates to help them decide who to vote for based on policy. Also importantly, 'ad hominem campaigning' for want of a better term  is much more frowned upon. There was a bit of a media storm here because David Cameron dared to criticize Jeremy Corbyn for not wearing a tie. And that wasn't even during a campaign!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently read up on lobbying.  Wiki has a nice breakdown of the differences per country:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying#Lobbying_by_country" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying#Lobbying_by_country</a></p>
<p>Some quotes from that page that I found interesting:</p>
<p>&quot;In a report carried by the BBC, an OED lexicographer has shown that &quot;lobbying&quot; finds its roots in the gathering of Members of Parliament and peers in the hallways (&quot;lobbies&quot;) of the UK Houses of Parliament before and after parliamentary debates where members of the public can meet their representatives&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;(Lobbying) is a controversial phenomenon, often seen in a negative light by journalists and the American public, and frequently misunderstood&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;there is currently no regulation at all for lobbying activities in France and, as a consequence, this practice suffers from a lack of transparency.&quot;</p>
<p>It seems complicated but from my limited understanding, unless our politicians can know everything about everything, it's necessary.</p>
<p>(edit: one more part I found intriguing: &quot;Some lobbyists are now using social media to reduce the cost of traditional campaigns, and to more precisely target public officials with political messages&quot;... Lobbyists, the digital version.)</p>
<p>Hypothetically, could they make bots repeat/argue their messages so they don't have to?  Could this be a problem in the future?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are no regulations in France specific to lobbying, but campaign finances are heavily regulated and closely watched. Sarkozy was fined around $500,000 and his party lost millions in public funding because of his 2012 campaign.</p>

<p>The TL;DR is that you cannot get more than a fixed amount from anyone, you cannot spend money for political ads if you are not a political party, and political parties cannot spend more than a fixed amount for their campaign.</p>
<p>This also as the side effect of limiting the campaigns in time as money can be quickly exhausted.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yah, if the future is like early 2000s. But we don't need to worry about bots until at least the 1980s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the thoughtful reply. But I have to critique the Wikipedia entry. Under 'Lobbying by country,' it identifies Australia, the EU, the UK, the US, and a smattering of other states. That still leaves out most of the world. Latin America, for instance, has developed very rigorous democratic practices in the past couple decades. There are ebbs and flows, and exceptions (it's a large region after all), but certainly there is a positive trend in that regard.
EDIT: I'm also not sure I like how reading a few Wikipedia entries is considered 'reading up' on anything. It could serve as a primer, but it hardly allows one to start making assertions about global policy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just straight up wrong. In many other countries lobbying is just lobbying. The major difference is that weird ass election system in the USA and the fact that there is so much money involved in the campaigns. It's not about who is the best candidat for being the president. It's all about who can get the most money and looks the best on camera and manipulates the best. And for manipulation you need a lot of money. For that many cooperations are more than happy to put out loads of cash to a specific candidate who then in return will give them what they want. And exactly that is why many other countries see lobbying in the US as corruption because it latently is. One of the reasons why the economy should not be involved in politics but I guess in the US people think it is a necessity... well maybe after Trump that view will change.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Trump is one of the first presidents to get elected despite the fact he didn't spend the most money on campaigning, so if anything the opposite of your point you're trying to make is true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sry but that wasn't at all the point I was trying to make and doesn't denounce my reasoning at all. Just because he might have spend less than Hillary doesn't change the fact that the entire system is fraud and build up that way. The reference to Trump was in fact to make it clear that your economy and politics is way to entangled and for that the point is still valid. Try to think a little more before answering man, should fit you just fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another reason why things are different in other countries is the two-party system in the US. In most European countries, there is a Green Party - hence environmental concerns are brought up by political representatives, rather than (or in addition to) paid lobbyists. Or take the Swedish Pirate Party - they took on the system by setting up their own candidates, rather than seeking to influence candidates from established parties.</p></div>		</li>
