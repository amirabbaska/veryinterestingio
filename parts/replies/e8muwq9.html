			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeeeeeeeeeeeeppp. The mods here will try to claim this &quot;Isn't a subreddit for responses literally aimed at 5 year olds&quot; and they will claim it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110925152642/reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive" target="_blank">never was</a>. But, at one point it was. </p>
<p>Sub was <em>really</em> good once upon a time. Some of the best responses used to be literally explaining the answer like it was a 5 year old asking the question. Playground, allowance analogies and all that. At some point they decided to do away with that though, and make the subreddit another generic question subreddit. </p></div>		</li>

Doing that right now is like reading a semi encyclopedia, it nice if you are super interest in the topic but otherwise it a chore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also another type which doesn't use centrifugal force in the reel. My old Datsun pick up had belts operated by inertia. You could pull the belt as fast as you wanted and they wouldn't lock up. But if I poked the brakes kind of abruptly and the truck body experienced an inertial force a device in the reel would lock the belt. I demonstrated this for my buddy and he was stunned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are things in the seatbelt base that are just chillin', and go with the flow (slow spin), allowing the seatbelt to extend at normal speeds. When something makes them move quickly enough (fast spin), they trigger a locking mechanism (arms swinging out and touching the walls), which prevents any more slack from being introduced.</p></div>		</li>
