			<div class="markdown"><p>Check out Taipei 101's tuned damper. They plated it in gold and turned it into a tourist attraction. </p>
<p>It's tuned to oppose the frequency of the building so that it directly negates resonance built up by wind, etc. </p>
<p>It won't stop movement completely, but reduces it. It also more rapidly decays resonance if it begins, so the movement slows down sooner</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROz_ghunhVE" target="_blank">this video</a> playing on a screen near the damper.  The part that's hard to tell from the video is that the damper is <strong>massive</strong> - like 20 feet diameter and weighs 700 tons.  Watch how it moves around like a kid's toy in the video, and then realize that the damper isn't moving --- it's the 101 story skyscraper moving, and the damper's inertia pushing back on the building to keep it from falling over.  </p>
<p>Also my ears popped three times I think on the elevator ride to the top.  They were at one point the fastest elevators in the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the Hancock Tower in Boston has something similar, where towards the middle/top portion of the building there is a floor that contains only a tub or pair of tubs of sorts that occupies the whole floor, filled with oil and very large lead plates with steel springlike tethers to the outer envelope of the skyscraper.  The oil pool essentially is minimal friction environment, and when the building shifts with wind or seismic activity, the lead plates remain in position while he building shifts to and fro.  The steel tethers then building back into true.  Or something like that.  Unlicensed architect here with unlicensed thoughts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other types of seismic dampers used by buildings! Tuned mass dampers aren't that common in buildings shorter than 500 ft. Viscous dampers in particular are popular. Many buildings in earthquake areas have isolated bases. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many buildings have insulators built into the base, a mass damper at the top is not the only means of earthquake resistance. Also, the ones for many skyscrapers are for wind and not necessarily earthquakes.</p>
<p>You see other stuff too, like cross bracing, diagonal ties, and other features like columns being stronger than beams</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a structural engineer working in New Zealand</p>
<p>This is a Tuned Mass Damper and the best example is on the Taipei 101 Building. As far as I know this specific example at Taipei101 is more for wind(typhoons) rather than Earthquakes but it still helps. </p>
<p>It doesn't quite move in the opposite direction(although it would look like it if you were next to it). What actually happens is that it adds so much mass to a building(the mass is generally about 10% of the total building weight) that it makes the building sway in a sort of &quot;out-of-step&quot; way with the wind. This is why it is called a &quot;Tuned&quot; mass damper. It is tuned to sway at a specific frequency so that the building is 'De-tuned', lets say, so that it is less affected by the wind( and also can be done similarly for earthquakes). Buildings of this height are generally &quot;in tune&quot; with the wind which is why the tunned mass damper is added to de-tune the whole building. does that make sense? kinda like when soldiers break step over a bridge</p>
<p>It is called a 'damper' because it also acts to reduce the motion.</p>
<p>I'll post a more general answer to the original question later</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, can it be said that the mass tuned damper is to de-tune the building from reaching its resonant frequency?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! Interestingly, the tuned mass damper actually  gives the building an additional resonant frequency. </p>
<p>The number of resonant frequency corresponds to the number of degree of freedom the building has (aka the number of mass centres). Let's say you have a very simple 1 storey building frame with 1 dof. Adding a tuned mass damper will actually make the building have 2 dof (1 for the building and 1 for the damper). </p>
<p>However, this does not mean it is worse. The most important thing is what is the frequency of the resonance, not the number of resonance frequency. Let's say you have an earthquake that is mainly in the region of 5 Hz. Your building without the damper may have a resonance of ~5Hz too, which is bad. But you can add a tuned mass damper such that the building now has resonance at 1 Hz and 8 Hz. It will is now safer. </p>
<p>Of course the real situation is much more complex since your building will have way more degrees of freedom, and your earthquake will consist of multiple frequencies (since it is irregular, and varies from earthquake to earthquake). You would have to decide which frequencies you actually want to avoid, and which ones you want to add. Tuned mass dampers are actually pretty hard to design. </p>
<p>There are also dynamic tuned mass dampers, which are pretty cool. They are filled with  water and have a computer system to change the resonant frequency of the damper as the earthquake is occurring, instead of having a fixed frequency like the giant pendulums. They are much more versatile.</p></div>		</li>
