			<div class="markdown"><p>That was a fantastic read. I'm not sure how well it would pan out though. The US is much more individualistic in culture, so there would probably be a bit of one upping to some degree. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like a self propelling situation.  Asian Immigrants work in the salon business because they can find work there, which leads to the same thing for the next wave of Asian Immigrants. </p>
<p>Just like Hispanic Immigrants and Landscaping.  They work it because that's where they can find work, which leads to the same setup for the next wave.</p></div>		</li>
