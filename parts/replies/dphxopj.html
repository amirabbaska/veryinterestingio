			<div class="markdown"><p>The muscles that control focus are ring-shaped autonomic sphincters and those rarely wear out or you'd leak.</p>
<p>Plus they have no effect after 50 or 55.. they continue to work but the lens doesn't deform in response so the eyes don't focus up close and reading glasses must be used to add the missing focusing power.</p>
<p>The H&amp;W experiments and many others show that the absence of light OR focusable forms will severely restrict vision development, but once the neurology develops say by age 8-10, occlusion does no harm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Discovery Channel show Darkness, where participants spend up to six days navigating through a cave without any artificial sources of light, did have some &quot;factoids&quot; regarding atrophy.
By their statements, I was led to believe that iris sphincter atrophy was likely to occur after no more than 6 days of sustained visual sensory deprivation.  It was, however, a temporary condition. I suppose the fact it is a reality t.v. show should be taken into consideration, even if it is on Discovery Channel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Important connections are made between the eye and the brain in early childhood/adolescence. The eye needs to see images for these connections to develop correctly. If something like a dense cataract is present at birth, the visual system underdevelops which can result in deprivation amblyopia, reducing acuity permanently. </p>
<p>As stated above, not a big deal once the eye is developed, much more important at an early age</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a professor that had uncorrected astigmatism in one eye before the age of five. As a result, he can't see lines in the plane of his astigmatism at all. The part of his brain that sees lines in that orientation didn't develop. So if he looks at a piece of lined paper, the lines will completely disappear if he turns the paper to a specific angle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of lazy eye the brain doesn't ignore the eye.  You end up not developing stereo vision.</p>
<p>I had a lazy eye corrected at 15.
After the surgery I was given exercises to try to get my brain to develop stereo vision - pinpoint light in a dark room try to make the double image converge.  Gave me massive migraines to do it.  So after awhile I decided to stop torturing myself.</p>
<p>Am 44 now and can always tell which eye I'm looking out of.  Can even consciously switch between them at will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't find the source right now but I recall a couple of case studies where people blind from birth due to eye defects were able to see after surgery as adults. The bottom line was that they had a very hard time connecting the images that they were seeing with their internal mental model of the world around them. For example, they were unable to identify the shape of a wooden block visually even though they were able to identify it easily by touch. If the block was star-shaped, their brain just didn't correlate all of the acute angles with the sensation of touching the pointy bits.</p>
<p>After months of rehabilitation one of them was eventually able to identify close family members by sight.</p>
<p>Edit: Found the Wikipedia article that led me to look into this. Some good reading- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molyneux%27s_problem" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molyneux%27s_problem</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although after restoration of sight, the subjects could distinguish between objects visually almost as effectively as they would do by touch alone, they were unable to form the connection between an object perceived using the two different senses. The correlation was barely better than if the subjects had guessed. They had no innate ability to transfer their tactile shape knowledge to the visual domain. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically the crystalline lens (behind the cornea) is made of cells that continually grow from birth. Those cells can't go anywhere and ultimately stack on top of each other and eventually &quot;cloud up&quot; after years and years. </p>
<p>From u/nxplkbl &quot;The crystalline lens is behind the cornea and flexes and allows you to focus from distance to up close. It becomes cloudy after years of sun exposure, sorta like clear plastic left in the sun over time becomes brown. </p>
<p>Cataract surgery is when an ophthalmologist removes and replaces the crystalline lens. &quot;</p>
<p>Trauma can also cause cataracts and some people get them early. They can cause blurry vision, haziness, night glare issues, and if left untreated blindness. Most people start getting them in their 50s, and some people's take years to fully develop. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cataracts are most often fairly normal metabolic changes that buildup in eyes as they age. UV light, certain drugs can increase these processes.    </p>
<p>Alpha-crystallins are the trash men/managers for the lens and overtime they lose function. Proteins become denatured and build up within the lens.    </p>
<p>Depending on where in the lens they accumulate, you have the various types of cataracts. Nuclear, the  yellow colored one, happens within the center of the lens. Cortical with spokes coming in peripherally towards the central inner area. PSC (Posterior Subcapsular Cataract) occurs on the most posterior portion of the lens. PSCs are associated with steroid use often too.    </p>
<p>Diabetes causes a specific type of cataract due to sorbitol within the lens. Also Diabetes can cause PSCs.    </p>
<p>There are Rosette/Traumatic cataracts that result from the forces on the lens/eye. Kids can be born with congenital cataracts, some are minor being harmless and other must be removed to avoid strabismus (lazy eye) and/or ambylopia (decrease vision due to strab).    </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eye doc here. This is a good explanation. Lots of misinformation on the pathogenesis of cataract development. Numerous morphologic, biochemical, and biophysical changes occur to the lens with age. Most notable are the age-related changes in color (more yellow), light transmission (decreased), consistency (increased hardness), loss of accommodative ability (manifested clinically as presbyopia) and protein aggregation. The resultant lens opacification, referred to as cataract, results in loss of light transmission.</p>
<p>These lenticular changes are accelerated by a continuous entry of optical radiation into the lens, especially UV. People who live closer to the equator require cataract surgery earlier in life due to increased UV light exposure. </p></div>		</li>
