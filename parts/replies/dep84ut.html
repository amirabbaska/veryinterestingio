<p>There were already German communities in some of these nations, particularly Argentina. This offered a opportunity to blend in and network with culturally similar people.</p>

<p>I think this is the correct answer. Both Argentina and south of Brazil have large German communities, many of which still spoke only German till the 70s. Many people (of course not all) in those communities supported the Nazis and provided escape routes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, religion. Mennonites and Catholic Germans went there to establish communities far from the Protestants. Some also fled Russia where they had emigrated prior (once again because protestantism had become prevalent) due to growing hostility from the Russians. South America had been widely advertised by the publication of the travels of Von Humboldt, the first great naturalist explorer.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cant speak as to why this occurrd, but if I recall the emigration to S.America occurred at the same time as the mass influx of Germans into the US ; which I think occurred in the early 1900s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that there was some sympathy to fascism within these countries which also made it easier for Nazi criminals to start over.  My source is  a half remembered documentary I saw years ago which may not have been accurate â€” perhaps someone can correct me.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I belive going back to WWI argentina specifically brought in German military advisors to modernize and train the Argentinian military. They had a very longstanding military relationship that led to the German community existing and making it a no brainer safe Haven. </p></div>		</li>
