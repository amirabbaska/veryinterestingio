			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard to explain.  It's like you're both equally in control of everything but you can't perfect anything specifically.</p>
<p>To make a example:</p>
<p>I'll sit and eat a bowl of cereal and forget which hand I'm using.</p>
<p>Yeah, seems small, but doing that your whole life really diminishes your ability to use a single hand specifically for anything</p>
<p>So I sometimes write with my left, sometimes with my right, and I don't even think about it, but it means my motor skills are split and I can't develop on one specifically, so I have really shit handwritting, but I'm shitty with BOTH hands </p>
<p>Its really hard to learn how to control my learning ability in motor movement, and its hard to find a real teacher with experience because most people that CLAIM to be ambidextrous aren't at all, they just know they're kinda good at a few things with both hands</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there are advantages, like I can type with either hand at 60 or 80 words per minute with the one hand alone, I can play guitar really well with both hands (like I can switch from the guitar from left to right, even upside down), I can throw a baseball with either hand at similar speeds,  I'm really good with my hands during sex because one isn't dominant.   </p>
<p>But the rest of the time is a pain in the ass</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you go into fencing, most good fencers are left-handed - simply because everyone always trains against right-handed people. So at the top of the food chain there's an over-representation of left-handed people.</p>
<p>If you can fence ambidextrously you can take advantage of whoever you're sparring against by fencing outside of their comfort zone, and also swap hands if you get tired.</p>
<p>Especially the part about switching hands when you're tired is a big boon imo, especially if you do HEMA fencing where the gear weighs more than in olympic fencing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally was born left handed, but taught to use my right hand. This is good for writing but it causes problems in other areas. For instance, I write with my right hand even though if I practice with my left hand, my handwriting should be better, but the English language works better for right handed people, so I use my right hand. But because I am technically left handed, I prefer to wear watches on my right hand, but if I do that I can’t write comfortably, so I can’t wear watches</p>
<p>It’s always small things, but they are still annoying</p>
<p>I will say however, that being able to use both hands for pretty much everything is nice. But for me it’s not like I can just do something with my other hand, I still have to figure out the proper motions for my other hand, it just takes me less time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here.  Born left handed but I'm effectively right handed and halfway to ambidextrous now.  It's kind of a pain in the ass sometimes but it's been more helpful than harmful so I've made my peace with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong and have no data to back this up but I don't think most people prefer to wear their watch on a certain hand because it's their non-dominant hand.</p>
<p>I'm very left dominant but was also taught right handed (apparently I didn't show a preference as a child so was encouraged to use my right hand). I don't feel like I have any disadvantage. My handwriting isn't great but it would be fine if I wrote more, and/or practiced it. I can't write with my left at all. I play guitar right handed just as well as anyone who practices as much as I do (i.e. not much) should reasonably expect to be able to. When trying a new sport I tend to play left handed, and will typically learn somewhat faster than when I try to use my right, but after the initial learning curve it makes no difference, I would perform just as well with my right or left.</p>
<p>I don't know if it's just that my left-handed preference is very weak, but for me the only time the preference really shows is when I first try a new skill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try playing Wii sports Tennis against yourself left vs right hands.</p>
<p>You're equally good with either hand but (as my driving instructor said - I'd tie something around one wrist but you still wouldn't recognise it)  so you keep dropping points because periodically the wrong hand tries to play the shot. </p>
<p>I've just learnt that this is also an issue with legs. Currently undergoing physio so have to do the step exercise and have great difficulty sticking to either right or left foot 1st on the step for 60 seconds.</p>
<p>I can juggle fire clubs like there's no tomorrow and am equally good in a couple of hour practice with either hand/leg but ask me to switch or stay on one my brain just can't do it. It just doesn't recognise that their is a difference.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a friend In HS who was ambidextrous. We're  middle-aged,  so we remember certain teachers being very anti-left-handed. He was struck with rulers regularly for not using his right. As a result, he can write with both (and type like a madman) but his handwriting never finished being refined. It's chicken-scratch regardless. Some of the worst handwriting I've ever seen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a friend growing up, and I'd go to his house frequently. I went to his house after school one day and his dad asked to see his homework. His dad looks at it and says, &quot;What the hell is this, chicken shit scratches? Redo this.&quot; and put it on the counter. I couldn't read it. I'm not sure my friend could either. </p></div>		</li>
