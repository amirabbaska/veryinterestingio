			<div class="markdown"><p>It's price discrimination.</p>
<p>Consider two types of travelers, business travelers and seasonal holidaygoers.</p>
<p>The latter is far more price sensitive than the former. However, people planning their holidays tend to book flights far in advance, while business travel tends to be planned on a shorter timescale. As such, airlines know that they can charge expensive prices closer to the date of the flight and catch business bookings who didn't know they were traveling early enough to get in on the &quot;tourist&quot; price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Price discrimination is a technical term and should not be seen to imply anything negative. It’s just a way to charge different prices for the same product or service based on willingness to pay. Coupons and rebates are other popular forms of price discrimination. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but it also implies an ability to charge a higher price to the customers who are willing to pay more without them simply pretending to be the customers who are only willing to pay a low price.</p>

<p>Pretend things were reversed, and people who are willing to pay a higher price knew their travel plans well in advance and people who weren't willing to pay much only knew they were going to travel on short notice.</p>
<p>The airline couldn't charge high prices early and low prices closer to the date of the flight since the high willingness to pay travelers would simply wait for the lower prices and &quot;pretend&quot; to be customers with a low willingness to pay. The airline would have to charge a single market price that (in the very simple toy model I alluded to in my last post with two groups of passengers and each with a distinct, uniform willingness to pay for a ticket) would probably be the price that tourists were willing to pay unless it was more profitable to price out the tourists and undersell flights that only had business travelers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's about making everyone pay as much as they are willing to pay for their ticket (with limitations due to information and your pricing structure).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^^ this. I’m a perfect example of this, as I travel a lot for work and personally.</p>
<p>Work is paying for it? Fuck it. I may procrastinate a bit more, and I’ll always request the flight that is most convenient for me and my business schedule.</p>
<p>Am I paying for it? I’m the cheapest bastard in the world. I’ll be online months in advance digging for those domestic flights with 2+ connections if that means I can save $11. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You're more likely to spend money in the airport on a connection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, a tiered method like that forces the existence of &quot;desperation&quot; tickets -- slots which will be picked up with &quot;there will be someone there tomorrow&quot; sorts of business customers, as well as being useful for cases where you need to re-assign people.</p></div>		</li>
