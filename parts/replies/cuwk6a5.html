I suppose because something has gone wrong with the way they see things vs the way they actually are.</p>
<p>Does dopamine as you've described it play a role in that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia" target="_blank">Anhedonia</a> (no pleasure) is a common problems in dopamine-interacting disorders like depression, schizo-spectrum disorders, and to some extent ADHD.</p>
<p>I think it's a fairly plausible speculation/simplification to say that various non-dopamine-related pleasure-implementing processes are in fact going on, but because dopamine is the one responsible for focusing attention, they don't actually realize that they're enjoying it on some deeper level and will not be motivated to repeat these pleasurable experiences. I haven't personally read any direct study on that topic, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey. You mention Dopamine is useful for focusing attention. Is this a big thing or just a little attention focus? </p>
<p>I find my ability to focus totally sucks and also correlates to when I'm unable to motivate myself to do something I like, enjoy and find rewarding (which is apparently another dopamine related thing)</p></div>		</li>
