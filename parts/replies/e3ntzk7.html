			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes you wonder if you could have the holder farther behind the line, and the kicker even further back, so that they have more space/room if that improves the distance/angle vs the extra yards they need...if the snaptime isn't a big enough factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At that point, it becomes a factor of how much extra time is added vs how much extra length youâ€™re adding to the kick. Not to mention that the more time you add to it, means more time for defense to get to, and block the kick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was waiting for this to be brought up. It's never taken advantage of by coaches (likely because they have no idea the rule exists). Imagine end of game scenarios where a team leading by 1 or 2 points is forced to punt with &lt;10 seconds on the clock. Makes more sense to fair catch and try the kick than go for a crazy return IMO. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all about angle of the rush. Holders are typically 7 yards behind the line of scrimmage. That puts the kicker in the &quot;pocket&quot;, but far enough back to clear the middle lineman. The angle an edge blocker needs to take is very tight. That angle also goes right by the wing lineman. Usually, even a slight push by the wing is enough to throw the rusher off his direct path. If the holder moves back to 10 yards, the edge rusher can take a straighter and opposition free angle to block the kick.</p></div>		</li>
