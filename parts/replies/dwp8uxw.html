			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just 3D, each image had infinite context attached. We have so many other senses we can marry with what we see and store that as metadata with each image. Depth, distance, color, smell, sound, texture, temperature, and the relative knowledge of each item within each image and how each item should predictably interact with every other item and even the ability to make predictive contingencies if the items do not behave rationally.</p>
<p>We are an amazing computer attached to countless top of the line sensors that can make inferences and predictions and memories and recognize patterns like nothing else in existence. </p>
<p>We are also succeptable to things like depression and over eating and substance abuse and laziness and all the other maladies of the human condition so the robots totally have a chance. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's hardly accurate, human eyes can detect flicker at ~1000 fps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but we don't get a constant stream at 1000 fps. Focusing on one area requires a lot getting filtered out. Our image processing filters out a lot of unnecessary content so it can be processed in a timely manner</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an analogy. Consider it a lower bounds. Mostly it's an ELI5 illustration to show that a 20 year old brain has processed a ton more information than the typical neural network program trained to detect whether a picture has a bird in it.</p>
<p>(and I'm aware that &quot;ton&quot; is a unit of mass and not precisely applicable)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a better example would be a blind man seeing for the first time ever in his life. Everything he saw would be new to him and he'd have an enormous amount of trouble categorizing things into groups. A microwave, television, safe, computer tower, and a brief case would probably all be pretty much indistinguishable to someone who has no frame of reference. </p></div>		</li>
