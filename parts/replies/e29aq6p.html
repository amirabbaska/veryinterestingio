			<div class="markdown"><p>It is more likely that a longer coma is due to a greater severity of the initial illness of injury, or due to complications related to the illness or to prolonged hospitalisation. And this would predict  a worse long term outcome. </p>
<p>It is plausible that the medications used to induce coma could have adverse effects and there is some evidence that this may be the case but it is difficult to separate any effect due to the medications and the effect of the illness of injury that lead to the person being placed in a coma. It is also difficult to establish the magnitude of any effect solely due to the medications used to induce coma. Lastly people in comas are a diverse group and it is very difficult to draw conclusions about them as a group. </p>
<p>I wouldn't consider the one week coma and the 10 month coma to be comparable at all. The person comatose for 10 months usually has had an unsurvivable injury. It's better to stick to examples of people who are comatose for days to weeks. And usually the coma is induced by medications as part of supportive therapy while the illness is treated.</p>
<p>If someone is comatose not due to an effect of medications then the prognosis is usually dismal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bulk of the data is from traumatic brain injury but can be extrapolated for other causes as well.</p>
<p>The longer you go with diminished consciousness(including coma), the worse it is. The TV trope of someone waking up from a prolonged coma and being their normal self is a total myth. Even Loss of Consciousness(LOC) longer than 24 hours is enough to classify your brain injury as &quot;Severe&quot;, with likely long-term sequelae. Coma durations lasting longer than a week are correlated with brainstem damage; indicating even more severe consequences. Some data suggests that emerging prior to the two week mark can result in a &quot;moderate to good&quot; functional outcome, but there will almost certainly be long term issues.</p>
<p>A large amount of people never emerge. For those with comas after TBI, about 50% who are in a coma after 4 weeks will eventually show some improvement. For those with anoxic brain injuries(cardiac arrest, drowning) the prognosis is much worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat related: if a woman is pregnant while in a coma, does this affect the development of the baby at all? In the extreme, if the woman fell into a coma shortly after conceiving, how would this affect the pregnancy? How does delivery work when the woman is in a coma?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll add that, compared with adults, childrens’ brains are much better at recovering from brain injuries. If an adult suffers a brain injury severe enough to put them into a coma, it’s unlikely they’ll recover without permanent and noticeable cognitive, behavioral, and functional deficits.</p>
<p>There’s a Hollywood conception of a “coma” where someone gets a bump on the head, goes to sleep for a month or ten years, and then wakes up and walks out of the hospital, and goes about their life as usual. Very convenient for lazy screenwriters, but not realistic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But often damage to the frontal lobe in children will initially go unnoticed because that region of the brain has yet to fully develop. Children are not good with executive functioning anyway so a weakness in this area is often missed until it manifests as a deficit in adulthood. At this point the connection to the initial TBI could be missed. </p></div>		</li>
