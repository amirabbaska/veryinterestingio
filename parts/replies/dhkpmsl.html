			<div class="markdown"><p>What baffles me is how international laws should prevent big MNC tech companies from just hoarding this data globally yet this still happens. But then I was send to China for work and got in touch with some local data hoarders and it's simply frightening. I had a meeting with one of these hoarders for targeted advertising, ie age groups, regions, professions, purchasing habits etc. It goes much further, they can tell exactly where you move, with whom you interact, what you buy (up to the items itself), even some malls they can track your movement. All because data between mobile providers/banks/tech companies are shared. Because we walk around with our mobile having WeChat installed it makes their life even easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are completely correct... I lived and worked in Shanghai China last year for Nike... I had minimal experience with the tech side, but everything was monitored there. If you combined my experience with Microsoft with communist China's intent and goals on suppressing and controlling their population - you have one ugly picture of what the world will look like in the wrong hands. I hope the tech industry continues to evolve both in overall positive life enhancements and morality.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hoping the OS tracking is not as bad as I dread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure that's why I stopped using windows update. Then the big ole worm started doing damage and I hadn't updated in a year.</p>
<p>And now I've got to figure out what, if any, privacy I can manage to keep if W7 has tracking updated into it. <em>sighs</em></p>
<p>I wish linux was an option but as an avid gamer it's just not realistic.</p></div>		</li>
