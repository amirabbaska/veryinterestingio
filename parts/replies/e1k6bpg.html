<p>' I'm not.'
' I'm driving.'
' I'm walking. '</p>
<p>' I am.'</p>
<p>In the first three, we are waiting for something more after &quot;I'm&quot;. We just expect it (&quot;I'm&quot;) to reference something. The last one could be used as a prefix for the first three (in place of I'm), but it also stands fine on it's own. If we stop talking after &quot;am&quot;, then the mind decides the sentence is finished. If we stop after &quot;'m&quot;, the mind just keeps looking for the reference.</p>
<p>Don't know why, it just does.</p></div>		</li>
