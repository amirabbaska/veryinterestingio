<p>The universe did not start at a single point and expand out in a ball from that point. The universe started with very high density and space expanded out from every point of space simultaneously. If the universe is infinite now, then it was always infinite.</p>

<p>My favorite way to picture this is to imagine an infinitely big sponge. Pretend that infinite sponge is squished as far as possible (but, since it's infinite, it still takes up infinite space). Now imagine that the squished infinite sponge slowly gets less squished (i.e. it expands). </p>
<p>Replace &quot;sponge&quot; with &quot;matter,&quot; and you have a pretty good way to visualize the expansion of the universe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds very good.  I like it much better than the balloon analogy because it does not have the problem of the 2 dimension vs. 3 dimension issue.</p>
<p>I have my own favorite picture as well.  I imagine the universe with an arbitrarily assigned x,y,z, axes established.  I picture it in a box with a knob at the bottom of the box.  The axes have distances labeled on them.  When I turn the knob the values on the axes change.  I think of the expansion as someone turning the knob, increasing the scale on the axis, but the picture I see is otherwise unchanged.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The sponge analogy is technically good (I personally prefer the balloon analogy) but this phrasing sounds a bit like a bloke I overheard in algebraic topology saying &quot;Just picture the geometry of L²(ℝ)&quot;. Oh sure, let's just picture the geometry of something that has no embedding in finite-dimensional space. Let me get right on that. </p>
<p>Not saying it's wrong, it's just difficult to imagine infinite densities in infinite space expanding to make something that's observed as finite.</p>
<p>I think it'd be easier to restrict yourself to an arbitrary big but finite expanding sponge, highlighting that around any chosen point there could be a horizon of sponge moving away so fast you wouldn't be able to see past it because light speed is too slow. A speed-based horizon.</p>
<p>Furthermore, near time = 0 there was a distance-based horizon of radius 0 because light hadn't moved yet, so the &quot;thing density&quot; was (everything the point knew of)/0. Then light spread out and you could see closer and closer to the speed-based horizon, but light speed is too slow to catch up because the speed-based horizon had a head start.</p>
<p>We wouldn't be able to tell the speed-based horizon from the actual edge of the sponge, though, which is why we can't conclusively dismiss the possibility that it's infinite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. As you get closer to the &quot;edge&quot; of the observable universe, you discover that more and more possible directions all lead back the way you came.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know the expansion rate of space. (67.15 ± 1.2  kilometres per second per Megaparsec.) If we account for that, we can tell if an object is moving away from us or just being carried away by the spatial expansion. (If it has an apparent velocity slower than the expansion of space, then it was moving towards us, but is still being carried away by the expansion of space.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still not grasping how we can measure the expansion rate of space accurately if all our measurements are dependent on space itself. IOW, if space was expanding ten times as fast as you mention, what measurements would actually change?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume you could look at relativistic effects.  A particle with a known decay rate would seem to have a slower decay rate if it were move through space relative to you, but not if the apparent motion were due to the expansion of space.  But I have not read that.  I am just assuming it.</p></div>		</li>
