			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to explore this in SF, Stephen Baxter explores alternate earths where the moon forming collision went slightly differently. One of them involves an earth covered by a shroud of thick mist. The book is called manifold origin.</p>
<p>The society that evolves actually develops a stationary hurricane around one of the world's biggest peaks to study the sky.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can't find any book by Baxter with that name. Only Manifold Time, Manifold Space, and Manifold Origin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apologies. You're right. All three are excellent, but I believe the book is manifold origin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's from his Manifold series, Origin IIRC. That's the third of three, I would recommend reading all three in order, but they are fairly standalone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd strongly recommend the whole Manifold trilogy and the Long Earth trilogy. There are at least two more Long Earth books scheduled. I'd also suggest Evolution by Baxter. </p>
<p>While it doesn't explore alternate Earths or have quite the same flavor as Manifold or the Long Earth, it is good. Essentially Baxter follows a thread of evolution through time, with each POV being that of a creature in either our deep past, present or deep future. </p></div>		</li>
