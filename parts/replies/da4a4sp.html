			<div class="markdown"><p>If you mean if the station accelerated <em>to</em> near the speed of light, remember that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial references frames. Any acceleration that won't kill the occupants probably wouldn't bring GR into it. The situation of an unmanned craft that can withstand extreme accelerations is left as an exercise to a more qualified commenter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I meant, what would happen if the station is near the speed of light and it keeps accelerating, would the balloon still go towards the direction the station is accelerating on? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean that during an ISS reboost an astronaut could potentially suffocate due to the lack of oxygen at the 'front' of the station? Or is the acceleration not that significant?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume the air circulation system is easily sufficient to overcome the forces of acceleration. Yeah you can't have stagnant air in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, having good ventilation in the sleeping quarters is vital in the ISS. Carbon dioxide would otherwise accumulate near the astronaut's mouth when they're sleeping, leading to suffocation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The boost is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI8ldDyr3G0" target="_blank">really, really slow</a>. They say in the video it has an acceleration of 0.0185 m/s^2. If I'm remembering the physics right, this should correspond to a difference in pressure of:</p>
<p>density <em> distance </em> acceleration =  1.2 (kg/m^3 ) <em> 100 (m) </em> 0.0185 (m/s^2 ) = 2.2 Pascals</p>
<p>Since air pressure is 101,000 Pascals, this is far too small to be significant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Under acceleration, the air pressure will be higher toward the rear of the ISS. However with the tiny acceleration, the effect would be miniscule.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the molecules that make up air are jiggling around at about 500 metres a second.</p></div>		</li>
