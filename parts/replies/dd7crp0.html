			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not /as/ red as they are when you add more nitrites, and customers flip out if the steaks aren't red. We used to have vacuum-packed beef that would last like three weeks in the fridge, but customers got mad because the steaks would be brown-colored due to lack of oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting.</p>
<p>Sometimes I'll bring home ground beef that looks really red but as soon as I cut into it, it is brown on the inside.  I always wondered if it was just old or if there was some other reason.  Maybe they're only &quot;nitrating&quot; the outside sometimes?</p></div>		</li>
