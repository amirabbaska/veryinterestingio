<p>For example they take part of your kidney and program the stem cells to grow a new one</p>

<p>This could theoretically work for organ replacement if for example, you were in an accident and they were damage, but not for disease purposes since the residual cells of the organ could still carry the original disease...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about organs, but nerves.... I have a eye disease that prevented my optical nerve from fully forming (autosomal dominant optic atrophy, if anyone's interested). My eye specialist told me that they were in the experimental stages of &quot;training&quot; stems cells to regrow the damaged parts and even complete nerves. He guessed it'd be 15 to 20 years before people were actually able to utilize this, but it's being tried out. I'm no scientist, but surely, if they can regrow nerves, they can regrow organs as well?</p></div>		</li>
