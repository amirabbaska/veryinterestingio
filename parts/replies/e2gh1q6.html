<p>The least “evolved” animal that could stretch died off millions of years ago, since it would be the common ancestors for the entire mammal and avian classes of the animal kingdom, respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since avians came from reptiles, this common ancestor would also be the ancestor of all reptiles. Do reptiles stretch? Otherwise the feature may have evolved separately in mammals and avians.</p></div>		</li>
