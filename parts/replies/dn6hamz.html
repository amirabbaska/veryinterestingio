			<div class="markdown"><p>A typical bullet or cannon shell travels at 800-1000 m/s. the speed of sound in air at see level is about 350m/s. The typical bullet can penetrate a few cm of steel. Energy scales up with velocity on a quadratic scale, and increases the penetration depth and volume displaced. These are traveling several times faster so it can definitely do some damage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only issue is if you have a singular projection </p>
<p>Then you just have a nice clean hole in a ship, especially if the projectile is moving fast enough to the point were kinetic energy isn't displaced into the ship</p>
<p>People above have referenced using railguns like shotguns, were the shell breaks into many pieces for more damage, but then other issues arise </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That really depends on the shape of the projectile. The thing about supersonic and hypersonic projectiles (those above M1 and those above M5 respectively), is their shape can be odd. As long as it fits inside the shockwave cone generated by tip of the projectile it can be whatever shape you want. So if you shape the projectile correctly you can have a very LARGE clean hole in the side of a ship. The advantage of a railgun is you aren't limited by the shape of a traditional barrel and rifling. You can use things of all shapes and sizes. And even shotgun style as you said. Their advantage is massive penetration power at significantly longer range with fairly high accuracy. Close range you can use them shotgun style. But one of the major advantages is the range. If you can prep it correctly you can have a singe projectile that flies several miles and detonates on impact. Or an oddly shaped projectile whose intent is to mangle enemy ships. There are a number of possibilities. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're highly accurate so you could use them to punch unto the engine room for example and get a mobility kill, then they're dead in the water and you could chose to move closer and engage with traditional weapons or keep firing and try to get the ammunition storage to go up. Rail guns allow you to engage at much longer range than current weapons systems so you could take out ships without ever being in danger of taking damage yourself. This all of course hinges on you being the only one with this tech. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if this was shot at the ground level of Manhattan a few stories off the ground, in theory, it would go through multiple blocks of skyscrapers?</p>
<p>If so, that's crazy. The cutscenes in Final fantasy 7 when Diamond Weapon fires the barrage into Midgar comes to mind. Very scary to have such a destructive power unleashed upon the world.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe I'm wrong, but unless you are shooting an armor-piercing 50. cal you won't do much to proper steel. Target plates made of steel are only a couple centimeters thick and you can shoot them with almost anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. Millimeters not centimeters. About 1 cm would be doable with a typical round. On the other hand, armor piercing rounds can go through several inches (depending on the type of armor piercing rounds). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would poke a hole through things just like you get with other very dense HV rounds.  This would very much be an artillery round to put big holes in things so other things can get through them.  Although, the idea of a MIRVing payload would be very scary, as the mass would be dispersed without appreciable loss to velocity.  It would shred pretty much anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the round penetrates, it can do a few things: still have enough energy and the right direction (round could be a bit deflected by the armor) and fly through to the other side. Or there could be some stuff inside which it destroy/damages. Or it could make tiny pieces of metal loose and damage and cause casualties with that. Or a combination of the above. </p></div>		</li>
