			<div class="markdown"><p>They'd probably be like our trees, but with more variation in ring thickness and color, but generally broader rings and a sharper contrast in color, compared to our trees. A 7 year summer would probably yield a light-colored ring of somewhere between 14 and 28 times the thickness of our trees average ring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this also apply to the branches? I’ve seen the same rings in some trees’ branches and wondered if those are also created by a “yearly” cycle</p></div>		</li>

<p>It might be easier to understand if you think of it as a full cycle of seasons and not exactly a 365 day period.  The rings show more what happens during the growing season that makes up the most of the actual ring.  It grows quite a bit.  The cells appear different (darker in most cases) during the 'off season' and lighter during the time of quicker growth.  This is a cycle that is made up of a year growing quickly in the spring/summer and slowing toward Autumn to winter. Then repeating. The rings come as the the tree grows outward all around.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so is the formation of ring/year the same for countries without the 4 seasons? for e.g. those on the equator..</p></div>		</li>
