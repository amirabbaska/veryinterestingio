			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course it varies from deaf person to deaf person but, generally, completely deaf people visualize sign language in their heads or feel themselves signing in their head. Congenitally deaf people think more visually. You do it all the time without really noticing it also. On the flip side most deaf people usually have some exposure to &quot;words&quot; as they are present on the lips of people around them all the time or were exposed to it when they weren't deaf and thus it's rare for these people to not have &quot;words&quot; in their head or some kind of &quot;thought container&quot; reassembling words. Imagine reading a book with a word or the name of someone you can't pronounce. You might not be able to pronounce it but you know exactly what the author is talking about any time that word comes up. Kind of the same thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only deaf. There are hearers that don't think with words. Most of those are visual, but some people claim thinking with concepts (whatever it means). </p>
<p>Anyway, why do we need to tell ourselves what are we thinking?    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Concepts&quot; could be considered as &quot;thought containers&quot;. This can also be called unsymbolized thinking. It's a very weird thing. For instance, even without knowing the words &quot;pain&quot; or &quot;light&quot; you could still experience these and understand them. You could anticipate the feeling of pain or of the sun lighting up the surroundings and experience them without having words to describe it. It can make your brain hurt trying to think about this as it seems counter intuitive sometimes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the only time I think in &quot;words&quot; is when I'm reading a comment or trying to work through a logic problem (I'm a programmer). Otherwise it's all conceptualâ€¦ I don't really know how to explain it other than say it's extremely abstract. Like whatever comes &quot;before&quot; words.</p>
<p>Also, if you hear something in your head like this thread is talking about, do you just imagine someone talking? Or can you literally hear the words as if they were being said in real life?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I can think in 'concepts'  (as well as in words and in all senses), is that not usual? I can for example imagine entire sections of software I'm about to program, without relying on the words that form the code or on imagined diagrams or anything. I just imagine the ideas behind the abstract mechanisms themselves without relying on representations.</p>
<p>For me it's almost essential to be able to do that. I wonder if those not aware of their ability to do that are really incapable or just unaware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting. When i was a child i used to read quite complex books, everyone thought i was a really good reader but in truth i only understood about half of the words on the page, but i understood enough to get the gist of the story, the result was a kind of speed reading where my mind filled in the blanks where i didnt understand with more primative concepts, this lead to a kind of imagined plot that followed the broad strokes of the story but with much of the specifics made up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting to think about what born-blind people &quot;conceptualize&quot; in their mind's eye. I mean, if I close my eyes, or am in 100% darkness or am unconscious, I can still &quot;see&quot; and &quot;imagine&quot; things - even things I've never actually seen before. I wonder if blind people can &quot;see&quot; these things, but never experiencing eyesight, they would never realize that their &quot;inner visualizations&quot; are essentially what seeing people describe as sight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't have to be blind to be unable to visualize things in your mind. There's a mental condition called aphantasia which is simply the inability to visualize anything in your mind. I personally have it since birth (and most people with it have it from birth) and my thoughts are purely in words. Visualizing something simple like a circle in my mind is impossible let alone something more complex like someone's face or my home.</p></div>		</li>
