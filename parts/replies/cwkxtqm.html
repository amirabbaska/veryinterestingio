			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure it's true. Have you ever left a water bottle in your car or or a glass on your night stand or something and had it taste weird and bad? Its stale because it's stagnant. Shaking it does fix that. I don't know for a fact if it's about oxygen like that guy said though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bad taste from leaving it in the car I always assumed was caused by the heated plastic it's in, you could be right though </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you already drank out of it, it's the bacteria from your mouth that makes it bad</p>
<p>also there's lots of shit flying around, like mold spores etc.</p>
<p>If it was oxygen, wouldn't it taste better after stirring it a little bit or pouring it into a glass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's from the phthalate esters in plastic bottle waters, and the fact that those bottles are a porous material and absorb things from the air over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The flip side of that is that if you leave tap water set out for about a day it allows the chlorine to off-gas.  I always keep a large cup of water by the couch and on my nightstand. I prefer the taste after its been there a day or so.</p>
<p>You can also use this trick for changing your aquarium water if you don't have a water conditioner to dechlorinate it.</p></div>		</li>
