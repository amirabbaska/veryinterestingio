			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer.  As I'm not a chemist, but an engineer and mostly a mechanic, I know that the proper fuel to air ratio for an internal combustion engine is around 14.5:1 (air:fuel), I believe that is by volume, not mass, though.  So would this still work out as a method of explaination as 1 gallon of gasoline is 231 cubic inches and would take 3,349.5 cubic inches of air?  So does anybody know how much 3580.5 cu. in. of CO2 weighs?  Or am I just way full of it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine that is why u/listens_to_galaxies said if we assume pure octane.</p>
<p>The exact number just isn't important.  The point of the math was to show how burning hydrocarbons can equal emissions larger than what was burned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1 Gallon of Gasoline is around 6.5lbs=2948.35g Chemical formula for gasoline is: C8H18(aq)+12.5O8(g)=&gt;8CO2(g)+9H20(l) You have to use stoichiometry to figure this out. Converstions. 114.23gC8H18/1molC8H18; 44.01gCO2/1molCO2; 8molCO2/1molC8H18 How I got the conversations: You will need to look at the periodic table and add up the amount of atoms in that molecule. Example C8H18 is 8 Carbons and 18 Hydrogens. Carbom is 12.01g so multiply that by 8 because you have 8 carbons and then you find out for hydrogen which is 1.01g then multiply that by 18. 8 Carbons ATM is 96.08 and 18 Hydrogen is 18.8; add it up and you will get 114.88 but I got the ATM off the internet because I'm lazy but I did the calculations before i typed this part out so ¯<em>(ツ)</em>/¯. It's close enough to 114.23. I hope you're picking up what I'm putting down. You are given the lbs but we can convert that to grams which we did so above. Then we will have to solve for the CO2. The numbers in front of the chemical formulas are moles. Moles are like just a bunch of atoms in a bag which you can find out the amount of atoms in it too but we're trying to find the lb's of CO2. The Equation
2948.35g X (1mol C8H18/114.23g C8H18) X (8mol CO2/1mol C8H18) X (44.01g/1mol C8H18). In this problem you will multiply 2948.35X8X44.01 then divide that by 114.23 and will get 9087.41grams. Not done yet!! We still need to convert it into lbs which is 20.03lbs of CO2. BOOM! Chem Major. I'm pretty sloppy, I know. 4 sig figs. Don't forget phases. It's proper chemistry grammar.</p></div>		</li>
