<p>2.there is (currently) no feasible (read: cost effective) way to create a 100% renewable grids as all of our renewable power sources are pretty temperamental and are not very good at producing the baseline amount of power a utility needs through a day. E.g the sun doesn't always shine and it's not always windy, but people always need power.</p>

<p>Depends on where you are... British Columbia derives about 95% of it's electrical needs from Hydro-Electric power plants. There's a small amount of thermal energy here and there, and a few off-grid locations, but it's overwhelmingly hydro.</p>
<p>We don't do pumped storage, but our power utility has also acted as a buffer (and made a pretty penny doing so) for the western electrical grid. During the california power crisis, they would run the dams at huge, unsustainable levels during the day, and sell that power to California at obscene rates. At night, they'd turn the dams off, and buy dirt cheap Nuclear power from California. You can do that with hydro power, which is much more difficult with thermal (be it coal, natural gas, or nuclear).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry I was not clear with that statement, when referring to renewable I was excluding hydro as its net environmental impact is in the negative as it disrupts huge swaths of ecosystems but excluding that it is renewable.</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing that out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pumped hydro storage doesn't have to have a large environmental impact. For 10 hour runtime, only about 50 acres are needed at the top &amp; bottom of a steep hill with 1000' difference between them to generate or consume 500 MW. It doesn't require square miles to be flooded, just an area the size of a small farm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There has been a lot of R&amp;D in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_energy_storage" target="_blank">grid scale storage</a> recently, with pumped hydroelectric, compressed air, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_battery" target="_blank">flow batteries</a>, and other technologies.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technological breakthroughs are not a granted outcome, however investment does help to drive innovation. The issue is that the swing in demand from a single energy generator, while large is not nearly the same scale as that of entire utility. The reality is that most power generators can always produce power, but when there is excess across the board there is nowhere to put it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pretty much all renewable systems are capable of scaling down their output, at a minimum.  Your first choice is hydro, because you can &quot;Save it for later&quot; -- If you have extra peaking generation capacity beyond what your source river can provide, it's as good as 100% storage efficiency.  After that, Solar can just not be used (the panels get a little bit hotter than they would otherwise), and wind can be trimmed down (which is done in high-wind situations to protect the hardware).</p>
<p>Ideally it would be stored rather than discarded, but overproduction isn't a particularly rough problem.</p></div>		</li>
