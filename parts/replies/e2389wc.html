			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, this is why health care professionals who take a blood pressure manually use a stethoscope. They inflate the cuff and then listen to your arm for the first pulse of blood they hear (systolic pressure) and the last pulse of blood they hear (diastolic pressure)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't even need a stethoscope, the pressure gauge on the manual cuffs is sensitive enough that you can see when the dial starts pulsating and when it stops pulsating, which gives you systolic and diastolic pressure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What medical significance is there to measuring systolic and diastolic pressure separately, rather than only one of them? Are there diseases which are specific to only one of systolic/diastolic pressure being high or low, rather than both being high or low?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two numbers are used to calculate other metrics like mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure, which each have significance in evaluating physiological cardiovascular function. A large pulse pressure, for instance, which might indicate atherosclerosis or endocarditis among other things, could be the result of a high systolic pressure and a low diastolic pressure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Systolic Pressure is the higher pressure range, and numbers above 140 indicate a greater chance of heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p>Diastolic Pressure is the lower level, and is less important, but is still necessary to determine overall risk levels.</p>
<p>For example, a person with 140/80 might have a lower risk of stroke than someone with 140/100.</p>
<p>Plus, you get the two numbers with the same test anyway, so why not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Systolic BP is significant as, that’s the overall blood pressure it takes to move blood throughout your body, to overcome the vascular resistances present to move your blood across the tissues to exchange gasses and across the nephrons of the kidney to deposit wastes and finally across the lung field to exchange gasses again. The higher it is, the harder your heart has to work, essentially.</p>
<p>Diastolic BP can be a good indicator of how relaxed the pressure gets when the heart isn’t actively pumping blood (when the ventricles of the heart squeeze) this can be a good indicator of chronic arterial disease, as arteries eventually become less pliable.</p>
<p>A simple formula with these numbers produces your MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure) keeping that number above 58 or 59 is important as that’s the pressure it takes to persuade important things like the brain.</p>
<p>These numbers are also different inside the heart itself, but the differences can be diagnostically significant in determining anything from Chronic Heart Failure to Aortic Valve Diseases.</p></div>		</li>
