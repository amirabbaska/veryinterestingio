			<div class="markdown"><p>I did that a couple times. Guy kept saying &quot;we've received a distress signal from your computer&quot;...I led them on for about 15 min, had the guy get his manager on the line because I <em>just couldn't figure out what the problem was</em>. A good idea is to use phrases like &quot;Oh, this little round piece that fell out? Well that can't be good.&quot; Also, mention how much porn you watch (whether its true or not), really makes them feel uncomfortable, especially because they're not supposed to hang up.</p>
<p>Eventually I told them there was no way my PC was sending out error messages....because I had a Mac. And that I'd received this same scam phone call a dozen times before. Haven't gotten one since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>lol I thought I was the only one who did that except in my version, after about 20 minutes or so I just start becoming progressively weirder and say stupid shit like &quot;okay I just typed what you said to, now a dinosaur popped out of my screen, what do I do next? </p>
<p>That's usually good for another 10 minutes of confused responses before they start screaming at me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of them called me and said, &quot;hello, this is windows technical support.  Do you know why I'm calling you today?&quot;  To which I replied, in the most obnoxiously enthusiastic voice I could muster, &quot;Yes!  You're trying to scam me!&quot;  He said, &quot;Yes!  You're absolutely right!&quot;  Then we laughed and hung up.</p></div>		</li>
