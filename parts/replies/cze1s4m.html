			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback and answer more of OP's question:</p>
<p>Scientists have recorded activity sequences of hippocampal neurons in rodents during quiet wakefulness (and NREM sleep and REM and consummatory behaviors) that seem to repeat recent experiences.  Whether this is in any way the same as &quot;lying there thinking about arbitrary things&quot; is still up for debate, but the available data invite lots of analogies with daydreaming/rumination.      </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit more on how rats dream:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The finding, reported on the Web site of the journal Nature Neuroscience by Daoyun Ji and Matthew A. Wilson, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, showed that during nondreaming sleep, the neurons of both the hippocampus and the neocortex replayed memories — in repeated simultaneous bursts of electrical activity — of a task the rat learned the previous day.</p>
<p>The researchers could interpret the memories through electrodes inserted into the rats’ brains, including into special neurons in the hippocampus. These neurons are known as “place cells” because each is activated when the rat passes a specific location, as if they were part of a map in the brain. The activation is so reliable that one can tell where a rat is in its cage by seeing which of its place cells is firing.</p>
<p>Earlier this year Dr. Wilson reported that after running a maze, rats would replay their route during idle moments, as if to consolidate the memory, although the replay, surprisingly, was in reverse order of travel. These fast rewinds lasted a small fraction of the actual time spent on the journey.</p>
<p>In the findings reported today, the M.I.T. researchers say they detected the same replays occurring in the neocortex as well as in the hippocampus as the rats slept. The rewinds appeared as components of repeated cycles of neural activity, each of which lasted just under a second. Because the cycles in the hippocampus and neocortex were synchronized, they seemed to be part of a dialogue between the two regions.  </p>

<p>The cool bit is they seem to be learning from their memory while they sleep. People can do this too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In hibernation, the body temperature decreases (down to hypothermia), and the metabolism slows, to conserve energy.</p>
<p>As opposed to sleep, which is more about restoration [than energy conservation], and at normal body temperature.</p>
<p>Some animals still need to sleep while hibernating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would not be surprised if some animals kept in captivity that suffer intense stress (like those tigers in the zoo that pace for 16 hours a day and are obese or underweight) would also suffer disruption to their sleep. Being less able to tell themselves &quot;I gotta get to sleep, I have work at 6:00&quot; I suspect they would just get back up and do something, but irregular or disordered sleep would surely be a possibility when an animal has mental health problems or trauma. </p></div>		</li>
