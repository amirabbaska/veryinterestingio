			<div class="markdown"><p>The explanations of Snoopy here really makes me realize how correct Bill Waterson was when he decided not to let Calvin and Hobbes get over commercialized. Peanuts feels so sold out to me but Calvin and Hobbes still feels special to me and it is because of this decision. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have read Calvin and Hobbes since I was like 8 years old. I've been amazed at how relevant it has remained over the years and as a 30 year old, I recently started reading them again for the first time in years and am blown away at how different my experience with it is. Bill Waterson is a wonderful man and a gift to humanity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. I think Charlie Brown is who we are, but Snoopy is who we should try to be. Snoopy enjoys life and genuinely finds happiness and enjoyment in most things. Charlie Brown handles what life gives him. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be higher up. I read the Peanuts comics as a kid and never understood it. My eyes are opened.</p>
<p>I particularly like your comment on Snoopy's sadness.</p></div>		</li>
