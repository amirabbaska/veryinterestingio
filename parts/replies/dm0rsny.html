			<div class="markdown"><p>Since supernovae produce all super-heavy isotopes, couldn't we make the argument that if the island of stability exists, we should see the corresponding spectral lines in a fresh supernova, but not if the island of stability does not exist?</p>
<p>Or are we talking about the difference between half-lifes of microseconds within the island versus half-lifes of nanoseconds outside of it? In that case even if the supernova produces these isotopes, they won't be visible for any appreciable amount of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't know whether superhevay nuclides are produced in non-negligible quantities in supernovae. We have no reason to believe that species near the island of stability are produced. But yes, even in the island of stability, the lifetimes could be very short on practical timescales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would these nuclides even be detected?  Even if they undergo gamma decay with a characteristic signature, it seems like it would be difficult in practice to isolate it from all of the noise and low number of photons captured at the detector due to the immense inverse square distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is currently considered a non-negligible quantity in regards to a supernova? The precision of the measurement? In that case, what quantity could hypothetically be formed while still remaining negligible? A simple percentage of the star mass at a given distance from the instrument will do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have any actual figures on hand, but spectral lines are much less distinguished for high mass elements since there are many more allowable transitions. I would guess that it would be impractical to try to verify a small concentration of heavy elements with spectral information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read recently that much of the heavy elements may have actually been created in neutron star collisions or neutron stars 'falling' into black holes. Can anyone clear this up for me - where do the majority of heavy elements come from? </p>
<p>Edit - <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Nucleosynthesis_periodic_table.svg" target="_blank">here</a> is a cool periodic table that explains how all of the elements came to be. Thanks to u/PE1NUT!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you're referring to r-process nucleosynthesis. This is how we think the heaviest nuclides in nature are produced. It's still somewhat of an open question as to <em>where</em> in the universe the r-process occurs. Some candidates are supernovae (I think this has fallen out of favor lately), neutron star mergers, etc.</p>
<p>A nuclear astrophysicist would be able to go into more detail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In order to fuse two heavy nuclei, you need to give them a lot of relative kinetic energy in order to overcome their electrostatic repulsion. But if you give them a lot of kinetic energy, then when they fuse, they'll form a highly excited compound nucleus which boils off particles (mostly neutrons and gamma rays).</p>
<p>If you boil off neutrons, then it's hard to reach very neutron-rich species. That's why when we use this technique to produce superheavy elements, we produce proton-rich species.</p>
<p>So instead you can do the reactions at lower energies, and minimize the average number of neutrons boiled off. But the probabilit of the reaction occurring becomes very small if you go to lower energies. </p>
<p>So you can't win.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, thank you for the quick and informative response.</p>
<p>Can you tell me if there are any other routes the physics community even minorly suspects could lead to successful fusion with larger numbers of neutrons retained?</p></div>		</li>
