<p>Except that its effect is opposite to what we normally mean by gravity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, but general relativity often defies our intuitive understanding of gravity, especially in very un-Earthly conditions, like the spaces between galaxies. </p>
<p>It's still the curvature of spacetime, as predicted and described by Einstein's general relativity equations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to confirm, popular descriptions of General Relativity describe gravity wells as being like a depression in a flat sheet.</p>
<p>So, using the same analogy, is dark energy creating something equivalent to a shallow hill?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll take your word for it that GR allows for negative gravity, but saying that there is negative gravity in intergalactic voids is one step further. As far as i know there is as of yet no consensus about what dark energy is.  </p>
<p>But i suppose it is possible that negative gravity is a fundamental property of space-time, and that gravity is positive only locally in the presence of mass.  </p></div>		</li>
