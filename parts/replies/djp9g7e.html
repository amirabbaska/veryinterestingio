<ul>
<li>The US economy is big so raw totals look big. As a percentage though, the numbers aren't way off</li>
<li>As a share of the government 'spending pie', defense isn't even in the top 3 in the US, and in terms of priorities, it isn't way off either</li>
<li>The US has a lot of treaties and responsibilities (and desire to influence world affais) to other nations that require a capable military that can go across two big oceans</li>
<li>Those treaties and responsibilities are simultaneous, and thus the US has to focus on multiple areas at once</li>
<li>The US military is focused primarily on growing rivals like China and a resurgent Russia, two nations with much lower wages and cost of living</li>
<li>Thus you can't compare total spending between the US and those two nations and conclude the US is many times more powerful than either nation - the US <em>must</em> spend more raw total money than China just to be equal because Chinese wages are much lower</li>
