			<div class="markdown"><p>Those airplane kits were wonderful. In elementary school my teachers would reward the class for good behavior with small bags of cracker Jacks. At recess e everyone would build their little planes, color them in and draw cool designs on them, then had little competitions in the field to see who's plane flew the furthest. </p></div>		</li>

A toy??</em> and then it was a row of stickers that had no adhesive with the Cracker Jack logo.</p></div>		</li>
