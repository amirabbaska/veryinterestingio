			<div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, yes. </p>
<p>From observing my personal, four-child data set, some children's different cries are far more distinct than others.</p>
<p>One of my offspring's distinctive cries changed in pitch, rhythm and intonation. Another, moderated their pitch rather than intonation. The third was colicky. What they lacked in differentiation, they made up for in duration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. That is because pain and other feelings in different parts of the affect affect us (even the babies) differently.      Some parts of the bodies are more sensitive to pain (and other feelings),       so when a baby is hungry, they cry in a specific way since the pain in the stomach influences their cry,      when they're craving for attention,     it's not pain but a feeling of fear that they experience,    since the tummy-hurt feeling is not experienced now,     and they are feeling a different emotion,     that'll influence their cry to be different. </p>
<p>Babies are complicated animals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both of my babies did. My daughter would make this &quot;myeeeah...myeeeeah&quot; kind of cry if she was hungry, and a &quot;eehhehhhhmm&quot; kind of cry when she wanted almost anything else. My son, who is 5 months old, goes &quot;maaamaaamaamaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrgh&quot; in this kind of angry yelling shriek thing when he's hungry, and makes the &quot;myeeeeeah myeeeeah&quot; crying when he's sleepy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like it'd be just one existential crisis after another. It's honestly surprising how well we learn to cope with life itself. Understandable to scream at it when you don't know what it is and you're as helpless as it gets. </p>
<p>Almost like a sperm whale called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, some of these things the baby is feeling are the most drastic feelings the child has ever experienced.</p>
<p>Bit your cheek with your gums? Most painful thing ever.</p>
