<p>Odd numbers (I-5, I-95, etc.) run north-south</p>

<p>Do you know of any rhyme or reason for the exceptions to this rule (ie, I-395 being marked as &quot;east&quot; and &quot;west&quot; in Maine)?</p>

I-85 through Atlanta has a bypass called I-285, another called I-975, and I-75 has a bypass called I-675. If there's reasoning behind the first of the three digits, I haven't picked up on it.</p></div>		</li>
