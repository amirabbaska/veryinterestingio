			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they serve other systems as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cannabinoid receptors, located throughout the body, are part of the endocannabinoid system, which is involved in a variety of physiological processes including appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we read &quot;X inside our body does Y for us&quot; its safe to assume X also serves other functions or systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the exact answer but men and women have more in common than most people think. </p>
<p>I was reading about how there's a lot of evidence to suggest that men suffer from PMS (Pre-menstrual syndrome) even though they don't menstruate: getting cranky, moody, hungry, fatigued, etc. once a month just as women do as their body prepares for menstruation. </p>
<p>So it makes sense that men have these pregnancy receptors even though they don't bare children. I mean, we all start as female in the womb, after all. </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Bare&quot; only refers to being uncovered. In all other cases, it's &quot;bear.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never heard that about &quot;male PMS.&quot; Men's hormones are much more stable than women's, and PMS (as much as it can be said to exist) is related to the comparatively drastic hormone changes of a menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>But I do want to clarify that &quot;we all start out female&quot; is a common misconception/oversimplification. Depending on how you're defining sex, you could say that we're chromosomally male or female from the moment of conception (based on whether the sperm is carrying an X or a Y). But we have neither male nor female gonads/genitals for some time. It takes a while for the hormones that cause that differentiation to be produced and actually start making changes. </p>
<p>The sexually ambiguous body parts that a fetus has look much more similar to female anatomy until the external genitals are nearly done being formed, which is probably where the &quot;we all start out female&quot; thing came from. </p>
<p>TL;DR - Up until the penis and scrotum are fully formed, all fetuses look female on a sonogram. But male fetuses are still XY from the beginning. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are at least six endocannabinoids, of which anadamide is one. I don't even know if there is a receptor with only one endogenous ligand. Regarding their physiological functions, the endocannabinoid system has not been documented very accurately up until recent times, and the only conclusive thing to take away from each publication is &quot;there's more to it&quot;. </p>
<p>It's noteworthy to point out that the 'classical endocannabinoids' (2-AG, anadamide) are also glycine receptor antagonists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Current working theory is that the level gets extremely high right after childbirth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you mind linking a paper? It reads like fantasy to be honest, considering how subjective the effects of marijuana are (in contrast to, say, endorphins vs. opioids).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, though this seems to be related to the regulation of anandamide <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19200965" target="_blank">through various sex hormones</a> -
I wonder why they only measured anandamide level. </p>
<p>Measuring the level of anandamide in the CNS during labour will prove difficult to say the least. I guess there's more to it...</p></div>		</li>
