			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you can never perfectly time the market. If you have money to invest, stocks today are cheaper than they were last week. They may continue to lose value, or they may rebound. If you are young, think long term. Right now you are getting stocks on sale. I lost thousands yesterday, but I'm only 32 and in the long run this will balance out because I'm getting stocks cheaper now that will hopefully rebound. I would be much sadder if I were retiring tomorrow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is the part i don't understand. what's &quot;soon&quot;? why would it be better to invest when things settle down as opposed to now? or is that we haven't reached bottom of the market yet? how does riding this kind of market trends work? i'm assuming there's not going to be a breaking news segment saying that the best time has arrived when it hits, so how do i recognize it (theoretically)?   </p>
<p>EDIT: not sure why i'm getting downvoted for asking a question, but ok...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Soon = they don't know if a &quot;bottom&quot; has been reached yet or not. basically, wait and see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you will be fine. This might actually make life easier with the commodities down. So, gas and everything like that would be cheaper globally.</p>
<p>Overall, with no investments, it pretty much doesn't affect you.</p>
<p>Although, if you wanted to start investing now would definitely be the time to do it.</p></div>		</li>
