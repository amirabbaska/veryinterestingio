			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I second the legal advice comment. The top answer is awful. That person clearly has no idea what they are talking about. Probably Googled Double Jeopardy.</p>
<p>Double jeopardy is an extremely complex issue that takes years to understand. Mainly because there are several distinct categories of double jeopardy analysis that each have their own body of law. An analysis of punishment under multiple different statutes for the same act or transaction is distinct from an analysis of multiple punishments under the SAME statute for the same act or transaction, which is distinct from an analysis of subsequent prosecutions after either conviction or acquittal for the same acts, etc. etc.</p>
<p>All of which is different from a dual sovereignty question which is, rather simple. There is no constitutional bar to prosecution by dual sovereigns for the same crime or act. </p>
<p>If someone commits a kidnapping in two different states, they are subject in theory to prosecution 3 times: once in each state, and once by the feds.</p>
<p>But while there is no constitutional bar, there are policies and statutes which apply. Particularly the Petite policy in the USAO manual, which is freely available online.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not guilty might mean the jury think you did it, but are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>Yup, sat on a jury for an attempted murder case. We thought the guy probably did it, but there just was not enough evidence to warrant a guilty verdict. It was just basically one guys word against another. No eye witnesses, no dna, no gun recovered, not much of a motive (other than some trash talking).</p></div>		</li>
