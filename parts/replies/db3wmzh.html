			<div class="markdown"><p>Not by agencies such as Neilsen, which cannot rely on such self-reported info. However, within a single company (e.g. ClearChannel), this information can provide more precise details about listeners: who they are, what stations they listen to, and what products they buy.</p>
<p>In turn, these details can be shared with advertisers seeking to more accurately target their advertisements. The fact that a show gets reliable and numerous unique call-ins (as opposed to the same few people calling all the time) is a significant attractor to advertisers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And how is all of this data being gathered?? Maybe through web or social media contests but not call ins. Very few people talk to a screener for more than a few seconds and even fewer make it to air. The only people I as a call screener collected info on were prize/contest winners. Also, the same people call in constantly. While there was some overlap among all of the CC stations in our market, each tended to have a unique audience, i.e. the Top 40 crowd didn't tend to cross over much to the classic rock station. But we all had our repeat callers/super fans/prize pigs.</p></div>		</li>
