The US's NTSC (which was back-compatible with black+white broadcast) pre-dated the PAL system that Europe developed by a number of years and PAL had the chance to learn from NTSC's mistakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the issue isn't the difference, but the conversion from one format to the other for broadcast?</p>
<p>Interesting that OP said BBC was blurry for them, where I've always experienced it the other way around here in the UK.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You probably can't see the difference between 25 and 30, but you probably can tell the difference between something shot in 30 shown at 30 and something shot in 25 shown in 30, especially in programs brought over before they had computers to smooth things out. They'd either have to show the frames at full speed, in which case the whole program would run 20% faster, or they'd have to show 20% of the frames for two ticks, in which case there would be a bunch of slight stutters in the movement. Likewise in the other direction, either programs would run slowly or their would be skips in the movement.</p>
<p>Nowadays, we have computers to try to approximate what the images would be if it were shot at 30fps, which is probably the source of the blur. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, I believe the refresh rates are also a tad different (60hz for NTSC and around 50hz for PAL). This ties in to the 25 FPS that someone also mentioned in this thread, but refresh rate will also cause the picture to seem “off” compared to what a person is used to seeing in reference to their typical viewing specs.</p>
<p>Source: I do AV in the states, so my experience is a little skewed in terms of what I’m used to seeing, but we work with a lot of video consoles/components manufactured in Europe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea that’s correct, old NTSC standards before HD TV meant that your screen resolution was 640x480 at 29.97fps, here in the UK we worked to 768x576 at 25fps.
So you guys had more frames to the second whilst we had greater resolution.</p>
<p>Now we work in HD and sometimes 4K, resolution has become more standardised but we still shoot/edit at either 29.97 or 25fps for broadcast of 24fps for film</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any idea as to why resolutions were kind of odd for PAL? 768x576 seems oddly specific, so I was just kind of curious if you knew. Definitely interesting info!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m guessing you’re making a joke because there’s plenty of sun in the UK.
<em>However</em> you’re not wrong in how some of the shows feel sometimes.
I typically avoid some British shows just because they have that dark and gloomy feel. Often they’re shot in the colder months, but the colour grading also adds to the gloominess.</p></div>		</li>
