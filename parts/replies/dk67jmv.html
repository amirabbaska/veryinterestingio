			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for posting this. This is the only real answer in this thread. Everyone should read that article, because it's well-cited and informative.</p>
<p>Going a little further, linguists will tell you that all it takes is social pressure and isolation for accents to change, and social pressure will always at least slightly modify accents constantly--new words are invented, some fall out of favor, some stop being important, and so on.</p>
<p>The early Americans were quite isolated, obviously, and they also had social pressure going on. Because once there were native-born Americans learning how to speak English in Jamestown and Plymouth, they had to speak with <em>some</em> accent. And what they spoke with is whatever was around--their parents had come from all over England, but mostly from the south and southwest.</p>
<p>One historian, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4139476?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank">Paul K. Longmore</a>, estimates that the earliest an England-born visitor could go to America and immediately recognize an American accent would be about 1670. By then, there were enough American-born English speakers in number, and they were old enough (the oldest in Virginia would be 60, the oldest in Massachusetts would be nearing 50) that it wouldn't be chalked up to a funny way that some young'uns talk, but it would be the way that <em>Americans</em> generally speak, spanning from father to son to even grandson.</p>
<p>But the accent wasn't too pronounced. Between the 1670s and 1710s, there are a number of mentions in surviving literature about &quot;barbarous English&quot; spoken in America, or how they oddly use one word when they mean another. It wasn't until Hugh Jones, a British visiting professor to the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, who arrived in 1715, that anybody made a direct mention of Americans having accents in surviving literature. He taught at the school until 1721, and then published his memoirs on his time there in 1724. In it, he said that Americans spoke English generally without &quot;idiom or tone&quot;, i.e. without too much slang or too heavy of an accent. But that same year, he also published an article entitled <em>An Accidence of the English Tongue</em> in which he made several observations on American pronunciations. One of them was that Americans spoke the &quot;s&quot; in words such as &quot;raspberry&quot; as a &quot;z&quot; sound.</p>
<p>Over the next fifty years, mentions of American accents came with increasing frequency, and British commentators often said one of two things: 1) that there was a lack of diversity in American accents as compared to England (still true today). You could be in Virginia or in Massachusetts and they all sounded the same. And 2) They spoke more &quot;proper&quot; English than did many people back in England.</p>
<p>That's because this same time frame, from the late 1600s until 1800, saw a large social shift in accents in England, going from the &quot;Original Pronunciation&quot; to &quot;Received Pronunciation&quot;. The rhotic accents had begun to be seen by city dwellers as hillbilly accents--a bias still held today against many speakers of the &quot;West Country&quot; dialects. They began to speak non-rhotically as a status thing, and eventually even the lower classes in much of England made the switch, too. (And just to clarify that it's not really individuals making a switch. It's mostly kids who make the switch. As an example, the parents have a hillbilly accent, but most of the kids at school don't, so the kid has a different accent than his parents. Together with whatever accent is being reinforced by the teachers, an accent can change drastically in the matter of two or three generations.)</p>
<p>By the time of the American Revolution, written observations on Americans having an accent were quite common. Benjamin Franklin's accent was written about during a visit to England in the early 1770s, and Franklin had been born back in 1706--something he presumably picked up in his 1710s childhood.</p>
<p>To bust a myth or two, the Tangiers/Outer Banks accent mentioned at the top of this thread being closer to colonial American or Shakespearean English <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=-3YokgYKoJMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=appalachian%20shakespeare%20speak&amp;pg=PT98#v=onepage&amp;q=shakespeare&amp;f=false" target="_blank">is a myth</a>. Appalachia is often wrongly cited the same way. The truth is, that the Tangiers accent was <em>already</em> being recognized by the time of the America Revolution as a &quot;hillbilly&quot; accent. Dictionary writer Jonathan Boucher, who lived in Maryland and Virginia from 1759 to 1774, wrote of the accent as &quot;the Scotch-Irish, as it used to be called, in some of the back settlers of the Middle Colonies&quot;. </p>
<p>In other words, what makes the Tangiers accent remarkable isn't that it sounds like the &quot;general American&quot; accent of colonial times--it doesn't. What makes it remarkable is that it <em>dates</em> from colonial times, and it's one of the oldest hillbilly accents to be spoken in America continuously. It's drifted just like every other accent, but it's been spoken by a continuous community dating back to the early 1700s, maybe even earlier.</p>
<p>There's ample evidence that early colonial American accents have the same root accent as the local accents heard in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pZ-Ny8q22o&amp;t=70s" target="_blank">West of England</a>, in places such as Bristol and Devon. But those accents have drifted considerably, as have American accents, so that we don't sound nearly the same anymore.</p>
<p>If you want to do a sound experiment, listen to the accents of president <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEG0xT7fddw" target="_blank">William Howard Taft</a>, New York City mayor <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/303893-earliest-known-recording-new-york-city-mayor/" target="_blank">John F. Hylan</a> (relevant part starts at ~0:30), and president <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb30L-NmKjo" target="_blank">Woodrow Wilson</a>. All three were born before 1860, and all in middle to upper class upbringings in different parts of the country: Taft in Cincinnati, Ohio, Hylan in upstate New York, and Wilson in the urban South and then New Jersey.</p>
<p>All three have elements of what linguists call the &quot;American brogue&quot; heard in the 1800s. It's what the 1700s general American accent developed into, and what the 1900s general American accent came from. Those three people were all born 150 years ago, and Benjamin Franklin was born about 150 years before that. So using your imagination, and those sound clips, and the clips of today's West Country accents, and recreations of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYiYd9RcK5M" target="_blank">Original Pronunciation</a>, you can piece together just about what the general colonial American accent sounded like before the Revolution.</p></div>		</li>
