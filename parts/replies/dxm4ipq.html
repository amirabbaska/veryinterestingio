			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever since I read that flies essentially see everything in slow motion compared to us, with 360 degree vision, I flick them to kill them.</p>
<p>Like you say just inch up really slow with your finger cocked and to the fly it's just a barely moving object.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the method passed on to me from my dad, and his dad before him. I remember reading an article about how, after filming them in slowmo, scientists discovered that flies will adjust their legs/body in ways that allow them to take off in very specific directions to escape quicker.</p>
<p>Seems to me the old clap trap method is the best way to attack them with that in mind. Another case where our ancestors didn't need science to figure out the most efficient way to tackle a problem.</p>
<p>Quick edit to clarify: not that I'm attacking the importance of science or anything. Just always fascinating to see humans find a really effective solution for something simple, only to have a small scale modern study/experiment using wildly advanced technology to more or less reinforce it.</p></div>		</li>
