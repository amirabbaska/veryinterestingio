			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with everything you said, but my only criticism is that this is a slightly confusing way to answer OP's question. Let me try it a different way:</p>
<p>Yes, a person using a skateboard will expend <em>less energy</em> than a person walking over <em>the same distance</em>.</p>
<p>The reason is that the skateboard functions as a simple machine (wheel and axle) which translates the person's energy into forward motion. When walking, a good deal of energy is lost propelling one's body upwards with each step.</p>
<p>To think of a comparable example to the skateboard, think of a person standing at the edge of an ice rink who pushes against the sidewall with one foot. Assuming he/she is wearing relatively friction-less footwear, like an ice skate, the person will travel a good deal farther than 1 stride length.</p>
<p>Again, most of the person's energy goes to forward motion. And again, less total energy is expended to travel a given distance (vs walking).</p>
<p>Edited: for clarity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing everyone seems to be missing is the energy required to lower one's body enough for the pushing foot to reach the ground and then the energy required to raise the body back up to a point where both feet stand firmly on the deck. With every push, you are also doing a one legged half-squat with the other leg.</p>
<p>edit: for example, when I skate around a bunch, it's not my pushing leg that gets tired, it's my other leg (the leg I use for stability and support)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why biking isn't always the best way to exercise. People will bike for only 20 minutes and think its a good amount of exercise simply because they went far. </p>
<p>You easily burn more calories walking to that destination. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Distance isn't really a limiting factor when it comes to exercise though. I've heard people say &quot;I've got 60 minutes to exercise, what should i do to burn the most calories&quot; - I've never heard someone say &quot;I've got 10 kilometers to exercise, what activity should i do to burn the most calories&quot;.</p>
<p>Cycling, Running, XC skiing, rollerblading and swimming are all activities which engage large muscle groups. They're all going to be burning roughly equal amounts of calories per unit time for a given perceived aerobic intensity in individuals who aren't specially adapted to any one of those particular sports</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biking is the best way to exercise because if your commute is 15 minutes by car or 35 minute by bike (a difference of 20 minutes each way), then you get 70 minutes of exercise per day day at the cost of only 40 minutes of your time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Walking is a strangely underappreciated exercise. When sufficiently brisk it is even aerobic, but either way it engages huge ranges of muscle groups and even brain activity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a little more energy expended maintaining balance when skating, I think, but not enough to make a difference when comparing overall. Skateboard stance is a bended knee also (I don't skate just trying to recall all the hours I spent watching it). So overall the whole thing requires different muscles. It's not like you push a few feet and then stand there. </p>
<p>Probably you have to compare an experienced skater to a walker to get a proper comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can just stand on a skateboard after pushing. Its not great form, but I think this is a conservation of energy type question and not a in depth look at energy consumption of various stances and muscle groups. The point is that you CAN cause a skateboard to roll, stand on it, and go farther than walking with the same energy expenditure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also your non-pushing leg is constantly doing little squats for every push because of the difference in height between the board and the ground. I've found that my front leg tends to get tired faster than my pushing leg. Not sure if this really adds anything to your point but it seems like people are only talking about the energy expended by the pushing itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Valid points. I was thinking more about energy expenditure in a Physics 101, simple Newtonian mechanics sense. But you're certainly right when talking about energy expenditure in terms of real human metabolism.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Increasing efficiency of travel lowers the energy needed to move the same distance.</p></div>		</li>
