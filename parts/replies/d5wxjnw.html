			<div class="markdown"><p>In those situations? As a Basic your first priority would be to control the airway and breathing, followed by bleeding. Most likely the airway is going to be alright otherwise if she were to fall unconscious maybe from hypovolemia then you can put in an airway adjunct to keep it open. If it's compromised and she's awake, a head-tilt-chin-lift should work although this would be unlikely. </p>
<p>Next is breathing - she is definitely going to be getting oxygen by non rebreather at 15lpm. She will most likely be freaking out and possibly hyperventilating or just otherwise taking deep, shallow breaths or rapid shallow breaths. This will decrease the Spo2 or the amount of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen in the blood. Want to keep this above 92% for any patient unless they are a victim of carbon monoxide poisoning. </p>
<p>Then the bleeding control. This is tough because you can't put a tourniquet on poor mom's private area. Also if a baby/placenta is coming out you can't keep pressure there either. In these cases though if there is no baby - you could try light pressure around the area. Bleeding control of the vagina is a tough one. You also have to be considerate of modesty and respect so really I would only ever attempt this if the bleeding was severe and it would most likely be gauze held lightly around the area. </p>
<p>Last but definitely not least you will be monitoring vitals closely to see any trends in BP/HR/Breathing Rate/Spo2. These can tell you of a worsening condition or something else going on inside the body you can't see. </p>
<p>If you are an Advanced EMT or Paramedic then you'll most likely start an IV and start giving some fluids to replace those lost in the blood. You'll also have her hooked up to a electrocardiograph (we just call it the heart monitor) not only because this will be constantly reporting vitals to you but you can check out the heart rhythm. Advanced EMTs can legally interpret 4 rhythms and Paramedics can do the rest I believe. </p>
<p>Then there is medication administration. A basic won't have much to give in this regard but a medic can give some pain meds if the situation calls for it. </p>
<p>Also a very important thing to never forget is to try to keep poor mom calm and be respectful. This is a very large event in her life. This is a complication surrounding her baby. The complication will most likely end with the baby dying and maybe her but less likely so. She will remember this for the rest of her life. Anything you can do or say to keep her somewhat alright you should do.</p>
<p>I think that's everything. It sounds like a lot but it's mostly routine stuff with any patient. So yes the main course of action would be to haul ass</p>
<p>edit: Advanced EMT can also give narcotics for pain management. oh and also this is for Ohio. Scopes of practice vary by state</p></div>		</li>
