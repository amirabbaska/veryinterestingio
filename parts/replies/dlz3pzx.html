			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you explain how they made the shell not explode in the barrel the moment they activated the triggering device?  Because the barrel, and the ground, would both be in range of the radar, right? What was the mechanism to make sure they exploded only bafter being launched?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent question. The VT fuse used centrifugal force (yes, I know there's no such thing) to turn off a safety after a short period of time. Firing the shell from a rifled barrel caused it to spin at high RPMs, which activated the fuse. A simple accelerometer safety would not have been sufficient, since it could be accidentally triggered by just dropping the shell from a sufficient height; there was no way to accidentally impart sufficient rotation to trigger the safety (this could only happen when it was fired).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh, and from the point of view of the VT fuse there was indeed a centrifugal force, so thats okay :P</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think many people give credit to how many military innovations we benefit from. People often see the defense budget as a bloated waste when in actuality it funds quite a bit of diverse research.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It can be both.  I'd be shocked if after spending hundreds of billions blowing people up we didn't come up with some tool useful for efforts unrelated to people blowing up.  Doesn't mean the budget isn't bloated.</p></div>		</li>
