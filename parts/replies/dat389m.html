<p>This is the correct answer.</p>
<p>I've worked on one of these ads for a design label. It starts with &quot;we're doing a new fragrance&quot; and it slowly snowballs into the 'art' that you end up with on TV.</p>
<p>I got to work with the non-CEO head of the company, so I got to see that quite a lot of it came from him. He had ideas in his head about symbolism and tones and wanted to convey that through the branding. I had a quick chat with him 1:1 to kick things off - did I like where he was going? What feelings were invoked in me on the subject (I admit I made some of it up, because I'm not really as passionate about perfume as I may have led on). Did I agree with his plan for the visuals?</p>
<p>Then lots of meetings with DP's and head creatives in the company - the head of digital had already put together a bunch of stuff like mood boards and collages of 'storyboards' for print campaigns, so I absorbed lots of that stuff... the company head talked to us about the types of models he wanted and how they would interact... he already had some personal favorites, so they were probably (definitely) going to be in it.</p>
<p>The DP in the end was world-famous, so I ended up mostly just doing technical work around his shots. There were people there that were incredibly hyped to work on something so artistic and visionary... and I was happy enough to pick up a paycheck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's the issue with all of this though -- I don't disagree with your analysis, but why perfume?  This should apply to <em>all</em> advertising, and to some degree it does, but it doesn't explain that basically every perfume commercial has all this weird, non-straightforward advertising, and no other industry does.  Why does perfume go this direction, and no one else sees it as effective?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they are basically selling a clear liquid that smells a certain way. They literally cannot convey what the product is like through visuals or text because there are no meaningful stats they can show. It's also really hard to compare a complex smell such as a fragrance to another smell a person might know. Because of this, their only option is to try and get their product stuck in your head so that the next time you decide to go fragrance shopping, you'll try on theirs. That's also why it's basically the only industry where testers are expected and not just an occasional thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, higher-end, designer brands often want a famous director. In order to get a famous director on board, along with paying them a shit ton of money, you've got to give them a lot of creative freedom. Sometimes a perfume ad is a great outlet since they don't make any sense anyway the director can go wild. </p>
