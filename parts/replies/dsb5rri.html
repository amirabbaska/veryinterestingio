<p>my controversial personal opinion, based upon this research and personal history, is that sugar consumed in moderation is healthier than excess NNS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is defensible, and possibly correct, but I would also add (anecdotally) that for many people, controlling their intake of simple carbohydrates is much easier when their diet is supplemented with NNS.</p>
<p>If it's a choice between a healthy level of simple carbs supplemented with NNS or an unhealthy level of simple carbs, most people should probably go for the former, even if the optimal diet does not include any NNS.</p></div>		</li>
