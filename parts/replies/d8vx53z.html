			<div class="markdown"><p>I have something similar, in my case its ADD. I spent most of my school years literally tuned out, either doodling in my notebook or just staring off into space. Eventually I dropped out of school, got into college based on a high GED score, and experienced the exact same thing there -- couldn't concentrate on the work. These days I have a high pressure, deadline job, and I still daydream for most of the day if left to my own devices (I always meet deadlines and excel at my job, somehow i manage to pull my shit together in time). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hhahaa, sorry to laugh, but this is so funny because I am exactly the same. I always thought, or compared my blank states of daydreaming to a computer troubleshoooting something or pretty much a screensaver. In primary school I used to daydream all day/every day. Teachers would always call my parents and tell them how i just space-out all the time. May I ask when were you diagnosed with Aspergers? I never was but everyday I suspect I have it, my ex's brother and father have it, and man I could see myself in them; also reading online about it, I have pretty much 99% of the &quot;symptoms&quot; or better said clues of the syndrome, but I am thinking that I am way too old for anyone to put a diagnostic now, or they'll just call me crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my cade it was about 10 years ago. You are never too old for a diagnostic, I even get benefits here at work because I am &quot;special&quot; and I can prove it. But in my case its not a draydeam. That involves thinking. I just go into a full blank state of mind. 0 thoughts. Just autonomous breathing, and thats about it. </p></div>		</li>
