			<div class="markdown"><p>Electronic dance music, which encompasses everything from trance &amp; house music to dubstep and hardstyle. If you're that old, you probably refer to it as 'techno' while you yell at kids to get off your lawn lol.</p>
<p>If you're interested in finding out more about various sub genres YouTube ishkur's guide to electronic music. It used to be a flash stie but from what I can see it no longer exists as such. </p></div>		</li>
