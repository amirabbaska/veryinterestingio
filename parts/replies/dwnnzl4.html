<p>No sense in paying someone else </p>

<p>This needs to be higher, the top comment right now and all the replies are missing this HUGE point. Do NOT pay some scammy company to do something that you can do yourself for free. </p>
<p>Instead of making payments to them, make them to yourself. Creditors will be just as happy to negotiate a settlement with you as with some company, so if you're genuinely to the point where you're willing to wreck your credit for 7 years to get out from under the debt by all means stop making your payments and hold the funds for a settlement. The only caveat here is you have to actually avoid spending the money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do this for my job at the bank. Even when you explain in a calm rational manner what is being done to them by a predatory company 90%  won't take it. I  would tell the customer I will do the exact same thing right now and you don't have to pay the settlement company's fees.
The fees are usually a $100.00 starter fee and 10% of whatever is saved via settlement. You got $10,000. off your debt you owe $1k to the company and taxes on the $10,000.
Yes it can be intimidating but if customers call and just talk not scream at the various Credit Card companies the entire conversation is 30_90 minutes. Be next to a computer or have a pen and paper to make sure you have specifics of everything. Most companies have 100% recording now so if you say A  and they say B make sure you can point it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do collections too and it just really drives me nuts that they take advantage of people who are lacking in financial education. I would always try to talk people out of it if they were still thinking about it, but once they signed they were usually a lost cause. I don't know if it was the companies telling them they couldn't break the contract or if they paid fees up front they didn't want to lose, but I've been broke too and it sucks that they're giving a company money that could be better spent elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, you can imagine how I feel about LifeLock. $10 a month (minimum) to do something that frankly is already being done for you. If someone applies for a credit card or whatever fraudulently, the bank will send you a letter. If you want to avoid fees, mostly all you have to do is open what you think is junk mail and give ti a brief look. A lot of people throw out notification letters thinking they're solicitations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do collections and I can't tell you how many people were oblivious that they even owed anything because they were throwing out letters and even statements with opening them. A $5 purchase you forgot about can turn into $100 in fees and it's so stupidly preventable. Not to mention purchases that aren't yours, and the longer you leave it the harder it is to have it reversed. I dealt with so many people, particularly the elderly, whose relatives had used their cards without their knowledge and now they're stuck with it.  Unless I know exactly what it is I open every piece of mail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) You can do it yourself, you can't do it as well as the 'scammy companies'. They bring many more accounts to the table than you do alone.</p>
<p>2) It doesn't wreck your credit for 7 years. Your credit score is much more dynamic than that. If you have a car payment, or a mortgage, your score will improve much more quickly. Even keeping a card out and maintaining a balance under 30% will accelerate that  healing. Just having the unsecured balances off will help.</p>
<p>3) I can paint my house, change my oil, even cut my own hair with clippers. But i already have  a full time job, and don't consider hiring a professional to be a waste.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, I suspect it has to do with refinancing the debt you have left. If you've been paying on a 300k house for 20 years, you're going to have a lot less left to pay on, and therefore can set up something manageable. </p>
<p>If you just bought one 2 years ago, you may be shit out of luck.</p>
<p>I know he'd been in his for close to 30 years, so I imagine it wasn't too difficult to work something out. Banks just basically want to be paid back <em>at least</em> what they put out, so it isn't a loss. So working out a deal is in their benefit.</p></div>		</li>
