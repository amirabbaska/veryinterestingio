			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not an attempt to answer so I hope it's ok I leave this here.</p>
<p>I smoked on and off for almost two years, trying to quit most of the time. I told myself that I would quit but I would continue to go outside for breaks because it was so psychologically beneficial. Especially at night with the moon and stars.</p>
<p>So, I'm going to vow to internet strangers that I'm going to make a habit of this. I'll encourage everyone else to try this as well. 5 minutes outside provides a great moment of relaxation and reflection. I was frequently surprised at it's effectiveness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I quit smoking I kept going outside with the smokers for a few months. Maybe half a year to be honest. For me it made quitting much easier, even though it involves being around it, the breaks were key for me. Oh and at home I would step outside to have a popsicle every now and then.</p>
<p>Also, good luck!</p></div>		</li>
