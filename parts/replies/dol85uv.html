			<div class="markdown"><p>Triggers: Some types of headaches have particular triggers associated with them. Understanding these triggers exist (and may be related to the headache) can help guide people to avoid said triggers. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Stress: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bright/flickering lights: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sounds or smells: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sleep: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skipping meals: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes in weather: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Menses: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alcohol: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foods: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Airplane flights: </p>
</li>
<li>Exercise: </li>
</ol>
<p>Other specific situations</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pregnancy? A headache in the setting of pregnancy or recently having had a child may sometimes merit further evaluation. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immunocompromised? If the patient’s immune system does not function properly, a headache in the right context may merit further testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Illicit drug use? A variety of illicit drugs can lead to headaches. A particular type of headache in the context of illicit drug use (intravenous drugs, sniffing drugs, and so on) may merit further testing.</p>
</li>
<li>Head trauma? Hitting the head can cause headaches for a variety of reasons depending on someone’s age and the nature of the trauma. This is to be taken in the context of the rest of the details above. </li>
</ol>
<p>General medical questions: The questions above generally get at headaches primarily resulting from an issue in the brain or spine. Headaches can result from other issues not necessarily in the “neurologic” system. It is important to consider things other than the brain when trying to identify and prevent a headache.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>State of overall general health: Any major changes in your health around the time the headache began may provide a hint as to why the headache started.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sleep/snoring: Sleep apnea can lead to a number of other medical problems, some of which include headaches. Treatment of the sleep apnea, if present, may alleviate the headaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dental/TMJ: Problems with the teeth or muscles of the jaw can lead to headaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contraception: Using estrogen-containing contraceptives may increase the risk (in certain contexts) of developing particular types of headaches. It helps to know whether a patient takes these types of medications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relation to menstrual cycle? Some headaches occur around the time of a woman’s menstrual cycle. Usually, this is apparent to the patient, but sometimes it is not and it helps to ask the question specifically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes in exercise/weight/diet? Sometimes changes in exercise habits, fluctuations (either increase or decrease) in weight, and changes in diet can have an effect on the headache. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relation to sexual activity? There exists certain types of headaches that occur in the context of sex, both during the act itself as well as during the orgasm. </p>
</li>
<li>Changes in work or lifestyle? This sometimes gets at the presence of stressors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Headache management</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Headache diagnosis: Has anyone ever given the patient a headache diagnosis?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Symptomatic treatments: What medications does a patient use to stop a headache when it occurs? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prophylactic treatments: Has a patient tried to take medications (usually ever day regardless of whether a headache is present) to keep a headache from occurring?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative treatments (massage, acupuncture, biofeedback): Has a patient ever tried things other than medicines to help with the headache?</p>
</li>
<li>Prior work up: Has the patient ever had a CT (CAT) scan, MRI, lab testing, lumbar puncture, and so on to evaluate the headache?</li>
</ol>
<p>People addressed the topic of diagnostic studies such as CT (CAT) scans and lumbar punctures, and while these may be used in the evaluation of a headache (along with a number of other interventions such as MRIs, MR angiograms, MR venograms, and laboratory studies), a discussion of when to order a test is far beyond the scope of this question.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is beyond the scope of this question to go into the plethora of potential headache syndromes that exist and how they are treated. </p>
<p>As you can see, evaluating a headache can be painfully complex and time consuming. Sometimes, a doctor can just ask 3 or 4 questions and land on the diagnosis of migraine and be correct (simply on the basis of a migraine having unique symptoms and being very common in the population). However, other types of headaches are more elusive and require some additional probing to ensure there isn’t a need to do additional testing. </p>
<p>Apart from being annoying and sometimes debilitating, headaches sometimes represent a symptom of something larger and more concerning. Given the complexity of them, it never hurts to get a second opinion (or a first opinion) from a dedicated headache doctor for any type of headache that seems new or concerning. It might seem silly a specific subspecialty of medicine exists to address headaches, but I guess all the questions above might lend some insight into it being a pretty complex issue. </p></div>		</li>
