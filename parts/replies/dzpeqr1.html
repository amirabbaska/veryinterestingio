			<div class="markdown"><p>They do need water, almost all insects on earth need a water source of some kind(I believe some spiders/scorpions are able to get enough water from their prey).  It's kind of fascinating because if you destroy all the possible water sources within a certain location, ants can't live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can’t they get it from food though? The Fennec Fox gets almost all its water from food, and it’s an inefficient mammal, I would think an ant can get enough water from ambient moisture and food if available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup it’s 100% surface tension related. Bugs need water, and open containers of water are perfect for them. The soap lowers the surface tension, and also kills them (something to do with it dissolving their exoskeleton or something I forget). </p>
<p>Pro tip: if you have a fruit fly problem, put cheap wine into a glass with water and soap. You won’t have a problem on a few days. You can also use Apple cider vinegar, but I find cheap wine works bests. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soap dissolves the water repellant wax that coats their exoskeleton. They also have little hairs to keep water away from their bodies but when the surface tension is listed it surpasses these protection and covers their bodies. Since their breathing is through their body surface, they suffocate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So can I kill a scorpion with a soap water mixture?
I have an irrational fear of stepping on them and thinking somehow they will strike me through the sole of my shoe lol </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this works.  Last year we had a glass of wine that had been left out, forgotten about and when we came across it a day or two later, it had a load of fruit flies in it.  The cider vinegar isn't as good, but attracts them too.</p></div>		</li>
