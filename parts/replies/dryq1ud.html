			<div class="markdown"><p>The road is usually hotter than the surrounding air because it is usually dark in colour, light travels faster in hotter/thinner air so it will curve away from the road, (think of it like cars maintaining side by side in a corner, the faster car will be in the outside of the corner) and will like like a refection</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The road is warmer, so a similar effect occurs. What you're actually seeing is light from the sky/horizon bending due to the temp difference, so it's not a reflection. The opposite happens when you have a cold surface, look up Saint Elmo's fire. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of a somewhat related question. How does some water appear Crystal clear, essentially invisible, while some other waters, even though obviously clear, still can be seen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a complex mix of factors.
What you see when looking at water is a mix of the slight blue color of the water itself, the refraction of any objects/soil/particles visible through in the water, and the reflection of the sky. A brighter sky and a shallower viewing angle makes for brighter and more obscuring reflections. <a href="https://cl9r93gnrb42o3l0v1aawby1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Polarized_web.jpg" target="_blank">Polarized glasses that filter the reflections show how much difference they make</a></p>
<p>Shallow, still, clean water under a dark blue sky, seen straight down will appear almost invisible.</p>
<p>Add a viewing angle, a cloudy sky, particles in the water or greater depth, and it’ll be harder and harder to see the bottom.</p></div>		</li>
