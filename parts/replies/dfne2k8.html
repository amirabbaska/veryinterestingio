<p>We would in fact come across the occasional fire that we knew we could just let it burn or surround and drown, yet we may do a little more for practice purposes. </p>
<p>However, those extra things almost never involved making entry. The last thing we wanted to practice was dying. And entering a burning structure that you don't know for certain is structurally sound is stupid. </p>
<p>The saying is simple. &quot;Risk a little to save a little, risk a lot to save a lot.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I guess I assumed it wouldn't be practice that put you in significant danger. And now that I think about it, I definitely know my local fire department has started houses on fire for practice when they were going to be demolished anyway.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well yes, that would be the last thing you would practice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a fire, but Texas A&amp;M has a massive [fire fighting training field] (<a href="https://teex.org/Pages/about-us/teex-brayton-fire-training-field.aspx" target="_blank">https://teex.org/Pages/about-us/teex-brayton-fire-training-field.aspx</a>) with a bunch of buildings that they repel down and catch on fire and stuff. We always see fire departments from other county's in town, so I'm assuming they practice there. </p>
<p>Mike Rowe was apparently doing a new show called &quot;Somebody's got to do it&quot;, basically dirt jobs but less dirty and more difficult or dangerous. Idk if it aired or anything. I was told about this 4 years ago. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the best things is to have a Training Burn, where we can light a room of a house on fire, and put it out for practice. we continue through all the rooms, then finally let it go up. When I was going through the fire academy, we were lucky enough to have about a dozen houses to practice ventilation techniques, overhaul techniques, and finally training burns. They were all in the right-of-way where a new freeway was going in, so instead of just bulldozing the houses, they let us burn them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isnt 100%... we arent allowed to let it go. The worry is embers will spread to other homes, plus the waste products in burning homes are extremely toxic.</p></div>		</li>
