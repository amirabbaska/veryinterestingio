			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't do either, and it wasn't until I was around 10 or so that I found out others could. I am not even sure I fully understand what others mean by it but I've had enough conversations with people that can that I have a decent grasp.</p>
<p>For example if I'm looking at something I can draw it with amazing accuracy. Without it in front of me though, I can't even get close to an okay drawing. Around five year old crayon level. So they have their uses!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a voice in my head. And until reading this, I always just thought &quot;the voice in your head&quot; was a figure of speech that related to someone's conscious. </p>
<p>People really hear a voice? Does it resemble their own voice? </p>
<p>Mind you I've always considered myself more logic based than creative if that has anything to do with it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't hear anything. It just processes I guess. </p>
<p>I was specifically reading these comments and paying specific attention to if I feel like am hearing anything or it's just being input. Absolutely nothing. </p>
<p>I honestly had no idea it was different for anyone else. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you know how sometimes a fellow redditor will say &quot;you are now breathing manually&quot; and then you are and it's irritating? You have just done the reading equivalent to me. You have broken my auto-read. Thanks.</p>
<p>But hey, now you're breathing manually. Sweet, sweet revenge.</p></div>		</li>
