			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder how the level of insulin resistance interacts with this system, because I (pretty healthy I think) actually wake up totally disinterested in breakfast after a night of heavy eating and was pretty confused by this question.</p>
<p>In fact after a particularly rich feast I often find myself eating a bit less for an entire day or two afterwards. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really depends on what you eat. IIRC protein does not cause as much spikes in your BG levels as does simple carbs. Fibers also helps. So if you binge on chicken wings, chances are you'll be less hungry than if you binge on cake. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. On the weekends when I allow myself to eat essentially whatever I'm craving at the moment , I have never woken up hungry ....to the contrary, I feel quite full and satisfied still and my regular meal the following day gets pushed back hours. this is regardless of whether or not the massive meal the night before is heavier in sugar/ carbs or meat and fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See I thought you meant this was ask science and it was an eli5 response.</p>
<p>Because it is the typical health blogger thing about high carb foods and an insulin rush, which actually does not work as an explanation. As the feeling of starving in the morning after eating at night still happens with a high fat and protein meal.</p>
<p>Hormones are a more likely reason, as people often eat at the same times during the day and the body expects food, it's also why the feeling of extreme hunger often passes after a bit of time even if you don't eat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this. the feeling of hunger is much more than low blood sugar. </p>
<p>my anecdotal is eating the same time triggers your stomach to start acid production anticipating your meal, thus you &quot;feel&quot; hungry and eat. on a high fat diet you can pretty easily overcome those hunger pangs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As i understand it yes. The insulin released to deal with the glucose prevents you from using the fuel in your fat cells. If you're producing high levels of insulin by morning it still might not have left your system? so you've burned and banked what you've eaten but you can't access your reserves so you're starving. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Hrm, your body needs energy from somewhere. The energy required to move from point A to point B does not change. You can't suddenly be able to do the same amount of work with less energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In multiple aspects, this is the case. Not only because sugary things are digested quickly and have a direct relation to glucose due to the carbohydrates, but also because protein has a higher satiation effect(making you feel more full) and fat takes so long to break down that it doesn't have the huge affect on blood sugar that simple carbs do.</p></div>		</li>
