			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this:</p>
<p>When it was first proposed, the ISS was originally sold as a station that could be built up as a sort of staging station for Moon or Mars missions, among other things. </p>
<p>However, in order to make it international (and get something like 20% of the funding from the Russians) we had to place the ISS in an inclined orbit that made it useless for this task.</p>
<p>It needed to have the inclination, because Russian rockets launched from Russia, and they lacked the power to reach an equatorial orbit after starting out at such a high latitude.  That deficit being the energy lost from not being at the equator to start with, and from having to correct their inclination once in orbit.</p>
<p>So the ISS is where it is right now precisely because the Earth gives you momentum, but the Russians <em>couldn't</em> take advantage of that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You want to be in an equatorial orbit (zero degree inclination) to go to the Moon or Mars or anywhere else.  ISS is in 51.6 degree inclination.</p>
<p>Launching into a specific inclination doesn't take a lot of fuel (if you launch from the right spot on Earth), but changing it once you're already in orbit takes a lot of fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ISS is inclined at 51.6°. Now, I launch to the moon or Mars from the ISS, you now need even more energy to first cancel out that extra inclination. I don't think the reason it's not used as a staging point is solely because of the inclination, but it clearly is a factor. </p>
<p>A station to be used as a pitstop would have to be in equatorial or near equatorial orbit, just like the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you aren't perfectly lined up with the inclination of the orbit, that means your orbits have only 2 points in 3d space where they could possibly intersect. This is always (basically) the equator. If Earth had 0 axial inclination it WOULD BE the equator, but because we don't it's orbital equator is range of +/- absVal Earth's inclination. It is much harder to line a intersection with the object when you can only possibly meet in two spots. Now you have to do entire orbit calculations for both bodies to find if your next orbit can get you there within the sphere of influence (enough gravity to be the primary source of gravity). You cannot rendezvous with anything not sufficiently strong enough in gravity using this method. This ALSO MEANS there are only two locations you can decently match orbital inclinations. They are the same spots. </p>
<p>With an orbit perfectly aligned with it's target body, all you need to do is perform your calculations, and also find a ratio of yours:theirs relative to Earth. This also gives you a lot more options for finding the perfect transfer time. This kind of transfer is actually referred to as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit" target="_blank">Hohmann Transfer</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add .. the primary reason for 51.6° is so they're not firing rockets over China.  (The trajectory does actually graze a portion of Mongolia, but it's far enough downrange that they usually miss it).</p>
<p>Since Baikonur is about 46°N, the most economical inclination would be 46°.  Those extra 5° simply cost than less upsetting China.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A mission to the Moon from the ISS' orbit is possible. In fact it wouldn't require a much larger rocket either. It just makes it more difficult.</p>
<p>Going to mars from a very inclined orbit isn't much different from any other orbit since the rocket carries the momentum from Earth's motion around the sun. On interplanetary missions the only important characteristic of the craft's initial Earth orbit is that at some point the instantaneous velocity of the craft is close to tangent to Earth's orbit around the sun.</p>
<p>For example a polar orbit which stay's close to the terminator (the line separating day and night on Earth) the craft will be traveling tangent to Earth's motion around the sun when it passes over the poles.</p>
<p>If the rocket is in a polar orbit which passes over the portions of Earth which are at noon and midnight (so rotated 90 degrees from the terminator) than it is never traveling tangent to the Earth's motion around the sun and is in a bad orbit for interplanetary travel.</p>
<p>Orbits stay fixed relative to the sun, not earth, so any object in orbit around earth will eventually be in a good position to be sent to another planet. You might need to wait a few months though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However waiting for the orbit to be tangent to the planetary orbit may mean leaving at a suboptimal point with respect to the transfer window or vice versa. </p>
<p>I wouldn't have thought it likely that they would align that frequently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A gravity turn is just a way of allowing the aerodynamics of the rocket, along with gravity, to gradually turn it over to gain horizontal velocity. Modern rockets no longer have to do this as they have gimballed engines and advanced flight computers which allows them to take a more optimal and controlled ascent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note: what KSP players call a &quot;gravity turn&quot; is actually a controlled ascent curve; you'll typically use a gimballed engine and some aerodynamic surfaces  because the flight/physics model in KSP doesn't quite match the real world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the gravity turn is the mid atmospheric shift from vertical acceleration to lateral acceleration. As you know from KSP, orbital velocity is lateral velocity, but it's important to get into the thinner atmosphere before burning laterally to reduce the losses from drag and gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some great responses here. I'm going to answer very directly- no, a gravity turn is about the shape of the ascent. You can absolutely do a gravity turn launching north, south, or west. A gravity turn in those directions is the most efficient way to launch in those directions, though less efficient than an eastward gravity turn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The above answers the earth's rotation benefit.  Adding to that concerning your earth's orbit benefit question, the answer is yes also.  When we launch a mission to someplace like another planet, the satellite also has the initial prograde orbit velocity the earth has while orbiting the sun.  We accelerate the satellite from it's earth's orbit in a direction close to the same prograde direction as the earth's orbit around the sun, requiring less fuel for it to reach escape velocity from the earth, and also causing the satellite to start increasing it's orbital distance from the sun. This is the usual initial method used for missions to the outer planets (Mars and beyond).  For missions to Venus or Mercury which are in orbits closer to the sun, we would make the acceleration retrograde the the earth's orbit around the sun.  We need to slow down the satellite's orbital speed around the sun so it will &quot;fall&quot; into a lower orbit around the sun to intercept the Venus or Mercury orbits.  Various combinations of the two methods can be used for missions that need to leave an orbit around the earth and escape earth's gravity to go to other celestial destinations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the nice thing about orbital mechanics is that it's all very easy to predict because space is mostly empty and everything takes a really long time. Newton's law of gravity is all you need.</p>
<p>Now just because it's easy to predict doesn't make it easy. How to do thing with the minimum amount of fuel is where the difficulty lies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its actually not too hard. I wrote a program in Kerbal Space Program using KOS mod(Basically an operating system) to launch into a circular orbit (Real solar system so basically near realistic.) ~400 lines of code to get a near circular orbit within 0.1% of my target orbit. Some of the math(Altitude and such) is baked and it uses the baked gimbal controls so some of it is a bit cheaty. Real rockets have a lot more math to do but overall the math itself is simple.</p>
<p>If rocket science and orbital mechanics interest you, I recommend picking up KSP. Most of it you can eyeball and get really close.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it would be impossibly difficult for a human to do, but after playing KSP for a few hundred hours, I can eyeball the transfer windows and manually pilot the craft the entire way without any help from maneuver nodes. The only thing you really need is the orbital paths and closest approaches to be visible, but in real life this can easily be done with a few instruments and math on paper. Real life has less of a delta V budget (less fuel), but this just means they have less flexibility and need to plan things out more.</p></div>		</li>
