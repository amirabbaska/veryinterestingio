			<div class="markdown"><p>I was unclear. When I said light/dark colours, I did not mean different colours, just different shapes of the same colour. So if you had something painted something vanta black (the darkest black ever produced), it is so dark because it absorbs all but 0.035% of light. But if you had a dark grey, it would absorb less light.</p>
<p>(This is also the reason why white cars are cooler than black cars, because light carries heat which white reflects but black absorbs.)</p>
<p>As for shiny/matte, I not to sure to be honest. Through the small amount of research I have done to answer you, I have concluded it has something to do with index refraction. Maybe this can help you start your own research on the topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shininess has to do with how CONSISTENTLY a material reflects whatever portion of light it does reflect, causing you to be able to make out intact images, such as the light sources in the room, which appear as spectral &quot;shines.&quot;</p>
<p>Shiny black = reflects few photons, but when it does, they follow angles that are highly predictable from their incoming angles</p>
<p>Matte black = reflects few photons, and also scatters those photons it does reflect fairly randomly.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes when talking about shiny, black things, you have a situation such as a matte black thing UNDERneath a glass or plastic coating, which is a whole different composite situation that can't be described based on the properties of a single material, because it's not. It might have aspects of both, because the glass is coherently reflecting some light for shines, and the part underneath is then also scattering light that reaches it, etc. The above refers to singular homogenous materials only.</p></div>		</li>
