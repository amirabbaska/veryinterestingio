			<div class="markdown"><p>Traveling through Arab countries, you get used to negotiating the price of everything, from an apple to a full dinner. You also have to expect that they'll overcharge you for being a foreigner (which translates to 'rich' in many of those places), so it's even more important. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you can't exactly travel abroad on a low-income...</p>
<p>Edit: I was thinking of low income people who live paycheck to paycheck and can't afford to save money for international travel. Some people are replying with examples of a <em>low travel budget</em>, that's not the same as low income. If you can afford an airline ticket, hotels, food, attractions, and other common travel costs, then the guy selling you a souvenir isn't going to think you're poor if you've made it all the way to them and still want to spend money on more stuff. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Your ass ain't showing me a price tag, a sales catalogue, or a rewards account but you still expect me to take your word for the price of the product? And then you bitch at me saying you'll never come back again? The fuck do you want me to do, trust every person who comes in this store expecting the same shit? At least everyone else can put in a fucking number or respect the price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in the US and I was trying to buy an $8 item at a clothing store in the mall. I go to the register and try to use a card. They tell me they only take cash. I had $3 in my pocket and I said &quot;sorry I only have $3 cash&quot;. To my surprise they said $3 is fine, and plugged the new price into the register. </p>
<p>I was shocked! Now I know... clothing prices can be negotiable at local shops (probably not at retail chains). Too bad I'd be too embarrassed to ever intentionally haggle at one!</p></div>		</li>
