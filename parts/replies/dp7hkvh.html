			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good explaination. Thank you. But is there answer to the last part? Can you &quot;force&quot; an allergy onto someone? Say, by introducing a pollen into the system with the flu on it. Would your body associate the pollen with that flu virus and mislabel it as a threat? </p>
<p>That was just an extra part I was curious about.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's possible. Maybe. Sometimes. But what you are describing is the very cutting edge of immunoncology - they are trying to force people's immune systems to attack their own cancers. And it's not easy, as a bunch of failed biotech companies can attest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. So what your saying is one the ways they've tried to fight cancer is by attempting to make the immune system recognize it? By having it associate the cancer with someone it already knows is bad? That definitely makes sense as something to try. Do you know how they went about that? Or have an article? (Sorry for the constant questions, this stuff is fascinating to learn)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can certainly induce allergies in mice in the lab. Repeated injections of an allergen (plus a stimulant called an adjuvant) will cause a mouse to become allergic to the allergen. This is called an allergen challenge model and it's commonly used to study asthma. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, actually. This is how I became allergic to red meat from a bite from the lone-star tick. The tick injects alpha-gal into the host's bloodstream, and the host's immune system recognizes &quot;foreign invader&quot;, attacks and develops more killer cells. </p>
<p>Alpha-gal is a protein found in red meats, and as such, anytime I ate meat for a few years, I would have an allergic reaction, and puke everything up in addition to general nausea and rash for a day or so. </p>
<p>Nasty stuff. Interesting, but nasty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost 4 years with alpha-gal here and talked to another friend who had had it longer (and more severely) than I do. I recently saw him eating some pork and I was like &quot;Yo wtf are you doing?!&quot; and he had read about slowly reintroducing it and easing back into it. He said he still hasn't tried eating an entire steak or pork chop or anything, but can eat decent amounts and hasn't had a single problem. Since then I decided to try it, ate a tiny tiny morsel of sausage from a friends pizza, then a small bite of chorizo a few days later. I've now tried slowly increasing amounts 6 different times and have had no issues. I'm taking it very very slowly, but thought you'd like to hear that it's apparently going away some for me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, by introducing significant quantities of foreign contaminants. </p>
<p>Personal story: Growing up, I never had any allergies except those every infant has. Towards the end of high school I took a summer job working lawn care and irrigation. In those hot, dry summers dumb kid, me, doesn't think to wear a dust mask. Needless to say my sinuses got pretty clogged on the daily. After about two months I started having allergic reactions to the slightest amount of pollen and dust and as bonus my immune system threw in pet dander.</p>
<p>Although it may be correlation not causation, it makes sense that rushing abnormally large amounts of allergens into a system repeatedly may trigger an allergic response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It happened to me too. When I was 16 I ate over 30 shrimp in one sitting and less than an hour later I had hives all over my body. Now I'm allergic and can't even have a sliver without breaking out. I suppose that's one thing that's better in moderation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That happened to me. Before babies, dairy was off limits for me. But then while pregnant I could only keep toast and smoothies down, so dairy was slowly reintroduced. I had 4.5 glorious years of eating a ton of dairy products. Then my second baby was born, and I've had all sorts of very severe symptoms. Tested for a bunch of stuff. Turns out it's lactose intolerance. NOOOO!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anaphylaxis is your body being a little too gung-ho about raising the alarm on what it perceives as a threat, or the allergen in this case. One part of your body releases chemicals to alert the rest of your body that there is an intruder. In anaphylaxis, your body releases too many of the chemicals in a short period of time.</p>
<p>These chemicals cause all sorts of havoc in sudden, large quantities. They make blood vessels in your body widen which leads to a blood pressure drop, while also causing the muscles you use to breath contract which means you can't get normal gas exchange in the lungs. </p>
<p>So in short, anaphylaxis is your body being a bit overdramatic and spiraling itself out of control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a woman here in Minneapolis who randomly developed a severe form of allergy- Mast-Cell Activation Syndrome. Her particular case is so bad that she can only eat one meal now without going into anaphylaxis, and the medications she takes trigger reactions. They’ve tried everything. It’s a pretty heartbreaking story. If you read her story on Caring Bridge, it’s very sad but also very interesting.</p>
