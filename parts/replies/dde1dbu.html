			<div class="markdown"><p>Hardness plays a factor in sharpness.. but things can be hard and not very sharp. Friction actually plays a role too. However, the main driving force of sharpness is ratio of amount of pressure applied to the surface area of the cutting edge. When you sharpen a knife, you're changing that ratio. </p>
<p>Basically, when you sharpen something, you're decreasing the size and width of that edge of blade, but applying the same force. That same force gets directed to a smaller surface area than before you sharpened it. This means that there is more energy being directed to a smaller surface area, allowing you to break whichever intermolecular forces are holding the object together (this is where hardness and friction play in). </p>
<p>Think of the difference between walking in deep snow with snow shoes vs regular shoes. In both scenarios you weigh the same, so the force doesn't change. It's the surface area that changes. Snow shoes have a large surface area, so you don't &quot;cut&quot; through the snow as much. Regular shoes have small surface area, so you &quot;cut&quot; through the snow a lot easier and deeper. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, but to be a bit nit picky. You liken metals and glasses commenting how basically all materials are a repeating unit. This is only true for crystalline materials. A glass is amorphous, and there isnt long-range order like that found in crystals where a a unit repeats. In glass the molecules are somewhat randomly dispersed and you can only find short range order.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, and often simplifying the situation is useful to explain it (e.g. the electron shells you learn about in high school are nothing like the orbitals, but that difference is more subtle and unintuitive). </p>
<p>In this case, likening glass to crystalline structure is just plain wrong and doesn't change the explanation particularly. Glass being amorphous is fundamentally what it means to be a glass and so it would be much better to liken glass to a liquid, or to omit mention or it completely </p></div>		</li>

<p>This answer has some nice ELI5 explanations, but misses the actual mechanism of how cutting with scissors works.</p>
<p>Easier in point form I think:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scissors are a simple type of lever, which you apply force from the handle and it transfers to the blade</li>
<li>The cutting region of the blade comes to a point, and is small in area</li>
<li>By squeezing the pointed blades together, you create a very high level of pressure (<em>high pressure</em>, because Pressure = (Force/Area). The area is very small, so the pressure is large).</li>
<li>The high pressure at the paper surface creates <em>Shear Strain</em></li>
<li><strong>Shear Strain</strong> is exactly how it soundsâ€¦ Shearing/cutting happens once the paper material has been stretched past its limit. The limit is determined by the bond strength, which u/BreadPresident mentioned well. </li>
</ul>
<p>TL;DR Scissors create a region on the cutting blade which is high pressure. THe high pressure pushes on the paper, and overcomes the internal force holding the paper together itself.</p></div>		</li>
