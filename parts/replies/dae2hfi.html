<p>They would likely have ample time to exchange their notes, in contrast to the general public. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This touches on the reason this is so effective. It was a <em>complete</em> surprise. Like, one of Modi's minister's offhandedly mentioned the possibility of something similar a few months ago, but beyond that they did an extremely good job keeping it under wraps until the sudden announcement. There have been scattered reports of early leaks, but they're fairly limited in scope.  </p>
<p>It's still not foolproof, as it's possible to others to exchange your money for you. Like, rather than do it yourself you can pay twenty other people to exchange smaller portions of your money. But at the same time that's twenty people you need not to turn you in, so it can be quite difficult to do successfully. Not impossible, just difficult. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for another question, but is this a precursor to a larger anti-graft agenda? </p>
<p>I mean, if no other changes are implemented, criminals and corrupt officials can still horde small bills, too. </p></div>		</li>
