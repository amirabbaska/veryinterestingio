			<div class="markdown"><p>We've moved away from the idea of relativistic mass, because it's generally a more confusing way of thinking about it.</p>
<p>It's better to think of the mass as invariant, but it's the equations of motion that change. So instead of F=ma, we have F=(X)ma where (X) is a quantity that depends on the velocity. If the acceleration and force are in the same direction, then I think (X) is the Lorentz factor cubed.</p>
<p>Similarly for momentum, instead of p=mv, we have p=(gamma)mv, where gamma=1/sqrt(1-v^(2)/c^(2)). So momentum does have a Lorentz factor to it, and we keep the masses the same. This is compatible with the velocity addition formula, if you go through the math.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's interesting.  Does an observer of a relativistically moving object 'feel' the gravity of the object's rest mass or its lorenz-adjusted mass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok.  Say you're an observer at point B.  Object A is approaching you at speed u, and object C is aproaching you at speed v.  Both speeds are around 0.9 c.</p>
<p>Assuming you survive observing the collision (you dodged at the last second and are well-shielded against the released energy), what were the momenta of A and C from each observer A, B, and C?  Does p(A from C) = p(C from A) = p(A from B)+p(C from B)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's call the spaceship &quot;frame 1&quot; and Earth &quot;frame 2&quot;. We're interested in how something looks like it's moving for someone in frame 2 vs. for someone in frame 1. Then:</p>
<p>u: The velocity of that frame 1 is moving with respect to frame 2. In this case, it's the velocity of the spaceship, so u=0.5c. </p>
<p>v: The velocity of the object of interest in frame 1. In this case it is light, which has v=c.</p>
<p>w: The velocity of the object of interest in frame 2. </p>
<p>You can plug in u and v to solve for w:</p>
<p>w = (u + v) / (1 + (uv) / c^2 )</p>
<p>w= (0.5c + c) / (1 + (.5c)*c /c^2 )</p>
<p>w=1.5c/(1+.5) = c</p>
<p>As expected, the speed of light still moves at the speed of light regardless of the frame you're in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you need a refresher, check out the Lorentz transform. If we assume that light travels with a velocity of c, and if we assume a basic concept that inertial frames are relative, this formula has to be the one that adds velocities or passively translates inertial frames.</p></div>		</li>
