			<div class="markdown"><p>Norman French did become mainstream.  Old English is essentially German, it is entirely incomprehensible to modern English speakers.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K13GJkGvDw" target="_blank">Listen to Beowolf in Old English</a>, you might pick out a few words if you know the tale.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_French_origin" target="_blank">45% of modern English words originate in Norman French</a>  French became mainstream, Old English stayed mainstream.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, it really isn't. By that standard, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic and Frisian are 'essentially German'.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Popular= populaire
Language= langage
Reason=raison
Intelligent= intelligent
Stupid= stupide </p>
<p>Theres actually a peculiarity where uncooked animals are called their old English names :cow and pig. But once they are cooked we use the French words; beef and pork (boeuf et porc). It's because the poor people spoke old English and they handled the animals when they were alive, but only the rich who spoke French could afford to eat meat, which they referred to in French. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This particular phrase is actually more modern than that. The correct answer is further down the page.  You can tell, because &quot;excuse&quot; is one of those words that entered English via Norman French -- amongst many other reasons that this phrase would be totally unintelligible during the time period you are referring to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is absolutely <strong>not true</strong>, and I'm astonished that nearly 300 people have upvoted this.</p>
<p>Edit: Holy hell. Now close to 600. This is such a wild distortion and misunderstanding of history, it makes my balls feel like they're receding into my body.</p>
<p>Edit 2: From my response below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's set aside the fact that there's not one credible source to verify this point about Norman French. The logic itself is wholly unsustainable. The Norman Conquest introduced a new elite culture and language to England, and the thought of the Normans or their cultural sympathizers apologizing to anyone for their language is completely absurd. Theirs was the elite culture. Theirs was the elite language. They did not possess the 21st-century sensibilities that would compel us to seek cultural intelligibility, or that would compel us to exercise our modern type of civility and concern for another person's social comforts.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The top comment on eli5 is almost never true. The sub does a good job voting up answers that are written at a &quot;5 year old&quot; level, but a terrible job filtering out wrong answers. The problem is almost none of the people voting knows whether any of the answers are true, and no one demands any evidence out sources for anything. </p>
