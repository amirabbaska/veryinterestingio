<p>you can just move away from the black hole and continue</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If what <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/f1lgu/what_would_happen_if_the_event_horizons_of_two/c1cuiyw" target="_blank">/u/RobotRollCall said 5 years ago is accurate</a>, this is pretty much impossible</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine, just for a moment, that you are aboard a spaceship equipped with a magical engine capable of accelerating you to any arbitrarily high velocity. This is absolutely and utterly impossible, but it turns out it'll be okay, for reasons you'll see in a second.</p>
<p>Because you know your engine can push you faster than the speed of light, you have no fear of black holes. In the interest of scientific curiosity, you allow yourself to fall through the event horizon of one. And not just any black hole, but rather a carefully chosen one, one sufficiently massive that its event horizon lies quite far from its center. This is so you'll have plenty of time between crossing the event horizon and approaching the region of insane gravitational gradient near the center to make your observations and escape again.</p>
<p>As you fall toward the black hole, you notice some things which strike you as highly unusual, but because you know your general relativity they do not shock or frighten you. First, the stars behind you — that is, in the direction that points away from the black hole — grow much brighter. The light from those stars, falling in toward the black hole, is being blue-shifted by the gravitation; light that was formerly too dim to see, in the deep infrared, is boosted to the point of visibility.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the black patch of sky that is the event horizon seems to <em>grow</em> strangely. You know from basic geometry that, at this distance, the black hole should subtend about a half a degree of your view — it should, in other words, be about the same size as the full moon as seen from the surface of the Earth. Except it isn't. In fact, it fills half your view. Half of the sky, from notional horizon to notional horizon, is pure, empty blackness. And <em>all</em> the other stars, nearly the whole sky full of stars, are crowded into the hemisphere that lies behind you.</p>
<p>As you continue to fall, the event horizon opens up beneath you, so you feel as if you're descending into a featureless black bowl. Meanwhile, the stars become more and more crowded into a circular region of sky centered on the point immediately aft. The event horizon does not <em>obscure</em> the stars; you can watch a star just at the edge of the event horizon for as long as you like and you'll never see it slip behind the black hole. Rather, the field of view through which you see the rest of the universe gets smaller and smaller, as if you're experiencing tunnel-vision.</p>
<p>Finally, just before you're about to cross the event horizon, you see the entire rest of the observable universe contract to a single, brilliant point immediately behind you. If you train your telescope on that point, you'll see not only the light from all the stars and galaxies, but also a curious dim red glow. This is the cosmic microwave background, boosted to visibility by the intense gravitation of the black hole.</p>
<p>And then the point goes out. All at once, as if God turned off the switch.</p>
<p>You have crossed the event horizon of the black hole.</p>
<p>Focusing on the task at hand, knowing that you have limited time before you must fire up your magical spaceship engine and escape the black hole, you turn to your observations. Except you don't see anything. No light is falling on any of your telescopes. The view out your windows is blacker than mere black; you are looking at non-existence. There is <em>nothing</em> to see, <em>nothing</em> to observe.</p>
<p>You know that somewhere ahead of you lies the singularity … or at least, whatever the universe deems fit to exist at the point where our mathematics fails. But you have no way of observing it. Your mission is a failure.</p>
<p>Disappointed, you decide to end your adventure. You attempt to turn your ship around, such that your magical engine is pointing toward the singularity and so you can thrust yourself away at whatever arbitrarily high velocity is necessary to escape the black hole's hellish gravitation. But you are thwarted.</p>
<p>Your spaceship has sensitive instruments that are designed to detect the gradient of gravitation, so you can orient yourself. These instruments should point straight toward the singularity, allowing you to point your ship in the right direction to escape. Except the instruments are going haywire. They seem to indicate that the singularity lies <em>all around you.</em> In <em>every</em> direction, the gradient of gravitation increases. If you are to believe your instruments, you are at the point of lowest gravitation inside the event horizon, and every direction points &quot;downhill&quot; toward the center of the black hole. So <em>any direction you thrust your spaceship</em> will push you closer to the singularity and your death.</p>
<p>This is clearly nonsense. You cannot believe what your instruments are telling you. It must be a malfunction.</p>
<p>But it isn't. It's the absolute, literal truth. Inside the event horizon of a black hole, there <em>is</em> no way out. There are no directions of space that point away from the singularity. Due to the Lovecraftian curvature of spacetime within the event horizon, all the trajectories that <em>would</em> carry you away from the black hole now point into the past.</p>
<p>In fact, this is the definition of the event horizon. It's the boundary separating points in space where there <em>are</em> trajectories that point away from the black hole from points in space where there are none.</p>
<p>Your magical infinitely-accelerating engine is of no use to you … because you cannot find a direction in which to point it. The singularity is all around you, in every direction you look.</p>
<p>And it is getting closer.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>while I like how clear the setup of this is, the concept that this infinitely accelerating ship can exist breaks how black holes work.  The entire reason why there are no trajectories out of a black hole is because when limited to the speed of light, all trajectories curve back towards the center too quickly to escape the event horizon, but if physics did allow an object to reach infinite speed, then there would be no curvature to any maximized trajectories because assuming you were travelling infinitely fast, the effect of massive bodies, which have a finite mass and therefore finite maximum gravitational pull, would have literally zero effect on the trajectory.  In a world where this magical ship could exist, the blackness inside the event horizon would still be real because light can't tap into your magical speed force, and your instrumentation might still have trouble if the instrumentation can't take faster than light speed velocities into effect, but in reality, virtually any direction you point the ship and punch the throttle, you would get out.  I suppose there is the absolute tiny singularity in the center of the black hole that you would have the ever so slight possibility of colliding with, and who knows what happens when something touches the singularity, but other than that, you would fly right out of the black hole back into normal space.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. I've seen that guy's silly theory of how you can't escape before; it's complete bs.</p>
<p>Being able to go faster than light and being inside a black hole's event horizon are two things we've never experienced. How could we possibly know how those conditions would work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to point out that while you can't go back in time, you could certainly change certain decisions. </p>
<p>Like let's say you have a baby in high school. Pop that bad boy into the black hole for awhile. Go back, get new friends, finish high school, maybe get a degree, find mr or mrs right, settle down, buy a nice little place in the suburbs. </p>
<p>Then, pull the baby out of the black hole. Now baby has a mommy or daddy who is 26 instead of 16 and he's only aged 3 hours since you put him in there. </p>
<p>Bam. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can totally wrap my head around the appearance of time dialation; light moves slower, so you perceive things slower... but how the hell can gravity extend our lifespan? Or, apparently, allow us to experience the world much faster (though it appears the same to us, if you don't look outwards) How does it slow our heart beat, our blood flow, the gears in a watch; all from gravity? What would happen if you had a rope from inside the black hole that connected to earth? Would the rope just hit itself in the black hole, since it's moving so slowly it's acting like a stationary object, no matter how much you shake it? </p>
<p>I really hope this is some crazy, barely understood theory because my mind is melting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: damn reddit you sure love giving hugs. Thanks all!</p>
<p>Edit 2: ...actually she's a lovely women. My wife and I just bought her and my father in law an Alaskan cruise for their anniversary. She's honestly the sweetest women I've ever met. She is an incredible grandmother and a total saint. Truly an unsung hero. </p>
<p>The joke was right there. Had to. Still, I can't bare to speak I'll of her lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that just means that his mother causes a local time distortion that causes the rest of time to move at normal pace while time near her is sped up, which from his perspective looks like the rest of the time moves slowly. For science we should throw his mother in law in a black hole and see if the effects cancel each other, maybe propelling all the trapped matter in the black hole back out into space. </p></div>		</li>
