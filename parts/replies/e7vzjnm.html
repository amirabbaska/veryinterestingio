			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the way those numbers are calculated, this is true. I think it's kind of misleading to say we are 50% similar to a banana, though. Consider this: the banana genome is about 500 megabases, while the human genome is 3 gigabases. So how is a genome only 17% the size of another one and yet 50% similar? Even if the entire banana genome perfectly matches part of the human genome, wouldn't that only be 17% (1/6) similar? There's a term in biology called &quot;orthology&quot; which means &quot;these sequences are descended from the same sequence in a common ancestor.&quot; There are programs that can compare two genes, or entire genomes, and determine their orthology. So when they say we're 50% similar to a banana, what they really mean is that the orthologous sequences between the human and banana genome are 50% similar. There's still a lot of sequence in both genomes that are not orthologous and not included in that number. It's kind of like if you took two identical red cars, replaced one of the doors on one of them with a green door, and then attached a fighter jet to it and said &quot;look these are almost identical, the only difference is the green door&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That 1% difference is also not including the standard variations in genomes. There's more than a 1% difference between men and women genetically. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you elaborate on that?</p>
<p>I wanted to ask the follow up question of the percentages I think I remember reading between different human ethnies. Iirc closer to 3, 4,5 percent.</p>
<p>Then the 5 percent that a lot of us inherited from Neanderthal.</p>
<p>Are these numbers all tied? I kinda assumed the inter species ones were what one would expect, and the inter species based on the 1% specific to humans (ie 4% of the 1%, or 0.04%, was what should really be understood there)</p>
<p>And since I'm on it, male Vs. Female: how much of that is<em> just</em> the swapped X and Y?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just regarding the percentages on the X and Y chromosomes...</p>
<p>The most recent human reference genome is GRCh38.p12 (Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38 patch release 12). You can see the number of basepairs in each chromosome <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=human[organism]" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>The size of the human genome (haploid, 1 copy of each chromosome) is 3,257 million basepairs. The size of the X chromosome is 156 Mbp and that of the Y (male) chromosome is 57 Mbp. So 1..8% (57/3,257) of the male (XY) genome is unique.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even so, that 1% figure is very contentious. Some genes or gene groups get duplicated, others get shuffled around, other have small modifications that may or may not be significant. You can't literally compare them letter by letter (or even codon by codon) to come up with that number. It depends on how you're counting.</p></div>		</li>
