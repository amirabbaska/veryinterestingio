			<div class="markdown"><p>Black holes place a lot of matter in a very small amount of space. This has the effect of bending space time dramatically. It's so dramatic that at the event horizon, the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light. Meaning you would have to go faster than light to leave the black hole.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you could dangle a rope past the event horizon, could someone on the other side use it to climb out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You shouldn't worry about those either, but for different reasons.  First, any black hole created in a lab is predicted to decay almost instantly via Hawking radiation, but if it turns out that this decay doesn't happen, the black hole will have an event horizon so small that it'll be extremely difficult for particles to fall into it, even if we tried to make it happen, and not enough gravity to pull particles towards it beyond a truly miniscule radius (way smaller than the radius of a proton), plus the black hole would also be travelling at well above 11km/s as a side-effect of how it was created (smashing atoms into each other at near the speed of light), so it's going to go shooting off into space, never to be seen again if it doesn't decay first, and as a final point, if high-energy collisions in particle accelerators can create black holes, then so can high-energy collisions from cosmic rays, the energy of some of which vastly exceeds what we can create in particle accelerators, so the fact that the Earth is still here after billions of years of being bombarded by these extremely high energy cosmic rays indicates that black holes from labs are nothing to worry about, because either they can't be created or they're harmless when they are created.</p></div>		</li>
