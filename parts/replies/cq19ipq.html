			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you just go to an animal shelter and request a dog to go out walking with?</p>
<p>I did not know this but it sounds like something more people should be aware of, and an incredibly nice thing to do.  Dogs love walks and taking out a poor dog waiting to be adopted is just - profoundly nice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In college, one of my professors gave us extra credit if we went to the local dog shelter and volunteered to walk the dogs. The shelter owner/manager was friends with the prof so they worked out a deal. Volunteering was free and you just had to show ID and mention the prof who would then be notified over which student volunteered.</p>
<p>The shelter was understaffed so some dogs weren't walked as often as they should have. Shelter gets some free help, the prof does something nice for the dogs and helps his friend out and we got extra credit and got to walk the dogs. Everybody wins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's nice. You have to pay $25 every 6 months and go to a training class to walk dogs at my local shelter. Only reason I haven't been back in 2 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We could at that shelter :) you had to give your information, pay 10euros and then you got a card. This card allowed you to take one dog of your choice for a walk every day you wanted for an hour (so everybody could walk dogs, but on slow days you could go 2 times a day). so the shelter made some money, dogs got walks, people got happy and some exercise and some dogs even got adopted by the people who walked them :) then after a year you get a new card, pay 10euros and of you go :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going to pet shelters and donating your time for a great reason is also a wonderful way to make new friends. I even dated a girl for 3 years who i met at the shelter. Weve since broken up because she cheated on me but some of my fondest memories (adopting my sheltie, Maggie, meeting my now ex, etc.) came from that shelter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great story, but fuck that woman not wanting to pay €130 to get her dog back.  I'd move mountains to get my pet back if it went AWOL, €130 is a bargain.  Glad Neo got adopted, and hopefully by someone who will love him properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was little, some punks let our dog out of our yard while we were staying out late with family, we kept looking for her for a long time, and followed a lead that the shelter had her. Sure enough, they did. I was young enough that I don't know what the price was, but we couldn't afford to get her back. I could tell by the look on my dad's face when he came back that it was something he wasn't proud of, and didn't want to talk about. There was a lot of stuff that we had to live without, but we couldn't get her back. It's hard to describe all the feelings that go with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctely she did want the dog back, but didn't want to pay for it 'because it was her dog'. By then Neo had been at the shelter for 3-4 weeks, and she only threatend to sue the shelter and made a facebook-group complaining about how they wouldn't just give her the dog. Of course the shelter still had to get payed for the food, vaccines and stay. So in the end I'm actually really happy he got adopted by people who really cared foe him :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly? Most of the lower and lower middle class. Pretty much any class that doesn't have an excess of income after expenditures.</p>
<p>I used to be there a few years ago, and had the good fortune to not have my cat get sick or need expensive grooming (although I had to do much more on that end). I could afford food, litter, and catnip, but that's it.</p>
<p>Now I just dropped 80 quid paying for her to get groomed, shampooed and just a general once over. She looks and feels like a million bucks, but three years ago that would have broken my very tightly budgeted bank account. It was VERY irresponsible of me, as if she'd gotten sick or her fur gotten matted or anything else, I would not have been able to handle it, but as I lived alone at the time, I was desperate to have another living being in the house.</p>
<p>Not saying what she did was right, but that's possibly why.</p></div>		</li>
