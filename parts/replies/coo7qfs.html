			<div class="markdown"><p>Law basically extends as far as you can enforce it.</p>
<p>If a government can't go up there and get you, then you can basically do what you want.</p>
<p>When on the ground however, or in the air able to be shot down by missiles and fighter jets, claims of laws not applying to you because you'll be in space, or because you're subject to some international law, won't carry much weight.</p></div>		</li>

But would they enforce it? If I was involved in launching people that violated space law but not American law would America care?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think in the Netherlands they allow you to give terminally ill patients the means to kill themselves. Problem is: these are healthy people. If I give a person a poison that will kill him a week later then it is irrelevant to the law in which jurisdiction the actual death happened. So I think the act of sending them off while knowing they won't make it for very long is illegal. It all depends on how believable they can act as if they thought people had a chance of growing old in their station.</p></div>		</li>
