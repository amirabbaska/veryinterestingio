			<div class="markdown"><p>I can attest to this.  I studied in Beijing back in winter/spring of 2008 and when i first arrived, i thought it weird that during the day the clouds were basically a blanket that dimmed the sun.  I later found out that this was smog.  During my time there, I found myself coughing up black particulate matter pretty frequently.  The final thing for me was eating at a restaurant that was next door to a coal fired powerplant...in the middle of the city.  There is very little zoning.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's kinda not exactly saying it how it is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Winter, you certainly can regularly see numbers up to and above 1000. No, not across <em>all</em> China, not in the desert, not in the far mountains, not in the deep woods but in most densely populated cities you certain can, where people live and are affected by millions. </p>
<p>No one has to take my word for it, <a href="http://aqicn.org/city/beijing/" target="_blank">they can see for themselves</a></p>
<p>Frankly, 1000 is an arbitrary number in this argument. Anything over 150 is criminal negligence on the part of the government.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trust me. I live in Shanghai so I understand what you are talking about. </p>
<p>But don't lie to people and say that the number 1,000 in China regularly. That distorts how it actually is. </p></div>		</li>
