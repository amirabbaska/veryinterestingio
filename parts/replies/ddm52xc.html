			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true! Raw chicken &amp; eggs are a great place for salmonella, but as long as you clean your hands after using them and cook them thoroughly there is very low risk at catching it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats true, but you have to keep in mind that we are handeling food and wash our hands regularly.</p>
<p>Plus:
We don't stick our hands into people, so we don't have as big a chance to make anyone septic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but that is sort of a false equivalence isn't it? On the spectrum of risk those two things aren't close to each other at all. </p>
<p>A bare hand inside the human body is likely to cause serious infections that could easily kill you, a bare hand on a sandwich just isn't the same risk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this, gloves are only sanitary when you put them on. Oh you forgot something in the refridgerator, the moment you touch the handle your gloves have more germs. Oh you need to rinse the vegetables the moment you touch the water handle germs. People are more aware and likely to wash their hands more regularly when not wearing gloves. </p></div>		</li>
