			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a lot more challenging for adults to get diagnosed than it is for children, for several reasons. One is that it’s harder to find providers who are qualified to make a diagnosis. And the other that most of our diagnostic tools have been developed for children. All people - autistic or not - grow and develop with age, so of course autistic adults don’t act like we expect autistic children to act. They have often come up with many important life skills and coping mechanisms that make diagnosis challenging. It is possible, though, to get a diagnosis as an adult. You basically have to start by finding someone in your area who is willing to do adult diagnoses. He have a whole section about adult diagnosis on our AASPIRE Healthcare Toolkit - it doesn’t have all the answers, but I hope it helps. <a href="https://autismandhealth.org/?a=pt&p=detail&t=pt\_aut&theme=ltlc&size=small&s=aut\_dx" target="_blank">https://autismandhealth.org/?a=pt&p=detail&t=pt\_aut&theme=ltlc&size=small&s=aut\_dx</a></p></div>		</li>
