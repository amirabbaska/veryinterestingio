			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer, in my experience. I've been meditating constantly for a couple of years now, and what I've noticed is that if I just watch my sadness, or my thoughts, without getting too involved in them (Identifying with it, believing the story my thoughts tell me), they then to pass right through. This works with apathy, grief, fear, anger, etc. Any negative emotion, I can get rid off by just watching them, and letting them be there. When I try to fight them, and try to push them away, they stick. It's so counter intuitive but it works. </p>
<p>TLDR: When you want to change your emotions = they persist. When you just allow them to be, and accept them, and even dive deep into them and experience it fully, they pass right through!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed! It's amazing how your reality shifts when you start becoming the observer rather than the subject. Perhaps the most useful skill I've learned. Applicable to every moment! </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've cured my anxiety with this. For about a week I couldn't breath right, not knowing why. I just couldn't take a deep breath. One day I just settled down to meditate and suddenly all this anxiety just rushed up.  It was intense, but as I just watched it, I had a strange experience where the extreme anxiety was there, but then there was me, just witnessing it. It got worse and worse, but it didn't effect me. Then it just left all of a sudden and I was left with this extreme sense of peace that I've never felt before. This is what really got me hooked. And my breathing was normal right after wards!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! That's great to hear. To share my resources I'll share the path that brought me to that book. </p>
<p>So I was introduced to this whole realm of mindfulness through the Duncan Trussle Family Hour podcast interestingly enough! I think he's hilarious and his shows bring some refreshing energy, comedy, and darkness to typical mindfulness lectures or dharma talks.

<p>DTFH introduced me to Ram Dass' teachings which are based in Hinduism. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>His lectures are shared at the below website. One titled &quot;Zooming Out &quot; had a huge impact on me in a time when I really needed it. I'll try to find the link and add it here.
<a href="https://www.ramdass.org/teachings/" target="_blank">https://www.ramdass.org/teachings/</a></p>
</li>
<li>His book Be Here Now introduces his story as a Harvard Professor of Psychology trying to find a way to soberly reach the places in the mind the psychedelics bring you and finally finding a guru in India who taught him. It shares amazing artistic renderings of aphorisms inspired by his guru, parallels between the worlds religions, instructions on how to practice Ashtanga yoga, and references to many other mindfulness resources. Definitely need the hard copy to fully appreciate and read the artistic renderings.

</ul>
<p>Duncan helped all the Ram Dass related teachers build a podcast network. <a href="https://www.mindpodnetwork.com" target="_blank">https://www.mindpodnetwork.com</a></p>
<p>Jack Kornfield and Joseph Goldstein are the teachers I always gravitate back to. They were partially responsible for bringing Vipassana to the west. They have great books available and podcasts on the Mindpod network. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They started Insight Meditation Society which has branches all over the US. Their headquarters is in Massachusetts and main website is here
<a href="http://www.dharma.org" target="_blank">http://www.dharma.org</a></p>
</li>
<li>The Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City was started by Gil Fronsdal, a student of Jack Kornfield. Their website hosts a ton of resources and online courses here:

</ul>
<p>I discovered Sam Harris through Joe Rogan (where I also discovered Duncan). Sam Harris' perspective on vipassana was a major motivation for me to take up this practice seriously after dabbling for a few years. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first chapter of his book Waking Up is here:
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/samharrisorg/waking-up-chapter-one" target="_blank">https://soundcloud.com/samharrisorg/waking-up-chapter-one</a></p>
