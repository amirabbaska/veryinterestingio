			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly off topic but there was some studies a few years ago that showed chimps preferred cooked food over raw food. That’s not that unusual but when given a choice, most chimps would wait a period of time for the food to be cooked instead of getting it immediately and eating it. A majority of them would also travel the another location to have their food cooked and some would even hoard part of their food so it could be cooked later on. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the article:</p>
<p>“To investigate, the scientists carried out a series of experiments at the Jane Goodall Institute’s Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Sanctuary in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in which wild-born chimpanzees were given the opportunity to prepare food using a “cooking device”.</p>
<p>For safety reasons, this was a plastic lunchbox with a false bottom, which researchers used to “transform” raw sweet potato placed inside by the chimpanzees into a cooked slice of a similar size.”</p>
<p>“Overall, the apes chose cooked potato nearly 90% of the time when they were given a straight choice and they were nearly as keen when they had to wait one minute while it was “cooked” by the researcher (who shook the plastic box ten times). The chimps continued to opt for the cooked option 60% of the time when they had to carry the food some distance in order to place it in the “oven” - although since they often carried it in their mouths this was a challenge and they sometimes appeared to eat the food on the way, “almost by accident”.</p>
<p>I tried to link to the scientific journal mentioned in the article but looks like it is broken. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's explained in the article......</p>
<p>In captivity, researchers used a 'cooking device' which was just a box with a false bottom, which the chimpanzees would place food into and the researchers would swap out for a cooked version of the food (sweet potatoes in this case)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is probably due to raw / undercooked meat causing stomach aches when you eat too much of it so probably more comfort than taste . Meat is hard to digest on itself and a lot more when it is raw. The same happens to humans. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans have evolved eating cooked meat. That's why you get sick from eating it. If you regularly eat raw meat your stomach will get used to it. Also, the chimps were getting cooked sweet potatoes, not meat. </p></div>		</li>
