			<div class="markdown"><p>This is Becca- Thanks for asking about our gear.  We all wore helmets and headlamps, of course.  For clothing, we wore heavy cotton jumpsuits over clothes that would not be bulky.  The jumpsuits helped protect us from scrapes as we made our way through the cave.  It's also much easier to go through the tight spaces in a one-piece jumpsuit because it's less likely beltloops and such will get caught on the jagged rocks.
We used climbing harness, ropes and ascenders to protect ourselves going up and down the Dragon's Back because a fall there could have been quite serious.  We tried to use harnesses going down the Chute but it was too tight in the Chute.  The extra complication of harnesses in that tight space actually made it more dangerous so we climbed very carefully.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I much prefer a nomex-kevlar blend and kevlar-resin forearm/shin guards lined with foam rubber padding. I do a <em>lot</em> of confined space work and got really sick of cotton.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking at the pictures I don't see how they'd end up all the way in the back though, without someone dragging them around (if the cave wasn't influenced by the outside world to move them around)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If numerous corpses were disposed of by simply being dropped or shoved down the hole (as, clearly, it appears they were) then inevitably they would form a sort of sloping pile. Any further body being tossed in would naturally roll down the slope and its momentum might easily deposit it in the farthest reaches of the chamber.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just out of curiosity, when did &quot;hominin&quot; become interchangeable?  I don't recall seeing that spelling until recently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hominid is a slightly broader category than hominin.  Hominid is derived from the Family Hominidae, whereas hominin applies to the Subfamily Homininae.  In both cases they are the informal terms (hence lower case) for the formal Family and Subfamily names.</p>
<p>The specimens found are assigned to the genus <em>Homo</em> and therefore are both hominids and hominins, as are we (<em>Homo sapiens</em>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren't really! They are both specific scientific terms, check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominini" target="_blank">evolutionary tree on the left</a>. Hominins are a group of hominid that includes humans. Same general idea as &quot;mammal&quot; and &quot;vertebrate&quot;, though way more specific. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not. Hominin is the correct term for Homo and its ancestors after the split with chimpanzee. Hominid includes Homo, Pan, and Gorilla. </p>
<p>They changed the nomenclature a few years ago... But not everyone uses it, which causes this confusion. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I haven't read the paper yet, but how did those hominids fit in there?</p>

<p>I heard an interview with one of the people involved in this expedition on CBC Radio the other day. She said one theory is that there may be another access route they haven't discovered yet, or that is no longer accessible, because the way they're getting in is so impractical.</p></div>		</li>
