<p>Huh, so if I had my own aircraft is can just get in a fly <em>anywhere</em> without telling anyone? </p>
<p>I thought it was all controlled, or at least logged.</p>

We flew out over Lake Michigan with the skyline to our left. It was awesome. Got VHS of it somewhere.
Those days are long gone I guess. I remember the dude demonstrated a negative G dive/turn to prove I wouldn't fall out the door. lol ... and didn't ask ATC for permission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you'd need your license. And you'd need to stay away from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace_class" target="_blank">controlled airspace</a>, especially busy airports. </p>
<p>And you'd want to monitor guard (emergency) frequency just in case.</p>
<p>But yeah, as long as you're not breaking any rules, you don't have to stay in contact with ATC.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, much of US airspace is class E+G which many an area isn’t serviced by an ARTCC. One example is Truckee/Tahoe/Sierras which depends on pilots to communicate with eachother in order to avoid possible mid-air collisions or runway incursions. After having a few near mid-airs myself, I appreciate the radar environment much more. We need to expeditde ADS-B for ALL aircraft ASAP. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're interested in the career field, i recommend going military for better quality of life.  Last i heard, FAA was grinding employees to dust with their &quot;counter-clockwise rotating schedule&quot; bullshit. Military ATC life is much less stressful than FAA or &quot;normal&quot; military life.</p>
<p>Navy and Air Force both turn out good controllers, although this can depend on where you got your training and experience.  </p>
<p>I'd say the long-term outlook is positive, because i don't think ATC will be automated in the near future.  </p>
<p>I cannot comment on the difficulty in training -- too much depends on you.  USAF teaches ATC fundamentals in about 3.5 months at Keesler AFB in Mississippi, but that only prepares you to begin training.  My first day at my first base, controllers had us plug in and listen to the frequencies and we could barely understand what was being said.  &quot;Controller ear&quot; is something you have to develop, as well as being able to see and plan flight paths in 3 (or even 4) dimensions.  </p>
<p>Airspace around every airport on the planet is unique, and so is every ATC sector out there. And you have to learn about your local airports, and you have to know your airspace like the back of your hand.  </p>
<p>There is a lot of information to learn and retain, but that is really only the beginning challenge.</p>
<p>All that said: i loved the job, and i recommend it to anyone interested.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother works at Indi center. He says they regularly have shifts that are staffed with less than half of what was the required shift minimum when he started ~5 years ago. The shitty working conditions are convincing more guys to retire before they have to making the situation worse. </p>
<p>edit: Now with more numbers, less anecdote: <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/283328-air-traffic-control-staffing-shortage-must-be-addressed" target="_blank">The nation’s ATC system has the fewest Certified Professional Controllers – 10,667 - in nearly three decades. Controller staffing has fallen nearly 10 percent since 2011, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has missed its hiring goals for the last seven years, and there are currently more controllers eligible to retire today than are currently in the pipeline to replace them.</a> Article is from last year but it is still true enough. </p></div>		</li>

<p>How's the job outlook for ATC?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The job outlook is great for openings in the FAA as well as the Military due to the controllers retiring in the FAA from the Reagan Strike in the 80's and looking for their replacements. Military are looking for replacements for those who are separating to go to the FAA. Win/Win</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How hard is the training?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Training is difficult. You have to learn radio frequencies, aircraft routes, altitude your facility owns and the ones all around you, aircraft types, speeds, weights, separation procedures between each aircraft, input flight plans, make weather observations at some facilities, solicit pilot reports just to name a few. Next you will have to be able demonstrate successful application of these procedures with your trainer and evaluator of the the facility to become certified. Dependent on your experience and facility: this can range anywhere from 6 months to 3 years. </p>
<p>The only difference between the military and FAA side that I've seen for new controllers is that the FAA has a 1 year probationary period. During this time, your Frontline Sup will make a decision to see if you're a potentially good controller for the facility. If you get through that first year, you're pretty much set in terms of job security.
In the military, if you don't get certified, you will get re-classed into another military job.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difficult thing you're describing isn't that difficult tbh, unless rote memorization isn't for you.</p>
<p>The hard part about atc is all the weird shit that tends to happen. You, as a controller, need to be able to use your encyclopedic knowledge of the many many books ATC has to offer to know and apply the correct rule(s) in the correct situations so that everyone is safe. </p>
<p>There's enough phraseology in place to take a lot of the guesswork out, but in those problem situations when a quick decision is needed, that's what's hard. Plus, the whole thing can get complicated real quick, real easy.</p>
<p>All that to say: I think the application is more difficult than just learning frequencies/altitudes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Airport Ops Officer here, thanks to you and all the other controllers that watch our backs while we're out there and allow us to do our jobs. There are some controllers that just like to treat us like we're a nuisance. It can be unpleasant and demoralizing when working with a controller like that. I personally try to stay out of the way as much as I can, but at times I just need to get into y'all's space and complete a tasks. Most of the folks at my airport are happy to help us accomplish those tasks and when you have them to work with it makes day a much more positive experience. </p></div>		</li>
