<p>TIL!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and those scenes were rendered out on rendering farms of several to dozens of computers dedicated to rendering scenes, often at minutes per frame.</p>
<p>It still is that way, as prerendered cinematics are distinctly superior to in game cinematics, though the gap is closing.  Prerendered cinematics are carefully animated, not at the mercy of any engine idiosyncrasies (loading pop, jitteriness, etc), often use much higher resolution models and textures, special effects like water, wind blowing hair, fire, explosions are much more carefully modeled, along with getting post production passes.  Also, they can stream from disk and play instantly, whereas in game cinematics still need to load world and character models and textures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gap has already closed on some situations. Lots of games have used the ingame engine to portray cutscenes since the models and hardware has become strong enough to portray emotions, battles, dramatic scenes etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ever see a tree come out of nowhere in the distance as you walk across a map? Somewhere behind you another one disappeared, freeing that memory space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Err, you're conflating two different things-- draw distance, and dynamic loading.</p>
<p>In games where the entire map is loaded at once, a tree popping into view just means you got close enough for the engine to decide to start drawing it. Nothing behind you, or anywhere, gets unloaded.</p>
<p>In open-world games engines like GameBryo, the world content is split up into cells that get loaded around the player as he walks around. But again, a tree appearing in front of you may mean a new cell has been loaded, but the trees behind you may still be there too, depending on how aggressively the engine unloads cells.</p>
<p>Really, the only situation in which one tree replaces another tree would be when you're hitting the onscreen object render limit, and that's going to be happening to objects in front of you, not behind you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but this doesn't explain why they use triangles and not circles and such. Machine works easily with triangles but it can render and display circles and elipses just as easy, can it not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It cannot, actually. Not just as easily, anyway. The GPU itself is built with triangles in mind, it has hardware acceleration designed to work specifically with triangles.</p></div>		</li>
