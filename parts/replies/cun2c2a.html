			<p>I'm getting tripped up because when I multiply it out the way you said to, I get a 6% probability. <br><br>The same thing happens when I do (364/365)^22<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>So, the sum we want is 365/365 <em> 364/365 </em> 363/365 <em> 362/365 </em> ... <em> 343/365, which gives the probability of 23 people having distinct birthdays, or 1 minus that for the probability of someone having a match.<br><br>Or you can write that as one fraction, by pushing them together: (365 </em> 364 <em> ... </em> 343) / (365 <em> 365 </em> ... <em> 365)<br><br>(364/365)^22 will be a significant underprediction for the odds because it's effectively using a much smaller chance of success for each person than almost all of the actual fractions we want to multiply.<br><br>To compact the maths together, can use factorials: <br><br></em> 365! = 365 <em> 364 </em> 363 <em> ... </em> 1<br><br><em> But we only want to count down to 343 (the 23rd person), so divide off 342! to get 365 </em> 364 <em> ... </em> 343<br><br>* For the bottom half of the fraction we have 365 every time, so that's 365^23<br><br>Combined result: (365! / 342!) / 365^23 = 0.4927...<br><br>Subtract that from 1 to get the odds of a match at 0.5073 = 50.7%</p>		</li>
