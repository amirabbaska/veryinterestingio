			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. The real answer is that we don't really care. Pretty sure the Chinese would know fuck all about Gallipoli (which is the most celebrated of war efforts here in Australia) because they have no reason to know or care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had detachments of Marines stationed around Shanghai, but after US diplomats and such were evacuated, they were pulled out. It probably also has to do with the fact that we, being the US, were funding Chiang Kai shek, who was an absurdly corrupt leader who pocketing all of the money and starving his people, which poured gasoline on the Communist/Nationalist movement of Mao Zedong. We supported Chiang Kai Shek because he was pro western powers, but did nothing to help his people, so the US was in a sense sponsoring Communism is China, which is a humiliating thing to note.</p>
<p>Another thing worth noting is the atrocities committed by the Japanese there, namely Chinese citizens being kidnapped and experimented on, dissecting alive without anesthetics, and after the war, rather than prosecute those responsible, the US arranged for a similar deal as they made with the German scientists and took the medical data obtained from these experiments in exchange for immunity from prosecution and so on. Another thing the US would rather not discuss, especially since it took place so recently in history. </p></div>		</li>
