<p>If you attach a cable from the Earth to the moon, would we speed up the moon's orbit around the Earth or slow the Earth's rotation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is another way.
If cost is an issue, you could use a smaller cable and just pump more Voltage into it.<br />
Alternatively, couldn't you just put a solar panel on the moon and power the hair dryer using that?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That kind of defea5s the purpose, this thread is about how long power cables can get</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conversely you could increase the voltage to roughly 38,500,000 volts to account for the voltage drop.  You would need to substantially upgrade the insulation on the wiring though, and getting the voltage juuuust right so you get enough to run the hairdryer but not so much that you turn it into a mass of melted plastic is going to be tricky to say the least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose it depends on how long you want it to run for, too. If a quick surge of electricity destroys the cable as it moves along it could you still get a brief moment of power at the moon? Or would the connection break stop it altogether?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem of the high voltage is that the current will just go trough the cable from the + to the - because there is not enough insulation to contain 38 million volt (which is a ridiculous amount). </p>
<p>380kV cables are already massive so scaling that up 100x won't be looking pretty. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You could probably skimp on insulation for the portion of the wire that would be in a vacuum, especially if the two wires were given some additional spacing...</p>
<p>That said, I don't have the foggiest clue what the right-way is to calculate the gap-distance for that kind of voltage through a vacuum. It might end up depending on some properties of the conductor, or whether a thin layer of insulation is needed merely to keep wayward metal atoms from accidentally creating their own bridge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except no one would send 230v over cable to the moon.  In practice, one doesn't do that for runs that are 100s of feet.   </p>
<p>Try stepping the voltage up to 10000V.   And allow a 40% drop so at the moon you' d need to step down from <del>4000V</del>6000V to 230V.  Ignoring gravity, revolution of the moon about the earth, etc., a very long #1000 copper wire should suffice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The original post was asking about a normal extension cord.  So while scaling up voltage is certainly the way it 'should' be done, the person you replied to chose 230V AC because it was essentially specified by the OP</p></div>		</li>
