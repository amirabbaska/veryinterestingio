			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought that a lake had to be at a low lying point of topography, and that it was just a huge collection of run-off (for better or worse). Is it considered stagnant, or does it slowly drain into the underlying water table and create movement? I’m glad OP posted, I have so many lake questions!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most lakes have outflows into other rivers.  If you don't have an outflow, you end up with something like the Dead Sea or the Great Salt Lake - they collect all the minerals from water that comes into them and become salty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lakes form at low point in the topography precisely because the water table is above them. There is a lot of water surrounding lakes as well it's just under the ground. As for considered stagnant water. Most lakes are big enough so that wind will create waves these, aerate the water. This alone means they aren't standing water like a mucky beaver pond. In addition as the the other commenter said, almost all freash water lakes have an out flow. This river carries away the salts that would normally accumulate in the lake. It also provids a current so that even without wind the water is mixing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a low point, but not all lakes are the same. Drainage lakes receive their water through streams and often have outlets as well. Seepage lakes can have no inlets or outlets. The water in either is basically stagnant. Most drainage lakes take a couple of decades to replace the entire volume of their water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most lakes do have drainage. It's not that they are gaining and losing zero water. It's the balance of (input from streams and groundwater flow) = (output from outgoing streams and groundwater flow) </p></div>		</li>
