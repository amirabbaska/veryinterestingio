			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's part of the basis for thinking there might be an exomoon here! There was a second dip in the star-light about 3.5 hours after the planet's transit, which is consistent with the idea that there's a moon around the planet following in it's orbit. Future observations could show transits at other times relative to the planet as the exomoon proceeds in its orbit. </p>
<p>The other line of evidence comes from the fact that the transit of the exoplanet came about an hour later than expected, which could be caused by a large enough moon so that they orbit a common center of mass significantly removed from the exoplanet's center (rather like the Earth/Moon system). It's also possible that the delay was caused by another planet in the same star system, though, so it's not a lock that there is an exomoon there. There are 2 independent lines of evidence that are consistent with the same story, but the single, incomplete exomoon transit is not very robust, and there is another possible explanation for the time delay, so this is still very much a &quot;candidate&quot; exomoon rather than a confirmed one. Future observations are needed.</p></div>		</li>
