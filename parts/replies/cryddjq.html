			<p>So the earth is exactly 24,000 miles around? </p>		</li>

			<p>It's 40,075km, or 24,900 miles. Pretty close!</p>		</li>

			<p>It's such a neat thing, the way it all ties together, it seems a shame to spoil it for a few miles or minutes give or take :)</p>		</li>

			<p>We should petition to get the distance of the standard mile changed to make the earth exactly 24,000 miles around.</p>		</li>

			<p>AGREED. Or failing that, petition to have some mass shed from the earth to narrow it a little. </p>		</li>

			<p>Or stop using the  imperial metric system and adopt the SI (International metric system). That would be cool too ;)</p>		</li>

			<p>Why not 25,000? It's closer and ends with a 5.</p>		</li>

			<p>Even more fun, for distances on the ocean, there are 360 degrees in a circle, and 60 seconds per degree. 360*60 = 21,600. A nautical mile is the distance traveled in one minute of arc. So that 21,600 is the circumference of the Earth in nautical miles. Convert that to standard miles, you get 24,856.8 miles or 40,003.2 km.</p>		</li>

			<p>No...but it is very close to 40000 km because that was the way they originally defined the meter, basically it just isn't exactly that because they couldn't measure it that accurately back then.</p>		</li>

			<p>This isn't entirely correct.   <br>1m is the 1/10000000 of the distance from the equator to the north pole.  <br>This could jump to the conclusion that the diameter of the equator is 40000km,  but the earth is not a perfect sphere,  so the number is slightly off</p>		</li>

			<p>The definition of a meter is now dependant on the speed of light, so you're not correct either.</p>		</li>

			<p>No.  But some 'kink' in order to include political areas, such as the one at the top right of the Soviet Union.</p>		</li>

			<p>Assuming you're in a plane you'd have to factor in your distance from the ground, likely increasing it by a fair bit.</p>		</li>
