			<div class="markdown"><p>Even more fun, for distances on the ocean, there are 360 degrees in a circle, and 60 seconds per degree. 360*60 = 21,600. A nautical mile is the distance traveled in one minute of arc. So that 21,600 is the circumference of the Earth in nautical miles. Convert that to standard miles, you get 24,856.8 miles or 40,003.2 km.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No...but it is very close to 40000 km because that was the way they originally defined the meter, basically it just isn't exactly that because they couldn't measure it that accurately back then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't entirely correct.<br />
1m is the 1/10000000 of the distance from the equator to the north pole.<br />
This could jump to the conclusion that the diameter of the equator is 40000km,  but the earth is not a perfect sphere,  so the number is slightly off</p></div>		</li>
