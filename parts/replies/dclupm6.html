<p>Even working from home it's going to greatly benefit you to grab a local company for a number of different reasons, including the ability to have an in person interview. Even popping into the office a few times shortly after landing the job and meeting people would be a huge benefit.</p>
<p>The entire country isn't like the west coast. Out here where I live ASP.NET/MVC is king. </p>
<p>Make sure you're not wasting your time learning something like angular if you're going to be stuck working in a market where almost no one needs the skills.</p>
<p>You should always familiarize yourself with the demand before spending time learning a new technology (unless it's just a hobby) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Completely agreed here. I live and work in Silicon Valley, but when I travel to other areas (even &quot;tech&quot; areas), it's rare to see MEAN stack or anything like it in use.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Microsoft seems to dominate the college curriculum in many non-SV areas, which may have something to do with it.</p>
<p>Definitely be aware that there are reasons we use the technologies we do here in Silicon Valley, but that doesn't mean there are necessarily jobs outside of SV in those languages. Remember that a lot of the press about companies here make it seem that our ways are the most popular ways ... when in fact that might only be true for the bay.</p>
<p>Also, OP, I have Multiple Sclerosis, and working from home has been a huge boon for me. It's not fun to shit yourself in the office, or not be able to drive yourself home because you had an episode that day. Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of options; I've been doing it for the most part for the last seven or eight years. However, it is harder to <em>start</em> remotely in the career than it is to <em>become</em> remote. I started working at home a couple days per week at a job that I had been at for a few years and that was happy with my performance. I eventually moved to another job that I worked from home the majority of the time and am now 100% remote with a team spread across three continents (surprisingly, Asia is not one of them :).</p>
<p>Each new position trusted me to go one step further, and each new job was comfortable with it because I had already done it with the previous job.</p>
<p>That's not the only way to get a remote job, though. When I'm hiring, what I want to know is whether the candidate can and will work at home. Just because a person hasn't done it doesn't mean they won't, but I need a little more convincing.</p>
<p>The most convincing arguments come from personal coding projects (for example, open source development (extra nice because I can see your code) or an app or whatever). This shows me you are able to work self-directed, and that is one of my biggest concerns. It also shows me that you are able to take ownership of learning what you need to learn. You don't get too duck your head in the next cubicle, so this is important.</p>
<p>My other concern is social. We spend a lot of time working, so, as social creatures, it is a part of our social lives. Some people need that constant interaction, and, if they don't get it, their work suffers because <em>they</em> are suffering. That doesn't mean an extrovert can't work remotely, but they need to understand the demands that it places in them and plan accordingly.</p>
<p>So, in short, the various fields of computing (in particular, the software end, from administration through development. Hardware is hard to work remotely) provide good options but may be a little hard to break into initially, though, once in, finding future remote positions is much easier). However, it comes with tradeoffs that can be hard for some people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try taking a look at freelance websites. Most offers there are for 1-2 day small jobs but there are a handful of developers who make a living from that. Sometimes they publish long-term full-time positions as well. There's also /r/forhire.</p>
<p>Option #2 is starting your own business.</p>
<p>Finding a company in your area that contemplates your situation might be a bit harder. From my experience they want someone at the office so that the employee can be kept under a supervising eye. But sometimes they accept it.</p></div>		</li>
