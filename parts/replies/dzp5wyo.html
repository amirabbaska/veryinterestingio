<p>&quot;Drop a mouse down a thousand foot mine shaft and at the bottom it receives a small shock, and then walks away.  A rat is killed; a man is broken; a horse splashes&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ant-Man doesn't really follow [OUR] physical laws. The spaces between the atoms are shrunk down, so he should weight the same whether he shrunk, or grew. When he's small, he keeps his strength, but over tiny areas, he produces more pressure on objects, but when he is huge, he should still only have the same strength, but doesn't seem to.</p>
<p>edited in a word to make it proper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also when he's small, he shouldn't be able to ride an ant considering he'd weigh the same amount. Fucking Ant-Man logic</p>
<p>Edit: same as his original weight. Not the weight of an ant. Ant-Man shrunk or huge would still be whatever weight he is at base size. His mass doesn't change, just the space between the atoms</p></div>		</li>
