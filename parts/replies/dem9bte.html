			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for answering.</p>
<p>Would those changes in orbit have influence on the other planets? how about the speed of the new orbits of Mars and Venus, and how fast would this happen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If Mars and Venus were to magically switch places and their velocities altered in order to maintain the previous orbits, I highly doubt much would change. Phobos and Demos would probably crash into the surface of Venus, or break apart in a small ring. As for the other planets, the masses of Mars + Venus is 6 orders of magnitude less than the sun. I'm pretty sure nothing would change on Earth (other than mass hysteria from astronomers having to factor in magic in their orbital calculations now).</p></div>		</li>
