			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think of honey as an over-saturated solution of sugar and water, then its natural reaction is for the sugar to separate from the water in the form of crystals. So, if &quot;lack of hydration&quot; is considered synonymous with &quot;over saturated&quot;... then yes, since more water would reduce the saturation level.  </p>
<p>However, crystallization can be caused by several things such as moisture level, glucose to fructose concentration (glucose crystallizes easier than fructose), and the presence of crystallization 'seeds' in the honey which can be removed by filtration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had honey keep for a long time after I bought it, finally crystallizing after 6 years.</p>
<p>I could still soften it by warming it for a few minutes.  But then it would not stay soft for very long (it would crystallize again after about a week.)</p>

<p>Honey isn't a solution though, it's a colloid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So sad! But yes, I find the best way to warm it back up is to put it in a hot car in the summer. Heating it on the stove runs the risk of 'cooking' it which will change its taste and consistency. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I recommend warming it up in a pot with warm (&lt;40°C) water. The hot car is a cool method too :) </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can make any alcoholic beverage from water, sugar, and yeast. The difference in beverage depends on the sugar source. (and yeast too, only specific yeasts make for tasty beverages). </p>

<li>Mead is made from the sugar in honey</li>
<li>Beer is made from the sugar in grain</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your main point is right, but you are over-simplifying your beer and wine descriptions.  </p>
<p>While mead is by definition a wine made from honey, beers and wines can each be made from a wide variety of sources. They are distinguished by process, rather than ingredients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and it's why we were probably making mead before beer and certainly before wine. You find a wild honeybee nest in a tree that's taken on water during a spring storm then sat around for a warm summer, eat the honey anyways and get drunk, &quot;NATURE IS FUCKING LIT! Let's figure this out!&quot; and boom, mead becomes a thing. </p>
<p>Side: The oldest confirmed winery is ~4000BCE but they've found pots in Asia with rice-honey-alcohol residue from at least ~6000BCE. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mead is honey and water, if you don't boil it it will ferment from wild yeast, if you boil it to pasteurize it you can pitch brewing yeast. The trick with mead is to be patient and let it age for about a year. It's good to add a few grapes as yeast nutrient too, and to not make it too sweet otherwise the fermentation will never finish.</p></div>		</li>
