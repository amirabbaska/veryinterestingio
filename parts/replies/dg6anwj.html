			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer made the most sense to me. Thank you so much. I feel a calmness surrounding me now, as if the universe is telling me I can move on to the next stage of existence after having learned this. God bless you, good sir. May your teachings lead the rest of these heathens down the road of true knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So if you cut off a limb it isn't like you removed a section of that central highway backbone and need to reroute before things can flow. Instead think of it like a fluid source being split up to be pushed through a sponge (the tissues) and then collected on the other side by a return fluid system. If you remove a big section of the sponge and plug up the larger supply tubes everything else continues as normal.</p>

<p>A true ELI5 answer.  Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They close it up. The area it supplied with blood doesn't really need the blood anymore.</p>
<p>Imagine a wall of sponge. One side has a big fire hose of water which splits up into garden hoses, then irrigation tubes, then little IV lines, right on down to little hair-thin capillaries. All those capillaries feed into the wall of sponge on one side.</p>
<p>On the other side the output is collected by more capillaries, which combine into the IV lines, irrigation tubes, garden hoses, and finally a fire hose going out. That hose feeds back into a pump that pushes it around to the first fire hose going in.</p>
<p>The sponge in this example is the tissue of the body. If you cut out a chunk of sponge which is fed by one of the garden hoses then you can just crimp the garden hose and everything still works. The water/blood just doesn't go down that path anymore and is split between all the rest of the possible paths it can take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this have any effect on blood pressure or how much work the heart needs to do in order to pump blood? Like if you were to lose a limb, does the heart now have less work to do with the same organ function as before?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was a great example, thank you!</p>
<p>I was thinking of the artery as separate from all the other veins, which makes no sense!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I am a massive moron so if you can, please explain what happens when someone's throat is cut for example and you're putting pressure to stop the bleeding. So the jugular is severed. How do you save a person if the jugular is severed but you manage to contain the bleeding? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well,  its not like the limb needs any blood so they close it. There is no loop only a highway with multiple u-turns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not normal for a large vein to stop abruptly instead of branching off to smaller and smaller routes right? But this isn't harmful? Or do they already stop abruptly? I don't know </p></div>		</li>
