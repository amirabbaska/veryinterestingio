			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fun anecdote. When Robert Altman was making the movie, MASH, he had his son write a song for the movie. He thought it would be a fun little way to include his kid in his work. So Mike Altman wrote a song for the mock funeral scene called Suicide is Painless. That song was then used as the theme song for the hugely successful, long running, and widely syndicated MASH tv series. Writing a little song for one of his dad's movies effectively set him up for the rest of his life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Danny Elfman said that his decision to add &quot;the Sihmsohns&quot; to the beginning of the Simpsons theme got him bumped up to a singer with residuals and he never has to worry about anything ever again (or maybe just health insurance, but I think that's underselling it)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just about to comment up there that he'd missed out the fact that Mike Altman was 14 at the time.<br />
Although, it's important to point out that he only wrote the lyrics, the music was written by someone else. It was a popular thing to do back then to write lyrics for the theme song but never actually intend to use them, Gene Roddenberry has a writing credit for the lyrics to the Star Trek theme. </p></div>		</li>

<p>EDIT: not that there's anything wrong with quoting The Tick in any context, ever. Just wanted to be clear.</p></div>		</li>
