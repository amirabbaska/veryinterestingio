			<div class="markdown"><p>Be skeptical. There is a lot of debate about Koko. There are doubts that Koko actually understands what she is signing.  </p>
<p>From wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another concern that has been raised about Koko's ability to express coherent thoughts through signs is that interpretation of the gorilla's conversation is left to the handler, who may see improbable concatenations of signs as meaningful. For example, when Koko signs &quot;sad&quot; there is no way to tell whether she means it with the connotation of &quot;How sad.&quot; or if she has no syntax. Following Patterson's initial publications in 1978, a series of critical evaluations of her reports of signing behavior in great apes argued that video evidence suggested that Koko was simply being prompted by their trainers' unconscious cues to display specific signs, in what is commonly called the Clever Hanseffect.Such debate requires careful consideration of what it means to &quot;learn&quot; or &quot;use&quot; a language  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her signing at all is impressive, but it may not be the true language and expression of coherent thoughts that you are looking for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I believe that of all of the animals that were taught to communicate on some level, none have ever asked a spontaneous question.  Apes that were trained to sign may ask &quot;where's my food?&quot; if you take their food away, but that is a trained response to the situation.  Apes, birds, or other communicating animals have never just asked a question to acquire knowledge or satisfy curiosity.  </p>
<p>The day an animal points to an object and without prompting asks &quot;What is that ?&quot;, or asks a &quot;why ?&quot; question, is the day that we will begin a true 2-way conversation with animals.  Otherwise, they are just learned behaviors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think of the chimp, the one with the talking hands.  </p>
<p>In the course of the experiment, that chimp had a baby. Imagine how her trainers must have thrilled when the mother, without prompting, began to sign to her newborn.  </p>
<p>Baby, drink milk.  </p>
<p>Baby, play ball.  </p>
<p>And when the baby died, the mother stood over the body, her wrinkled hands moving with animal grace, forming again and again the words: Baby, come hug, Baby, come hug, fluent now in the language of grief.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I'm not an expert, but as I understand it, it mainly comes down to them not being able to articulate themselves due to how their mouths, tongues, throats and vocal cords are physically built. But there was a chimpanzee that got taught sign language and it even taught it to its adopted son:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was going to say this but we should differentiate between language and speaking. Primates can assemble words within limits (others have mentioned Koko the gorilla) but, as you suggest, fine motor movements are among the things that differentiate us from the other apes. In short, they can be taught low-level language but can't talk. (Check out Stephen Pinker regarding the brain, speech, and language). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up Kanzi the bonobo.  I think he is a better example of using language with his lexigram board.  There also isn't the controversy surrounding him like there is with Koko.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as an information, the extend of the abilities of Koko are highly controversial, since only her handler can &quot;understand&quot; her but no one else. So it isn't quite clear if she really is able to communicate in sign language or if it is just the imagination and interpretation of her handler.  </p>
<p>There were also some scandals like Koko &quot;demanding&quot; to see a person's nipples (including from women), where it isn't quite certain whether Koko actually wanted to see a person's nipples or her handler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How much Koko understood language was never independently verified, she would not be able to speak to anyone but her caretaker, making it certainly seem like the ability of Koko to speak was just projection of the caretaker, ascribing meaning into very rudimentary and confused signing by poor little gorilla.</p></div>		</li>
