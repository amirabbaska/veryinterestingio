			<p>Not entirely, the check-box itself doesn't &quot;really&quot; exist. The trick is that most bots don't support javascript </p>		</li>

			<p>That's true, but it can be circumvented by simply duplicating the request the button is making, whether it's a typical HTTP request or some TCP based socket communication. Its just another hoop to jump through, which gets stopped as soon as the bot encounters a HIT.</p>		</li>

			<p>Duplicating isn't as simple, because the &quot;nocaptcha&quot; will create some kind of token on-page and store it in a JS variable , which is then submitted along with the request  </p>		</li>
