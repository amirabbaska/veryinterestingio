			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that quarks make up the proton, and upon splitting they would immediately form a new pair which is why we cannot observe them by themselves, but don't understand why this means they can't be split. </p>
<p>It was my understanding that we could split them, but because of the intensity of the strong force, it would take more energy to split than would be released when they split. Or is the energy required to split them infinite?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah I see. So in spite of the fact that new ends to the tube suddenly appear, can we say the original two (three?) were split apart? Are the new ends distinguishable from the old ones? Are the new tubes distinguishable?</p>
<p>I donâ€™t think infinite energy is required to get to that point. The effort to separate them remains constant, up to the point where new flux tubes form. This is different than electromagnetic interaction, which dies off with distance. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Quark (colour) confinement, however, says that essentially we can never see or have isolated quarks. In other words quarks HAVE to stick together and form a baryon - mesons and hadrons. For a start, the strong force being very strong and attractive at very short ranges - this is due to the term +kr (and note the r dependence not 1/r) in the strong force potential, where r is the radius/separation and k is called the string tension. So qualitatively you might start seeing why it's hard; it's in fact impossible.</p>
<p>In a hadron - say a proton - the quarks are bound together by gluon tubes , which is essentially just a bunch of gluons travelling back and forth between the quarks. The gluons (and quarks) have non-zero colour charge (e.g. red-anti-blue or green-anti-red, where something like red-anti-red is neutral colour). But because gluons have colour, as you separate the two quarks, the gluon tubes get stretched and start to narrow. This happens more and more until enough energy is released that the tubes snap and immediately form a quark-anti-quark pair, with each particle of the pair instantly being attracted to and bound to the original pair of two quarks. This is so that the net color charge is zero - the strong force really loves to keep things colorless.</p>

<p>I know what most of those words mean, but combined together their meaning eludes me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Color is a property of the strong force in the same way that positive and negative are a property of the electromagnetic force. It's just that there's 3 kinds of color rather than the two kinds of electric/magnetic charge, and the way they interact is more complicated. Quarks have a color charge in similar fashion to how electrons and protons have an electric charge.</p>
<p>It's necessary that a quark is paired with other quarks to create a particle. It's also necessary that a particle's color ends up being zero. So it's necessary that quarks are paired with other quarks such that the color charge of the particle they create is zero. This is just how the universe is.</p>
<p>If you attempt to split quarks apart, the strong force keeps them together like a rubber band. It does not get easier to pull quarks away from each other the further they are apart. Once this rubber band contains enough energy, it &quot;snaps&quot;. When it does, the energy stored in said rubber band is used to create new quarks that satisfy the pairing requirements.</p>
<p>In short: Quarks can never be alone. If you try to pull them apart with enough energy, the universe will simply create new quarks to stop them from being alone because it's easier than bringing them back together.</p>
