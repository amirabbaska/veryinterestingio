			<div class="markdown"><p>There are plenty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDuUR7l3bgc" target="_blank">implosion fails</a>, where the building does not come down.  Maybe it leans but doesn't fall.  Maybe it just drops a storey or two, but doesn't collapse.  The OP is wondering what they do when that happens.</p></div>		</li>
