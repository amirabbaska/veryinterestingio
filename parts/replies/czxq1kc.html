			<div class="markdown"><p>yea if people think trees of giant crisp red apples and long vines of big plum perfectly green grapes among other things used to be a commonly occuring sight in nature pre-agriculture days, they'd be sorely mistaken.</p>
<p>We took the food in the world that exists and made it better, by and large. Why have a tree grow enough small apples to feed 20 people when it can be bred to grow giant apples so that each tree feeds 100?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, apples resist selective breeding for the most part.</p>
<p>That Red Delicious apple is a clone of a clone of a clone... of a clone of a mutant tree that happened to sprout up in some farmer's &quot;Yellow Bellflower&quot; apple orchard  and wouldn't die the first few times he tried to kill it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Bali. We still have those bananas around, locally they are called &quot;stoney banana&quot;. When ripe, they are very sweet if you don't mind the stones. The young fruit are used for ingredients in some traditional spicy fruit salad. </p>
<p>But they are mostly cultivated for Their leaves, which are thicker than other types of banana. Banana leaves are widely used in Bali for food wrapping and parts of various types of Balinese Hindu daily offerings. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Every fruit you practically eat isn't natural.  All the apples, oranges, pears, strawberries, etc...... were hybridized to taste the way they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It gets really cool when you get into apples and potatoes, neither of which can be grown reliably from seed. potatoes grown from seed will most likely have little resemblance to the plant they came from, and will possibly be poisonous. similarly there's no telling what you will get when growing apples from seed. apples aren't inherently poisonous, so it should be edible... ish but it wont be for instance a red delicious.</p>
<p>that's why almost all potatoes are  &quot;clones&quot; a sample from a known variety that spreads to make more copies of itself. and apples are grafted. a sample from a known tree, literally transplanted onto the root system of a young unknown tree. everything that sprouts from the graft, is a branch of the transplant, if any part of the old tree was left, it would be genetically different. in fact you can now buy trees that have several varieties grafted together, so that different parts of the tree produce different types of apples. </p></div>		</li>
