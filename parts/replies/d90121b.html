			<p>I'm 94% sure that glasses by definition have no structure. They're amorphous. </p>		</li>

			<p>There are also no cleavage planes! If you break most crystalline materials, they will tend to break more easily on certain planes, which will give you that minecraft block effect you described (Or sheets, or little trapizoids, whatever). </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Obsidian is a type of glass which has no crystal structure as opposed to iron which has a crystal structure. A glass is a material that doesn't have an order to it. Pure iron's structure at room temperature is a variation of a cube. This cube is repeated, like minecraft blocks, for &quot;infinity&quot; whereas glass might have a cube <br><br>thats where you lost me, and im way more than 5.<br><br>How about.<br><br>It allows the edge to be alot thinner than any metal hence it can cut at a cellular level.</p>		</li>

			<p>Since you seem to know about mat sci, then what is tempered glass that'll shatter at many points near simultaneously upon breakage at one point, into not random but rather crystalline shards?</p>		</li>

			<p>Tempered glass is heat treated. How they do it is they heat it up to some temperature and then rapidly quench it. <br><a href="https://youtu.be/xe-f4gokRBs?t=3m21s" target="_blank">This video explains it the same way I would and gives fun illustrations too</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Harder, more brittle, and lighter, but it's still s crystal structure. But if you're not trying to cut on a cellular level, why bother with obsidian? A good knife will cut your tomatoes whether it be ceramic or steel. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; This cube is repeated, like minecraft blocks, for &quot;infinity&quot; whereas glass might have a cube but they're angled and positioned every which way, and sometimes not even cube shaped.<br><br>Material Scientists also call Glass &quot;amorphous&quot;, which basically means it is a fluid turned solid in its current form. If you look at it with an REM you can see that iron looks like sugar grains whereas glass (or glassy substances like obsidian) looks like a fluid that doesn't have motion in itself.</p>		</li>

			<p>I work in child pedagogy and in one of the curriculums we redeveloped, and we used Minecraft as a reference when teaching rudimentary chemistry to very young children. We saw huge boosts in engagement and retention when teaching concepts such as atoms and molecular arrangements, applied in-game with students 'crafting' molecules out of their base elements. It is really incredible how much kids can learn when the teaching environment is built for them, and makes me weep for the generation of kids who grew up with bullshit standardized testing, so much wasted potential. </p>		</li>
