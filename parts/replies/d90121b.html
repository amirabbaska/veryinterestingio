			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in child pedagogy and in one of the curriculums we redeveloped, and we used Minecraft as a reference when teaching rudimentary chemistry to very young children. We saw huge boosts in engagement and retention when teaching concepts such as atoms and molecular arrangements, applied in-game with students 'crafting' molecules out of their base elements. It is really incredible how much kids can learn when the teaching environment is built for them, and makes me weep for the generation of kids who grew up with bullshit standardized testing, so much wasted potential. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This cube is repeated, like minecraft blocks, for &quot;infinity&quot; whereas glass might have a cube but they're angled and positioned every which way, and sometimes not even cube shaped.</p>

<p>Material Scientists also call Glass &quot;amorphous&quot;, which basically means it is a fluid turned solid in its current form. If you look at it with an REM you can see that iron looks like sugar grains whereas glass (or glassy substances like obsidian) looks like a fluid that doesn't have motion in itself.</p></div>		</li>
