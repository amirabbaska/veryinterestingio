			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I'm studying neurobiology and want to piggyback off of this.</p>
<p>Self-harming behaviours like chewing, picking, hair-pulling, etc. can be triggered by high cortisol levels (stress) or low serotonin (depression, anxiety). </p>
<p>Basically, if you have too much stress or emotion to effectively deal with, your body turns to seeking some kind of physical sensation (even if it's pain) to calm itself down.</p>
<p>This is true for a lot of non-human animals, too - like our other primate relatives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating, so we will try to find an outlet for the stress/anxiety on by taking it out physically on our bodies? Are there more productive ways to do this (while in public)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's something that's negatively affecting your life/harming your body, therapy can be great. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or even habit reversal training may help.</p>
<p>Body-focused repetitive behaviours may also spring from anxiety, BPD, OCD, etc., so treatment for any underlying stuff can be the way to go.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if it's something you want to change, but not as big of a deal, I don't have an official answer for you. But something that's helped me is accepting it, to an extent. I realized that the way I was thinking about my &quot;bad habit&quot; and the guilt I was carrying around was making me fixate on it more. When I was able to let it go a little, I could heal better.</p>
<p>I'd also recommend mindfulness/meditation practice, since it helps you get out of your own head. </p>
<p>Edit: on a less Zen note, I also have a keyboard sample (has four keys) that I carry around and click sometimes when I just need a satisfying physical experience, so</p></div>		</li>
