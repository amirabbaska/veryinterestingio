			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but the question is how do you get that kind of distribution? If we look at the most basic level, photon energies should only correspond to discrete energy transitions. So how do the wavelengths &quot;smear out&quot; like that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You only get discrete energy levels when you are talking about single atoms or molecules. Once you have a body consisting of more than a few atoms the electron orbitals overlap and you get a series of continuous energy bands. An &quot;ideal&quot; black body is said to be an &quot;ideal emitter,&quot; that is we assume that the distribution of states is continuous and uniform. In a real object of course this is not often the case and some state transitions may be preferable to others. This results in extra absorption or emission at certain frequencies and is the phenomenon responsible for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line" target="_blank">spectral lines</a>, which can be used by scientists to determine the composition of the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even for single atoms there are a couple of other mechanisms which can cause the emission lines to spread out. Random thermal motion will result in doppler spreading, and short-lived exited states have imprecise energy levels due to the uncertainty principle.</p></div>		</li>
