			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of people don't recognize the power of collaboration.  Every once in awhile there's a single genius that develops/discovers something mostly on their own, but most things are the result of thousands and thousands of people each doing something menial, but it adds up to a major goal when we throw shit tons of researchers at it.  Same goes for most sciences, medicine, programming, plants, I dunno, name something, designing a robotic dildo?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something around like... model the world with math, and then use math and other models to find other things you wouldn't expect. Fun fact, the inventor of the periodic table predicted properties of elements that people haven't discovered before based on an observed pattern of known elements. We've only recently taken observations to prove theories Einstein had discovered decades ago through math.</p>
<p>Science is crazy since scientists write and prove theories. Theories are theories because we could always be wrong (needing a scientific paradigm shift), but they've been proven correct theories so far. Like, we use Classical physics (i.e. Newton's Laws) for normal sized things in the world, but it doesn't work well for the really tiny quantum world where we shifted to quantum physics to model that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It gets better! Dimitri Mendeleev predicted the density of the yet-undiscovered element #31 to be 5.9 g/cm3. When Paul de Boisbaudran discovered it (and named it Gallium) in 1875, he found its density to measure 4.7 g/cm3.</p>
<p>Mendeleev wrote to him and told him that was wrong, and to measure it again. Guess who turned out right?</p></div>		</li>
