			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to the same extent. These bacteria essentially excrete acids as they break down sugar residue on the teeth. That acid is what eats away your teeth and causes cavities/tooth decay. Sugary things like fruits were a very rare luxury in the past, not like today where almost every meal we consume has added sugar in one way or another. Early humans simply didn't supply those bacteria with enough sugars to cause lasting damage</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really. Cavities are more a problem borne by agriculture in general. Its incidence correlate well with the cultivation of grains (rich in carbohydrates) in many cultures. Some of the earliest written texts are about dental caries in fact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't carbs just more complex variations of sugar??? My logic may be flawed but I feel like that would yield similar results as the increase in sugar dense foods in modern diets mentioned above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sugar is a type of carbohydrate, not the other way round. Sugar was reasonably scarce (came mostly from fruits) before the modern times, whereas dramatic increase in carbohydrate intake in general is the product of agriculture. Calling sugar and carbohydrate one and the same is just not true especially in a science question.</p></div>		</li>
