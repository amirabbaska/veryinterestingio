<p>Specifically </p>
<p>The fluoridation of water is known to prevent tooth decay[18][19] and is considered by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as &quot;one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century&quot;.[20][21]  </p>

</blockquote>
<p>There is no benefit to drinking fluoride. </p>
<p>Any benefits come from topical application (e.g. rinsing). In brief, it is postulated that fluoride can substitute for hydroxl on the hydroxyapatite surface of tooth enamel (thereby passivating it to acid attack).</p>
<p>Young children (&lt; 4 years) should not use fluoride toothpaste and should avoid fluoridated water if possible, otherwise dental fluorosis may result. This happens when fluoride substitutes for hydroxyl in the bulk of the (developing) tooth enamel, producing substitutional defects in the crystal matrix. Mild dental fluorosis is the cause of those white patches you see on many people's teeth. In more severe cases, the enamel may be compromised to the point of flaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's about .7 mg of fluoride per liter in public drinking water in the US.</p>
<p>Lethal dose is ~30 mg/kg, so ~45 liters per kg of body weight.  Assuming you weigh 70 kg, that's 3100 liters of water per day for a fatal dose.</p>
<p>Gastrointestinal discomfort symptoms start at around .2 mg/kg, or ~1 liter per 4 kg of bodyweight, or around 18 liters per day for our hypothetical 70 kilo adult.  </p>
<p>At those intake levels, hyponatremia or water intoxication are much greater threats than fluoride toxicity, since there are recorded cases of people dying from less than 6 liters of rapid water intake.</p></div>		</li>
