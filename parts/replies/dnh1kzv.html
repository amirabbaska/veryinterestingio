			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for all the examples. I'm creating a persuasive presentation on why Linux is better for customization than other operating systems, and I really appreciate the specific examples you gave. I know that some of Linux or some Linux distros run on CLI, would a Linux user have to understand how to use command prompts in order to use Linux?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nope, but since command line is super powerful, it would be silly to not learn how it works. Without CLI you can do same stuff as on other systems, with CLI you can do more.</p>

<p>That's not really distribution specific usually, every distro can be cli and every distro can have GUI, it's a matter of setup since Linux is like LEGO, I'll explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>sometimes you want ready to go set to put on the shelf (examples: openSUSE, Ubuntu, Fedora), but you can also disasemble and hack it around</li>
<li>other time you want to build your own set using provided instructions (like Arch) </li>
<li>another you may want to 3D print your own pieces (Gentoo) </li>
<li>or if you're feeling adventurous - 3D print the 3D printer first (LFS - Linux From Scratch)</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, <em>all</em> of Linux runs on CLI. However, there are graphical tools that interact with CLI tools, and vice versa. For example, there are graphical tools that automate and guide the use of the command line video tool, ffmpeg. Conversely, there are command line tools that can customize your graphical environment. Some distros vary in what graphical tools are available for certain CLI tools, but every distro has CLI underneath everything.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		</li>

There will be GUIs for all the common things a simple user needs. But if you want to customize or automate something, the console makes it a lot easier &amp; faster to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use Linux (Peppermint) the most on my little old netbook, an Asus eeePC1000H. Does what I want, and has made a rather slow (1.6Ghz Atom from ~2010/11) machine usable for basic internet tasks even now, and even some light/retro gaming. </p>
<p>This post has been what I've experienced. Don't be afraid to ask, don't be afraid to google, don't expect that things are going to Just Work. Go in with that mindset, and you shouldn't get too frustrated, and in time you'll learn what you need to in order to make it work. </p>
<p>You've got to want to do it though. You can't just walk into Linux and expect an easy ride like you do with Windows or macOS. It's useful and gives you some options for much older hardware just for one example, but you need to want to do the legwork. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It should be noted you only need to do this if you're making the compiled form public (free or for sale). If it's for personal use, do what you like and you don't have to share with anyone.</p></div>		</li>
