			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a minor in marine sciences (major in geosciences), did undergrad research in paleoceanography using Nd isotopes as a proxy for tracking changes in NADW and AABW, and I've never heard anyone use the term &quot;optical oceanography/er&quot; .  Of course it makes sense that it exists... I just never thought about it.  The more you know!  </p></div>		</li>

<p>In terms of painting, what about optical effects from Mediterranean light versus northern European lighting? The former has more blue in it or something, because the latter sees more rayliegh scattering through more atmosphere? Does the slightly different colored light shining onto the ocean have much of a contribution to how the ocean looks?</p>
<p>I found an overview I barely skimmed on mediterranean water color:
