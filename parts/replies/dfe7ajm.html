			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in Britain, but here in the countryside it's all in one, because it's got a long way to go to get to the recycling plant I guess. In cities you have to sort it and use separate bins; I think separate bins are being slowly rolled out across the country. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. When I was in Holland my seriously small town (think Sandford from hot fuzz) had 2 bins, 1 for plastics, street pickups for cardboard and a glass bin at the supeemarket. My cousin in RotterdM just chucks it to his single local bin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in a UK city and we have bins for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metal &amp; Plastics</li>
<li>Glass</li>
<li>Garden waste</li>
<li>Paper &amp; Cardboard</li>
<li>Landfill</li>
</ul>
<p>So even in the city they sort and separate the metal and plastics after pickup. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at a recycling plant when i was younger and desperate for cash.</p>
<p>Everything would get thrown together onto a conveyor. The rubble would pass first a crew (my station) that would look for things that shouldnt be there like trash bags, food soiled cartons like pizza boxes, wires, scrap metal. We would find whole turkeys, legit trash bags, fridges, ac units, bags full of syringes etc. It was a pain becuase all the heavy stuff would fall first then get burried by the rest of the rubble, so your digging thru the stuff on a moving conveyor trying to pull a 100lb tv or something before it moves down the line. Plus you had rotting stuff like turkeys/meat or food scraps. And of course all the bio hazard stuff like bathroom trash bags or a whole bags full of used syringes.</p>
<p>Then the next station had a set of rotating discs that were spaced far apart. This let stuff like cans or paper drop below onto another conveyor while the big carboard boxes flew over the discs into a bin.</p>
<p>Next the rubble would go thru a giant blowing chamber. Pretty much paper would get blown onto another conveyor where another crew would be waiting seperating cardboard,paper and trash.</p>
<p>The heavyier stuff like cans would not get blow and go on a conveyor to a big machine that has a bg rotating magnet that picks them up and drops them another conveyor. Again another crew would be picking theu the can line while another crew was sifting thru whatever was left which were clear plastics and colored plastic bottles/containers. All collected into there seperate bins.</p>
<p>Then anything that was leftover was pretty much dust and glass that was piled up out side. They used this glass/dust leftovers as a landfill topper once a landfill hill was piled to high.</p>
<p>It was a shit job since a temp agency was incharge of all the hiring. All the workers were illegals working with itn numbers, so they work &quot;illegally&quot; but pay taxes so I guess it wasnt an issue. Since I was the only legal person there i had to drive everyone and drop them off. I was pretty much working like 16hrs a day all while attending night classes. Plus the temp agency had a couple of bouncers hired as supervisors since people were falling asleep on the job. Shit job, shit pay but hey it paid the bills</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea somewhat. 10 bucks for me and 6 bucks to start for the illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>I was taking home 500-600 dollars a week which i loved since i was catching up on bills but the hours were killer. Id wake up at 2am and started picking up people, drive an hour to the plant to start at 4. Finish at 4 and arrive home at 6-7. Then I had to quickly shower and went to class which would last till 11.</p>
<p>Man I did that for 4 months. </p></div>		</li>

<p>isn't it hard/costly to separate?</p>

<p>People fuck up the separate bins enough that you have to do that anyways.</p></div>		</li>
