			<div class="markdown"><p>The Bloomberg article is good. But what bothers me is that whenever advances in solar are discussed, too often is the current price compared to the price in the 70s, which were panels made in specialized research institutes. The panels of the 70s were hardly commercial panels and therefore the comparison doesn't really hold up. It makes more sense discussing prices of the last two decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, but I think that's just the timeline most people use so ... people keep using it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/183447/us-energy-generation-from-solar-sources-from-2000/" target="_blank">Here is a graph</a> of solar power usage in the US from 2000-2015. It's gone from about 500Mkw hours to 26.4Bkw hours, an increase of over <strong>50x</strong>. If you check the graph, you'll see an exponential curve common to technological  products. The problem is, whether it's computers or solar power, people continue to see exponential curves in the past and project them forward linearly, so they miss the significance.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-13/we-ve-almost-reached-peak-fossil-fuels-for-electricity" target="_blank">more detailed BNEF report</a> about this too that's worth reading if you're interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the big advantages solar panels have at this time is for now cost reduction doesn't rely on basic science, it's manufacturing driven. If there is one thing the manufacturing industry knows how to do is drop costs as production volume goes up. Part of that is as the volume increases the amount of money available to dedicate to advance manufacturing processes goes up.</p></div>		</li>
