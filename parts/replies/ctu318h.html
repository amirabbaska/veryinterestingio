			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that, the next logical question would be &quot;Why does anyone use oil or gas for power at all then?&quot;</p>
<p>The answer is that is precisely what you mentioned in your first paragraph; gas and oil powerplants can change output very quickly, which allows them to respond minute to minute as the overall load on the system increases throughout the day.  The way the electricity market is structured (at least in North America) power plants are turned on over the course of the day as electrical demand increases, in order of cheapest to most expensive.  The nuclear, wind, solar, and hydro plants get turned on first (and are pretty much always on, barring maintenance or emergencies).  Next, coal plants, then natural gas, and finally oil.  This system means that gas plants are often online for only an hour or two a day, (with oil rarely being used) but, since the electrical prices are highest during this time, they still recoup their costs.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coal plants are switched on and off? I was taught (at a power plant tour) that coal plants operate around the clock because stopping a major turbine means it has to be shut down until it completely cools down before operating again, and this can take dozens of hours. Maybe they constantly operate on minimal capacity until demand gets high enough (instead of stopping completely)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two kinds of power plants. &quot;Base load&quot; and &quot;peakers&quot;. </p>
<p>Base load plants are generally thermal plants. They run on a steam cycle were water is heated to steam and then spins a turbine. The heat can be coal, oil, biomass, waste mass, natural gas, nuclear. Really anything that you can use to heat up water and make it boil. There are also Hydro plants that are a turbine run by water, not steam. They are designed to really be efficient at their full capacity. They can be ramped but they are slow to change loads and they are way less efficient at lower loads. Nuclear plants in the US run at like a 95% or higher capacity factor. So do a lot of the coal plants. They produce power at 100% of their capacity 365 days a year and only shut down for short maintenance periods.  </p>
<p>Peakers are plants like gas turbine plants. They are basically a really bug jet engine driving a generator. Or diesel engines. There are lots of variations. Some are heat cycle plants but they are really slowly being phased out due to there slow response time. </p>
<p>The way it works. The minimum load on a grid is say 1000MW. Basically it never goes below that value. SO you contract with a Big thermal plant to provide 1000MW of power. they run full tilt 365 days a year. Then as the day progresses and people start to wake up and businesses open etc the load goes up. So they have plants that start up and run to provide the extra. So at peak load, 3pm on a hot day when all the AC is pumpin', the load is 2500 mw. SO you have 15 small plants each putting 100MW on the grid. As the load need was buliding up, plants were coming on line to supply it. </p>
<p>The really efficient base load plant is getting a predetermined amount for their power. The peaking plants are being paid what ever the rate is. As demand goes up and supply is taken up the plants that cost more can start to come on line. That way the grid has the power it needs when it needs it. </p>
<p>The other issue is grid stability. Without really big turbine generators on the grid, (you only have a large group of small generators) you can lose stability. A bunch of generators sharing load with out a big generator to kind of anchor them in synch you can get problems with reactive loading and frequency problems.</p>
<p>So there are some coal plants that do operate as peakers. They know that in the summer they will need to be online and making power by 9:00 and will be going back off line at 8:30pm. This lets them be able to ramp up and down with out having to change rapidly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to cool down the turbine after a trip. </p>
<p>Some info (I'm a nuclear plant operator). Heating up the turbine takes about 6 hours give or take 2. You first heat up the shell and casings by passing an extremely small amount of steam through it. Heat up too fast and you will cause differential expansion and possibly cause turbine vibrations. Once the shell is heated you now can heat up the steam chest. The chest has differential expansion rates as well to worry about. Once the shell and chest are up to no load operating temperature, you are ready to roll the turbine at any time. </p>
<p>We start turbine heat up as soon as we have excess steam supply to do so. We spend about 6 hours heating up the reactor plus extra time for tests on the way up and putting feed pumps in service. So we end up getting to NOP/NOT with the shell warming done and only chest warming is required. </p>
<p>When the turbine comes off line for any reason, you don't have to immediately jump to warming again. We've been offline for days without re warming. It's a matter of how much temperature dropped and the differential expansion. Our turbine engineer evaluates this after every turbine trip. If the turbine does cool down too much, we have to reperform shell and chest warming. But if we are going to try and do a hot restart of the reactor we will just go straight into turbine roll once we have steam supply back up to normal. </p>
<p>Remember the turbine components are extremely well insulated. The condenser is at a vacuum and keeps the turbine interior evacuated from air, so heat loss is only through the contact bearings and black body radiation. Temperature drops slowly, a few degrees per hour. </p>
<p>Hope this helps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One point (or correction) - the absolute best source for peak loads, spinning up really quickly and reacting fast, is Hydro-electric. </p>
<p>How hydro is used depends on how much water is available. If there is water to spare, it is used as baseload, as the power is practically free. But if there isn't enough, then it is used as peak power.</p>
<p>There is a hydro power station near here that (at least for some time) was being used to to correct the 'power factor' of the area, to reduce losses in the transmission lines between us and the major baseload power plants about a thousand kilometres away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One caveat, not all hydroelectric plants are allowed to run this way.  Some hydro plants are what folks call &quot;run of the river&quot; plants and act just like wind and solar (you get what you get, don't really get to hold it back and use it later)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This works some places. Some places where hydro power can work, though, aren't even really fit for flow-powered hydro. There's engineering work going on to build gravity-feed hydro into the lock and dam system along the Mississippi. Nobody's going to back that thing up into a lake flooding the whole basin. There's already water crossing the low dams attached to the navigation locks, though. As it falls it could be powering local cities without slowing the flow of the river.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the unit size. At my company, the biggest are base load (~1000mw units), medium are controlled via AGC (throttle them up and down based on load), and we can turn the smaller ones one and off completely plus throttling. It may take an hour or two to get the small ones up to full power, so we try to turn them on based on the predicted load. When shit breaks instantly, we use spinning reserve hydro to absorb it until the CT plants spin up (10 minutes or so).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is steam the best stuff to use in the turbines; is there no more efficient substance? Just seems surprising that good old water is the best stuff for the job when it seems that every other engineering fluid is something else - hydraulics, lubricants, other engineery things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are newer substance being used.  Water is plentiful and powerful.  It has an amazing heat capacity swing from superheated to regular steam.  It's basically king.</p>
<p>Plenty of alternate working fluids are being experimented with.  Oddly enough, C02 is really pretty effective as well.</p>
<p>So ironically one of the most hated greenhouse gases can be used be for good.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another benefit that hasn't been mentioned is that it has good phase changing properties that make it excellent as a working fluid in a heat engine. Being able to quickly condense the exhaust from the turbine makes it really easy to move your working fluid back to your boiler. Pumps work a lot better than compressors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I would add that combustion turbines are starting to be used in base load applications.  The very largest ones are approaching 500MW making them suitable for this sort of thing.  No steam means the plant is cheaper to build.  Often there is a heat recovery scheme applied which will generate an amount of steam, although nothing close to what is needed for a large steam turbine.  This measure improves plant efficiency and thus increases profit.  Power plants have a simple metric in most cases = $/MW.  </p>
<p>Water has some incredible qualities for absorbing and returning energy - through a machine.  It is going to be around in this capacity for a long time.</p>
<p>This evolution in power production is a result of the changing market needs driving technological innovation.  There are complex power products that can be bid on which require flexibility only offered by fossil fuel fired assets.  Among these are a class of aero-derivative machines, which are smaller than baseload type and can be used to make a tidy profit by way of there almost instant availability (~8 min).  Money can be made purely for having the asset &quot;available&quot; for startup.</p></div>		</li>
