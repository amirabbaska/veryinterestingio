			<div class="markdown"><p>Programming providers own more than one channel. The more popular channels are used as leverage to get the less popular ones available by way of bundling them together. Basically &quot;You want channel X? You also have to pay for channel Y and Z.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They would have to start charging more then.  They can afford to charge $1 right now because they know that it'll get bundled with other channels and picked up.  Say for example HGTV costs $1 right now and you love HGTV.  If less and less people started picking it up, now you have to pay $6 in order to keep it on your plan. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. </p>
<p>An analogy that I like to use is this - </p>
<p>Let's say there are 10,000 people subscribing to TV in your area. HGTV is asking for $1 per subscriber per month. That means that at the end of the month, HGTV will expect a check for $10,000.</p>
<p>Let's move to a world where it's purely a la carte, and only 1,000 people subscribe to HGTV. Would HGTV accept a check for only $1,000 at the end of the month? It's highly unlikely since they had been getting paid $10k per month.</p>
<p>What happens then? The people who were paying $1 per month as part of an overall package are now paying $10 per month for just the one channel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's not quite that easy. If you could pick and choose channels, the cost of individual channels would have to go up because less people would be forced into buying them. Planet money did a podcast about TV bundles a while ago, I think for most people the costs would be similar whether they're bundled together or you get to pick a few. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Working in this industry. This is the only correct answer so far. </p>
<p>[Edit]
I've no idea how much Disney makes from ESPN, but it's a huge chunk that's for sure. Check this article to learn more:

<p>For those of you saying why isn't there an ala carte? Well, HBO Now for AppleTV is a good example of the coming trend. CBS is doing it, and now SlingTV offers a great alternative. Single channel, or small bundle subscribing is definitely here. Maybe not everyone has jumped on the bandwagon, but give it time. Props to WWE for being the first multinational to do it (correct me if I'm wrong!)</p>
<p>As for why does ESPN cost so much? Because people will pay for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cable companies wanted more money. Product companies wanted new advertising platforms. Simply put, greed. It use to be a thing that you wouldn't have advertisements before the previews in movie theaters. Now when you go you get 30-40 minutes of straight commercials playing before the previews even begin. Why? Because they can make money that way. It's why I stopped going to theaters. With online streaming services like netflix and amazon prime I hope we see a new paradigm where it works like this. Either I pay you to show me a video, or you advertise  to me to cover the cost of showing the video. Pick one, cause I won't pay to be advertised to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cost of producing content has gone up across the board -- people expect higher production values, HD, 5.1 sound, etc.  The equipment to produce it isn't cheap, and that's not taking into account stuff like production design. For example: a single fancy garment (one with embroidery designed for a noble) on Game of Thrones can cost $10,000US since it's a unique garment that needs to be hand-stitched. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So why not work off a subscription based plan where viewers choose the channels they get and pay only for those? I'm sure more people would be willing to get cable to see the current shows they like as they air on the few networks they actually watch if it meant they could pay that much less for the bill instead of going the less legal route if that's what they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does ESPN cost about 22x more than the average channel? That seems a little ridiculous. And forcing people who don't even watch it to pay for it seems very ridiculous. What gives? </p>
<p>Edit: yes I understand that people like sports, watching them live and that a lot of people only have cable due to sports, but shouldn't people who could care less be allowed to opt out? Especially considering that ESPN is the most expensive basic cable channel? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because sports are more valuable than other forms of content. Say you have a tv show, someone may dvr the TV show and watch it at a later date and skip past the commercials. Or they may just forget about it. Or they may wait for it to come out on Netflix or blu Ray. But sports almost have to be seen now, immediately. If someone wants to watch a football game, they want to watch it live. No dvr. No skipping those commercials. No waiting for it to come out on Netflix. If Bob's Honda dealership has a sale this Thursday, they know the most valuable commercial time is on a sports program right before that date because everyone will watch it at that time. Hell, without espn, half the cable customers would drop cable, why bother when everything else is on Netflix?  This is driving the valuation of both espn and the sports franchises themselves. Reality TV competitions (American Idol, Survivor, etc) have somewhat similar economics (though on a less extreme scale) which is one of the reasons why the networks love those as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make some good points, but...</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Because it isn't. While Netflix has a large library, it is maybe 1/5 of the content Comcast has on their Xfinity On Demand product. As a matter of fact, Netflix and Hulu, combined, aren't 1/3 of what XOD has. I've talked to many cord-cutters in my past job and it was always the same thing: Netflix/Hulu was great, but it ran out of decent content pretty fast. </p>
<p>Edit: if you got Hulu+, Amazon Prime, Netflix <em>and</em> HBO NOW, you would pay $32/month + $80/year, averaging $38.67 per month, not including ISP charges for broadband. Which isn't a dramatic savings over cable/satellite, especially when factoring in the lack of live sports and new episodes of shows.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Netflix actually doesn't have a great selection of TV outside a few choice programs and their original content. Netflix is more of a &quot;Blockbuster for the 21st Century&quot; whereas Hulu concentrates more on replacing your TV service.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sports is a big reason lots of people keep cable, I know it is for me.  Lots of other TV shows I can either record, find somewhere online, or catch a re-run.  Sports is meant to be watched live, in the moment, and if you don't and you're an avid sports fan, you will be following on Twitter or something so you have no reason to watch a re-run.  So while I'm ok with watching Elementary on cbs.com a week or two after it airs, or Doctor Who on some shady streaming site the day after it airs......I want my sports on a 40 inch HD tv at minimum, in real time. </p></div>		</li>

NHL GameCenter Live and similar packages can be used through internet on television, computer, tablet and phone. This season I paid $130 for the entire season and had access to live games from every team in the league. NFL MLS and I think MLB &amp; NBA are doing this, too.
