			<p>Why don't they provide an option to charge that $20 for service fees and channels advertise to me to add their individual channels instead? I probably only use about 10 of the 999 channels available and if they're about $1 each, that would ~almost cut my bill in half. </p>		</li>

			<p>Programming providers own more than one channel. The more popular channels are used as leverage to get the less popular ones available by way of bundling them together. Basically &quot;You want channel X? You also have to pay for channel Y and Z.&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>They would have to start charging more then.  They can afford to charge $1 right now because they know that it'll get bundled with other channels and picked up.  Say for example HGTV costs $1 right now and you love HGTV.  If less and less people started picking it up, now you have to pay $6 in order to keep it on your plan. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;  If less and less people started picking it up, now you have to pay $6 in order to keep it on your plan.<br><br>Exactly. <br><br>An analogy that I like to use is this - <br><br>Let's say there are 10,000 people subscribing to TV in your area. HGTV is asking for $1 per subscriber per month. That means that at the end of the month, HGTV will expect a check for $10,000.<br><br>Let's move to a world where it's purely a la carte, and only 1,000 people subscribe to HGTV. Would HGTV accept a check for only $1,000 at the end of the month? It's highly unlikely since they had been getting paid $10k per month.<br><br>What happens then? The people who were paying $1 per month as part of an overall package are now paying $10 per month for just the one channel. </p>		</li>

			<p>Well, it's not quite that easy. If you could pick and choose channels, the cost of individual channels would have to go up because less people would be forced into buying them. Planet money did a podcast about TV bundles a while ago, I think for most people the costs would be similar whether they're bundled together or you get to pick a few. </p>		</li>

			<p>So where do commercials come into all of this? More cheddar for the networks?</p>		</li>

			<p>I imagine both subscriber fees and commercials are necessary to fund networks. If they cut commercials, monthly rates would go up.</p>		</li>

			<p>Why do some people work two jobs?<br><br>Having two sources of income doesn't mean that one source covers the costs and the other source is pure, evil profit. If they cut one source of income, they would need to make it up with the other.</p>		</li>
