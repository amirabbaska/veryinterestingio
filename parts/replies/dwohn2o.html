<p>It's just North Korea at this point. The US, UK, France, China, and Russia all signed the Comprehensive test ban treaty, India and Pakistan have an agreement with each other not to test, and Israel is keeping its cards very close to its chest. Iran and maybe a few other countries would maybe like to test but haven't managed to build a bomb. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a correction: The CTBT is not in effect. The US signed but did not ratify it (and China has also not ratified it). It will not go into effect until India, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea, Iran, and several other states sign and ratify it. The US and Russia could start underground testing again tomorrow and not be in violation of any treaties that are in effect. The fact that they haven't tested since the early 1990s is more about an international norm than treaty agreements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The fact that they haven't tested since the early 1990s is more about an international norm than treaty agreements.&quot;...and also the fact they were able to build simulations based on the past data to reduce the need of actual tests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We still have the 1992 moratorium on testing to adhere to. Our subcritical experiments contain a diagnostic specifically designed to provide proof that criticality was never achieved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure India and Pakistan have no such agreement. There has been an &quot;understanding&quot; since 1998 (and before from when Pakistan got the bomb; 1983 till 1998) not to test, but no agreement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could launch a really big spaceship with nuclear bombs. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion\)" target="_blank">Orion Project</a> was pretty serious before we realized how damaging atmosphere explosions were.</p>
<p>Some groups still explore interplanetary or interstellar travel ideas that involve conventional launch but then switch over to bomb-driven acceleration.</p></div>		</li>
