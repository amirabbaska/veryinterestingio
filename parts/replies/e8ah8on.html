<p>Its like saying you can rent this bike for free, but ADHOLES TM attached a 50 lb weight to the bike that says ‘BUY ADHOLES!!!’</p>
<p>Then when people conplain about the weight and try to take it off, Adholes come back with the same 50 lb weight plus a 20lb bracket to make it harder to remove the weight.  Meanwhile the bike company becomes reviled and unusable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I recently heard that this is all Facebook's fault.  They told everyone that they were going to focus on video hard-core a few years back.  This led news sites and such to lay off tons of writers and hire video producers.  The sites did this for fear of falling further from profitability by falling out of Facebook's good graces.</p>
<p>Turns out Facebook users quickly decided they didn't like videos as much as Facebook thought.  (There's some claims that Facebook over-estimated demand for video by 900%!)</p>
<p>Here's a random article that's related, for more details, if you're interested: <a href="https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/pivot-to-video.php" target="_blank">https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/pivot-to-video.php</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. It's ridiculous how many people are trying to argue in favor of ads when the whole reason we're trying to block them is because they've gotten ridiculous. I didn't mind a banner at the top and bottom of a side or the wallpaper on the sides being a link. What drove me to ad blockers and a bunch of other addons was pop-ups, big ass pictures showing up on the site asking me to sign (with a tiny &quot;No thanks&quot; button at the bottom), sites tracking me even when I leave go to other sides, videos automatically playing, and several 30 second ads in a row every five minutes to watch something. You can't throw shit in people's face and get mad when they find ways to stop you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but on tv, you only get 15 minutes of content, and 15 minutes of ads.</p>
<p>It should be 25 minutes of content, and 5 minutes of ads, but they cant make as much money like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this right here.</p>
<p>its a safety thing.</p>
<p>i clean virus riddled computers daily , 99% of the cleanups are ad caused malware.</p>
<p>the remaining 1% is poorly secured systems (one customer had a driveby takeover, because they turned off every firewall so they could use remote desktop from home on their financials server)</p>
<p>Simply installing Ublock reduces the infection rate from &quot;i just got home and the 1800 number popped up again&quot; to  &quot;wow i havent seen you guys in 3 months&quot;</p></div>		</li>
