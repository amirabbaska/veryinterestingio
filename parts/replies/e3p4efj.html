			<div class="markdown"><p>The weight is why crossbows were the medieval shotgun.  The heavier the projectile, the more force it can deliver to whatever it hits, but with the tradeoff that it can't fly as far. In addition it can be preloaded, giving the solder a single shot before he needs to stop and reload (and therefore open himself to a mace to the face)</p>
<p>This tradeoff of &quot;more power, less range&quot; is why longbows were still in use after crossbows were invented.  Longer range is always useful, as is being able to pull out a shotgun in the middle of a swordfight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There was an additional advantage to giving peasants crossbows. It took years of training to become a good longbow archer. Any stupid peasant could be trained to use a crossbow in a single day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;more power&quot; part was a big deal, moreso than many people realise.</p>
<p>Crossbows were a very big improvement over the bow in several ways. Two of the biggest being the &quot;point and shoot&quot; aspect, and the lower need for quality compared to a  conventional bow (both longbows and horse bows).</p>
<p>The higher power of a crossbow bolt meant that it could still effectively incapacitate a man with a glancing shot. Further lowering the need for skill below just the removal of proper shooting technique for a bow. This meant that you could train men to be adequate with a crossbow in, frankly a day if needed, since the ranges of a crossbow and the situations you'd have such short training in would generally make height and drop a non issue, and because of the lower need for quality, you could have them mass produced and have most of your soldiers trained to use them.</p>
<p>Do they stand up to a more conventional bow? Under most conditions, no. But that's not really the point. They let you have much more men trained to be adequate, and they let you mitigate the advantage that am enemy skilled in archery has.</p>
<p>The ability to dominate in ranged combat could allow you to gain an incredible advantage over your enemies before their own skills come into play. The crossbow meant that even a largely unskilled man could fire a bolt, thus minimising the advantage of archery.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>If I remember correctly, the training time for crossbowmen was about two weeks. This means that they would be accurate enough to hit a target at short to medium range and be able to reload their crossbows quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Compared to the literal lifetime it takes to develop the upper body muscles required to even draw a good bow let alone get accurate with one, this is a staggering advantage. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Meanwhile, training a longbowman took years. Especially with the larger English longbows, where the incredible draw weight meant that it easily took upwards of a decade to train someone to basic competence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it should be noted that longbows would take a good 10-15 years of mastery whereas crossbows and firearms required less experience to operate. Of course early firearms sucked donkey dick and when they misfired could easily take your arm off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. The crossbow bolt has a much flatter and faster trajectory than an arrow, so it's very much a point-and-click weapon. It will go where you want to, while archers would have to lead their shots and rely on groups all firing together to cover a large area with projectiles.</p>
<p>You have to train archers from a young age, whereas I can make someone proficient with a crossbow/arquebus in an afternoon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can quickly train an army of men armed with crossbows that perform well enough in battle. The same cannot be said for archers. Also an army of 1000 crossbowmen firing volleys of deadly bolts is very scary for knights, much less ordinary soldiers, to charge into while being very effective.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don’t know where this myth originated but anyone repeating it has obviously never shot a bow before. Yes it’s hard to master, but you don’t have to master it to be effective. I would say that how fast you can build up the muscles required to fire a war bow is probably the greatest limitation. Especially if you didn’t have access to our modern nutrition and training.</p>
<p>There are lots of young hobby bow hunters who certainly haven’t trained dozens of hours per week for 10 years and can still reliably kill a deer 30m or 40m away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am very skeptical of this explanation. Medieval war bow arrows were quite a bit heavier than modern arrows, about 1000 grain according to some estimates, and as far as I gather crossbow arrows were typically also close to that weight.</p>
<p>I think it has to do more with the length of the power stroke, i.e. how far back you can pull the string.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because this answer is mostly bullshit. Weight and power aren't the reasons, it's aerodynamics.</p>
<p>Bolts are thicker so they slow down faster due to increased drag. Bolts also have less fletching so they don't fly as straight over distance which also increases drag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that sounds much more plausible given how they are about the same weight but crossbow bolts are shorter and fatter. Medieval crossbows could not be pulled back very far so you could not have long bolts unless if your crossbow was huge and as someone else said you may also need robust bolts to handle the force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's both. The crossbow arrow needs to be stronger to withstand the shorter-but-stronger power stroke without breaking, which means even if it weighs the same as a regilar arrow it's still thicker, less aerodynamic and with more fletching.</p></div>		</li>
