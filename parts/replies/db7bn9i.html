			<div class="markdown"><p>3 1/2 decades ago when I owned a home in town, lawns were the thing. People notice lawns. It is the first thing they 'rate' you on, second is the cars you drive. I didn't get complemented on my nice paint job or walkways, but 'nice lawn', or 'you have a patch of oxalis growing on that end' or ' why is your grass so green and mine isn't?' Ridiculous. Life in town was a constant 'look nice and look proper'. Now, I can get my newspaper, prune my roses and clean my gutters in my underwear and mow my meadow acre bare-assed naked if I want to, and when I want. p.s. I appreciate you guys. You are hard workers and not given enough credit. I hope you get some nice xmas tips. I tip my paper'boy' 2 Benjamins every year.</p></div>		</li>

Being the bright spot in somebody's day or week is worth so much more as a gift than the money you're shelling out, and I guarantee it's appreciated. Good on you.</p>
<p>Lawns and the accompanying scrutiny are indeed ridiculous. I mean, if it's your personal hobby or your HOA forces you to keep up with the Jones' I totally get it, but damn. You could intentionally 'infect' your lawn with clover or creeping charlie, train it, maintain it, and it will look a nice vibrant green and live off frigging rainwater unless there's a drought.</p>
<p>The industry, the science, and the cult(ure) of lawns is just so far behind the times.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very nice insight from a professional lawn care worker. (I apologize if I messed up your title) it's great to have people who take pride in their work. And also are responsive to the customer no matter what business your in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.
The title thing is mostly a joke. People could call me a 'Grass Bagger' or a 'Gravel Chucker' (depending on what I'm doing that day), and I'd say &quot;Yup, that's the business&quot;.</p>
<p>I only really grit my teeth when people imply that it's easy. Sure, not Rocket Science by any stretch, but doing the job quickly and to a high standard thirty times a day takes a very special kind of dummy to do.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not a mere moron Ma'am, I am a <em>very exceptional</em> moron.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
