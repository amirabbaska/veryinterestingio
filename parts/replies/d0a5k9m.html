			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly what you said with the exception that the olecranon is on the ulna. The fibula is the usually smaller bone in the lower leg. Also considering how big our quadriceps are compared to our triceps, we need the extra assistance to be able to transfer that force effectively. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of this exactly, OP, but there's an additional piece as well.  Legs are our more load-bearing appendages, therefore they require something more effective for continuous momentum than a modified &quot;ball and socket&quot; (the ulna is actually my favorite bone, because the head looks very similar to the head of an actual socket wrench!). The femur is a thick, strong bone with a rounded end at the knees, and the tibia and fibula do slightly cradle it (along with connective tissues), with a very small dip in the bones. Because of this the patella is required, or there would no way to attach muscle very effectively between the two.  Legs arn't as good at sideways motions though, as a result, but they don't have to be.  Arms do require this and so the different joint actually provides more effective muscle attachment for this function, and greater range of joint motion.</p>
<p>But what about animals on four limbs?  They still have a similar system because most rely on leverage from their hind legs.  Our walking upright increased the size and strength of our legs, but we still use them as other animals do.  However, in four-legged animal's forelimbs you see the real differences.  They have a humerus close to their bodies (for the most part), because they function more horizontally*  instead of vertically and need the extra stability (while sacrificing some side to side mobility) making their front limbs more stable than ours due to the differing bone length (shorter humerus, but longer ulna and radius, in comparison).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is worth noting that the patella is really ancient, and has actually evolved at least twice - once in mammals, and once in dinosaurs/birds. Marsupials have proto-patellas, and I'm not even sure if monotremes have them at all. Amphibians and reptiles lack them entirely, though IIRC some lizards do have something somewhat similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So bats actually do have an 'elbow cap' (ulna sesamoid), which looks like it was derived from the olecranon. Their radius and ulna is also fused. Given what you said about load-bearing limbs, I wonder if bats evolved the sesamoid as a compromise between the strength of the fused forearm and the leverage of an anchor point further up the limb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gif doesn't explain the difference though. Long story short, the leg bones line up because they need the support more, the arms don't because they need the manoeuvrability more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The arm has a bone with a bump that acts like a pivot for the bits that pull the forearms. The leg has no such bump, and instead the kneecap exists to do the same thing for pulling the calves.</p>
<p>This is only an analogy, because I don't know enough physics to say whether or not they're the same principle, but think of a see-saw: It's easier to lift up one end of a see-saw than it is to lift one end of a plank of wood of the same length off of the ground.</p></div>		</li>
