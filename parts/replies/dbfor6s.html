			<div class="markdown"><p>This was shamelessly borrowed from Askreddit. Some dude was given a fairly innocuous prompt, like &quot;what question would you ask me?&quot;, and came up with, &quot;If you and a super intelligent snail were each made immortal, and given a million dollars, and the snail would spend all eternity chasing you, because if it touches you, you die; what would you do to escape?&quot;.</p>
<p>Took that whole sub on a direction they had not anticipated. They had not anticipated it at all, sir. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Presumably nothingness is outside the sphere. It's not as much some barrier at the edge. The universe is just all the stuff and energy that exists. If you moved past the furthest reaches, then you (part of the universe) have expanded into that void. </p>
<p>Drop a salt shaker on the ground. All the grains of salt are all the stars. The &quot;universe&quot; is the circle of spilled salt. Now blow on the pile in the center, causing grains of salt to fly outward in all directions. The &quot;universe&quot; just expanded to be a larger circle of salt. What's outside the salt? Nothing. We draw an imaginary line to measure how far the salt has flown from when the shaker broke. The Big Bang flung matter far and wide, but it's just a growing radius of stuff being farther apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I seem to remember reading that if you tried to move past the furthest reaches, you wouldn't go into a void, because there's no &quot;space&quot; out there for you to exist in or go to.  The expansion of the universe is literally the expansion of space itself, not just the matter in the universe.</p></div>		</li>
