			<div class="markdown"><p>Love this explanation! In the same style, here's an addendum about screenspace shader effects (ambient occlusion, god rays, reflections, etc), and baked lighting.</p>
<p>One day, a new client comes in. He wants something really special to show off in his manor's foyer. He describes to Cirino a scene, from a vantage point outside the manor.</p>
<p>&quot;The viewer faces the front of the manor, which faces the west, with the rising sun behind it, casting rays of light in all directions. The manor's rippled reflection is visible in the reflecting pool below, and long shadows are cast from the manor's many manicured cypress trees. Marble statuary surrounds the pool, and partially visible beneath the water's surface are the dancing patterns of refracted light from the sun.&quot;</p>
<p>Cirino thinks hard on this, knowing that Giancarlo is going to have a tough time. The wealthy client has offered a handsome sum for the painting, so he works diligently to describe it to the best of his ability to Giancarlo. At first, Cirino thinks he will not be able to omit all of the objects that are behind foreground objects, because their shadows will still be visible. This would mean he would have to fully describe every object in three dimensions! But Cirino, thinking of all the work this would generate for Giancarlo, cleverly comes up with a solution: as an addendum to the information he normally gives Giancarlo, he uses information about each object to create a description of just the shadows and their placement.</p>
<p>Upon receiving Cirino's description, Giancarlo quickly realizes the difficulty of painting the wealthy client's scene. He starts with his usual process, omitting the pool for the time being. He's able to figure out from Cirino's description where the shadows go in spite of not knowing about all of the objects that cast them. With that done, he moves on to the complex lighting arrangement. With his keen eye for detail, Giancarlo knows the position of the sun will result in shafts of light that come to a point at the sun and are cast outward from there in all directions, except where they are blocked by the manor. He comes up with a system:</p>
<p>&quot;At every point where a shaft of light may be cast, I'll work out with my protractor and the depth description from Cirino whether the ray of light cast by the sun will be blocked by the manor, or will continue on to the point I'm currently painting. If the ray isn't blocked, I'll lighten the painting there!&quot;</p>
<p>It's a laborious task, but Giancarlo, knowing the painting will be seen by the manor's many wealthy guests, dutifully carries out his plan in the hopes of obtaining future clients.</p>
<p>Now on to the statuary. Giancarlo has already painted the statues, but with the challenging lighting of this scene, they don't really stand out. Their carefully-crafted details are barely visible, a detail the wealthy client would surely be interested in. Ordinarily, when a statue is well-lit, the many subtle shadows on the statue's creases and folds won't be particularly visible. This time however, they are lit from behind -- the only light striking the statues is <em>ambient</em> light reflected off the surfaces surrounding the statue. Making use of his classical training, Giancarlo devises a scheme for figuring out where to put shadows and highlights:</p>
<p>&quot;Using Cirino's depth description, I'll consider the area surrounding the point I'm currently painting. If the point I'm painting is more deeply embedded in the statue's surface than the area surrounding it, it must be a crease or fold that light can't so easily escape or enter, and will therefore be darker!&quot;</p>
<p>Giancarlo uses his method to touch up the statues. In fact, it looks so nice he decides to touch up the manor too, shading the manor's intricate gables, cornices, and columns in the same fashion.</p>
<p>Now, on to the reflecting pool. This one seems like a real challenge. First, the patterns of light at the bottom of the pool's surface. Giancarlo knows these patterns are caused by light refracting on the surface of a rippling pool, which concentrates light in certain places much like a magnifying glass. Working this out in a realistic way would be a real chore, because it would require calculating how a ray of light refracts at every point on the water's surface, projecting the refracted ray onto a new position at the bottom of the pool, and then adding all of the refracted rays up to figure out how bright it will be. Giancarlo knows that some scientists have figured out ways of doing this pretty quickly, but the pattern on the bottom of the pool is so complicated that nobody can tell if it's the real thing or not anyway. So he fakes it!</p>
<p>On to the reflection. This part really benefits from realism. Giancarlo comes up with a clever plan:</p>
<p>&quot;Now that I have the rest of the painting finished, I already have the image that will be visible in the reflection. The only difference is the image in the reflection is distorted by the ripples in the reflecting pool. I'll just create a ripply reflective surface out of foil, hold it up to my painting at the right angle, and paint what I see!&quot;</p>
<p>Giancarlo takes a sheet of foil, and carefully creases bumps and ripples onto the surface. He holds it up at an angle to the painting and, presto! He has a perfect reference for the reflection of the manor on the pool. He copies his reference onto the canvas, blending it in with the fake pattern of light on the bottom of the pool.</p>
<p>Finally, Giancarlo's masterpiece is complete! And with a few clever tricks it didn't take as long to complete as it seemed like it would. All proceeds routinely with Cirino's new clients from then on, until a wealthy family comes in with their beautiful signorina in tow.</p>
<p>&quot;We want a portrait of our daughter holding one of our estate's prized ruby red tomatoes to her cheek for her debut!&quot;</p>
<p>Cirino relays the seemingly simple request to Giancarlo. Giancarlo knows better though -- capturing the smoothness of her skin, and the glow of the tomato on her cheek will take a lot of work to get right. And on top of it, the many strands of her fine lustrous hair! Good thing Giancarlo's already thought of a few tricks to make this easier...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would make an amazing animated short--it's visualized so well, and so simply. You, quite fittingly, painted a picture with words, economizing thought. It really makes one wonder at the structure of data transmission in all formats, including this ELI5. This entire sub Reddit is dedicated to being an efficient CPU for an untrained GPU. Remarkable.</p></div>		</li>
