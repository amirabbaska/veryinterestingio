			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. Rare, medium rare, medium, whatever. Select the appropriate temp and it'll never go above that. Then it's a matter of time, based on thickness of cut. </p>
<p>Let it sit too long? Oh well, nowhere for juiced to go, so stays moist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I looked up how to sear a steak the other day and it came out fantastic, only used salt. Salt it very well on both sides and let sit for an hour then get a cast iron pan super hot. Toss the steak in and flip it every minute for 10 minutes, throw in half a stick of butter halfway through</p>
<p>I was super proud of it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got a cheap one from Walmart for about $80, and it works awesome.  It’s a stick-style one that clamps onto a pot or a plastic bin, so it takes up very little space in the cabinet and it’s SO worth it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Costs like 200 bucks for a decent set + vacuum bags. It's basically for cooking your meat perfectly, but you still need to fry it on a pan so it doesn't look like gray boiled alien meat. It takes some space and is useless for pretty much everything except cooking large chunks of meat. It's also SLOW. You have to start it in the morning/day before to get the meat ready for dinner. It gets really expensive really fast to eat that much meat that often.</p>
<p>Same with a rice cooker, it's useless for everything except rice. If you don't eat rice that often, it's useless.</p>
<p>Steam cooker, grills etc. are the same. You don't use it except for some specific items and unless you want to eat those specific items every day, it's just collecting dust in your cupboard.</p>
<p>Also it's one more appliance you need to manually clean/maintain/store.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>I'd never used a rice cooker before coming to China, but after a few uses you can never go back to boiled rice.</p>
<p>For Asian dishes, it's just not the same.</p>
<p>It isn't just the convenience (I see a lot of people here citing that as the only reason), it's the <em>perfectly cooked rice</em>. If you've never used a rice cooker, I think it's hard to understand exactly how much better it is from a rice cooker.</p>
<p>Every Asian household has one for a very good reason. Over a billion people can't be wrong!</p>
<p>I've lived in China nearly a decade, ive bought my parents and sister rice cookers and they were sceptical at first, thinking <em>great another appliance to put in the cupboard</em> but it gets used every single time they need to make rice.</p>
<p>It just tastes so much better!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha fair enough, I think I could use a steak cooker too! Personally I have actually never cooked rice but I wanted to start adding stir fry to my cooking repertoire; I mentioned this to a friend who said &quot;oh you just <em>have</em> to get a rice cooker, can't make good rice without it&quot;. I'm guessing a more accurate statement would be &quot;it is easier to cook good rice with it.&quot;</p>
<p>Anyway, sounds like they are preferable but I'm not sure when I'll be able to afford one/where I would store it in my tiny apartment, and I want stir Friday (yes like in Archer) to be this Friday, thus the ELI5. Thank you for your input, here's to hoping someone creates a steak cooker someday soon!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get that they're cheap, but I'm on a pretty serious budget. I do have $20 to throw around, but I'm very particular about not making unnecessary purchases. I'm not sure it's for me since I don't cook rice often, but then again, maybe if I had one I would cook it more often!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty easy to cook good rice but the rice cooker makes it easier.  </p>
<p>The tip to cooking rice is NEVER remove the lid while the rice is on the heat (or shortly after).  A pot of rice on low heat does kind of a neat physics trick where the whole pot is the same temperature (100C).  The liquid water can't get above 100 because it will boil off and the steam will condense when it gets below.  If you remove the lid though, the steam escapes which lets top get cool and the bottom to boil off and get hot so you end up with undercooked rice with burned bits on the bottom.</p>
<p>The rice cooker basically cooks it not to hot, for the right length of time then turns off the pot.  You then let it rest (with the lid on) for a few minutes to cool off slightly and, voila, perfect rice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rice cookers are fairly cheap if you don't go for some high brand. And with the amount of use you'll give it. It'll basically pay for itself in a very short time. Also, they're usually pretty compact (if you don't get the bigger ones) so you can store it in top of anything you want.</p>
<p>Like you I have a small apparent, and my microwave and rice cooker are on top of my mini-fridge, haha. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gonna say, the ultimate is an insta-pot.  At it's heart, it's a fully automatic cycling pressure cooker.  I know how to cook rice stovetop, but it's never come out as well as the insta-pot does (stovetop comes out less fluffy, more stick-together).  Insta-pot can also do beans from dry to ready-to-eat in ~30 minutes.   It can also serve as a slow-cooker.  And to boot, it's super efficient, and in the summertime, doesn't put a ton of heat into the house to prepare a hot meal. It's one of the best &quot;kitchen gadgets&quot; we've ever bought.</p>
<p>Not as cheap as a cheap rice cooker, but it's essentially 3 bits in one- a rice cooker, a slow cooker/crockpot, and a pressure cooker.</p></div>		</li>
