			<div class="markdown"><p>From the airlines perspective they want to board as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Which means they want everyone to be seated right at the gate of the aircraft to avoid having to wait for everyone to get their (late) etc.</p>
<p>At which point you want your most valued customers to be comfortable and settled into the flight as soon as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect most folks you (and I!) know are flying economy class. When we get on the plane we're not guided personally to a comfortable plush seat with plenty of legroom, given the drink of our choice by a smiling, friendly attendant, and generally fussed over like we're the most important person in the world.</p>
<p>If we were, I think we'd be more than happy to get on board, leaving behind the airport lounge with its crowds of screaming toddlers and over-chatty strangers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, except that you wouldn't be in <em>'the airport lounge with its crowds of screaming toddlers and over-chatty strangers'</em>, you would be in a private lounge with service superior to being on the plane.</p></div>		</li>
