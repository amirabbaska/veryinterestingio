<p>This is what is too often ignored in accounts of persistence hunting.  An antelope will make a series of sprints that a human can't come close to matching, stopping to rest in a covered position.  A pack of wolves can track by sight or scent, and if those are lost the chase is over.  Humans have a weak sense of smell, but we can interpret many signs of an animal's trail, and we can make mental models of how they would behave.</p>
<p>It is a bit of a mystery though how we got to be smart enough to do that.  Chimps aren't quite up to it, and you can't build a bigger brain without more food.  Sort of a chicken and egg problem- which came first, the brain to catch the food or the food to feed the brain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't the answer to that is the egg, as the egg (that becomes the first chicken) is laid by something that isn't quite a chicken (evolution)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine that if animals had the intelligence to do so, they'd describe humans as some kind of Lovecraftian monstrosity; implacable, motives beyond their understanding, and equipped with a bunch of weird little wriggly things on the ends of their forelimbs instead of a normal, god-fearing hoof or paw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Intelligence actually became more developed as a result of this persistence hunting/scavenging. It most likely was used by the first really bipedal ancestors H. erectus, to initially scavenge carcasses. Using our superior stereoscopic and color vision, they could look for visual cues (birds circling, smaller scavengers) to locate and eventually run to a carcass and by out running the other predators over long distances they could get there before the larger, more dangerous predators did. Higher Intelligence started to develop later on after we were introduced to this high protein diet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this, and after H.Erectus was able to use controlled fire, the availability of calories skyrocketed. Coincidentally, this increase in available calories is around the same time that we see increases in brain size from 900cc to 1200-1300cc. This is a huge difference, like 2 tennis balls worth of brain matter difference.</p></div>		</li>
