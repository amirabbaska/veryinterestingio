			<div class="markdown"><p>If you've ever seen a meteor shower, imagine those bits and pieces entering the atmosphere on a much larger scale all across the Earth. Meteors burning up in the atmosphere will shed dust, which will travel through the air and settle on the ground or in your living room.</p>
<p>A few thousand tons of dust and rock from outer space lands on Earth each year. That sounds like a lot, but across the entire Earth's surface it pales in comparison to what's already here so we really don't notice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, it's pretty easy to collect! A significant amount of magnetic material in dusty/dirty areas are tiny bits of meteorite. You can find and separate them pretty easily by covering a very strong magnet with a protective layer (think sandwich bags, cling wrap or paper), and brushing it along the dusty surface. The magnetic particles will stick to the magnet, and you can separate them later by cleaning the dirt off of the protective layer, leaving the particles to stick to the magnet. After that, it's a matter of carefully removing the protective layer and emptying the remaining meteorite particles into a container of your choosing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It gets up with hot air and then it falls down with the cold air, air always circulate in a room, even without some apparent &quot;wind source&quot; and these particles are light enough to just drift along. Or just gusts of wind from open windows etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can actually be deadly. Sometimes people walk into abandoned mines along perfectly flat corridors in which the top half is normal air and the bottom half is mainly heavier CO2. It seems fine walking in, but once they turn around to walk out, they're walking through mixed up air that's 50% CO2 and sometimes they don't make it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all of the stuff mentioned in the previous post being carried around by low-strength air currents. It's not falling from the ceiling, it's just that it's not dense enough to settle in the kinds of air currents generated by human activity (HVAC, wake of you walking around, etc.).</p></div>		</li>
