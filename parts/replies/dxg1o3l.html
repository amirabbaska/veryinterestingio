<p>Was deployed with a joint U.K./USA operation and lived with some U.K. guys for 9 months..... the majority of our culture and beliefs really are pretty much the same. At least who is in each of our military. There was also ~5 or 6 other nato countries there</p>
<p>The brits were by far the easiest for our guys to integrate with and get along with. </p></div>		</li>

I feel like your military bases don’t displace you from society quite like the US army tends to. Some of our bases are in the middle of absolutely nowhere, an hour minimum to any sort of non military people</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many Americans consider the UK to be a very friendly foreign country, and don’t consider Canada to be a foreign country at all (except perhaps in a technical legal sense). </p>
<p>Are there differences?  Sure. But from a Michigander or Ontario perspective, the folks right on the other side of the border are arguably less “foreign” (in the sense of “distinctly different culture”) than, say, Louisiana or francophone Quebec. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the culture point, that's also a factor with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes" target="_blank">Five Eyes</a>. Our closest intelligence sharing allies are all the main English speaking countries, US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Canada wins out being next door and the UK wins out being the #1 European ally and also having a strong military. Aus &amp; NZ are a bit far away and not as strategically located as they were when battling Japan in WWII.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Given the rising tensions with NK and China, Aus &amp; NZ would def have an important strategic role again of we ever went to war with those countries.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe the shared language is the reason why the UK is considered to edge out France as the USA's closest ally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this mainly it although I think cultural similarities also play a part - for a long time, a substantial chunk of the people living in the US (at least those of European descent) were descendants of people from the British isles.  And even then, a lot the institutions in the US are modeled after those from the UK.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, what many Americans (and others) today do not realize is that fully one-third of American households just prior to WWI were speaking German.  The war changed that of course, but it is also fair to note that the US, a democratic state, was facing a political conflict with the German monarchy at the time. </p>
<p>Edit: I stand corrected.  The &quot;one-third&quot; thing was way overstated, and refers to some cities (e.g. Milwaukee) and not all.  Yes German was the second-most spoken language at the time.  Yes Germans comprise one of the largest &quot;ethnic&quot; groups in America (even today).  But no the 1/3 was only within certain regions/cities and not country-wide.</p>
<p>I must note that I am from Hawaii, where the &quot;one-third&quot; thing about the Hawaiian language at another time (late 1890s) was real.  I point that time out because the Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown in that decade, and was temporarily a &quot;republic&quot; on its way to becoming a US territory before 1900.  The Hawaiian language and many aspects of Hawaiian culture were severely repressed at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's for sure ... my mother was born in 1927; saw WWII as an adult. When I was telling her about my new girlfriend in around <em>2006</em>, and mentioned that she'd been a German language teacher for around 10 years, Mom's reaction was still something along the lines of &quot;Why <em>German?</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Like, seriously, Mom? It's been 60-odd years. Things have changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure! The US is founded on descendants of Britian. Even tho America decided to break free from Britian, they brought over all the culture, food, ideas, language, religion, education and everything they were raised with. Over time Britain calmed down. And then the US helped Britian fight off the nazis in WW2. Even before the US officially joined the war, they were trying their best to supply Britian with ammunition, bombs and planes and stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>France under Charles de Gaulle was very much against the american hegemony in Europe. He was a fervent defender of France’s « independancy » and was not fond of the idea of it becoming a second rate power. This was impactful in France’s relationship with the US at the time as well as with the growing European integration.</p></div>		</li>
