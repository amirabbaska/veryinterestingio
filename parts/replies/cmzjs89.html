			<div class="markdown"><p>There are unwanted cats everywhere that are feral and unsuitable for being pets.  Several cities have &quot;catch and release&quot; programs where you essentially capture the feral, take it to the vet for spay/neutering and shots, then release them back into the wild.  It keeps the population down and keeps them from spreading disease.</p>
<p>My mother (who runs the colony with my help) worries that their incisions might become infected, so we keep them in an outdoor kennel until they're healed.  Because we feed them and built little shelters for them to keep warm during the winter, they tend to linger around our property.</p>
<p>Protip, and this is important: if you see a neighborhood cat with the tip of his hear cleanly docked, that's a signal to animal control and other vets that it's a feral that is being taken care of by someone.  The vets do it when they get the surgery so that people don't try to house them and then give them up when they realize the cat really does not want to live with them. </p>
<p>EDITED: Just to clarify, the docking also shows vets that the cat has already been fixed so they don't try to do the surgery again.  But typically, a person that cares enough to trap them also cares enough to keep them safe and fed, so the two go hand-in-hand.</p></div>		</li>

<p>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!</p>
<p>The tip of the ear being docked is a sign that the (feral) cat has been spayed/neutered! This is to avoid a cat being caught a second time only for the vet to find it's already been done!</p></div>		</li>

<p>My local no-kill shelter gets a few cats every now and then from the feral colonies they maintain, when the cats get enough human contact as kittens that they'd clearly be happier in a home.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Bravo! This is <a href="http://www.alleycat.org/page.aspx?pid=431" target="_blank">really important work</a>.</p>
<p>I don't know that it's a matter of ticklish so much as it is not wanting to be overstimulated. After all, rubbing a kitty's tummy means running your hands over multiple nipples! Slow, gentle rubs don't cause the claws to come out -- and I've noticed that a lot of cats really, really love having their <em>armpits</em> rubbed.</p>
<p>I have one former feral that flops down and begs for rubs but has never, ever used his claws -- even without being taught that. It's hilarious when he grabs my hand gently and kicks it gently, all without claws.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.  It's <em>expensive</em> work, too.  10 ferals outside, and 7 kittens we raised who never wanted to go back outside, so they're inside cats now.  You really gotta love animals a lot to do it.  </p>
<p>We have one orange cat who makes a game out of it.  She's purring the whole time she's shredding my hand, but if I stop, she rolls back onto her back and the game starts over again.  We have a couple of cats who just sort of take it without reacting and we know which ones don't like it so we don't do it.  They're the ones who will get up and walk away if they think you're gonna touch the sacred belly fur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know too well the cost in dollars: I moved into a house in east TN that was surrounded by dozens of hungry cats and spent the next three years going broke doing as many spay/neuters as we could get subsidies for. We did get neighbors involved, and did give away a lot of kittens, but I can only hope that things didn't fall apart completely when we had to leave. </p>
<p>When we moved, we took four former feral kittens that never found homes for various reasons. One of them took two years to let himself be touched, but when he did, he went for it whole hog. He's constantly flopping down asking to be belly rubbed, but he has never, ever used his claws on us. He goes through the motions of objecting (grabbing, kicking) but always with his claws sheathed. It's adorable!</p></div>		</li>
