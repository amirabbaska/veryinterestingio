			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean if you go shoot concrete and or steel with copper and or steel cored ammo it will spark like a mofo too. Only source off the top of my head besides people recording themselves shoot metal is that loser who the dallas police blew up with a robot after he ambushed and killed some officers. There is a video of him shooting one of the officers and you can see his gun kick up sparks on the impacts of the surroundings.</p>
<p>Also another thing that video demonstrates is how gunshots echo and in urban areas it often makes semi auto fire sound full auto or as if there is more than one shooter. I can try to find the video if anyone has trouble. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there are far less overkill weapons to get rid of you. so you're save in the sense that no one would ever shoot a railgun at a civvie. if they shoot at you though, the sonic boom will probably tear you apart, but your body is so soft, the projectile itself wouid most likely just punch a clean hole whereever it hit you.  </p>
<p>hard to actually test, since nobody is allowed to put weapon systems in space where we could test shooting people without having to deal with sonic booms</p></div>		</li>

<p>I disagree. Look at the <a href="https://youtu.be/fX4ODh1g4eM?t=30s" target="_blank">effects of a large caliber bullet on ballistic gel</a>
(similar in material properties to human insides).</p>
<p>The projectile does go straight through you, but it's movement imparts such an extreme amount of energy that the pressure waves rip you apart. The linked video shows a phenomenon called cavitation, where the motion of the bullet creates a bubble of low pressure which implodes so forcefully it produces a shockwave.</p>
<p>That 5.56 caliber bullet contains roughly 2000 J of kinetic energy. This railgun projectile has something like 10^7 J of kinetic energy, thats 10,000,000 J. </p>
<p>Four orders of magnitude more energy (!!!!!). Humans aren't good at thinking in orders of magnitude. That's the same difference between walking a city block, and walking the Appalachian trail twice. </p>
<p>TL;DR This projectile would vaporize you. It would aerosolize your body. You would immediately cease to exist in a horrifying but scientifically fascinating fraction of a second. </p></div>		</li>
