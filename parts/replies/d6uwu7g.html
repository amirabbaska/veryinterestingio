			<div class="markdown"><p>The star is smaller, dimmer, redder, and cooler. It burns way slower, and will last for trillions of years. No red dwarf has died yet, in the history of the universe.</p>
<p>So the planet has to be very close to its star to be warm enough to be habitable. It orbits once every 11 Earth days. It's likely to be tidally locked, which means that it rotates every 11 days as well. That is, one side is always daytime and the other side is nighttime.</p>
<p>So you have to be careful what you mean by &quot;day&quot; here. The &quot;sidereal&quot; day - the actual period of rotation of the planet - is likely to be 11 days. The &quot;solar&quot; day - the time from noon to noon - is likely to be essentially <em>forever</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You might get something odd happening, like a red dwarf colliding and merging with another star, and the resulting more massive star goes supernova or something. But a lone red dwarf will last for a long long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All stars experience some level of convection of material inside them. This is useful because it takes unused hydrogen closer to the core of the star. Medium, large, and massive stars experience this benefit less and less because the convecting material can't reach the core (where the majority of fusion takes place) through all the layers. Red dwarfs, however, fully enjoy the benefit of convection and so will use up the majority of its fuel. That, combined with the less intense gravity of the smaller star, is what lets a red dwarf fuze for trillions of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain how astronomers are able to find objective time comparisons between distant bodies like this planet and the Earth? I thought relativity means there is no objective time scale by which to make such a comparison, that time itself gets out of sync between objects at different speeds. What am I misunderstanding?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time dilation is caused by large speeds, or large gravitational fields.</p>
<p>You only get large enough gravitational to cause a significant effect if you're basically right on the surface of a black hole. So we can ignore that most of the time.</p>
<p>For &quot;large speeds&quot;, the object's speed relative to us needs to be a large fraction of the speed of light. Even at half the speed of light, the time dilation is only ~15% (that is, we experience 1 second for every 1.15 seconds they experience), and at 10% of the speed of light, the time dilation drops down to 0.5%.</p>
<p>Most objects in the Milky Way are moving around at hundreds of km/s. Even nearby galaxies move are hundreds of km/s relative to us. Something moving at thousands of km/s is faster than the galaxy's escape velocity, and is considered a high velocity star. But 3000 km/s is still only 1% of the speed of light - giving a time dilation factor of 0.005%. So, time dilation is almost always too small to really worry about. It's only in some extremely high velocity gas jets where it gets important.</p>
<p>Proxima Centauri is moving at around 30 km/s relative to us, because we're in the same part of the galaxy moving at about the same velocity. So time dilation really isn't an important factor here at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How did you figure that? (If it was in the article, I apologize, this is what I get for redditing immediately before class...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it was mentioned in the Nature article?</p>
<p>It's also just how tidal forces work - tidal forces decrease with distance more rapidly than they decrease with mass. So you get stronger tides from a small nearby object than from a large distant object than from a large distant object. That's why the Moon has stronger tides than the Sun, even though the Sun's gravity dominates our orbit.</p>
<p>This planet is <em>really</em> close to its star. So even though the star is much smaller than the Sun, the tidal forces are <em>way</em> stronger than the ones the Earth feels. You would expect it to be tidally locked.</p></div>		</li>
