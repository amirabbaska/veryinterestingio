			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanna say that I'm an opera singer as well and I would be what is called a &quot;Bass-Baritone&quot; and there are a couple of famous/badass roles that are quickly associated with that voice type; think Wotan in Wagner's Ring Cycle or Figaro in Mozart's Marriage of Figaro. In regards to weight with this particular voice type, most bass-baritones that have incredibly powerful voices are in fact rather tall (6 feet and up) and weigh anywhere between 200-260 lbs which depending on body composition and actual height is usually not that &quot;fat.&quot; Most of the best bass-baritones--either colleagues or legends in the business--that I have looked up to in fact usually had very muscular builds (see George London's &quot;Leb wohl&quot; <a href="https://youtu.be/B24qmkKfK7w" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/B24qmkKfK7w</a>  or Greer Grimsley's Flying Dutchman <a href="https://youtu.be/p6DkNfNPt3s" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/p6DkNfNPt3s</a>). I'm not entirely sure if what voice part you sing has some type of &quot;optimum body shape&quot; that is in some way correlating to the necessary muscles that are required of the different resonating frequencies/harmonics, but there is a general or stereotypical kind of &quot;body shape&quot; attributed to many different voice types. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw Greer sing the Dutchman once. Holy crap that was amazing. </p>
<p>I said somewhere else in the thread, but height and body frame aren't tied to being a healthy weight or not. Large (meaning tall and big framed) singers tend to have longer vocal tracts and thicker folds. </p>
<p>Short Latin tenors have short vocal folds, making them sweet leggieros. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thinking about it, it would make since that visceral body fat expands the rib cage giving the diaphragm more room to operate. That's the only thing I can think of, although the visceral body fat would also make it more difficult for the diaphragm to expand. So, it's a mystery. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My voice instructor (herself an IU graduate and Chicago Lyric Opera singer) once told me that singers are not allowed to drink or smoke (as both can damage the voice), so 'all that's left to do is eat and fuck'.</p>
<p>There is an amazing amount of sex that happens in the operatic world, but it doesn't show like weight gain does...</p>
<p>Hmmm, well, I guess it does at times...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trust me, every time there is a &quot;enclosed&quot; and large work enviroment, there will be a lot of sex.
It has to be enclosed because you must feel safe that nobody is going to judge you for it, and it has to be large because, well, you need a large pool to choose.</p>
<p>People just love to have sex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I seem to recall learning about a method of vocal training way back in college that involved adding a weight to the bottom of your tucked in shirt or something.  I THINK it might have been the Suzuki method, but some basic google tells me I might be misremembering.</p>
<p>But the gist of the idea was that adding a weight (basically where the bottom of your gut would be if you're overweight) you increase the power of the diaphragm, or at least give yourself more control of said.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Suzuki is mainly a violin/strings method of how to learn music.</p>
<p>Lots of teachers will have you hold weight in front of you to help engage your intercostal and lower abdominal muscles, which are the primary muscles of breath in singing. It's mainly rooted in the Italian *bel canto*** approach to singing, though the Germans did a fair amount of it, too.</p></div>		</li>
