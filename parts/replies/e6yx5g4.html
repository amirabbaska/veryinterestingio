<p>If kangaroos jump into the road because they're startled, wouldn't exposure to more cars make then used to it and be less likely to overreact?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Watched a video on some domesticated foxes not long ago but they brought up how 'friendliness towards humans' was linked to genetic indicators.  So if I  had to guess, more vague behavior patterns might be more influenced by genetics than a learned behavior like the likes seen in chimps and basic tool use (i.e using sticks to extract ants from ant nests)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what your talking about probably happens and I have pondered on that aspect myself.</p>
<p>This seems diferrent somehow, the roos seem to be smaller than they used to and its only the greys that have survived. Where you get transitional country from woodland to desert where the was a mixture of red and grey roos, only the greys have survived.</p>
<p>Near the cities, massive populations have died over the decades leaving only a skelleton population that dont exhibit much skittishness. </p>
<p>Then there are the minority within that population that do bounce out from a standing start position. </p>
<p>Out in the bush you can see the process happening again, like going back in time; Huge death tolls as the skittish ones become eagle food.</p>
<p>Its only based on undiciplined observations, I just have a hint of insight that something may be going on over the generations.</p></div>		</li>
