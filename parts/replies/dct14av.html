			<div class="markdown"><p>No one is sure (theories range from the split of V from U in English or that lef came from luef in Old French which shifted to lieu in Modern French and later adoption used the newer pronunciation), but I did learn that lieutenant comes from the Latin words &quot;place&quot; &quot;holder&quot; which will probably warm the heart of many an NCO.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you mean a cloth with a tartan pattern woven into it, that's not Welsh: it's Scottish, from the Scottish Gaelic &quot;plaide&quot;, which I believe (although I may be mistaken -- Scottish Gaelic phonology isn't something I've studied closely) is pronounced something like &quot;plat-uh&quot;. (Scottish Gaelic speakers, feel free to correct me.)</p>
<p>In Scottish Gaelic, &quot;ai&quot; is pronounced somewhere between &quot;a&quot; (as in &quot;car&quot;) and &quot;e&quot; (as in &quot;bet&quot;) Although it's written with two letters, it's one sound. If you're pronouncing the word &quot;plad&quot;, that's actually roughly correct. &quot;D&quot; is usually pronounced a bit like a &quot;t&quot;, but sometimes like a &quot;d&quot;.</p>
<p>The Welsh word &quot;plaid&quot; is a different word, and it means &quot;political party&quot;, as in the name of the Welsh national party Plaid Cymru, &quot;the party of Wales&quot;. In Welsh, &quot;ai&quot; is pronounced like the English word &quot;eye&quot;, so &quot;plaid&quot; is pronounced &quot;plide&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In Spain however, the word used to describe a similar rank (leader of companies of men) was coronel [...]  So the term coronel migrated to English [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Oxford Dictionaries site says we got &quot;coronel&quot; via French, rather than Spanish:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mid 16th century: from obsolete French coronel (earlier form of colonel), from Italian colonnello column of soldiers, from colonna column, from Latin columna. The form coronel, source of the modern pronunciation, was usual until the mid 17th century.</p>
