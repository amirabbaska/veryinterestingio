<p>The transaction he placed led to his immediate discovery.  He placed an insanely irregular purchase of put options which was immediately being investigated by financial authorities.  And he was dense enough to place this transaction through a computer with an IP traced to inside the Dortmund team hotel.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. In that case it is not terrorism because it lacks the motivations we see for other kinds of terrorist actions. There was no ideological motivation that compelled the individual to act - just monetary gain.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to sound like a prick, but he actually bought &quot;put options&quot;.  It's an option, a form of derivative financial security, that allows owners the right to sell the underlying security (BVB stock in this case) at an agreed price in the future but does not bind the owner to do so.</p>
<p>The &quot;puts&quot; ended up being much more expensive than a traditional short sale.  AND the BVB stock price went up that day, meaning both &quot;put options&quot; and &quot;short sales&quot; would've returned net losses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, but I think it leaves out a crucial aspect of terrorism. Or, at least, could use a spotlight shined on this aspect.</p>
<p>In addition to being defined by the political motivation behind the acts of violence, <strong>terrorism is violence against non-combatants.</strong></p>
<p>This is important. The terrorist organization often considers itself a military or para-military operation and they may sometimes engage in military operations - but a terrorist organization will also (or exclusively) attack non-military targets. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that a bunch of recruiters are non-combatants.  </p>
<p>Of course, terrorist try to falsely justify their actions by declaring the targets valid military targets by some stretch of logic.  Ex: Your congressman approved the war in my country, which sent the soldiers, so shooting congresspeople are valid military targets, blah blah.  </p>
<p>The definition I've always seen was &quot;the unlawful use of violence or the threat of violence to inculcate fear, to cause social political or ideological change&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my understanding, &quot;terrorist&quot; and &quot;terrorism&quot; are not labels used by the actors to self identify.</p>
<p>I agree with your definitions, but I think it is worth adding that the use of the term has the purpose of dehumanizing the target. As such, both sides call the other terrorists for their military operations against non-combatants. </p>
<p>The ideological component seems overstated as every war is driven by ideology to some degree; it is the part that justifies the violence. The ideology itself doesn't create the need for resources, safety, or anything else. That's the part we all share. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes it does. The ideology defines the goal and the methods that are acceptable to reach said goal. It was the ideology behind National Socialism that enabled the horrible actions that were to follow. Just like it was the ideology held by Ghandi that helped define how peaceful his future actions of protest were. The finer details of each ideology matter, a lot</p></div>		</li>

<p>Terrorists' goals vary depending on their motivations, but causing widespread terror in the minds of populations is generally more of a desirable additional effect than the main goal. </p>

<p>This is important to remember. The reason ISIS attacks France for instance is to create a climate of intolerance against muslim people. Anybody who studied a bit ISIS knows they have nothing to do with Islam (except using the name) and their ideology wins nothing by attacking France. They kill far more muslims (their number one target) close to their &quot;area&quot; than they kill people in France or anywhere else. But they get fresh troops from Europe via brainwashing. To brainwash somebody, this person needs to be weaker minded than most and/or to be easily influenced. To influence somebody and convince them that they have to leave the place they live in to &quot;join the army of god to purge heretics&quot;, you need a category of people to be despised.</p>
<p>And since the primary scape goat for any problem in France since the 50s are foreigners/muslims, you can guess what happens after every single terrorist attack. The second something happens, every single news outlet goes out of their way to talk about terrorism and islam. Dude killed somebody because he hated him? Day one: &quot;we have confirmation that it's indeed a terrorist attack&quot;. Every single time. And it spreads to racist people. The vicious circle of &quot;I hate you all for another's doings and one of you will do the same in the future because of me&quot;.</p>
<p>It's interesting to watch/read interviews of people who went to &quot;join&quot; and realized it was all bullshit once there. You really need to be 100% sure that they're &quot;right&quot;. It's all brainwashing. &quot;Muslims are heretics, we are the real army of Allah&quot; etc. </p>

<p>Actually, the opposite is the case!
At least in Germany (can't really speak for France), news outlets are extremely careful with their wording. No serious news outlet will speak of a &quot;muslim terrorist attack&quot; when no official office has confirmed it.</p>
<p>It even goes as far as explicitly <strong>not</strong> revealing the ethnicity of for example a rapist, in hopes of not stirring up racism.</p>
<p>It creates a different problem of people feeling lied to by media and they will just assume things, anyways.</p>
<p>Assuming the rapist is a muslim refugee when a lot of recent cases in the media ended up being those?</p>
<p>Assuming the bombing attack on the concert hall in Manchester was carried out by muslim extremists affiliated with ISIS, when the majority of such recent attacks in Europe was muslim terrorism?</p>
<p>Get real. It is just human to assume these things after they have proven right so many times. Trust me, it is not nice to have your own biases confirmed all the time when initially you hoped that &quot;Wir schaffend as&quot; works.</p>
<p>Media doesn't need any smear campaigns at this point. At some point even the densest social romantic wakes up.</p></div>		</li>
