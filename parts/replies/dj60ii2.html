			<div class="markdown"><p>Kay I think I know what you're confusing here. </p>
<p>Like other people said &quot;toxins&quot; aren't a thing and they aren't stored anywhere. </p>
<p>What you're maybe thinking of is the lymphatic system. Your blood is pushed through veins and capillaries and while they're tight, things get through on a molecular level. So water, proteins, things like that. It's not a wall, it's a very very tight net. </p>
<p>The things that get pushed through the capillary walls accumulates in your lymphatic system and gets directed back into the bloodstream on its way back to your heart. </p>
<p>Now, what happened with your partner. If they have an autoimmune disorder then there is something in their body that their immune system attacks. The cells that attack generally hang out in certain areas like joints or the lymph nodes, or other places, it depends on what the disorder is. </p>
<p>When you get a deep massage it's similar to going and working out, you get a bunch of tiny tears in the body. It also moves everything in your lymphatic system around. The lymphatic system moves due to muscular contraction rather than a pump like your blood. </p>
<p>When they got the massage it likely caused damage that and either the autoimmune cells got moving around, or it allowed them greater access to the cells that they want to attack. This lead to the pain that they felt, there was no &quot;build up&quot; of anything. </p>
<p>-I work in vaccine research, I can try to answer this better, I would just need more background.</p></div>		</li>

<p>isn't that a little extreme? </p>
<p>of course most &quot;cleanse your toxins!&quot; products are pure bullshit, but aren't some things stored in your fat? like I know fat soluble vitamins are, just makes sense to me that other fat soluble compounds can also be stored in the body. </p>
<p>again, NOT saying people should go buy a &quot;cleanse&quot; or worry about &quot;toxins&quot; because that is 99.99999% bullshit. </p>
<p>edit: just read a bunch of posts below me saying the same shit. ah well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the only time you have toxins in your system is when you are in septic shock, that is, if your immune system can't contain a pathogen(usually bacteria) that produce substances harmful to you(toxins) as part of their metabolism. That only happens when you are in very deep shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend is correcting me now.</p>
<p>When there is too many toxins for your body to process then your body will store them in fat to deal with them later, and then during physics massage it is possible for those toxins to be released. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a doctor but sounds like the massage gave her some bruising, which isn't uncommon from a massage.</p>
<p>Depending on the autoimmune disease could have also distressed her joints.  My mom has mixed connective tissue disease and I'm pretty sure a firm massage would rough her up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no such thing as &quot;toxins&quot; in the body. As relaxing as massages feel they actually are more of a workout for the body. As another redditor mentioned, very deep physical massages specifically try to activate the bodies natural breakdown and rebuilding of tissue. Massage also increases lymphatic and circulatory function. All of this to say not only can people feel dehydrated from the &quot;work out&quot; of massage, but if they don't properly rehydrate they may feel sluggish the next day as their body continues to recover.</p>
<p>In the case of your girlfriend, if the massage was too deep that can cause bruising and pain the next couple of days. It's normal to feel sore after particularly deep work, but it should be the kind of sore after a good workout, not pain.</p>
<p>Basically, drink plenty of water and &quot;toxins&quot; don't exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Deep&quot; and &quot;vigorous&quot; massages are actually hurting you, in relatively small ways.  Muscle tears and ligaments strain, resulting in your body working to heal it, which can make you feel crappy.  Furthermore, many massage locations will be very hot, and it is possible to get a bit dehydrated from it as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What could that be? I was under the impression that the bacteria was stored in the muscles or fat, something that like if the body's pathways are too saturated or have no effective way at that time to dispose of the dead bacteria. </p>
<p>I would love to learn more as this is an ongoing, changing health issue for my girlfriend. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Muscles are considered a &quot;normally sterile site.&quot; The only places bacteria is found under normal conditions is on the skin and in the alimentary canal (aka digestive tract - considered to be outside the body). The respiratory tract is another common place for bacteria, which I believe can sometimes be asymptomatic. Anything else would be considered a bacterial infection, which is abnormal and usually very noticeably symptomatic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only part of your body that should have bacteria is your gut.  Everything between your gut and the air should be sterile.  The terms blood-borne infection and sepsis should be familiar to you, and indicate that bacteria is growing where it shouldn't be (and you'll probs die).</p></div>		</li>
