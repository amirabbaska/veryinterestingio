			<div class="markdown"><p>Breeder here also. It's really not necessary to use transgenics to fix the Cavendish problem--it's fairly easy to induce uneven chromosome number for seedlessness (e.g. watermelons, colchicine). Introgressing wild sources of resistance, fruit quality, etc. can be challenging, but really isn't the main problem. Everything in breeding is a numbers game, and given the amount of natural variation that is available, we can definitely breed a better banana. What we're missing is the funding/push that agronomy has: if we really had a huge banana initiative (read, lots of funding) for WGS and development of molecular markers, we could quite feasibly overcome linkage drag. Another factor to consider is that since Cavendish is so widely planted, it would take a LOT of vegetative propagation and starting over for growers. We see this a lot with horticultural crops like apple--there are many cultivars out there with superior fruit quality and disease resistance compared to the standard Red Delicious, Granny Smith, Fuji, etc., but growers are (quite reasonably) unwilling to start over with new scions, wait years to reach commercial production levels, and so on. So there is a preference for more management inputs rather than a change in genetics. BUT, basically, there's not enough demand for cultivar improvement to change the status quo now. Probably depends a lot on how Fusarium develops in the next few years, given climate change and banana management practices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is the main challenge for plant breeding, how can we make a line that is worth adopting especially if the current standards aren't &quot;broke&quot; yet. Hell growers of annual crops can be slow to change varieties and they get to start with a clear slate every year. Even if a resistant cultivar is found it still needs to be bred up to the agronomic standards that Cavendish has. I know colchicine is a trick that can be employed but we still have to deal with the fact that a cultivar that can replace the Cavendish hasn't been found yet. But if funding can be secured than an improvement program and creation of more refined elite breeding lines should be created so that the banana industry can act quicker for future issues (and we both know something new always pops up). I also typed this late at night so I wasn't going to go into detail about every aspect of the issue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't aware that this fusarium species had developed fungicide resistance, though I'm not familiar with the selection pressure a population would be under in a banana production system.  Efflux transporters are typically associated with the DMIs but they are the rarest mechanism of resistance.  I would say that target site alterations (point mutations) are more concerning as they render the chemical useless.  I am a plant pathologist who studies fungicide resistance, among other things.  I think this was one of the more informative comments that I have read thus far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I meant in a more general sense there have been some species that are fungicide resistant, I have no idea about this one as I don't study banana. I probably didn't explain it as well as a pathologist would (probably got a few things wrong too), this is just how I understand it from a breeding perspective. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given the propensity of Fusarium species to reproduce I would imagine that this is a major issue in banana production.  Like I said, a well thought out post!</p></div>		</li>
