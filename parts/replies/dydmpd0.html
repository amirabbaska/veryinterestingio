			<div class="markdown"><p>There's Promethium at 61 too. Also not transuranic, but is a lathanide, so appears in the upper of the two row sections we traditionally place underneath the main periodic table.</p>
<p>If Wikipedia is accurate, there's actually less Promethium in the crust from decay of other elements at any one time than there is Technetium, but that goes to show that there exists some of each on Earth, stable or not, even if they're effectively inaccessible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a supply of helium trapped in the crust, still. It's limited and the US has like 95% of the world's potential supply. When they finish extracting it, they have no real plan for replacing their supply and it's needed for some tech manufacturing. Buy now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's plenty of He still left in the crust. Massive amounts of He are vented to the atmosphere as a waste product of natural gas extraction. The problem is that price for He is so depressed due to the US Congress ordering the National Helium Reserve sold off that there's little economic incentive at the moment to try and capture it.</p></div>		</li>
