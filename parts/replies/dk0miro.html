<p>Firstly, yes, you are correct. Idiots have indeed used the Internet to create homogeneous echo chambers to re-enforce their preconceived notions on subjects that they have no expertise in. In this case, the subject is science.</p>
<p>But let's be fucking real here. These same people would be idiots without the internet too. </p>
<p>If anything, the Internet is the greatest <em>enemy</em> to anti-intellectualism, as it places all the once-difficult to find information within the fingertips of anyone who wants to know. </p>
<p>Yes, you described <em>how</em> these people are existing in the current techno-cultural climate, but you cannot blame the Internet for their existence. They existed before, and in much, much, much larger quantities than today (did 1894 Mr. Evangelical &quot;government sucks&quot; FarmBoy in Louisiana believe in scientific progression and the destruction of anti-intellectualism? Very likely the answer is no).</p>
<p>It's just that the Internet has given them a voice to be heard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before they had to confront people that disagreed with them, and had nothing to back up their bigotry. Now there's a world of pseudoscience at their fingertips.</p>
<p>Phrenology didn't die, it just lept on the internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for clarification, are you claiming that the internet has been an overall <em>detriment</em> to science and progression of the human mind? Because I don't think you do, despite the fact that it is highly implied.</p>
<p>Not necessarily. These people could still have their own pseudoscience.</p>
<p>Or -  if they are sufficiently ignorant, they can claim that science is irrelevant and completely bogus. You still won't be convincing them, and many people will still believe in their values.</p>
<p>Get a televised debate among a regressive, racist, anti-intellectual Evangelical Pastor (making him pastor so that he at least has an articulate way of speaking, like his opponent) and a genius scientist in 1920, magically have the debate seen by every person in the USA, and I guarantee you that the level of immunity of the anti-science group will be just as high, if not higher, than today.</p>
<p>At least today people accept that at least the <em>idea</em> of science is good. Some people just deny science that contradicts their world view - cognitive dissonance. </p>
<p>Militantly delusional people living in echochambers have always existed. If you want a some examples off the top of my head, I'll give you one: the KKK. Nazi's. </p>
<p>There's no denying that we are at a point where science deniers are most easily debunked. And this is directly due to technology like the Internet.</p></div>		</li>
