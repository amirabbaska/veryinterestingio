			<div class="markdown"><p>Personal anecdote but I used to work as a gas meter reader and I found that the best way to deal with accidentally walking into a yard with a dog(provided it wasn't obviously and immediately agro) was to stand there looking away, but keeping an eye on it in my peripheral vision, and let it approach me on its own terms and sniff my shoes or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to be a delivery man and so I had dogs of all types come at me every which way you can imagine and I settled them all down the same way: treats. This is why you should never rely on a dog to protect you, they will always side with a person who is offering them delicious smelling food. I saw huge snarling snapping dogs turn and roll on their backs and whimper for second Begn strip. It doesn't help that most agro dogs are that way because they are under fed or abused by their owners, so offering some extra yummy free food and maybe even a little affection always worked out great for me. Never got nipped once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That really varies from dog to dog and person to person. My parents have a dog who is extremely friendly and lose pizza. If you had a pizza you could probably walk into their house and clean them out. But if are at all threatening to my mom or my nephew, you're fucked. That dog absolutely loves me but if I wrestle with my nephew my ass is getting bit. Doesn't matter if I have cookies or pizza or a 5 pound steak. </p>
<p>If you come up to the house he'll probably bark at you but as long as you're not threatening he won't mind. Hell keep an eye on you though and will happily take cookies from you, but there are still people he'll put above all else. I probably come below pizza, but I understand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a hugely false.  A dog knows not to eat during confrontation,  Why do you think throwing food at a dog in a dog fight does nothing?  I think you're mistaking defensive and aggressive.</p>
<p>I have met plenty of dogs that when snarly quickly glance at what you throw to them, and then continue the &quot;fuck off I'll kill you&quot; stance.  My dogs also show this with some new people until I show they are not dangerous.</p>
<p>Prime examples, trained attack dogs, police dogs, fighting dogs.  Not one of them will stop in their tracks to eat and let someone in their den/get away.  You just had a run of dogs with shitty owners, or dogs that were leery of strangers.  Aggressive and leery dogs are a huge difference.  Leery will seem aggressive because you have not established your intent yet.  Aggressive means it doesn't give a shit, it wants you gone.  </p>
<p>Claiming dogs are bad at protecting is a really poor statement with what you follow it with.  So you expect a dog that isn't taught them he/she has the role of defense to defend without failure?  Guard dogs, and pet dogs are very different.  Not to mention if you gave my dog a treat, and then hit me, you'd best run because my dogs will jump the fence and chase you down.  I had my stupid neighbour start screaming at me, and jabbing his finger into my chest last summer, and my dogs cleared my fence and stood him down until he was inside his house.  This is a neighbour that pets them when he walks by.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This. Alpha dog reasoning is so outdated it needs carbon dating to time.  </p></div>		</li>
