<p>HOW DID MAX PLANCK DO IT?</p>

<p>Planck didn't calculate the Planck length exactly, he just found the Planck constant. </p>
<p>The value of the Planck constant came from fitting experimental data on blackbody radiation. if the Planck constant was a little higher, then sunlight would look a little redder. If the Planck constant was a little lower, then sunlight would look a little bluer. Because experimentalists had precisely measured the blackbody spectrum at well defined temperatures, Planck was able to deduce the value of  the Planck constant to within about 1% of the true value, well over 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Now, to state the obvious, the exact number that we use to represent the Planck constant depends on the units we use. It is 6.626 x 10^(-34) kg*m^(2)/s, but it is also 4.135 x 10^(-15) eV*s. Plank realized that if he picked the &quot;right&quot; units, then Planck's constant could be just equal to 1, and we wouldn't have to bother remembering it. In fact, if you picked the right units you could make Planck's constant, the speed of light, the gravitational constant, the Coulomb constant, and the Boltzmann constant all equal to 1. These are sometimes called the natural units, because they are defined by the laws of physics instead of referencing specific objects in the universe, like a lump of metal stored in the suburbs of Paris. Since we have 5 constants, we need to define different 5 units to set them all equal to one.</p>
<p>From this point on finding the actual values of these Planck units just requires inverting a few equations. You can see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units" target="_blank">this process described on wikipedia</a>, for instance.</p>

<p>What is hbar? </p>

<p>Easy to look this one up, but this is the &quot;reduced Planck constant&quot;, i.e. the Plank constant divided by 2π. </p></div>		</li>

<p>He actually did introduce the Planck units. He wrote that this new constant allows the construction of masses, lengths and times just from physical constants, something that was impossible before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;new metric system&quot; that has the natural units all equal 1 could be nice. But then again, maybe it would actually be horrible for everyday use.<br />
Still, it could make sense. Is there any system actually using this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each of these units has a &quot;dimension&quot;, for c as it is a speed this is &quot;length / time&quot; or &quot;L / T' for hbar this is Mass⋅Length^2 /Time and for G this is Length^3 /Time^2  / Mass</p>
<p>You can only combine these in one way to get a length</p>
<p>hbar G / c^3 =  Length^2</p>
<p>So the square root must be the Planck length.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is difficult to teach without knowing what level you are teaching at.  We are both describing the thoughts that Planck had when he derived this length, but as you don't know any physics this is hard to explain.</p>
<p>You are aware things have dimensions I assume, like volume or time. If I multiply three lengths together, I have a volume.  If I divide a length by time, I get something with units of speed.  This is the principle we are trying to convey.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was calculated with a tool called dimensional analysis (which is a lot less complicated than it sounds). Basically you take constants and try to think of a way to combine them in a way that produces a new constant with the desired units. The units of the known constants were</p>
<p>hbar : kg ⋅ m^2 ⋅ s^−1</p>
<p>G : m^3 ⋅ kg^-1 ⋅ s^-2</p>
<p>c : m ⋅ s^-1</p>
<p>where m is for meters, kg is of kilograms, s is for seconds. The only way to combine these constants into a new new constant with units of meters is</p>
<p>L =  sqrt ( hbar G / c^3 )</p>
<p>Thus Planck's constant was defined. The philosophy for why it's significant is that gravity, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics are all extremely important theories of the universe, and hbar, G, and c all appear very prominently in the equations of those theories. If we were to combine those theories we would likely get equations that have constants which are combinations of those constants. The planck length is one such constant. I believe later on a more sophisticated calculation emerged, which showed it was the smallest possible measurable length scale.</p>
<p>tldr: dimensional analysis is a tool for getting a result when you don't understand that much about the problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Up to numerical prefactors. You could easily use the not reduced Planck constant, or 8 pi G, for example.</p></div>		</li>
