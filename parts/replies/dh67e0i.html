			<div class="markdown"><p>The method is called TDR (time-domain reflectometry) for electrical conductors or OTDR (optical time-domain reflectometry) for fiber optics. </p>
<p>Without getting too deep into transmission lines, it's enough to say electricity bounces off of a broken end of a conductor in the same way your voice echos back in a closed pipe. Timing how long it takes for the reflection to come back will determine the distance to the break. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's not ELI5, but you can pulse a high voltage, low amperage, Alternating current through a broken wire, and trace that break with an RF (radio frequency) receiver tuned to the same frequency as the Alternating current you're feeding the wire.   the wire acts as an antenna and you can find the rough area where the signals spread out instead of following the path of the cable/wire consistently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's even easier than that, most of the meters can send the pulse down the line and listen, there is a sharp impedance change at the break and this will cause a reflection backwards down the line. You just wait for the response with a timer and you can figure out the distance. Then pull up a map and find out where that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its called a time domain reflectometer. Most good network cable testers have them built in now and you can buy one for less than a thousand</p>
<p>The ones they use for long distance are probably more expensive though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you've seen cross sections of long haul cables, they have fiber optics in the jacketing. By shooting laser pulses into the fiber and measuring the reflection time, you can calculate how far away the first break is. Using multiple fibers, you can get a better picture of what the nature of the damage is. </p></div>		</li>
