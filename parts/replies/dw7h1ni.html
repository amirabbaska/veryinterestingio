			<div class="markdown"><p>You gotta play the long con. Borrow money from the the first time and pay it back. Once you pay it back and they know you're reliable they'll likely be comfortable extending credit/loans to you in future. Over time they may even be willing to give you greater sums. That's when you take the money and run.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sentence 2:  mention the word &quot;bank&quot; or &quot;government&quot;</p>
<p>Sentences 3-500:  tirade of personal political beliefs and insults to banks and government</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aww man that’s why I read Reddit.</p>
<p>Sentence 1: wow this is interesting and I’m actually learning something.</p>
<p>Sentence 2: oh this is taking a weird turn but I’m invested now and can’t quit halfway through.</p>
<p>Sentence 3-500: goddamn it not again. </p>
