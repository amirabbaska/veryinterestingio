			<div class="markdown"><p>This stems from something called the &quot;dive reflex.&quot; Basically, for a water-dwelling animal, randomly taking a breath in is more dangerous than just holding it an hoping for the best. Humans are actually born with such a sense as we spend the first 9 months in a water environment. If you were to take a newly born baby and immediately put it in a tank of water, it will just sit there without breathing. After a few months, we lose this reflex however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When my daughter was born it was a water birth. It's not an uncommon thing and has been happening for a long time so we already know that the baby will just chill out happily and just look around maybe if they aren't distressed. </p>
<p>Here's a link on water birth, the first part has a nice piece on its history. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny, I just saw a theater production called &quot;Animals Commit Suicide&quot; this past Friday.  One of the main characters went on a rant during the play about these suicidal dolphins.  Good stuff, but only five other people were there to see it with me.  Anyone in Chicago-land looking for something to do should go check it out at the First Floor Theater in Wicker Park.</p>

<p>Elephants also have a lot of cases being distressed and go on a suicide rage, one fought a big jeep or so trying to protect its pack, got shot in the end. Nature is also full of heroes!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the topic of elephants, their sudden aggression is caused by a condition called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musth" target="_blank">musth</a>, where their testosterone levels spike up to sixty times their normal level. Once it's over, assuming they haven't been killed in defense, they go right back to normal.</p>
<p>It's actually pretty scary. Imagine if a temporary chemical imbalance that causes a blind murderous rage was <em>common</em> for humans.</p></div>		</li>
