			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there was a study a couple of years ago which showed that after being scared by a specific object, a person has an elevated fear response when re-exposed that object - but over time that fear response usually reduces back to baseline levels.</p>
<p>When the object was a spider or snake, the subject experienced an elevated fear response on every re-exposure, which didn't reduce with time.</p>
<p>The conclusion was that people are not innately afraid of spiders and snakes, but after being scared by them once, that fear never really subsides in the way it usually would.</p>
<p>I'll look for the paper when I get home from work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, based on that explanation there must be at least some function of it that is innate but... dormant might be the best word, and once “activated” by exposure, that innate difference never “switches off”. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At a &quot;layperson&quot; level, yes, but at a more precise level, not really. At a more precise level, primates seem to have TWO modules: one to rapidly recognize the threat and one to associate and store this memory. It reminds me of one of my favorite Simpsons episodes:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSimpsons/comments/3er5qf/you_dial_91_and_then_when_i_say_so_dial_1_again/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSimpsons/comments/3er5qf/you_dial_91_and_then_when_i_say_so_dial_1_again/</a>
The &quot;recognize snakes&quot; module is found in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulvinar_nuclei" target="_blank">pulvinar nuclei</a>, a region of the thalamus. Some researchers argued the evolution of this led to primate vision getting better too (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/10/did-snakes-help-build-primate-brain" target="_blank">easy source</a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/47/19000" target="_blank">primary source</a>)! Without getting too fancy (and risking pissing off the scientists), the thalamus is a more 'ancient'<em> part of the brain, and we care because more 'ancient'</em> parts are closer to our 'core' and thus, when they fire, they fire much quicker. <strong>I argue</strong> that this <strong>quickness might also mean a higher intensity</strong> (think, acceleration) and more intense responses that are also quicker are much more likely to be learned... think of burning your finger for a poor analogy. But even if i'm wrong about closer=higher intensity, the closeness alone is enough: our snake fears register much earlier in infants' minds than learned fears (<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53ebe472e4b00370a695515a/t/5404aa12e4b0f429034591e3/1409591826089/New+%26+German+%282014%29+-+Spiders+at+the+cocktail+party+-+An+ancestral+threat+that+surmounts+inattentional+blindness.pdf" target="_blank">source 1</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00080?WT.ec_id=SREP-631-20111003" target="_blank">source 2</a>).</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: we have innate machinery to respond to snakes and spiders but our fear of them is not innate.</p>
<p>(+) I use the 'ancient' term (or developmentally early, as this develops earlier than the rest of the brain) as a metaphor because most folks grasp the idea of how 'ancient' parts are more directly and rapidly connected. I know some scientists hate this term like they hate the term '<a href="https://www.jhfestival.org/blog/anthropomorphism-pros-and-cons" target="_blank">anthropomorphism</a>' (e.g., the water 'wants' to rise in capillary action), but I've found it even worse to get fancy with terms that require lots of passive verbs and fancy lingo.

<p>So my innate aversion to house centipedes even if rationally I know they are harmless and in fact quite beneficial, is actually an ingrained response because basically these are creepy snake spider things?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my understanding, also.  Fascinating. </p>
<p>We can safely add bats, bees and bears to the list of things this mechanism applies to.  Stuff found in caves, apparently.  </p>
<p>It implies that a vague description of a common threat is hard-wired by genetics and resulting brain development.  Confirmation of the specific identity of the threat is then required to activate it, such as observing a fear response.  This system prevents accidental, misguided fear of snake-like or spider-like objects (curved sticks, other bugs) and it also prevents contagious fear of non-threats (one crazy person can't make everyone crazy over nothing).  </p>
<p>Toddlers frequently have nightmares after their first sighting of a bear, in a zoo or on TV, for example.</p>
<p>This has some interesting ramifications for our understanding of the irrational fear of other races (eg racism, success of dog-whistle politics).  Our brains are the result of a million years of evolution, mostly under circumstances where fear of outsiders helped protect the tribe.   It also seems that racism is easier to teach, and is more contagious, than other irrational behavior.  Something to be mindful of.</p>
<p>This existence of this mechanism also begs questions regarding the development of sexual preference and search criteria.  There is clearly a hard-wired component, but also flexibility and adaptability.  How strong is the observation component compared with the innate component?  Are people impacted by a single, specific trigger?  To what extent is sexuality shaped by observations, culture, fashion, etc?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the topic of tribal influence on racist behaviors, I saw a study some time ago that showed more homogeneous societies were less racist than more diverse ones. They then studied it on the individual level and found similar trends: those exposed to other races <em>more</em> we're unintuitively <em>more</em> discriminatory, rather than less. If the study holds merit, it has some interesting implications for current goals of racial diversity, that it may actually be harming our ability to work with other races, rather than help.</p>
<p>Perhaps it has to do with what you're saying about triggering survival mechanisms.</p>
<p>I'll try to find that study again when I have a chance. It is not exactly politically correct, so it probably won't be the easiest thing to find.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How can you say that the entire reason we're afraid of bugs and pests is a survival thing, but then class racism as irrational? This &quot;fear&quot; must have come from somewhere, in exactly the same way as the prior comparison. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered if my dog's dislike of hoses is because they invoke a primal fear of snakes. He pays no attention if it's not moving, but as soon as I touch the vacuum cleaner or garden hose, he barks and snaps at it in a fearful, high-pitched way that's completely out of character for him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something to keep in mind as well, smaller primates are often preyed upon by snakes. </p>
<p>Snakes, raptors, and cats are the top primate predators and many primate species have alarm calls that specify thr presence of each type of predator and the appropriate evasive maneuver. Snakes are such a force in primate lives that a specific call is made upon sighting them. So it's not just the lizard brain, the primate brain could have experienced significant selection for snake detection/fear (as opposed to another mammalian order). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but the &quot;lizard brain&quot; (we didn't even evolve from lizards or any member of the Squamata lineage) is still under selection and mutation in all mammals, as it is part of their body. So these adaptations could be happening in the &quot;lower&quot; brain or the &quot;upper&quot; brain, or probably both</p></div>		</li>
