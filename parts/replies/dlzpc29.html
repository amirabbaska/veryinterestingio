			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up question: are the elements we've identified, or elements in general, at some basic point or another, simply created from the many different ways to combine the basic properties of the atom? </p>
<p>In example, is one element made strictly from a nucleus, proton, electron, while another is made from a nucleus, 2 electrons, 2 protons, and so forth with all elements being different combinations?</p>
<p>I clearly don't know much about this stuff but I'm gaining an interest. Thanks in advance. </p></div>		</li>

<p>An element will always have the same number of protons. I.e. hydrogen will always have 1 proton, oxygen will always have 8 protons, carbon will always have 6 etc. </p>
<p>The element can then have a different number of neutrons. These are called isotopes. For example carbon comes in 15 isotopes, but only three naturally occur.<br />
^12 C is the most common (99% of all carbon), with 6 protons (if it had 7 it would no longer be Carbon, it would be nitrogen) and 6 neutrons. ^13 C (approx 1% of all carbon) has 7 neutrons. ^14 C occurs in trace amounts and has 8 neutrons. This isotope is radioactive.</p>
<p>Finally there are ions, which are atoms with differing numbers of electrons. This is where much of chemistry happens because electron interactions determine how atoms bond with each other. These vary wildly but generally try to fill their outer (valence) shell of electrons. Neutral common carbon ^12 C^0 has 6 electrons total, 4 of which are in the valence shell (the first shell only has room for 2 electrons). Valence shells (usually) have a total capacity of 8. This is the reason carbon forms so many different compounds, because it has 4 electrons and 4 spaces in its shell to work with.</p>
<p>However the different isotopes and ions of carbon are not different elements because they all have exactly 6 protons.</p>
<p>Hope this helped clear things up.</p></div>		</li>
