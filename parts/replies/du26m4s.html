			<div class="markdown"><p>Also your brain burns a lot of calories, and while unlike muscles it doesn't need much protein, it does need a lot of straight sugar-power, ie carbs. So candy works well for brain work, though you'd probably want something healthier and less insulin spiking than actual sugar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Used to use M&amp;M's or Skittles. Got fat. Now I use blueberries/grapes/chopped up sweet peppers/carrots. Still gives you that sweet hit and your brain still says &quot;mm, sugar, I like that&quot;, just in a more healthy way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think for most people this method would fail. Eating carrots and chopped up sweet peppers? that's not gonna give you a dopamine hit.
you're studying and forcing yourself to only eat healthy things?? this just seems like a routine that most people will fall out of. exciting at first and a hassle down the road.</p>
<p>If you've got a lot of discipline, that's fine. But probably most people don't have that kind of monastery monk discipline.</p>
<p>If  someone reads this and is overweight, my advice to you is eat less at dinner and lunch. I'm skinny and I eat sugary snacks and am also in pretty good shape. ~95% of the people I've seen who are overweight absolutely <em>stuff</em> themselves at dinner and lunch and then try to rectify their weight gain by cutting out a few chips or snacks that make up maybe 10 or 20% of their caloric intake. And then their weight loss inevitably fails and they don't know why. Stop stuffing yourself at lunch and dinner!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not saying it will work for everyone, but it worked for me, and it could help others, especially if they already like those things to begin with. Just because it's healthy doesn't mean it's a slog/drag/hassle to eat. For me it was easier to just put down a container of blueberries on my desk and be able to mindlessly nosh than have the guilt of all the M&amp;M's hang over me.</p>
<p>When you're sitting down studying or watching tv and mindlessly snacking, all those calories can get away from you, and it's easy to go way overboard. Mindless snacking and eating because you're bored can put you in a huge calorie surplus and you don't even notice because it's just a few chips or snacks. Another thing that leads to weight gain is our sedentary lifestyle. Typically college age students don't get anywhere near enough exercise. The recommended amount of exercise for a healthy adult is at least 2.5 hours a week, but most college students only get exercise in terms of walking around campus. Exercise is also good for relieving stress.</p>
<p>Honestly, the best way to study is to get 20 minutes of good cardio in, get your pulse up to 140-180 for those twenty minutes, grab you a healthy snack and a water bottle and crack to it. I can find the study that supports the aerobic exercise and studying link if you would like. Plus there's actually nutritional value to fruits and vegetables. There's no harm in trying it, it worked for me, hopefully it works for others. </p>
<p>Want to edit to say this: I'm only 5 feet tall, female, 135. My BMR is incredibly low. I eat 1300-1400 calories plus exercise at maintenance. Calories are big deal to little people who have ridiculously low calorie needs. That's why I'm hard on skittles and m&amp;m's. For a dude that's, say, 5'7&quot; and 170, skittles and m&amp;m's won't have as much impact on your dietary needs as it will on me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>lol, you try eating just one skittle per paragraph! But no, I'm in nursing school, the studying never ends. But part of why I gained so much weight, aside from snacking while studying, was stress and not getting enough physical activity, plus having Whataburger/Taco Bueno instead of cooking at home so I wouldn't have to take time away from my studies by cooking and cleaning dishes and going to the store and blah blah blah. </p>
<p>Basically it boiled down to poor time management. </p></div>		</li>
