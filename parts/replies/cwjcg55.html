			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the closest to a professional kitchen technique as you can get. I worked in the prepared foods department at a health food store and after cooking a foodstuff that would be served chilled we would spread it thinly on a shallow hotel pan and put it in a special chiller that would run for small intervals of time circulating extremely cold air over the food to minimize the time spent in the danger zone and to prevent nearby foods from warming in the walk-in cooler when they were stored for later use.</p></div>		</li>
