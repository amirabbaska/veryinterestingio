			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for a Chinese company and the Chinese here drink hot water year round. In the summer, they say they drink it because it makes their body work harder to cool down. This sounds completely asinine, am I the dummy? Wouldn't it make more sense to drink cold water so your body can focus on cooling extremities? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sweat a lot.  It's why I never go to clubs during the summer.  A trick I learned was to keep a piece of ice under my tongue.  I go from dripping in sweat to shivering in about 30 minutes.   </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the point though. Sweating is your body's way of keeping you cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is because in Traditional Chinese medicine, they believe that  &quot;normal&quot; body temperature and the temperature of your inside is set. When you drink cold water, you force your body to heat itself to reach that temperature again. Hence when you drink cold water your body is constantly trying to heat back and is out off balance, you sweat more because your body is heating etc. When you drink warm water your body doesn't have to do that. I believe the &quot;inside&quot; temperature is around 38°C, but I can be mistaken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Chinese also have a general aversion to drinks that have not been heated, probably also because boiled water was safer, historically. Europeans solved this by brewing beer, ale and mead.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your body is heating itself up pretty much all the time. Sweating is a way for it to cool down.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you drink cold water, you force your body to heat itself to reach that temperature again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless you're drinking huge quantities, it will have very little actual effect, we're talking ~1/10th of a degree which is well within natural <em>daily</em> variations.</p>
<p>Consider: we'll approximate humans as being 100% water, so a 70kg human at 37ºC represents about 10.8MJ of heat (1J per 0.24ºC per gram), a large glass of cold water (0.5kg at 10C) is a deficit of 41.5kJ of heat, or 0.5%. Your <em>average</em> internal temperature may go down by 0.1~0.2ºC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe the &quot;inside&quot; temperature is around 38°C, but I can be mistaken.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Average internal temperature in humans is 37±0.5 ºC though it varies quite a bit (33.2–38.2 depending on time, location, gender and other factors, it can vary by over 1C in 24h), oral measurements will be somewhat lower (by ~0.5ºC).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The autoregulation is really important. The same thing should be tested without anesthesia to be able to estimate the effect of a cold drink.</p>
<p>If the response is not inhibited you will conpensate by producing more heat.
Depending on the area where you are this is good or bad. I will see if i can find a paper about this.</p></div>		</li>
