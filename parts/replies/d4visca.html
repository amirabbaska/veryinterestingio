<p>I just realised it might be worth noting that when I said &quot;absolute absence of other atoms that is important&quot;, I was really referring specifically to &quot;between the faces to be welded&quot;, so it would be technically be theoretically possible with <em>any</em> gas present.</p>
<p>So long as there are no non-metal atoms between the faces at the moment they are brought together*, cold welding is possible.</p>
<p>* and a few other conditions are met. I'm already in over my head! I'm just a chemist that builds robots, I only use these connectors occasionally.</p></div>		</li>
