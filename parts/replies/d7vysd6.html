			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent some time in a remote village in the Himalaya where they don't have any electricity (other than flashlights and radios powered by batteries.) This is exactly what happens. People might stay up for a couple of hours after it gets dark by the light of small kerosene lamps, but they go to bed pretty early. Everyone wakes up in the middle of the night and they check on their animals or do a few small chores or use the toilet. Cover of darkness is useful for toilet activities because there was no toilet or even designated pooping spot with privacy - people do it in the fields or away from the village.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which sounds kind of ridiculous when you think about it. <em>Before electricity</em>, people just got up in the middle of the night to dick around then go back to sleep to ~dawn. What, exactly, would they be doing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the theory is that most adults used that time to have sex (funnily enough, dicking around!)
I also read that mass would be held around that time </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Poets wrote, the religious burned the oil that remained since it had to be used up that day, people did prayer, reflection, had sex,etc. Simply remove ALL artificial light from your life after 6PM for a month and you will most likely go into a bi-phasic sleep cycle as covered here <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10607034" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10607034</a>.... during the time you are awake due to elevated chemicals released while you sleep it feels very peaceful. I personally read or write since 1 no light and 2 I like doing so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think lamps are artificial light. And yeah, I'd probably go to bed earlier because without <em>any</em> artificial light, there is literally nothing to do once the sun starts to set. An hour before sundown is the last usable light for anything that needs it.</p>
<p>Of course, then my middle of the night is <em>even more</em> useless to be up during.</p></div>		</li>
