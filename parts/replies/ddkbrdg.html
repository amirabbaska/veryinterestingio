			<div class="markdown"><p>Congress isn't going to do anything to give away their new control of all three branches of the government. Besides they are having too much fun watching Trump put it to all his supporters. You have to admit that it will be kinda fun to watch them loose their jobs to robots, their healthcare to repeal and delay, and their food prices go up because of import taxes on Mexico and deportations. Most of his supporters don't know how much produce gets trucked in from Mexico. Not to mention all the Latinos that work in the meat packing houses, dairies, and vegetable farms in this country. </p>
<p>Most of this ethics stuff is a diversion tactic so that no one notices how little Trump actually knows about running this country. Kinda like the dog barking at a squirrel and letting someone rob the house. </p></div>		</li>
