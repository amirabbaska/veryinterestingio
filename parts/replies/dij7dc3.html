			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, If Mr Pence was involved in the wrongdoing, he might be out also.  Then we have President Paul Ryan (not Jack Ryan like in the Tom Clancy books).  Under no plausible circumstance does Hillary become President.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or since paul ryan may get a vote of no confidence soon if he doesnt start doing better would be the new speaker.</p>
<p>Ghe only way a democrat would be in line would be if the republicians lost the house in midterms. Then the democratic speaker would become president which would be bizarre.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, an impeachment proceeding could takes months if not years to get enough Republicans to vote for it. And if they do they likely will impeach Trump but not Pence.</p>
<p>If Trump is impeached, the likelihood is that Pence will then pardon Trump like Ford did to Nixon to avoid criminal proceedings once he is out. That would then likely get Pence impeached for obstruction of justice. But, the Democrats would be smart to drag out the proceedings for the rest of his term in order to prevent Ryan from becoming president and to use it to keep it in the news until the next mid term election where the Democrats would hope to regain control of both houses and render both Pence and Ryan useless.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We don't have a legal mechanism for that to happen. It would require some sort of ad hoc solution, which is improbable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong but you're one of the few people here giving an unbiased answer, but one if the biggest things people are forgetting is that the Trump Campaign =/= Trump, and if they're going to do anything against Trump himself they have to prove he knew some sort of fraud was occuring, correct?</p>
<p>Because from what it looks like to me is that there are other people in the campaign who may very well be dirty but they've never found anything at all to say that Trump knew about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually don't have to <em>prove</em> anything. Congress can impeached him for whatever they feel it's an impeachable offense. All he has to do is something so egregious that enough republicans want to impeach him. He doesn't have to be <em>guilty</em> of anything. </p></div>		</li>
