			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a little of an overblown problem. Sure, it's not like Jeff Bezos can just cash out 100% of his shares overnight. But these bigwigs will just slowly cash out every few weeks over the course of months or years until they hit their target goal of what they wanted to sell. The market will absorb these sales pretty easily and they end up getting pretty close to what the market price was the day they started to sell or even better (as the shares can continue to grow, despite founders selling off). Nobody really expects founders to hold all their shares in perpetuity, so bigwigs selling isn't necessarily a bad sign (although it definitely can be).</p>
<p>Here's a recent example that seems to have had no bad sign for the company (amzn had outperformed the market over that timeframe since the announcement about 1 month ago): <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/06/bezos-is-selling-amazon-stock-to-fund-rocket-venture.html" target="_blank">http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/06/bezos-is-selling-amazon-stock-to-fund-rocket-venture.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to piggyback on this, I could give a pretty accurate estimate of someone not in the top 1% just by knowing their name and address. Most people not in the top 1% have 90+% of their wealth tied up in their home. So knowing their address allows you to get an estimate on the home's value and when they purchased it. Knowing the value and when it was bought means you can estimate the price when it was bought and how much has been paid. Therefore you know how much equity they have in the home and thus 90+% of their net worth. If they don't own their home and instead rent then statistically speaking they probably have less than $1,000 in the bank and debts far exceeding that.  So if you're not in the top 1% and you don't own your home chances are good your net worth is $0 or less.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Um, source?</p>
<p>Also you can see how much they paid and what the value is now, but you still don't really know how much equity they have. What if they refinanced and cashed out? Also not everyone buys with a 20% down payment... Some put down less and some put down more...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to go around a source a bunch of different things, and his percentages are made up for sure, but the ideas are not. </p>
<p>The average person's single largest investment in terms of value ends up being their home. Smart people will surpass their home with investments over time, but for most it's the home. </p>
<p>The next one is again, an over generalization but there are tons of reports out there that say &quot;x&quot;% of the population live pay check to pay with less than $1000 in their bank account at any time. While there are so many situations where renting makes sense and the affluent or financially mature can also rent and increase net worth, in the entire country as a whole you rent because you can afford to own. Despite not being sure if I'm staying for more than a couple years, I have bought twice since it's either cheaper than renting or I get a better house than if I were to rent in my price range. My current mortgage is less than $1000 per month and my realtor told me I could rent it for $1400 if i wanted to.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-richest-people-in-the-world-20160121-story.html" target="_blank">You are actually, probably in the top 3% globally and don't even know it. Do you have more than $100,000 in assets? Then you're in the top 7%. $250,000 in assets? Then you are in the top 3% globally. If you have more than $500,000 then you're in the top 2% globally. If you have more than $1,000,000 in assets then you're in the top 1%. This means that if you live in California and own your own home paid off, you're very likely to be in the top 2% of wealth in the world, just from home ownership.</a></p>
<p>When talking about the US only:</p>
<p>If you're in the bottom 70% then my estimate would be dead on, because you would have no real assets besides your home. If you're 71% to 99% then the estimate becomes less and less accurate as you go up. However, it's still likely to be about as good as the ones used for the very wealthy. (Meaning it's just a ballpark figure.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you only have $1,000 in liquid assets, and your home is likely to be your biggest, and almost only asset, it stands to reason that you can give a pretty good assessment of an individual's total worth by knowing just what equity they have in their home. It's not like it'll be 100% accurate, but easily at least as accurate as the estimates provided for the wealthy. The ones that it's difficult to provide a good estimate for are those in the 85-99 percentiles. The bottom 70% their home is pretty much dead on their total worth, above that some large retirement accounts, and stock investments might possibly be larger than their home equity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For example, if billionaire X owns 50 million shares in the company he founded and it's trading at $100 then we know they are worth at least $5 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it is also important to realise Billionaire doesn't have that money sitting around in a bank account at their easy disposal. </p>
<p>Also they couldn't just  go and sell that many shares at market value. If they sold a lot of shares then you get classic supply and demand, a big supply of shares with not so much demand. So there share price would go down.</p>
<p>If a founder of a company started selling off lots of shares. That would also make other shareholders uneasy and they might think something bad is going to happen to the company and start selling their shares as well. Causing the share price to drop further.</p>
<p>So in essence those sort of valuations of people's value don't mean all that much in the real world.</p></div>		</li>
