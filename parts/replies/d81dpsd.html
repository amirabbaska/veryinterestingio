			<div class="markdown"><p>So does the same concept apply when you shape the center piece of the paper as the tip of a pyramid? </p>
<p>Because I believe that still burns faster than a flat piece of paper in the center. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you think about it by shaping the paper like a pyramid you are increasing the amount of surface area that is being heated. In fact, if you keep folding to make the pyramid 'sharp' enough, it'll pretty much be the same as one of the edges of the paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would agree. The heat would remain and be held inside of the pyramid as well.</p>
<p>As an example one of my first jobs was shrink wrapping a sailboat. There was a spot I couldn't get to from the outside and the wind didn't help either with all the flapping. So I decide to to go on deck inside the wrap and work from there. The heat remained, causing a huge bubble and as the hot air rose, it eventually burst.</p>
<p>Actually, come to think of it, I just described a hot air balloon, adding nothing to the conversation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A pyramid shape also pushes air up and sucks fresh air in from the bottom causing it to light up even faster. Kind of a simple rocket pointing down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's basically a square <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospike_engine" target="_blank">aerospike rocket nozzle</a> at that point, although the flat edge is not the ideal shape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the flip side (get it?) if you're holding the lighter below the pyramid's tip, CO2 fills the chamber, and snuffs out the flame. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it also have to do with where the paper is making contact in the flame? </p>
<p>At the corner you're able to stick the paper directly in the hottest region of the flame. Dispersing more heat over a larger surface area.</p>
<p>From the center the paper might not be touching this area of the flame as readily.</p>
<p>To your point, if you made a pyramid, you could put the tip in the hottest point as well.</p></div>		</li>
