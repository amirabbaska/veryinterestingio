			<div class="markdown"><p>a) Though Crooner gets nothing, does his label earn anything from the radio plays? b) What kind of royalty or pay arrangement is set up for the &quot;producer&quot; of an album or song?</p>
<p>Thanks for the great explanation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a) No, the label doesn't get anything for radio plays either.  Performance royalties are a 50/50 split of an amount between artist(s) and label, or writer(s) and publisher. </p>
<p>b) Producer royalties will be 1 or 2% usually alongside the artist's percentage but they can be anything agreed upon depending upon their involvement. They don't partake in performance royalties usually - I'm sure a producer could be registered so to receive performance royalties but it would have to be at the acquiescence of the label and artist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so this may seem like a silly question, but where does the label make the bulk of it's money? The album sales?</p></div>		</li>
