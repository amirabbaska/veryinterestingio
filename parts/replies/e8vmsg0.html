			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also another Voyager episode called &quot;Gravity&quot; where Paris, Tuvok, and Doctor get stuck in some sort of gravitational well, where the same dilation effect happens. What's 2 hours outside the well is like 2 months inside. When Janeway sends them an audio signal, they hear it in &quot;slow motion&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
