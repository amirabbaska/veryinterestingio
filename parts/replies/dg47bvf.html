			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you're waking up during REM sleep on week days. We have 90 minute sleep cycles and will naturally rouse a bit at the end of them, so weekends you wake up at the end of the 90 minutes, weekdays you wake up during REM sleep. (At least this is how I understood it 10 years ago, maybe I'm getting it wrong?) </p></div>		</li>

<p>I asked my sleep medicine doc about this a while back. He said that varies too much to be of any real value. Like, it's sorta true but varies a lot from person to person and day to day so there's no point in trying to time your sleep. </p>
<p>Also told me that the way you feel right when you wake up is not really related to how you will feel an hour later. More sleep is always preferable to waking up at the &quot;right&quot; time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is definitely true for me - I'll have a fitful night of sleep where I'll wake up every hour or two, just long enough to look at the clock and realize that I'm not sleeping well and that I'll feel like crap when I have to actually get out of bed.  Sure enough, come 6:30, I feel like crap.</p>
<p>Once I get out of bed and get on with my day, though, everything tends to feel normal.  I just may get tired a little earlier in the evening (oddly, with symptoms of a head cold, e.g. congestion, postnasal drip, etc., that go away after I get some sleep).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now I don't want to argue with a doctor, but every time I've naturally woken up about 15-30 minutes before my alarm, I feel a lot worse in the morning if I go back to sleep and get the start of my deep sleep interrupted by my alarm than if I just get up when I naturally wake up even though I have slept a bit less. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it hard to believe, but I have individual bias going on. My fiancee sleeps 2 more hours than me and always seems more tired for the first two hours of the day. But it's probably just two different people with different sleep needs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first cycle is close to 90 minutes and if you are napping, this is a good guide to nap length so you don't wake up in the middle of a cycle.  15-30 minute power naps are good and 90 minute full-cycle naps are good; anything in between is less refreshing.</p>
<p>Repeated cycles in longer chunks of sleep vary from the 90 minutes, making this rule of thumb a poor fit for any sleep length beyond the first cycle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you do on weekdays vs weekends? </p>
<p>From my experience I wake up at the same time because it's routine and habitual. And the reason why sometimes I feel shitty when I wake is because I know I'll be doing something I don't want to do. Doesn't really happen to me anymore though. I have a different perspective on my life now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work on weekdays.  I don't dread going to work or anything but yeah, honestly, I'd rather be hanging out on the beach with the Hawaiin Topic girls or at an amusement park.  </p>
<p>What's your new perspective on life?  If it'll improve my weekday mornings I'm all ears.  And don't give me the &quot;Any day above ground is a good day‚Äù nonsense.  Yeah that's true, but problems are relative because some people don't have access to clean drinking water yet I flush my waste and water my plants with clean drinking water.  I, on the other hand, have problems that they would never understand.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you're right. Problems are relative. One thing is common though, everyone has problems. You just have to learn how to live with it or find a solution. For me it was to never work there again. Basically I don't do anything that I don't want to do anymore. I'm always doing something that can benefit my past, present, or future self. But main goal is working for my future self. </p></div>		</li>
