			<p>Just FYI basically everyone that actually lives in Japan and knows the scene thinks that book is a joke. Adelstein is not particularly well liked and most people think his stories are heavily embellished at best.</p>		</li>

			<p>So is there a good book to read about the Yakuza?  From a social engineering perspective, the way they are organized is simply brilliant.  Brutal yet efficient.  I am very very intrigued.</p>		</li>

			<p>True this. This book is over - embellished crap that sounds like he learned about the yakuza and how to write from bad B movie scripts. </p>		</li>

			<p>Great book! <a href="http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/1stsxc/jake-adelstein" target="_blank">Here is an interview</a> the author did on the Daily Show where he compares them to the Boy Scouts.</p>		</li>

			<p>Second this...great book.  You see just how ingrained the yakuza are in Japanese culture.  It's pretty much just tolerated. </p>		</li>
