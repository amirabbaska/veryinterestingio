			<div class="markdown"><p>I work on an oceangoing vessel and will second what DrWhoSays....says. We have a few layers of navigation and the magnetic compass is the base level, SHTF form of navigation. The corrections to a magnetic compass are modeled every year and each chart (map) we use has a correction guide for the covered area (example: Compass variation was 13째 W in 2012, with an annual decrease of 1.5째, making the 2014 compass variation 10째 W). That, combined with an annual determination of error induced by the ship on differing headings will get you to a true heading.      </p>
<p>So, professionally, I'm more concerned about a CME knocking out the GPS system, because GPS is a huge asset, though one should never rely on just one form of navigation.<br />
If the GPS gets knocked out, then we would rely on Gyrocompass for heading and radar/ranges/sightings for position fixes.<br />
If the radar is down, rely on dead reckoning, visual sightings of points, fixed lights, etc to navigate safely.
If the GPS, Radar, and Gyrocompass is out, correct the  magnetic compass to true and get your sextant out and hope it's not cloudy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You explained correctly how reversal of magnetic field would be dealt with updating isognonic lines. </p>
<p>But does the decrease in intensity of earth's magnetic field have the potential to render magnetic compasses useless?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Our magnetic north actually shifts around a lot, currently it's in Canada.</p>

<p>Just recently (within a last few weeks), I read somewhere that it is actually somewhere in Siberia?</p>
<p>I found the link and it is apparently from the SWARM data. North Pole is not in Siberia, but it is shifting towards Siberia: <a href="http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Swarm/Swarm_reveals_Earth_s_changing_magnetism" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Swarm/Swarm_reveals_Earth_s_changing_magnetism" target="_blank">http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Swarm/Swarm_reveals_Earth_s_changing_magnetism</a></a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can someone explain this to me? I figured magnetic north was magnetic north. I understand that it moves, and I could understand how we might have different models saying maybe it's a few kilometers this way or that way, but how do we have different models showing it Canada and Siberia? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've seen, the evidence from paleomagnetic rock samples suggest that when the flip occurs, it happens quite rapidly. The flip also is not a simple rotation of the dipole but rather it breaks up into higher orders (I.e. quadrupole, octopole) meaning there would be many north and south poles at different locations on the earth.
Also, the dipole field shields the earth from the solar wind and cosmic rays except around the poles (the northern lights are caused by this). If the field breaks up, the earth and our satellites will have far less protection. This could possibly knock out communication and GPS satellites.</p>
<p>I'm on mobile or I would dig up some sources. Grrr Comcast.</p></div>		</li>
