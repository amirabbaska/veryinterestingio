			<div class="markdown"><p>You did an excellent job putting an ELI5 spin on it.  But to make it even more obvious.  Working memory is like the space on a desk, you can work on everything on it quickly, but space is limited.  So that you can still keep all your stuff organized when not in use you have drawers, aka permanent storage.  When a piece of paper is in your drawers, you can't see it or work on it, but you know where it is &amp; can retrieve it at any point.  If your desk is full when you need a piece of paper out of the drawer, you have to free up space by either throwing things away or putting them in the drawer.<br />
Now all pieces of paper have to sit on mats to help organize where things are supposed to be located on the desk &amp; how things are supposed to work.  Those mats are the files your computer needs to run.  Just like /u/Jainarayan said, when updates happen the copy in the drawer gets updated, but because other papers have to sit on top of them, you can't just swap them out for the copy in the drawer or else everything gets all jumbled.  The only way to replace mat is to put everything back in the drawer or throw it on the floor, aka rebooting.</p></div>		</li>
