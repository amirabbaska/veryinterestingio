			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think wildlife would be incredibly abundant as a food source, and the water likely fairly clean. Bacteria has evolved with us, but the primitive forms of bacteria then may still be pretty nasty. Some may have gone extinct that were very nasty to us. Fire would still be our greatest tool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just based on the context, I think he's saying that there were a lot of turtles in Late Cretaceous Montana, and probably America in general. It probably doesn't apply worldwide. </p>
<p>He also may be speaking relative to our time. &quot;Lots and lots of turtles&quot; could mean something different than &quot;lots and lots of rats&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>By the Late Cretaceous there would have been fruit, but youâ€™d have to experiment carefully to find ones that were good for humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where do you put the odds of succeeding at this without dying as a consequence of poisoning? Would there be much plant life that's recognizable today? Do we know if early fruits were as often poisonous then as they are now? Any tried-and-true methods for extracting unknown toxins from plants before eating? Fruit/vegetable matter and Vitamin C are pretty critical for humans, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best method is to follow the guidelines in the graphic found <a href="http://www.wilderness-survival.net/plants-1.php#fig9_5" target="_blank">here</a>. They're on par with what I've learned in several wilderness survival classes (Scouts and Professional) and provide a good method of determining if you should eat them or not. </p>
<p>I will say, some survival experts have different guidelines they use, but for the most part they follow this pretty standard process. </p>
<p>If you can't read the article/picture, here is it formatted to text:</p>
<p><strong>Universal Edibility Test</strong></p>
<p>There are many plants throughout the world. Tasting or swallowing even a small portion of some can cause severe discomfort, extreme internal disorders, and even death. Therefore, if you have the slightest doubt about a plant's edibility, apply the Universal Edibility Test (below) before eating any portion of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Test only one part of a potential food plant at a time.</li>
<li>Separate the plant into its basic components - leaves, stems, roots, buds, and flowers.</li>
<li>Smell the food for strong or acid odors. Remember, the smell alone does not indicate a plant is edible or inedible.</li>
<li>Do not eat for 8 hours before starting the test</li>
<li>During the 8 hours you abstain from eating, test for contact poisoning by placing a piece of the plant part you are testing on the inside of your elbow or wrist. Usually 15 minutes is enough time to allow for a reaction.</li>
<li>During the test period, take nothing by mouth except purified water and the plant part you are testing.</li>
<li>Select a small portion of a single plant part and prepare it the way you plan to eat it.</li>
<li>Before placing the prepared plant part in your mouth, touch a small portion (a pinch) to the outer surface of your lip to test for burning or itching. </li>
<li>If after 3 minutes there is no reaction on your lip, place the plant part on your tongue, holding it there for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>If there is no reaction, thoroughly chew a pinch and hold it in your moth for 15 minutes. <strong>Do not swallow.</strong></li>
<li>If no burning, itching, numbing, stinging, or other irritation occurs during the 15 minutes, swallow the food.</li>
<li>Wait 8 hours. If any ill effects occur during this period, induce vomiting and drink a lot of water.</li>
<li>If no ill effects occur, eat 1/4 cup of the same plant part prepared the same way. Wait another 8 hours. If no ill effects occur, the plant part as prepared is safe for eating. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CAUTION</strong></p>
<p>Test all parts of the plant for edibility, as some plants have both edible and inedible parts. Do not assume that a part that proved edible when cooked is also edible when raw. Test the part raw to ensure edibility before eating raw. The same part or plant may produce varying reactions in different individuals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will note and reiterate this particular section that is a bit up the page from the universal edibility test and as a mushroom hunter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not eat mushrooms in a survival situation! The only way to tell if a mushroom is edible is by positive identification. There is no room for experimentation. Symptoms of the most dangerous mushrooms affecting the central nervous system may show up after several days have passed when it is too late to reverse their effects.</p>

<p>Hmm... Are there are any cases where the converse is true?  Something that's harmless raw, but when cooked breaks down into something toxic?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well gingkos, cycads, ferns, mosses and conifers are thought to have remained fairly similiar. Angiosperms first appear in the cretaceous, so depending on when you were, you might see magnolia, figs, plane trees but many if not most modern plants (since modern plants are mostly angiosperms) would not exist yet.</p></div>		</li>
