			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the instructor, school, or even department within the school. Some instructors from my experience had the regular A/A-minus cutoff as high as 95%, whereas others don't have plus/minus grading whatsoever. Others I've had didn't round a B+ to an A- at 89.5%, so there's definitely a lot of discretion here. Then at the school or departmental level, it may be more or less strict, with different cutoff percents, to which the individual instructors have to confirm to.</p>
<p>Source: went to plenty of different colleges and universities and each had their own grade system quirks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally for the purposes of a GPA from the schools I've gone to (Arizona/California) pluses or minuses aren't taken into account. From my experience that final grade would be displayed as an A. In my experience pluses or minuses are more for tests/assignments; the final grade usually doesn't take those into account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the institution and the degree program.
At my university, as a rule, a D is a failing grade. In my grad program I need to maintain a B+ average, I believe, to get a degree. A C in a course might count as me passing it, but I would need very good grades in other courses to off-set that grade.</p></div>		</li>
