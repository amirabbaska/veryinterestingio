			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that when an animal has a cut, it's somewhat bleeding and the bloodstream has a slightly higher pressure than outside, thus keeping the venom from entering the blood system. It is somewhat like washing a wound with water, the water don't get inside your blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly but not likely.</p>
<p>Wounds tend to bleed <em>out</em>, moreso than get things into them, except by force.</p>
<p>Bacteria or viruses can get some traction there, but they are living organisms. If they get a foothold, they can breed.</p>
<p>Venom (which is already being diluted now by saliva) <em>really</em> needs to get directly into the bloodstream to do its damage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Whilst water can break down proteins, it is a very long process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be a little more specific on the linguistic difference:</p>
<p>something is poisonous if it makes you sick when you eat it (poisonous mushroom, berries, or plants, even frogs)</p>
<p>something is venomous if it makes you sick when it injects, bites, or stings you (venomous snake, scorpion, or spider)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hey now!</p>
<p>&quot;The downside is that most users experience extreme pain for 6 hours as the body gets used to the toxins&quot;</p>
