			<div class="markdown"><p>Good on the Glass-Steagall stuff, but not accurate on the loan securitization.</p>
<p>Most of the bad loans were securitized by private lenders, primarily investment banks like Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, etc. (such investment banks were never subject to Glass-Steagall because they did not hold deposits), and other private finance firms like hedge funds. This is why those types of financial firms had the hardest time during the crisis.</p>
<p>Fannie and Freddie have limits on how &quot;low they can go&quot; in terms of issuing and securitizing sub-prime loans. In fact that is the definition of &quot;sub-prime&quot;: generally speaking, it means loans that Fannie and Freddie will not buy to securitize. </p>
<p>Where Fannie and Freddie got into trouble was that they bought a lot of the highly-rated private securities that the private banks and funds offered. So when it became clear that those securities were not actually worth rating highly, Fannie and Freddie lost a bunch of capital and had a liquidity crisis. (Which just means a bunch of their savings disappeared and all of sudden they were in danger of running out of money.)</p>
<p>One of the easiest-to-understand points of proof that Glass-Steagall repeal didn't cause the crisis is that Europe never had a similar regulation, yet they didn't cause a similar crisis.</p>
<p>Another point of proof is that firms that would have violated Glass-Steagall generally did OK during the crisis, while firms that did the worst would never have been covered by Glass-Steagall anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is the best way I can describe the 2008 crisis.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, the combination of very low interest rates and a &quot;stable economy&quot; at the time fed a boom in the housing market. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began buying mortgage loans from originators and bundling these into pools that could be traded like any other asset. These pools were claims on the underlying mortgages, called Mortgage Backed Securities. The act of pooling is called securitization</p>
<p>An example of the cash flows from this: A savings and loan bank makes a $100k loan to a homeowner. The homeowner will repay interest and principal over the next 30 years. The bank then sells to loan to Freddie or Fannie (the agency) and collects the payments from the homeowner and pass them on to the agency in exchange for a service fee. The agency pools these loans into mortgage-backed securities and sells these to investors. The agency guarantees the default risk for a fee and then passes the ultimate cash flows to these investors.</p>
<p>This created securitization by private firms of subprime loans with higher default risk. In the private pass-throughs, the investor bore the risk of default, therefore, the original mortgage brokers had little incentive to provide due diligence on the loan as long as they could sell it to an investor. </p>
<p>Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) created groups of tranches. Higher rated tranches had the first claim on repayments and junior tranches got leftover. This concentrated default risk on one class of investors, leaving the rest relatively protected. For example, imagine a a securitized loan with 3 tranches, A, B, and C. Tranche A is the highest rated senior tranche with a par value of $150 million. Tranche B has a par value of $15 million. Tranche C has a par value of $10 million. If there is a default, tranche C is effected first until the par value is depleted and then moves to tranche B. This leaves investors in tranche A relatively safe until there are $25 million in defaults. Investors would buy into the lower tranches because despite the higher risk, they offered higher coupon rates and usually sell at less than par value.</p>
<p>In the U.S. there are recourse and non-recourse states. In non-recourse states, your home serves as collateral for the loan and if you default on your mortgage, only the house is collateral and the lender cannot go after any other assets and you are not liable for any remaining balance on the loan that the value of the home does not cover. </p>
<p>So, when housing prices began to fall (the bubble popped), houses were worth less than the loan balance so people walked away from their houses and defaulted on the loans. There were so many defaults the value of most of the lower tranches were depleted and even the higher tranches began to be affected. Because government and private agencies insured many of these loans, they were on the hook to cover the payments to investors. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae's financial condition was extremely damaged by covering the defaults and they were placed into conservatorship. A key component of the conservatorships is the commitment of the U.S. Department of the Treasury to provide financial support to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to enable them to continue to provide liquidity and stability to the mortgage market. The treasury department provided almost $190 billion of support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fannie and Freddie have been securitizing mortgages since the 1970s. It's a big part of why they exist at all.</p>
<p>When we talk about the causes of the financial crisis, it's very important to understand the mix of where the MBS came from. Over 80% of subprime-backed MBS--the ones that broke and started the whole thing--were issued by private firms, not Fannie and Freddie.</p>
<p>Fannie and Freddie had some loans that went bad--but not many. Those problems were greatly exacerbated by the writedowns they had to take on the highly rated MBS they had bought from private issuers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>So they had Fannie and Freddie securitize mortgages in bundles, letting the good mortgages &quot;prop up&quot; the bad ones so to speak</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <em>not</em> what securitization is for!  The point of MBS is essentially the same as the point of a mutual fund: diversifying assets so that you have exposure to the &quot;true&quot; mortgage market, and not the specifics of one person's mortgage, which depends on individual life circumstances that you're presumably not trying to gamble on.</p>
<p>Having a less risky bet &quot;prop up&quot; a riskier one doesn't even make sense.</p>
<p>The problems with the MBS market were (perhaps) some amount of fraud, and (more fundamentally) the failure of the market to price in the risk of an outside event altering the correlation of default probabilities.  Usually one guy defaulting on his mortgage doesn't tell you much about whether his neighbor will keep making payments, but when you have an event that causes sudden job losses then suddenly defaults do become highly correlated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The requirements for securitization were turned into more or less an automatic rubber stamp, and the &quot;true&quot; mortgage market was estimated to be way better than it actually was. It's not all about a failure to account for outside events. If Fannie and Freddie had looked harder at some of those sad jokes of mortgages they would have been more reluctant to securitize some, or most, of the bundles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll note that I did include fraud as one of two contributing factors.</p>
<p>That said, people at the time were willing to buy even &quot;bad&quot; mortgages, on the grounds that they expected property values to rise, negating some of the downside of repossessing instead of collecting mortgage payments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my eyes the problem is that MBS provided an out for the actual lenders. Provided they were getting their loans secured, the banks didn't give a shit who got a loan. It took their skin out of the game. They were making money on the interest with a seriously diminished exposure to the risks.</p>
<p>Hello market manipulation and all kinds of fraud opportunities because now nobody knows what the actual market value of real estate actually is - or the risks of the bundled assets.</p>
<p>Worse yet, the banks were bailed out by the government which set up the MBS to begin with.</p>
<p>The American people got played. Hard. The only winners were the insiders on Wall Street and the politicians winning elections in the name of &quot;a house for everyone!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure it's fair to blame lenders, except in actual cases of fraud (which seem to be rarer than is commonly implied).  The people putting together the MBSes were okay with a relatively high default risk because they expected property values to increase anyway.  If you have a customer who's significantly more sophisticated than you asking to buy specific things from you, how is it your fault when they get what they asked for and things go badly?  It's like if I was a clerk at an auto store and Jeff Gordon comes in asking for some unusual part... am I supposed to second-guess him?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couple of things in support of/in critique of your explanation.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Glass Steagall’s fall wasn’t the sole cause of the over-connectedness of traditional banks, mortgage companies and lending companies that led to the 2008 Crisis. However, it's repeal led to far more firms becoming tied up with one another in what amounted to a single electrical grid. The “single grid” meant the failure of one quickly and catastrophically led to a failure of the entire system because the load could not be spread into different grids.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The repeal of Glass Steagall was merely the final domino falling. The real problem began with the massive deregulation and gutting oversight that began in the Reagan years. That culture of inexorably gutting financial oversight/regulation continued through the Bush41/Clinton years. This meant that people like Mike Milken and the 1980s S&amp;L crises were inevitable. The only reason for dismantling Glass-Steagall in 1999 was to allow Sandy Weil to merge Citigroup and Travelers. Glass Steagall was a dead letter. Far more damaging was the gutting of federal financial oversight and eliminating regulations. (Weil himself has since admitted getting rid of Glass-Steagall was a mistake.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As you state, no one in their right mind wants an economy to crash. The highly regarded Larry Summers has stated &quot;no one is in favor of gambling with insured deposits.&quot; However, greed is a very strong motivator. ALL major banks were/are booking derivatives in their depositaries (and also want that practice to continue). It’s why they all worked so hard to gut that prohibition from Dodd-Frank.
No one wants the economy to crash, but making a huge amount of money with the added bonus of not being either financially or legally on the hook -- or even taking a haircut -- means that if everyone else is doing it then you ride that pony, too till it drops over dead. No matter their real age, investment bankers are just like 18-year-old boys in their thinking. &quot;Sure there are risks,&quot; they admit, &quot;and sure maybe if things go really bad, someone gets hurt. But that someone won’t be me.&quot; Everyone believes in accountability – for the little guy. Playing at that level, however, means you like one of the leads in “Love Story” -- never having to say you’re sorry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As for Fannie/Freddie + the government wanting people to have homes + real estate loans being the main cause of financial crises, that’s all wet too. In 2008, real estate lending losses by themselves would undoubtedly have produced another nasty Savings &amp; Loan level crisis. What escalated that crisis into a global financial melt-down was derivatives, specifically credit default swaps written on risky subprime exposures. The synthetic exposures were somewhere between 4 and 6 times the value of real economy subprime risk. And a high percent of the CDS exposures (whose risk was masked by packing them into collateralized debt obligations) wound up at under-capitalized, systemically important financial firms like Bear-Sterns and Lehman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did bankers understand the risk? Yes, they did. What they were hoping for (gambling on) was the fact that, historically, people rarely defaulted on paying their mortgages. This however, combined with the perfect storm of financial institutions (Nationwide; Washington Mutual; Wachovia; many others) throwing out the lending rule book for home loans. Big institutional banks no longer had the skills to make small loans (i.e. home loans) that required an assessment of personal character and the local market. In fact, most major banks had disbanded credit officer training programs over two decades ago. This combined with derivatives meant that any one that walked through the door with a zipper and a pulse got a loan that would then be packaged up with others – both good and bad – and spread out in different stock issues nine different ways from Sunday.</p>
</li>
<li>AIG, Fannie and Freddie were among the biggest customers of the Wall Street subprime bonds and the CDO factory. AIG had accidentally created a firm within a firm and had gotten rid of its real risk managers, leaving Joe Cassanno, a bully who didn’t understand the downside until way too late, in charge. Fannie and Freddie are culpable in that they both talked themselves into the foolish practice of using the fees they got for insuring mortgage bonds and investing that dough in subprime bonds and loans. Freddie and Fannie were already thinly capitalized; they could not afford a bone-headed bet like that. So AIG, Fannie and Freddie were all insurers that made terrible investment decisions by virtue of falling for Wall Street’s latest apparent high return opportunity.
But the treasured post-2008 Crisis conservative past time of blaming only Fannie and Freddie (conservative dog-whistle speak for &quot;the federal government&quot; or &quot;liberals&quot;) is like blaming the rooster for the sunrise.</li>
