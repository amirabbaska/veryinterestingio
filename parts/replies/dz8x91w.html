			<div class="markdown"><p>Not op, but I have a story similar to it! </p>
<p>my grandfather was born with a dark purple port wine stain across the lower half of his face. Everyone in the family thought they were caused by a moment of great stress when the baby is in the womb. When my great grandma was carrying him, she was baking a blackberry pie one day and her husband came in bleeding really badly (he eventually lost the hand) from a farming accident. She covered her mouth in shock and got the blackberry juice all over her face. When my grandpa was born, she remembered that moment and said it was the blackberries that caused it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Italian here. Both my great-uncle and I have birth marks shaped like a raisin (aren't they kind of all a little shaped like that?). His mother (my great-grandmother) said his was due to her wanting raisins so much when she was pregnant and of course she believed mine was similarly caused. Never realized this was an Italian thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similarly, when my grandmother was pregnant with my mother, she heard her father slaughtering a pig. She brought her hands up to her ear to cover the noise, and sure enough when my mom was born she was missing the lower lobe of her ear. My grandmother swears that covering her ear that day is why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on a bus in Belfast one day and the <em>heavily</em> pregnant woman in front of me was on the phone to her pal.  She said &quot;I wanna tattoo, but I'm gonna have t' wait 'till 'e's born.  I don't want him comin' out with it&quot;.  </p>
<p>I thought about it for a while and sadly came to the conclusion &quot;nope, that's really what she said, there's no other way it could be misinterpreted, she's just a fucking retard.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

I only have one other birthmark than these Mongolian marks and it’s on the bottom of one of my toes. My brothers and I however all have the same Mongolian Mark on our butts in the same place. I also think it’s interesting that my youngest brother is my half brother, and we still have the same mark. </p></div>		</li>
