<p>...It also reveals the top speed of a horse fly to be <em>90 mph</em> (145 kmh).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, an open circulatory system, unlike in mammals and reptiles, has no high pressure blood vessels such as arteries. Instead, there is a mixture of blood and lymph cells, <em>that white-ish goop inside bugs,</em> which sloshes around cavities. The benefit is that bugs do not easily/cannot internally &quot;bleed&quot; like mammals. The downside is that this lack of high pressure blood is one aspect that prevents them from being too large. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting issue that a biologist friend of mine brought up with respect to climate change was that there is really only one long-term solution: carbon sequestration. One of the best ways to sequester carbon is to grow plants. Lots and lots of them. But plants will also change the composition of the atmosphere by releasing tons of oxygen. We'd be back at the Carboniferous Period. You know what the Carboniferous Period had?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a while since I read about it but:</p>
<p>Insects 'breath' through <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiracle?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">spiracles</a> which are basically holes that go a bit into their tissues and allow oxygen to diffuse into their bodies, they don't breathe like we do. </p>
<p>It's why bugs can only be so big, past a specific surface-volume ratio you require more sophisticated means of transporting oxygen to all of your cells, like lungs and a strong pump for example. </p></div>		</li>
