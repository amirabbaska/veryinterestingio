			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid I was super into dinosaurs and marine biology and my mom would always take me to the library. One day I watched this National Geographic kids video and they introduced the cuttlefish. I flipped out and was converted from dinosaurs to cephalopods and that was pretty much that. From there I studied marine science at Boston University in college and tracked down this cephalopod researcher named Roger Hanlon and begged him to take me as an intern. I wrote this completely batshit letter to him insisting that if he didn’t take me that year he was going to take me the next because I wasn’t going to leave him alone until he took me and he miraculously did (why did no one tell me not to do that? I don’t know, whatever, it worked). I worked with him for 2 summers in college, and during the school year got cuttlefish in the BU marine lab at school one year and octopuses the next so I always had cephalopods around. This wasn’t normal but I guess I was kind of insistent about the whole thing. Then I started my Ph.D. here and it’s all squid all the time. </p>
<p>If you go to this video at about 13:15, that’s the scene that blew my 8 year old mind. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deCzNb68WeY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deCzNb68WeY</a>  One of my tumblr followers found the video after she asked me this question about a year ago.</p></div>		</li>
