			<div class="markdown"><p>Great comment! As an animal scientist, my first thought was “stereotypies” which refers to the “hobbies” or repetitive actions animals display when they are lacking enrichment in their environment.
Often seen in captive, undomesticated animals, but can be exhibited in domesticated animals &amp; pets as well (a lot of dogs that were bred and selected for jobs such as hunting or farming, but are just house pets can exhibit these behaviours). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Yep, any animal can exhibit these stress-induced behaviors, including pets! Pet owners should do their best to provide enrichment for their furry loved ones. It's heartbreaking to see an animal displaying these behaviors, whether it be in a zoo or at home. :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, although if you can add even one or two things, that would be a huge help. We’re getting a lot of unscientific speculation in this thread, so I’m really trying to direct people to some scientific sources of information. I know what it’s like to be on mobile, though! </p></div>		</li>
