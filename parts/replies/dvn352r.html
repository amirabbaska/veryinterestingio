			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a DJ in Chicago doing mashups in the Girl Talk style, from two vinyl turntables. You know, Easy-E on one table, AC/DC on the other. It was the most brilliant beat matching I've ever heard. He was playing in a comic book shop in midtown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of pro DJs probably practice at home or on their free time because it's their life or passion. That sounds like a very cool Mix wish I heard it. Sometimes they'll probably make their own mash by editing the songs together through programs. </p>
<p>When I use to experiment with DJing I had some vocals mixed with other songs that I thought would sound good together. I wouldn't say they were great but it was fun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you're describing a REAL DJ... I don't think that's what OP means... I think they mean a DJ at a club.</p>
<p>People aren't mentioning it because nobody does their own scratching anymore and beat-matching is just pushing a button labeled &quot;Beat Match&quot; now.</p></div>		</li>
