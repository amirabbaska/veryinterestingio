			<div class="markdown"><p>Antarctica was beyond what I expected in so many ways. This coming from a person who thought it would be Greenland-like just icier. I've spent whole summers in Greenland studying polar deserts and their response to climate change. So how is Antarctica different? I knew there would be very few plants - just two species of flowering plants, mosses and algae. As we approached for our first landing, the ground was a fluorescent green; it almost seemed lit up from underneath. Moss, I thought? And why so much of it? We landed and I went to see what made the earth so green. The answer was not what I expected. It was algae, an incredibly thin layer and underneath was penguin poo. Penguins feed in the sea, and through their poo transfer nutrients to the land. These are the nutrients needed to sustain the growth of algae on young, nitrogen-poor soils. From a distance, the hills looked covered in plants like an alpine meadow. This now has me wondering how they look from space, can satellites see the 'green'?  The icebergs were the other big surprise. Their size was truly massive, especially as one considers the depth they go beneath the sea given the mass above. Their shapes were like the mesas of the US desert SW near where I live. Anne took incredible photos. See if she'll post a few...I think we can post photos on an AMA.</p></div>		</li>
