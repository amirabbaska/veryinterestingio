			<div class="markdown"><p>What isotope of potassium? Two proton decays are uncommon unless you're talking about species beyond the proton dripline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is an interesting one, because it should be an alpha particle, but i'm not sure of your values for atomic mass. Is it 40, or 39, for Potassium, and 35, or 36, for Chlorine? Because through values I have, it should be 40 and 35, which gives a difference of 5, coupled with the difference of 2 in atomic number. I'm pretty sure Helium could have an isotope of 5/2, but I am also sure there is an isotope of Hydrogen of 3/1, which could mean either 1 alpha particle or 2 hydrogens, one of 2/1 and 1 of 3/1. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about lithium-5. 3 protons, 2 neutrons, decays by proton emission... but isn't that also essentially emitting an alpha particle? Similarly with helium-5, just emitting the extra neutron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of these decays: alpha, spontaneous fission, nucleon emission, and cluster emission, fundamentally happen by the same mechanism. It's just a particle tunneling through a potential barrier (except in the case of an s-wave neutron where there is no barrier).</p></div>		</li>
