<p>What? Groups of self righteous idiots actually making the cause they're hiding behind worse and lacking the self awareness to realize they're actually the bad guys?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I want a dog I can go to a rescue group, go through a long background check, have someone visit my home to make sure I’m the right fit for the precious life that might be entrusted to me, get lectured on the <em>proper</em> way to care for an animal, then write a big check.</p>
<p>Or I can go to a puppy mill and just write the check. </p>
<p>Or I can go on Craigslist and find one for free. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand, how is paying a breeder for a dog considered &quot;rescue&quot;? I'll breed and treat this dog like shit, and you can pay me to &quot;rescue&quot; it? Isn't that just buying a dog? What hole are they jumping through to call it a rescue? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;rescue&quot; is just a bullshit word that means &quot;used dog.&quot;</p>
<p>it might bark at black people and anything on two wheels and piss itself constantly but it just adds to the charm I guess.</p>
<p>pigs are smarter but nobody gives a fuck about rescue bacon or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And even if they were technically, they don't have the kind of symbiotic relation with humans that dogs have. Dogs have evolved to literally read our facial expressions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was at the humane society recently and you could tell the the vets were just broken down from lack of funds and help.  I assume these people got into the gig to save animals and were thrown into a pit of an  underfunded, wasteland.  It's a great cause but the people that go there don't have any money and expect their animals to be treated or just surrender them entirely.  Very depressing.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only humane societies that have ever felt like happy places were the ones I've seen in college towns with a lot of support. I think the reality is mostly what you said, underfunded and stretched to the limit.  Those who can afford to spend crazy amounts on rescues are certainly not the norm and I hope it doesn't come across that the article represents most shelters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  I was there to have my dog spayed and the only reason I went there was because the surgery was a package deal through the rescue.  The place was divided in half.  The clinic was for  paying customers and the shelter side was the charity.  The employees on the clinic side seemed much happier and their customer service was great.  Charity side, not so much.  </p></div>		</li>
