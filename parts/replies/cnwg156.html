			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just micro usb, but cables in general, at least for mobile devices. Wireless charging is quickly becoming the de facto standard on new devices and to be honest, I can't remember when I last used a cable for data transfer to my phone or tablet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wireless charging is slower, less efficient, and uses a larger charger. More importantly, you're in a bubble. Wireless charging has barely caught on even in major cities. Maybe in several years it'll be a popular alternative, but it'll probably never completely replace wired charging.</p></div>		</li>
