			<div class="markdown"><p>Sufficiently correct for ELI5 ;-). Non-polar (=apolar) stuff is sticky as well, but it sticks to other apolar stuff. Apolar stuff is randomly very slightly polar in all directions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_dispersion_force" target="_blank">London Dispersion Force</a>), which makes apolar molecules attract each other although at a lesser degree than polar stuff.</p>
<p>It also depends on the surface areas of objects making contact. Large molecules with a high surface area to volume ratio are stickier than similar smaller ones, because they have more sticky surface. </p>
<p>These differences in polarity and also surface area is why the apolar lighter fluid butane has a boiling point of -1 degrees Celsius, whilst water - a very polar molecule - has a boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius; it takes more energy to pull water molecules in liquid water apart and turn them into a gas than it is for butane, mainly due to difference in polarity.  Octane, which is also an apolar substance but is larger than butane, has a boiling point of 125 degrees celsius, so polarity isn't the only factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick correction: apolar stuff doesn't really &quot;attract&quot; each other, except by dispersion forces, due to induced polarity in the molecules which is why very apolar molecules such as butane fail to maintain any notable surface tension. Think of some plastic balls and some magnetic balls that fill up a cube. Because the magnets so prefer each other, they will shove the plastic balls aside so that they can be together.  When the cube is fairly packed, (though lose enough for the balls to flow past each other, representing a liquid) it will either reach a state where some of the plastic balls are forced together in small spheres, reducing their surface area and maximizing the attraction between the magetic balls, or the plastic balls will be shoved into one single area.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the correction.
There are a lot of other factors I didn't mention either in an apolar/polar mixture. There is solvent shielding, hydrogen bonding competition, entropic factors, concentration, presence of polymers or colloidal objects and their dilution regime/sizes/lengths/shapes, and the timescale of the process depending on the slope of the chemical potential of the mixture. And others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surface area isn’t the main difference between butane and water. Water has crazy strong hydrogen bonding. Polar interactions are stronger than nonpolar interactions. That’s the main difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Calling the attractions magnetic isn't strictly correct. The attraction is electrostatic, as it's caused by deficiency or abundance of electrons. In water, you're correct in that the molecules will preferentially associate with one another. Oil doesn't really have a preference for itself in the same level of strength, but by being excluded it will end up all together.</p>
<p>Magnetism is caused by unpaired electrons in the molecular orbitals (atomic orbital overlap is what results in bond formation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know this is ELI5, right? Magnetism is clearly being used as an analogy because it’s more relatable for non-science folk. And it’s a great analogy. Electrical and magnetic forces are two sides of the same coin and fundamentally operate the same way. Explaining ionic bonding to a five year old by comparing it to refrigerator magnets makes a lot of sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying it's a bad analogy, but the answer doesn't make it clear that it is one.</p>
<p>I wasn't deriding the original answerer, I just wanted to add that the attraction is electrostatic, and some information about the concepts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good explanation of the magnetic element, but the surface area of contact is about as important.  For instance Gecko feet are less sticky in the magnetic sense then they are due to the billions of contact points they make per foot.  Those connections are what cause some adhesion to be much stronger in one direction as you are pulling against the other material instead of away.  In those instances you peel it up to minimize the area of the force applied and ensure you’re pulling away from the other surface. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are they really that complicated in Gen Chem? The bigger it is, the more space and electrons is has for electrons to get relatively clustered to one orientation or another without repelling at any given instant. In a small room like an elevator, people tend to make the most of the space they have, so it's quite evenly shared. In a huge auditorium it's extremely more likely to find groups of people oriented towards the front or back.</p>
<p>If you break it down even further and start putting groups of auditoriums or elevators next to each other (where each room knows each other, but aren't familiar with other room populations), the people in the elevators maintain their alignment, as there's not much elsewhere to go; the people in the auditoriums will probably shift to one side, leaving space for the next auditorium over to shift to that side of their auditorium, leaving room for the next... </p>
<p>As much as any one person wants to escape their auditorium group and get into the empty space in the next auditorium, they are still separated by a clear wall, but they don't want to go to the empty side of their auditorium because the group next door is encroaching on that territory (despite the other clear wall).</p></div>		</li>
