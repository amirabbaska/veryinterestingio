			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a great answer and it highlights part of the problem. How do you know what you're supposed to look for? I mean if we look for grazing animals, sure look in a pasture. But what if we can't even formulate what we're looking for? Maybe we are looking for edible animals. In that case we should also look in the water and find fish. The problem is your methods for looking for something constrain what you may find.</p>
<p>The problem is that cows are defined as &quot;those grass eating animals there&quot;. There is no Platonic <em>concept</em> of cows floating out there for which we can find the instantiations. It's just the cows themselves. I know this gets too philosophical, but when looking for things you can't define or don't want to define (to avoid constraining the answer) you inevitably end up with philosophical problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your second paragraph is why we aren't opening that can of worms yet. We may as well look for life &quot;as we understand it&quot;, if we have limited resources. There is literally zero proof that life exists in any other circumstances. We might as well look at things we KNOW can support life, instead of just using our imaginations. That's not to say that life we cannot comprehend doesn't exist, but if we truly cannot comprehend it, we wouldn't even recognize it if we saw it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My problem is that the question may be ill-defined. You're using the word &quot;life&quot; casually as if it had some idealized meaning that we can find.</p>
<p>But of course on the other hand, we successfully found mountains, rocks and dust on other planets without bumping into semantic issues, so it's not unimaginable that we could find life, since it's just another human concept like &quot;rock&quot;. But I think we are trying to approach this life thing differently because we also desire to find unexpectedly different life forms, too. But in general trying to find a very exotic &quot;X&quot; will just lead you to the fringes of mental category of &quot;X&quot;.</p>
<p>Say you're looking around for very strange cows. What would you legitimately label as such? Is a cow with long hair still a cow just a strange one? Is a buffalo a strange sort of cow? Is an elephant just an exotic cow? You see what I'm getting at? The more &quot;exotic&quot; it is the less of a &quot;cow&quot; it is. So the game becomes finding where the &quot;true&quot; demarcation lines of the concept &quot;cow&quot; are, which is inherently a very uninteresting quest, since it's about our mental categories, not about the natural world itself.</p></div>		</li>
