			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating! Thanks for your reply. I find it truly mind-bottling (hehe) that even though I'm choosing when to speak, and that there's these areas in the brain that are responsible for pulling and creating words for me to use and say, yet I'm not consciously aware of which words will come next. They just flow (not eloquently per say, but coherent enough for the listener to understand). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently started thinking about dreaming like that.  How the brain can subconsciously create a virtual world with you yourself interacting in it, but also sometimes other people that can say or do things that surprise, intrigue, or frighten my dreaming self/avatar - and it's doing this all on the fly...  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great summary of language processing. I'd like to add that there's been some advances in understanding Broca's and Wenicke's area, and that there's a whole network outside of these areas.</p>
<p>Most neuroscientists would agree that Broca's and Wenicke's areas are engaged in grammar and syntax, ie the rules that string words into sentences. The particular function of each area are not as well known, but Broca's area has been implicated in &quot;merging&quot; grammatical phrases into larger ones. However, there is evidence suggesting that both areas have functions outside of grammar. In particular, Broca's area has been shown to process both music and complex action--and both areas have structural hierarchies of information.</p>
<p>Outside of these canonical areas, it has been argued that some motor areas are involved with language. The supplementary motor area has been implicated in word sequencing as well as speech in noise perception, and the premotor cortex acts like Broca's area. Relevant to OPs question, many scientists think that word selection involves the temporal cortex, which may store a sort of mental dictionary of words and meanings. </p>
<p>This is a very active area of research, so I'm incredibly excited to see how well this comment ages! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about when a person speaks multiple languages? Each language has somewhat different syntax and person has different levels of skills? Is the vocabulary in some different part of the brain and then processed through Broca's and Wenicke's area despite if it's mother tongue or a foreign language where you sometimes need to think more to find the proper word?</p></div>		</li>
