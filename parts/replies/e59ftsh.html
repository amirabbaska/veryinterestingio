			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense - same thing happens with potatoes, I never thought to correlate that with starch though. Usually keep lid on until boil, then take it off and reduce heat slightly to cook.</p>
<p>Saw some comments suggesting adding oil, but I think that adds a funny texture to pasta when cooked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing you're supposed to put in the water is salt.  No oil.  And the proper amount of salt is enough to make it taste like sea water.  And cooked to 'al dente' which is about 1 or 2 minutes before fully cooked (depending on pasta type).  Then you're supposed to put the pasta in with your sauce and finish cooking the pasta for the last minute or two.  This also helps the pasta absorb the sauce for flavor.</p>
<p>Your pasta shouldn't require any salt after serving - the pasta water (and sauce depending on type) should be salted properly during preparation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Man why is it every other pasta place just drops the sauce on top of the bare noodles? By the time it's on my table the noodles are all stuck together and rubbery and it's impossible to mix. Just mix it in the pot goddamnit!</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, that would be too much salt. That's just some rule of thumb that somebody once said because your water needs to be saltier than one would expect as the noodles don't absorb all the water and only take on salt until the osmotic equilibrium is achieved. But you don't want actual sea water levels of salt as it would make your pasta taste too salty.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This is correct. Add enough salt so the pasta/sauce combo tastes nice. If you haven't added enough to your pasta or sauce then you can add some after you have mixed both until you get the tastes you want but be careful because at this point it's harder to correct if you accidentally add too much salt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I throw in a personal little aside: be careful when adding salt to the water if your recipe calls for adding pasta water to the sauce. </p>
<p>Made some junk the other week and it turned out the saltiest thing I've ever eaten, didn't even cross my mind I'd salted the piss out of my water first. </p></div>		</li>
