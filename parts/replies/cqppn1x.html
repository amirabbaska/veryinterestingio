			<div class="markdown"><p>Enjoy <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/podcasts/stuff-you-should-know.rss" target="_blank">Stuff You Should Know</a> and [TechStuff]( <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/podcasts/techstuff.rss" target="_blank">http://www.howstuffworks.com/podcasts/techstuff.rss</a>) also.</p>
<p>Both updated multiple times a week by the same group (howstuffworks.com) but equally amazing!  SYSK is the more famous one, in fact the most famous of them all from HowStuffWorks.</p>
<p>But anyway.. Generally.. Under known.</p>
<p>As someone who has listened to these podcasts since around 2008 when I won an iPod in a photo contest, I am really geeky about them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've missed a lot of episodes lately, but two recent episodes I really enjoyed were Mean World Syndrome and Exploding Ants. Their run of episodes during Feb was really good, esp. Lingerie Probability. From last year, you might want to check out The Science of Uncanny Music, The Horror Movie Aphrodisiac, and Trypophobia: Fear of Holes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a podcast that never really has a standout episode. They just do a good job researching topics that I wouldn't normally think would be interesting. I'm a podcast junkie and this is always consistently entertaining.</p></div>		</li>
