			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. We call a molecule like this (with one hydrophilic and one hydrophobic end) amphiphilic or amphipathic.</p>
<p>edit: I should say - it's not really correct to say that soap has one surfactant end - the fact that soap has both of these ends is what makes it a surfactant/amphiphile.   But yes, soap is an example. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, I think you have to consider how saturated the fatty acid is. For instance, something like chocolate has a lot of saturated fatty acid (palmitate) in it, so it's more difficult to remove with detergents because it's already hydrolyzed. It's going to be slightly more difficult to get those things to bind to water in the wash, so they'll just stick around. Some agents that increase the acidity can help also, because this will kind of dilute the hydroxide in the overall solution, freeing up those areas to react more readily with water (i.e., why people suggest cleaning with vinegar or lemon juice, etc).</p>
<p>Also disclaimer: not my area of expertise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point indeed! Didn't think about this, but should hold true: based on the type of fat, you have harder and easier stains.<br />
Check the molecules before dirtying clothes!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about when the stain dries (or anything else that makes it harder to remove)? That tends to make the stain more difficult to remove, and in some cases impossible (using any method I've tried). Adding water also doesn't seem to help.</p>
<p>Does the chemical makeup of it change as it dries or is there something else going on?</p></div>		</li>
