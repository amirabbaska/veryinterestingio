<p>Pretty rare because the conditions have to be just right for dew to form on some surfaces while leaving others tinder-dry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with that is the sheer force of an impact. Yes, theoretically it can ignite things, but coupled with the impact force It would most likely just obliterate everything and leave some smoldering wreckage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A real old Cornish guy once told me years ago that they put a metal pole in the bales sticking out, and everyday when making the rounds they check the pole and see how hot it is.  If it was excessively hot they would break open the bale .  He might have been bullshitting me....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We usually would leave them on the wagon at night covered then uncovered during the day. Or if it was really wet after a cutting and mowing we would let it sit for a few days in hope it would dry. Otherwise we would just run the bailer and let them drop. Let it dry out then just pick em up an toss em on the wagon later.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The reactions you speak about occurred 2 billion years ago when the percentage of U235 in naturally occuring u238 was much higher.  2 billion years later, due to the half-life of U235 being smaller than that of U238,  that percentage has shrunk so much that we needed to build a whole facility in Oak rigde tennesse during WW2 to artificially extract U235 from U238 ore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, Most meteors are cold when they hit the ground. It's not on fire. Its compressing the air in front of it enough to heat it so it glows. It would have to be a massive man killer to light anything on fire that way </p></div>		</li>
