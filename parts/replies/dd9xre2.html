			<div class="markdown"><p>Last time I had jury duty, during voire dire, (sp?) the ADA gave a long winded explanation of presumption of innocence and the state's burden to prove guilt. He then asked by a show of hands that if he did not present any evidence, would we find the defendant guilty, not guilty, or would you not know. I was the only person out of 20 something possible jurors to raise my hand for not guilty  (the rest raised their hands for &quot;wouldn't know&quot;). I couldn't believe it. I never want to be judged by my &quot;peers&quot;. Also, I wasn't chosen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last time I had jury duty, the defense attorney asked everyone to fill in the blank: &quot;innocent <strong>__</strong> proven guilty.&quot;  I was the only person who said that it was &quot;unless&quot; and not &quot;until.&quot;  I cheated a little bit because they had used that phrase during the introductory presentation, and I guess I'm the only one who was paying attention.  Also was not chosen.  I think they got enough people before they got to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scots Law doesn't work quite the same way as Common Law. Scottish juries originally had two verdicts: &quot;proven&quot; and &quot;not proven&quot;. In the 18th century, under English legal influence, the term &quot;not guilty&quot; was introduced to infer absolute innocence. This eventually transformed &quot;not proven&quot; into a verdict where the jury feels guilt has not been satisfactorily proven but whereby the accused may well be considered morally guilty. </p>
<p>It is essentially and practically the same as &quot;not guilty&quot; but still carries that technical legal difference. It wouldn't result in a retrial unless new evidence came up. Due to historic double jeopardy laws (which were revised in 2011) once acquitted – even if by &quot;not proven&quot; rather than &quot;not guilty&quot; – you couldn't be tried again for the same charge on the same facts.</p></div>		</li>
