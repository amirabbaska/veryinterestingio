Also, the &quot;news&quot; industry is very &quot;closed&quot; and a handful of companies control 70% of it all...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda. </p>
<p>You can buy plenty of cheaper stuff online at a fraction of the price.</p>
<p>Choice exists - there's a billion types of frames you can get through the various brands, but there's no competition between brands within that. </p>
<p>Go online, and you can buy China-made glasses for $20, which will eventually bring competition to the main street. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the same. The eyeglass industry is pretty much a monopoly from to bottom, filled with false choice.  There is legit competition in the auto industry, it's just that auto makers have different labels for slightly different cars </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand further on this. A lot of brands are actually just another Brands luxury sub-brand. Lexus IS Toyota luxury. Infinity is Nissan luxury. Genesis is the new Hyundai brand for luxury cars. Acura is Honda luxury. Mercury is Ford's I guess economy sub-brand.
Chrysler Jeep and Dodge are all owned by the same conglomerate. GM the worst brand in cars owns a ridiculous amount of sub brands including brands that no longer exist because management is horrible like Pontiac.
Kia and Hyundai from what I understand or actually the same company. Or one of the other I don't know the details. But the cars are basically exactly the same just with different names and a few tweaks for each brand. </p>
<p>Please excuse any typos I'm sure I'll be editing them out for hours. I've used Google voice typing.</p>
