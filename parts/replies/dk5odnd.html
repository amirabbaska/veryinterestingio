<p>For example, have you noticed you can read a page in a book much faster than you could recite the page out loud?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is interesting to me, because I whenever I read something, I read every word aloud to myself in my head. Of course, this is a bit faster than physically speaking it, because I don't have to physically move my tongue and lips around to other sounds, and have no chance of stumbling over sounds, but it's still definitely not &quot;much faster&quot;. I can sometimes make myself read faster, but it makes me feel kinda stressed, because my eyes are darting all over the place, and I feel like my comprehension plummets when I do it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>much of English is spoken in iambic pentameter</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only if you're permanently stuck in Shakespearean Actor Mode.</p>
<p>It is true that in spoken English, stressed syllables are usually spaced more or less equally. But iambic pentameter would restrict you to five stressed syllables at a time, and that's going to sound very stilted and awkward most of the time.</p>
<p>That paragraph in iambic pentameter:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the exact linguistic term for it, but your mention of stressed syllables reminded me of something I learned recently. English is actually a semi-tonal language. Not only are certain syllables stressed, but we can also stress individual words and by doing so change the meaning of the sentence. Try it.</p>
<p>SHE hit the dog. </p>
<p>She HIT the dog.</p>
<p>She hit THE dog. </p>
<p>She hit the DOG. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is emphasis and intonation, not tone, so it's not accurate to call English a &quot;semi-tonal language&quot;. These features are used to reflect the grammatical structure of a sentence -- for example, distinguishing between defining and non-defining relative clauses, or between statements and questions -- or to highlight what the speaker considers important, or to reflect the speaker's attitude in relation to the utterance -- for example, there is an intonation pattern for sarcasm, indicating that the speaker believes the opposite of what he's saying and intends to insult or belittle.</p>
<p>In your example, the meaning is exactly the same in every case -- a female whose identity has already been established has struck an identifiable dog. What's different in each case is which part of the sentence the speaker wants to draw special attention to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, my mistake. Would it be more accurate to say spoken English is just iambic (not necessarily in any meter)?. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not even that. I was using the term &quot;iambic pentameter&quot; in a very loose sense -- five stressed syllables per line.</p>
<p>In fact, though, it's even more specific than that: strictly speaking, an iamb is one unstressed syllable followed by one stressed syllable -- the &quot;da-DUM-da-DUM-da-DUM&quot; rhythm of some poetry. If it doesn't have that rhythm, then strictly speaking it's not iambic anything.</p></div>		</li>
