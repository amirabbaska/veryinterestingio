<p>Another way to look at it is to approach it from the other side, time wise. Let's begin in the now and ask yourself, why are living creatures here? Let's take a plant as an example. It is here because there was a plant before it. And there was a plant before that one too. It's not here because it wants to, it's here because millions of plants survived before it that happened to reproduce. Plants that do not reproduce are not here because, well obviously they didn't reproduce. </p>
<p>The microorganisms don't know how /want to reproduce. But because if they didn't, they wouldn't be here.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm not good with words, hope you understand it anyways. Also, I know I left out the 'how it's all saved on the DNA' part.</p></div>		</li>
