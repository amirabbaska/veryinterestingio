			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so based on that, the thing to do is take your dried spaghetti pasta out the night before, put it in a container of water over night and dinner takes no longer that heating the sauce?  That is very cool.  It's like soaking beans.  Any idea how long the pasta will stay good at ambient temp? I am thinking about camping etc where there's no fridge.  It's light to pack, goes a long way to feed many ... Geez, will rice do something similar?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The real question is will the pasta remain al dente after such a soak and reheat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible, but you'll have to learn where the sweet spot for both hydrating and cooking is. Fresh pasta can be al dente so there's no reason rehydration would prevent it. But now you have two steps where you can overshoot instead of one. </p>
<p>I'm spitballing here, but the best way to rehydrate dried pasta without over hydrating it is probably to determine the exact amount of water to add to a given mass of dry pasta, and then vacuum seal it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know, it's actually not entirely clear what the final conclusion and recommended technique is from reading that.  He mentions &quot;pre-soaking pasta and having it sitting in your fridge, you don't have to bring a pot of water to a boil every time you want to eat it&quot;.  So... does that mean you can leave it soaking in your fridge for a week if you want??</p>
<p>But then in the next paragraph he says &quot;start the pasta soaking while I prepare a sauce or other ingredients&quot;.  So... really it only needs to soak for a few minutes??</p>
<p>And then in the next section, I'm completely confused about whether he's saying this technique does work for spaghetti, or doesn't because it sticks together too easily.</p>
<p>Then there's the alternative method he mentioned earlier about putting dry pasta in a pot and covering it with water and then &quot;follow the back of the box for timing, starting the timer as soon as it comes to a boil, and subtracting a minute or two from the recommended time.&quot;  But wait... is that different than the technique of letting it soak while preparing the other ingredients, or is that the same technique?? But I think maybe that was the technique that didn't work well with spaghetti??  I have no idea.</p></div>		</li>
