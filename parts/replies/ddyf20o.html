			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say that my daughter has a fluoride allergy.  We figured it out when we moved to a house with well water and all her health issues cleared up.  A few trips to grandmas where she drank the water there (same municipal water system) and got sick again seem to confirm it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just think the whole things weird... of all the additives to add to water we choose something to stop tooth decay? Why stop there? Why not add vitamin C? Why not add nothing and just give free fluoride pills to people that need it? I've heard it said that fluoridation has reduced tooth decay, but then in a similar time period brushing and tooth care has improved/ increased too. Just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fluoride is extremely stable and only needs to be added in minute quantities to water. This makes it an optimal choice vs something like vitamin C that would break down quickly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I was getting at... When you do research to back up their claim it usually references a study done by Germany in 1940 and a press release shortly after the war about the German chemical company that produced the gas used to commit atrocities also produced the fluoride used in the water. Therefore folks conclude fluoride is bad too.</p>
<p>Attempts to replicate the study in mammals have failed. There have been environmental studies of birds that actually find a possible increase of aggression in birds that have eaten fish from water that has far too much fluoride in it. Usually studying chemical spills and it's effect on the environment after the incident occurred. </p>
<p>A study done in 2013 on mice/rats failed to find any behavioral or health problems in the mice/rats that consumed extreme levels of fluoride in their water over their lifetime. </p>
<p>You gotta remember it's the same folks that think fluoride is subduing the population also believes climate change is not influenced by humans. They use old science to back up their argument on fluoride and ignore modern science on climate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When you have a dose rate that is significantly above recommended, there appears to be some negative cognitive effects, although the magnitude is relatively low.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exposed groups had access to drinking water with fluoride concentrations up to 11.5 mg/L (Wang SX et al. 2007); thus, in many cases concentrations were above the levels recommended (0.7â€“1.2 mg/L; DHHS) or allowed in public drinking water (4.0 mg/L; U.S. EPA) in the United States (U.S. EPA 2011)</p>
