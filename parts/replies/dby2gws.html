			<div class="markdown"><p>No no no, the mixers know that most people will be listening with stereo, and most audio engineers will know how to avoid what you're talking about pretty easily. And if you're talking about the system not mixing down correctly, your TV knows it needs just the stereo mix. If you dont have a surround sound setup and enable it to be output, your tv wont assume you're using surround (which would mess things up). If everything was set to output the surround mix at default, 95% of all listening experiences would be pure garbage.</p>
<p>It all just comes down to dynamic range, if you want whispers the same volume as an explosion, the movie is going to feel very flat and dull. It would be a pretty easy feature to implement, for those who want to subject themselves to a poor audio experience in exchange for volume normalization. Im not sure why its not more common, but its comes down to maintaining the feeling of what is on screen. Fight scenes should be louder than low-talk by the campfire scenes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Artistically speaking your argument makes sense. But from a consumer who had wanted this for a very very long time it's annoying to hear that it could be easily done.</p>
<p>I can understand a slight change in volume, but it's obnoxious at sometimes. To the point that it ruins the movie because I have to constantly maintain the volume manually. </p></div>		</li>
