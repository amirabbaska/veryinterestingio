			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, no, not really. In the video you linked he says that what you say is the actual answer is not a good one, because it would mean that a wild universe appeared, already big and wide, which is very unlikely. Because if it was a big bang, the stars would not have &quot;started&quot; a long distance away from us.</p>
<p>It has more to do with the fact that the waves of radiation coming from stars are stretched (redshifted) by the expansion of the universe, causing light to go lower on the spectrum, to the point where it's not visible anymore, as the top comment pointed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>youre misunderstanding the expansion of the universe. the universe is not expanding from a single point, space everywhere is expanding. take a look at this image <a href="https://imgur.com/kmJ4kFj" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/kmJ4kFj</a> to both galaxies point of view space is expanding away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That does not change his explanation, though. Whether space expanded from a single point or everywhere at once, the facts remain that 1) the stars would not have originated as far away from us as they currently are, and 2) the waves of radiation coming from the stars are stretched/redshifted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, what? I always thought expansion meant from a single point. I wish I could understand physics more easily. It's so hard for my brain to fully understand this stuff. I feel constantly mindblown by everything and it's getting worse as I get older. lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every observer will still perceive the expansion of the universe as if it was expanding away from a single point--the point being their location--and so the Principal of Equivalence tells us that the two perceptions must result in the same outcome. Therefore the same redshift must occur in both reference frames. The only difference is the perception of <em>how</em> the redshift occurs, which clearly doesn't matter here since what we care about is the outcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The big bang doesn't say that the entire universe was in a single point - it says our observable universe was in a single point and expander. This point was next to the other infinite number of points representing the rest of the universe that we can't see, and thus made up a still infinite universe. Another commenter has a good explanation for the expansion of space, so I'll leave that part to him. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The expansion of the universe will prevent us from ever having a sky as bright as the sun because most stars will always be too far away for the light to reach us</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So does that mean that a certain large portion of our universe moved away from us at faster than light speed for a sustained period of time? Or does it mean that earlier in the universe, any given spot was closer to seeing that universal bright light (if an observer were around somehow) and it's just dimmed since then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stars didn't exist in the very early universe when everything was close enough to reach equilibrium so there was never a point where starlight caused the night sky to be universally bright. By the time we got stars the universe was pretty big already and the light from distant stars was to far away to ever get to us because of the expansion of the universe. </p>
<p>My understanding is that basically all of the universe has expanded away from us faster than light and we'll never see it. If the universe is infinite then the tiny bubble of our visible universe is basically nothing compared to the whole universe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yay. I'm glad someone posted this. Me and my astrobiology professor would spent hours discussing paradoxes. Super fun. This was my favorite to figure out. I love Olber's paradox. Simple now, but back then a real question they didn't know the answer to. And it gives me hope that some day soon all of our &quot;unanswerable questions&quot; will be answered and common knowledge.</p></div>		</li>
