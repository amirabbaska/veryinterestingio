</blockquote>
<p>That's not order in the thermodynamic sense. </p>
<p>Entropy as order can be articulated as the distance from equilibrium. </p>
<p>For example, imagine a balloon (filled with a lot of air) in a room. Imagine the room is the entire universe. </p>
<p>If you waited a trillion years, what would the condition of the room be? You can know intuitively the air in the balloon will have found a way out and dispersed throughout the room. </p>
<p>The molecules of air in the balloon are thus ordered, and the molecules spaced evenly throughout the room are thus disordered. </p>
<p>That's an increase in entropy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Entropy is actually a measure of how many different ways that certain state can exist.  It is associated with order because a there is only one way that an ordered state can be.</p>
<p>Imagine a room with 10 items and 10 places to put those items.  Start with a completely ordered room.  Each item is in its exact place.  This is low entropy.  Then go in and randomly select two items and trade their places.  Now there are eight items in the right place and two items in the wrong place.  There are a lot of ways this can happen, so this is higher entropy.  Now do it again.  Chances are you now have 6-7 items in the right place.  Now do it again.  And again.  You end up with a mess.  Do it again and it is still a mess!  You probably can't even tell the difference before and after each switch.  There are so many different ways that something can be a mess.  That is high entropy.  There's is no law preventing things from randomly going back to the ordered state, but the odds are so astronomically against it that you can say that it will never happen.</p>
<p>That second paragraph was too long but just wanted to make that argument.  If you slightly alter a low entropy state, you will make a significant change.  if you slightly alter a high entropy state, you'll get something which is only technically different -- otherwise it looks the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually its just a quantity like mass or temperature. There are a lot of cool ideas that come from measuring the entophy of things though. </p></div>		</li>
