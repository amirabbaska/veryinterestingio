<p><em>Rocket Surgery</em>. As in, &quot;It ain't Rocket Surgery!&quot;</p>

</li>
<li><em>Rocket Brain Surgery Scientist</em>. As in I'm just fuckin' with two good friends who happen to be retired Rocket Scientists. Back in the day one of them, along with his father (another Rocket Scientist), solved the 2-tethered-masses-rotating-in-orbit problem. Nasty bit o' work, that.</li>
