<p>Edit: didn’t read carefully. Question was whether there was MORE radiation from flying. Not sure about that answer. Dose depends on flight duration, altitude, latitude,... for more info:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In radiation safety we use a principle called 'as low as reasonably achievable' (ALARA) with the thinking of 'better safe than sorry', i.e. 'better to err on the side of caution'. Being exposed to more than the legal limit does not imply harm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, radiation dose is all about statistics. 1 millirad corresponds to an <em>extremely</em> small chance of causing damage that ultimately produces symptoms (ignoring the distinction between dose and exposure, but that's a different topic). Ultimately however the underlying biological processes are quite complex and it's difficult to say what the exact threshold will be before bad stuff happens, hence ALARA. You'll almost certainly be fine, but just don't take the risk in the first place if possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add context to this answer, 1 millirad is equal to .00001 grays, and the amount of radiation one gets from an Abdominal X-ray is about .0012 grays.</p>
<p>If you get a whole body PET scan it can be as much as .014 grays, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(radiation\)" target="_blank">this</a> article.</p>
<p>EDIT: Ok, so after doing some research (I am <em>not</em> an expert) it turns out that the actual units used in the article are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert" target="_blank">sieverts (Sv)</a> and not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_(unit\)" target="_blank">grays (Gy)</a> and the relationship between the two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_dose" target="_blank">is</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose_(radiation\)" target="_blank">very</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorbed_dose" target="_blank">complicated</a> (even if they have the same dimensions), so just take the numbers with a grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wgen you see the shielding at the entry and exit it is quite obvious they can not emit a lot of radiation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah no. How much shielding there is in a secondary barrier goes toward how much lateral scatter the device is producing. For lower energy X-ray systems, like this bag scanner, that's not a whole lot. But the primary beam from the scanner could be doing a lot of dose.</p></div>		</li>
