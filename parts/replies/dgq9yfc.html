			<div class="markdown"><p>That line is the closest description to the sensation I felt often as a kid. It rarely happens anymore as an adult.</p>
<p>When I saw the post, this line came into my head. I have never &quot;seen&quot; the room shrink, but I have felt my body shrink and grow at the same time. I called it feeling &quot;gigantically tiny.&quot; </p>
<p>It is an odd and frustrating sensation. </p></div>		</li>

<p>However, i believe the line is not &quot;you would not understand&quot; but instead...</p>
<p>&quot;You'll not understand&quot; </p>

<p>And Album liner lyrics: <a href="http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/7536095ceb914569ad2c5991f1231dae/pink-floyd-comfortably-numb-track-from-the-wall-album-d5k527.jpg" target="_blank">http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/7536095ceb914569ad2c5991f1231dae/pink-floyd-comfortably-numb-track-from-the-wall-album-d5k527.jpg</a></p>
<p>But don't feel bad.  I've misheard a bunch of lyrics far worse.  <em>&quot;I'm a pool hall ace&quot;</em> is how I always hear <em>&quot;How my poor heart aches&quot;</em> from The Police's <em>Every Breath You Take</em>.</p></div>		</li>
