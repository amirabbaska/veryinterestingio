			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome explanation. I'd like to add that the technological and social differences also add some issues. East and West Germany were only 10-20 years apart, but North Korea is almost 100 years behind South Korea as far as the general population goes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting. </p>
<p>I'd be interested to hear what you thought of an idea I had regarding NK.</p>
<p>Using a series of stealthed jets to drop scattered payloads of handheld devices (tablets?), each designed to show the native population a resource of information about the outside world. It would have detachable solar panels for power and be able to receive (but not transmit) information such as daily news. </p>
<p>The purpose of this would be to give these people a way to know what's really going on and (hopefully) spur a population to rebel against the regime without needing any significant outside interference. They would be dropped all over the country.</p>
<p>Base on your comment, I take it as a given that having one of these devices would be punished with death, but I'm curious what you think NK's general public would do? Would they all end up being collected and destroyed out of fear, or would they be widely hidden away by curious people? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the same person, but I can say they'd definitely have nothing to do with them. And those that did would be very severely punished.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even the ones that do watch without consequence
(maybe greasing a few palms in the process) won't be taking the propaganda as seriously as you'd imagine. They know their own government and television exaggerate things for effect. The houses and stuff must be exaggerated in the same way, after all, who could have a fridge that an entire person could fit into? Or multiple cars?</p>
<p>Some things can't be fabricated, like the massive skyline of Seoul, but those things are oblique enough to fall under sway of things like &quot;They live in those skyscrapers dependent on US imperialism and work all day, even the kids, in order to not get thrown out into the street.&quot;</p>
<p>If you were going to fly anything in, try to make it as unpropagandized as possible. People in complete disagreement with each other over some political situation, or maybe anti-American sentiments spoken in public (after all, the South is a US puppet state, is it not?) Show some of the dark sides of South Korean life, like homelessness and the education system.</p>
<p>At any rate, all of these approaches would have very small reach in the North Korean community, because of all the monitoring and the risk of being sent to prison for not immediately turning over the material to the police.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That has kind of already happened. Portable DVD players with Korean soap operas are widespread by many reports. </p>
