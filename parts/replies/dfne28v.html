			<div class="markdown"><p>oxygen poisoning is only a problem when breathing a high FiO2 (fractional pressure of O2).  since you're still in normal atmosphere you're still breathing 21% oxygen and O2 poisoning can't occur.  oxygen levels only build up in the blood significantly when inhaling higher ratios of O2</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, pO2 will still be higher, as the percentage of oxygen in the air stays the same - but it should still be below the level that would be harmful for long-term exposure, as it will be only 20% above the normal pO2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be easier though. </p>
<p>You would have extra air pressure helping you breath more oxygen in each breath. -5,000ft on land is roughly the same pressure as being 50 ft underwater (50 fsw). As you said, that's nothing. You would be able to easily breathe. In hyperbaric chamber therapy, 50' water pressure can be &quot;lived&quot; in for 30+ hours. You would have no problem with oxygen toxicity or trouble breathing through the pressure living at -5,000ft.</p></div>		</li>
