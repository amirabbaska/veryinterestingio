			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Airplane internet is shit since they have worthless connections to satellites. Fast movement and long distance makes it unreliable. </p>
<p>If everyone used the internet on planes it wouldn't load anything. But if few people use it (because of pay barrier) they can use it, but still bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how their network is setup exactly but their <a href="https://www.qantasnewsroom.com.au/media-releases/qantas-switches-on-fast-free-inflight-wifi/" target="_blank">news</a> makes it seem Netflix and Spotify is locally stored on the planes and doesn't even require internet access. They have special agreements with those services. Wifii =/= Internet.</p>
<p>Next time you fly, try to access a youtube clip and see how fast it loads. That 100% not stored on the plane. If its fast, then I'm amazed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk when you last flew Qantas, but I fly Emirates pretty frequently (a massive partner of Qantas, to the point where I think they bought them but I’m too lazy to check), and it started out with free 20 MB, and 1$ 500MB, now it’s 20$ for 500MB. I still get free unlimited because my Skywards tier is pretty high, but those are the current prices for non frequent fliers. They were free/next to free because they were testing that shit, and didn’t want to be held accountable if it went tits up. I’d say Qantas should be the same by now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most airplane data connections have been terrestrial connections which is why the connection was so poor and why it didn't work over water and in some countries. They are now starting to move to higher bandwidth satellite connections that will be much better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never been on a flight that offered wifi. I didn't even know it was possible for a plane to have wifi because,  you know,  the fast movement and all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also noticed when traveling recently that many of the big airports also charge for wifi, so yeah this is a bigger factor imo.</p></div>		</li>
