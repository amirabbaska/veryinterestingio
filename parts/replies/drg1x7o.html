			<div class="markdown"><p>How would they be able to index way back then? I know you can figure a lot out with how they react to each other and whatnot, but a lot of my (limited) understanding of valence electrons and reactivity and stuff seems like it's really easy to understand in hindsight, but when nearly everything is potentially an unknown it seems like it'd be pretty difficult.</p>
<p>EDIT: In case my understanding of &quot;indexing&quot; is wrong, what I'm asking is how do they know how many proton/electrons/neutrons (and by extension, their place on a the periodic table) these things have?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorting by protons and neutrons is merely using those as a measure of mass. They might not have known how things were interacting under the hood, but a lot can be learned with simple but highly accurate measurements and observations. The creation of the periodic table basically served as the Ihop on the left that means you've gone too far as, being ordered by mass as well as reactivity, you know when you've passed where an unknown element has to be. Im sure there are volumes describing the processes and lucky breaks that advanced chemistry that can speak much more intelligently on it than I can. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They didn't, but they knew the properties and the mass and so could order them by mass in lines and similar properties in columns which started to show a pattern which became the periodic table. You don't need to know the mechanism of the chemical reactions or what particles give the elements mass.</p></div>		</li>
