			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know of any conditions where someone's heart is congenitally smaller than it should be? My great grandmother supposedly died young and doctors said she lived far longer than she should have due to the size of her heart. I've always been curious about it as a scientist, but as a chemist I don't know much about congenital heart defects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know essentially nothing about congenital heart defects.  They’re incredibly complex and only pediatric doctors deal with them, and only a small subset of them </p>
<p>Edit: thought more about it.  If she was part grinch, then her heart could have been up to 3x too small.  Studies on this were done by the esteemed Dr. Seuss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They didn't know she had it until she died in her 50's. I guess they looked into it since she hadn't been sick. Just had a really small heart they said.</p>
<p>She was an avid gardener and they said that physical activity likely strengthened it so she lived as long as she did. Of course, this was in the 1960's when she passed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mum has a smaller than normal heart for her size. She was a twin and she apparently got the short end of the straw with the heart. At least that’s what I heard doctors telling her when I was younger. </p>
<p>She had a few heart attacks due to it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have Pectus excavatum. I'm not super tall, I would say i am average height. Does that mean my organs are smaller than they should be?</p>
<p>I have already researched all the issues that could come from this but still have a few issues myself that I don't know if it's linked to the dent in my chest (mostly morning sickness and random short of breath moments). Are there any serious implications from Pectus excavatum? Can this condition be rectified in a 23 year old? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the condition corrected by the Nuss bar when I was 16. The nuss procedure has been successfully done on adults! When I had it done in 09 the biggest complication was getting insurance to see it as something that wasn’t cosmetic. I can say with 100% certainty that it’s improved my breathing and self confidence!</p>
<p>Also,  to add on I’d say I saw a major increase in lung capacity (roughly 20-25%). I no longer get shortness of breath from light physical exercise, and my asthma more or less vanished. However, after the surgery I had MAJOR chest pain for ~ 4 months which stopped me from doing anything until the pain was tolerable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never heard of this. I just read up about it now and it sounds horrible. I couldn't read through a sentence without cringing. Was it painful? Was there a desperate health issue that required it or was it fear of future issues that made you get the procedure.</p>
<p>I would say i have a pretty bad case but not extreme (i think. It's really uncommon so I don't have much to compare to. It actually looks exactly like the first pictures you find on google. So i guess I'm textbook) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, I have a maybe dumb question but something I've always wondered about. Is blood always in vessels, or does it ever pool around the body in giant oceans?  Yes, I'm aware that's what a bruise is, kind of. When you cut into a body, all this blood comes out, but it's not in thick veins or arteries because you can see those.  Are there tiny invisible capillaries all over your body? Or is blood just milling about sometimes?  Because that's what it looks like if you watch a video of a surgery, or diagrams of the circulatory system - like, there's places where there wouldn't be blood vessels but obviously if you opened up the body - hey, there's blood!</p>
<p>Is the &quot;fluid&quot; you mention here not blood?  Like, if someone has edema, is that blood or some other bodily fluid?</p>
<p>I've always wondered this. I've never been able to picture it right in my head. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blood is composed of cells and proteins suspended in a salty, nutrient rich solution called plasma. The red blood cells give it the red colour, and are the most common cell, but there are others.</p>
<p>In general, blood remains in the circulation. And you're right, there's millions of tiny capillaries supplying all your body tissues. They are the connection between arteries and veins. Capillaries are narrow enough that blood cells only manage to get through in a slow trickle, sometimes only one by one.</p>
<p>However, those capillaries are porous. At the arterial end of the capillary, where the blood pressure (or hydrostatic pressure) is high, they allow the smallest molecules, those dissolved in plasma, to leak out and bathe the tissues. This allows for diffusion of nutrients to supply adjacent body cells. Waste products diffuse from adjacent cells into the plasma. </p>
<p>Because proteins and blood cells remain in the vascular space, the pull of the concentration gradient (or oncotic pressure), draws the plasma back in at the venous end, where the blood pressure is lower. </p>
<p>Edema typically occurs when there is an imbalance between the pressures, or an excessively leaky capillary. So if blood protein is low, not all the fluid gets pulled back into the blood vessels. If there is a backlog of fluid because the heart isn't pumping well, the pressure in the venous end of the capillary is too high, and fluid remains in the tissue. If the capillary encounters inflammatory chemicals, it becomes extra leaky.</p>
<p>In the case of watching surgery, it's probably just blood that has spilled as a result of cutting vessels. But I think it's a really cool concept so I decided to write it out anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blood is always in a vessel. When you cut in a lot of capillaries will break and that’s what you’re seeing when it pools. But even then it’s not that much, relative to the amount of blood in the body anyways. It can be mopped up with gauze fairly quickly and easily. There are other fluids, as well. Interstitial fluid and stuff but I’m not really sure about all that. But yeah as far as blood goes it’s not sloshing around anywhere. Or at least it shouldn’t be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oedema is basically plasma (the liquid, non-cellular part of blood) being pushed out of your blood vessels and into the interstitial (between cells) space of the surrounding tissue, either because your blood pressure is very high (you can see this in the lungs where the pulmonary blood pressure gets very high for various reasons, leading to fluid build up in the lungs and potentially even coughing up &quot;pink frothy sputum&quot;), you have depleted albumin (which is a protein that acts to bind to less-soluble things in the blood but also contributes to the osmolality of the blood  - less of that means the osmolality of the surrounding tissue is higher than the blood and pulls water into the interstitium), or you have increased vascular permeability (your bloid vessel linings get &quot;leaky&quot;, seen in allergic reactions, particularly anaphylactic shock).</p>
<p>A lot of your bodily fluids are really just plasma plus or minus a few things (not 100% accurate but that's how I think about it) because blood is how you get things from one part of the body to another. If you want to make things, especially liquid things, everything you need for that is coming from the blood anyway. Eg, urine is blood that has been run through a sieve (called the glomerulus in your kidney) to collect the liquid part plus some smaller solutes like glucose and electrolytes, which then get reabsorbed in varying amounts. Bigger things like blood cells and proteins like albumin remain in the blood and return to the systemic circulation, but it's reasonably accurate to describe urine as a filtrate of blood. </p></div>		</li>
