			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought this was the case! Thanks for posting. My dad has a degree in hardware engineering and explained it to me at one point but I wasn't sure if I was remembering right. It's all blinking so the one that blinks more often uses more power :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a strange way to put it. If the circuitry is ON constantly it is steady. You are saying that it &quot;sends ON&quot; as if it was doing so actively and repeatedly. The circuit doesn't change state to keep the power to the LED on (to keep &quot;sending ON&quot;). The circuit keeps &quot;sending ON&quot; until it &quot;changes state&quot; and for instance closes a transistor, at which point it is no longer &quot;steady&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is with analog circuitry with digital circuitry and LEDs everything is based on the clock and in every cycle you have to tell the LED to either stay ON or to turn OFF. When it looks &quot;steady&quot; ir actually isn't. If you have a really, really fast camera you would still see it blinking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even in digital circuitry the same state twice means no blinking e.g. going 1-1 is not 1-short 0-1</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How's that result in using less energy tho? </p>
<p>Like how a car uses less energy/fuel if it's slowly going a constant 5mph instead of stopping. Going. Stopping. Going. Etc. </p>
<p>If something similar applies here in our clock as does our car, in terms of fuel/energy, the constant stream should be more effecient than stop n go, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because being &quot;steady&quot; requires it to be flickering at a constant rate &quot;ON…ON…ON…ON&quot; as opposed to &quot;ON……ON……&quot; when blinking (half the time).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it also takes the car half the time to reach the same spot going at a constant rate than it would the other way yet it uses less energy. So less time doesn't itself mean less energy it seems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not flickering. The LED is powered constantly unless you are dimming it using PWM.</p></div>		</li>
