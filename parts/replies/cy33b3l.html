			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be the #1 answer.  The group of executives the board had running the network at that time had a massive, potentially game-changing portfolio of shows that they quite literally fucked into the ground.  Those idiots cancelled Titus, Firefly, Futurama, AND Family Guy.  People forget that Family Guy was in the same boat as Futurama until that group of executives got shitcanned for being utterly shitty at their jobs.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as OP sees it, my mission was complete. Futurama was the first tv series i made sure i bought each season for, and ive only done that with 3 other shows, sienfeld, archer, and FMA(both original and brotherhood.</p>
<p>I love futurama and cant sleep without either it or archer on in the background. Both are good to watch over and over, but not so unknown that i stay up to see the end like a movie. I just put it on and let the voices(sometimes even the directors commentary bring me to sleep. The next show im going to be getting as it comes out is rick and morty. Cant wait for season 2 dvd</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should be higher.  Futurama was consistently preempted by football.  Week after week I'd tune in only to see it interrupted or not shown at all.  I watched the vast majority of seasons 1-4 on DVD a few years after it was canceled, because I literally couldn't see it as it aired (or not, as was frequently the case).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite &quot;Fuck you&quot; from Fox came during the war episode.  Fox interrupted the episode just as the bomb in Bender's ass blew up to tell us that the secretary of state of Florida had certified the election for Bush.  Literally with like 1 minute left in the episode.  For something that was never in doubt (The secretary of state's actions, not Bush winning Florida).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They about ruined the Simpsons screwing with timeslots in the same way. Season one was a top 10 show Sundays at 8pm. Then they moved it to Thursdays to compete against the Cosby's and the ratings plummeted for a while, but they did eventualy recover, mostly. Then they moved them back to Sundays in season 6.</p></div>		</li>
