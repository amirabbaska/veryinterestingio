			<div class="markdown"><p>For the numbers, the vapor pressure of CO2 at -90C is 300 mmHg (1) which is about 0.4 atm. This means at -90C, pure CO2 will &quot;push&quot; into gas form from solid form at a pressure of 0.4 atmospheres. </p>
<p>The partial pressure of a gas is its molar fraction multiplied by the pressure of the mixture. Air has 0.04% CO2 which multiplied by atmospheric pressure is 0.0004 atm. Since this is way smaller than the 0.4 atm of pure CO2, it will not form a solid as it's not being &quot;pushed&quot; out of gas form. </p>
<p>To work the other way, at 0.004 atm, the vapour pressure that would match the partial pressure of CO2 in air is approx -130C (1), which is when you'd start to see atmospheric CO2 desubliming. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm thinking it's unlikely - the snowball period has been postulated to be caused, amongst many things, by a reduction in greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>If you reduce the CO2 levels, the partial pressure becomes lower even if the global temperature decreases. Conversely, increasing CO2 would make the partial pressure of CO2 higher, except the global temperatures rise too, such that CO2 is likely to stay as a gas. </p>
<p>In future, if there is a case where global warming goes out of control and creates a CO2 rich atmosphere, and the sun dims enough, then the conditions would be right...be it's unlikely humans would be around to see it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Less in favour of precipitation i would say:</p>
<p>1) rising altitude leads to lower concentrations of heavier gases in a mixture. CO2 is relatively heavy as a gas, so the partial pressure will only go down as altitude increases</p>
<p>2) Vostok (where the -90C was measured) is already 3500m altitude which so high already that water clouds struggle to form - this is why they actually only get 22mm of snow a year (it doesn't rain because it's cold there), and it's one of the driest places on earth (in terms of air humidity). If that's the case for water (which is actually lighter than CO2 as a gas), then CO2 precipitation is extremely unlikely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since they would never precipitate, there won't be any <em>particles</em> stuck in the snow. But snow contains a lot of air, so the CO2 is effectively captured anyway (as a gas).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is it that makes partial pressure relevant to this process? By contrast the boiling point of water depends on total pressure. What makes the one process depend on partial and the other depend on total?</p></div>		</li>
