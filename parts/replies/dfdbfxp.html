			<div class="markdown"><p>The orbitals for the Hydrogen atom are actually relatively simple (at least compared to heavier elements). If you're programming a 3D graph you could plot <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_FkGV5soUkDY/TCfWG0iVLEI/AAAAAAAAAmc/w4rNEqfgvzo/s1600/Pauli-b.jpg" target="_blank">the first few</a> orbitals -- just write the equation and make the opacity of each point in space proportional to the square of value of the function at that point. The parameters are:</p>
<p>Z = charge of the nucleus. For Hydrogen this is equal to 1.<br />
a<em><em>0</em></em> = atomic radius. You can just set this to 1 as well, since the scale of the diagram won't matter.<br />
e^(something): exponential function. Most programming packages will have this built in, just search for &quot;exp()&quot; or similar.<br />
r, θ, φ: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/3D_Spherical.svg/1107px-3D_Spherical.svg.png" target="_blank">spherical coordinates in 3D space</a>. r is the distance from the centre, θ and φ are angles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll take a look at it, although I think that's just way too complicated for what I want to do :). The problem is that it should work for everything till iron :/</p>
<p>I'm in the 9th grade - everyone in my class ist about 14 years old, so it would be just too much.
I think I'll Male a Mode where each electrone ist just a cloud of particles, that should be enough (I added a GIF how it currently looks like).</p></div>		</li>
