If you were in a closed room you wouldn't be able to tell if you were moving at constant velocity but you could tell if you were rotating. The actual forces felt would depend on how fast you were rotating of course, but you could detect it e.g. if you held up a pendulum it would only point directly down at the centre of the room. I've no idea how to this on a universal scale but the principle would be the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm trying to get my head around this. So please bear with me and clear up my thinking on this.
If at the time the universe was little and if it had spin then as it got bigger(expanded) the gravity between the 'stuff' in the universe would have less and less attraction and that would get less and less with time as they got farther apart. Not so? Because no external gravity to universe. So is that why the universe is expanding at an ever increasing rate, its simply spinning in 'nothing' whatever that means?</p></div>		</li>
