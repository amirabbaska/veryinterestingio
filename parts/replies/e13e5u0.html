			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in China for a month, starting last Sunday. I went to one place where they didn't have any drinks other than a hot rice-wine-based soup. My friend told me that it's fairly common for people to eat meals with only hot soup for drink.</p>
<p>This is in Chengdu, where the food is spicy and the weather is hot and humid. I could really use clean ice water sometimes...</p>
<p>Anyway, the main reason for avoiding cold water here is that water has to be boiled to be safe in China. Ice is often frozen tap water, so anything iced has to be drunk before the ice melts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I didn't know that cooked food actually digested more efficiently. I always thought that we learned to cook because we figured out through gruesome and unfortunate trial and error that cooking reduces the chance of food-borne diseases.</p>
<p>(EDIT: I'm a derp. I misunderstood; you said specifically that <em>eating</em> it is quicker, not necessarily the actual digesting part. Still, the majority of my following questions still stand.)</p>
<p>I'm new to this board, so I hope this isn't going off-topic or anything: Does cooked food have the same efficient effect on non-human animals? And something I've always wondered, do you know if non-humans are as susceptible to food-borne diseases as we are? One thing that has always puzzled me is that you don't really seem to hear about animals being sick in the wild nearly as often as you hear about humans being sick. Seeing a sick animal on National Geographic and the like is rare. But that could just be because a sick animal dies very quickly in the wild, and wild animals being sick isn't nearly as important to humans as other humans being sick, so it doesn't get reported.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If i recall correctly we can't digest raw food as effectieve as a lot of animals. We cook our food, so it costs our body less energy to digest it, this energy can go to other things. Such as having a large brain an needing very little sleep. For example, the koala bear eats only poisonous plants as food. They don't get sick from this, but they do need 22 hours of sleep each day to digest it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned a theory in anthropology that basically said the body has a certain amount of &quot;expensive tissue&quot; it's willing to make. I don't know what all counts as &quot;expensive&quot;, but it included digestive and brain tissues. Our species traded digestive tissue for more brain tissue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do recall reading that for example, foxes actually have a harder time digesting cooked meat than they do raw meat. Could be wrong info, can't even recall where I read it, but if that is the case, it does show how widely varied guts can be when even just cooking it can do more harm than good for an animal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Michael Pollan’s book Cooked touches on a lot of the topics you are asking about here. He explains a lot of the scientific and cultural aspects of cooking.  Cooked food is both quicker to eat as well as to digest. Raw foods have tough structures that are difficult to break down by the digestive system. For example cows have a 4 stomach system just to progressively break down grass. The heat in cooking breaks down these structures allowing easier access to the nutrients in the food. </p>
<p>He does briefly talk about how cooked food is also more nutritional for animals as well. He mentions how many animals will choose cooked foods over raw ones. Not sure how scientific his claim/observation was though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I don't get saying it's not the opposable thumb. There are many factors separating us from other animals. Other than cooked food and opposable thumbs, there's brain size, tool use, distance running, bipedal movement, an extremely long time spent caring for young, complex language, and complex social structure. That's just off the top of my head, and a lot of those are interrelated with each other. So saying it's this one particular thing that makes us different is clearly wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying one thing makes us even more different is not completely wrong though. The point of saying opposable thumbs make us different is that opposable thumbs made us able to use basic tools (already tackled one of your specialties) that too made us able to cook food (rid of food illness), and that also made us be able to develop more powerful brains (another human specialty). From the powerful brains we were able to create and use much more complex tools, learn language and social structure, and for that reason we take care of the young for so long, to teach them that. Other than that we pretty much only have distance running, which is a pretty simple difference from other animals that wouldn’t put us in another class. As you can see, saying one particular thing makes us different is not so wrong after all, since all the other important differences likely stemmed from it.</p></div>		</li>
