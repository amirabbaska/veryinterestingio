			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily! Glioblastomas can be very encapsulated, or lower grade gliomas can be invasive. The new WHO grading has it more based on genetic properties of the tumor itself. The real trick with any cancer, but specifically GBM is getting all of the individual cells. With GBM, if you miss any cells at all, it will almost 100% come back with a vengeance. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually even worse than it sounds.  With astrocytomas, which are the most common cancers of the brain itself (and include glioblastoma, the deadliest one), it's less &quot;roots&quot; than it is individual tumor cells microscopically invading and blending into surrounding healthy brain.  The normal cells these tumors derive from are star-shaped supporting cells that naturally have the ability to move among neurons and their connections, so it's sort of easy for these tumors to develop that ability further and become wildly invasive.</p>
<p>While a skilled surgeon can identify tissue that looks like mostly tumor, and tissue that looks like mostly normal brain, the exact transition point where the tumor ends and healthy brain begins is essentially invisible.  Tissue that might look completely normal can have single individual tumor cells still in it.  So it becomes a balancing act of &quot;how much tissue can we remove to give this patient a chance at a good chemo/radiation response, but without damaging their brain too much.&quot;</p>
<p>And of course, some brain tumors occupy incredibly vital areas, and are therefore impossible to remove without killing the patient or leaving them too disabled to function anymore.  Tumors that involve the thalamus and brain stem are often inoperable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way my wife's neuro-oncologist described it is: imagine your brain as a bowl of white sand, then take a tablespoon (or more) of black sand, and pour it into the bowl.  Then whisk it.  Then try to take out the black sand.  Pretty grim.</p>
<p>And that is not for a GBM; rather, that was for a (at the time) Grade II astrocytoma that was later classified as a diffuse astrocytoma under the new WHO classification system.</p>
<p>So to answer the original question, it is next to impossible to remove every cell of the tumor.  Better surgeons, with newer and more improved techniques, can get a better chance of a gross total resection, which in turn, may lead to a better prognosis.  It's a tough world and a shitty diagnosis. </p>
<p>I am not familiar with other types of tumors outside gliomas; there are many with all kinds of different surgical approaches and outcomes from what I understand.  But more research equates with better science, better understanding, better technology and better results, so if you care, DONATE!</p>

<p>Vivid though that mental image surely is, and fitting too in how it conveys the difficulty of a neurosurgeon's job (it <em>is</em> virtually impossible to get every tumor cell), it also gives the impression that the tumor cells are evenly interspersed throughout the whole brain, which I think might be a bit <em>too</em> negative and grim.  The tumor cells are typically at least initially concentrated in one region of the brain, with variable depths of invasion away from the main tumor mass (although certainly, very aggressive GBM's can essentially take over a large swath of the brain, as in the classic <a href="https://www.nejm.org/na101/home/literatum/publisher/mms/journals/content/nejm/2018/nejm_2018.378.issue-3/nejmicm1704713/20180215/images/img_large/nejmicm1704713_f1.jpeg" target="_blank">&quot;butterfly glioma&quot;</a> pattern).</p>
<p>It's impossible to know in any given patient how invasive their tumor truly is, but it's in the spirit of hope that it is fairly early in the progression and localized that surgeons even bother to operate on astrocytomas.  If we knew for sure that a person's tumor had already spread microscopically to the opposite end of their brain, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a surgeon to remove the main tumor unless it was strictly for palliative symptom control.  Radiation of the tumor bed also wouldn't make sense, if we knew for sure it had spread far beyond the area immediately surrounding the main tumor.  Chemo would pretty much be the only option.</p></div>		</li>
