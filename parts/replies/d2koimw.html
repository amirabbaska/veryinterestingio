			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a very similar setup, retail and commercial sales under different company names.  The truth is retail gets a 60%-120% markup and still comes in at just barely better margin than the commercial side.  </p>
<p>It costs money to keep a direct to consumer quality website running, advertising, marketing, picking one item at a time (instead of 500-5000).  Sure you have to do those things but the cost of those things is much lower on the commercial side.</p></div>		</li>
