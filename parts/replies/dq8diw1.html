			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of years ago I was drinking with some old friends and a few I had never met before. Me and one of the new guys hit it off pretty well and hung out most of the night. He was a few years older than me, wife, young kids, and just funny as hell. At the end of the night, my friends dropped him off at his house. He apparently tripped going up his stairs and hit his head on the banister, got up, went in the house, laid down on the couch, fell asleep, and died. I know there is nothing I could have done, but I still think about that night. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guy I went to HS with was waterskiing and hit a ramp incorrectly. Miraculously he was ok a little banged up but fine. His parents were drs, checked him out and they went about their vacation. Next day they were following behind him in his Jeep when he suddenly veered out of the lane and flipped the Jeep. Another friend was in the vehicle w him and said that he had looked over and the driver had a blank expression, Apparently that ramp hit had caused an aneurism that finally burst the next day. He was dead before the car even flipped. The other friend lucked out and walked away w a broken arm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit. A buddy of mine fell straight backwards down 10-12 stairs right onto his nugget while also blackout drunk. I watched him fall, thinking, &quot;holy shit he's fuckin' dead.&quot;
But we carried him up the stairs by his arms and legs (everyone was quite shitfaced) and threw him on the couch. When I got up the next morning he was gone along with an 8th pf mushrooms I had stashed. Never saw that fucker again... I wonder if he lived? Damn dude, childhood memories.</p></div>		</li>
