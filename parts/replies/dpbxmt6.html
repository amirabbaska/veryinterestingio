			<div class="markdown"><p>You did the right thing!  I can't believe it's legal and not considered mutilation (which it is!).  Same procedure is done on women in some african countries where they remove the clitoral hood of women (the analog to the foreskin is the clitoral hood), and those places get threatened with sanctions for violence against women and female mutilation.  (There are varying types of FGM, and clitoral hood removal is just one variant).</p>
<p>Double standard.</p>
<p>Good for you for not getting it done to him!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically true in most places looking at the history of civilization, but if you go back further, to pre-history, there were real differences. Males in particular led violent, brutal lives and rarely lived to old age. You can see the same thing in animals today, almost all of which live much longer in captivity than in the wild.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If lifespan is based on the average # of years lived, then a high rate of infants dying will skew the lifespan lower. Like if we have a population of 100 people and most live to 80 but 20 die as infants, the lifespan might be averaged at 65 even though, again, most people who make it to adulthood live to 80.</p></div>		</li>
