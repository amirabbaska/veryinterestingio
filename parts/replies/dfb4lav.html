			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the detailed response!  I currently have a retainer to keep my top teeth touching.  The surgery to break my jaw will hopefully allow me to breathe through my mouth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get the surgery man, I was in a similar position except my jaw grew too much, I decided not to go with surgery and now my front bottom teeth are like an inch in front of my top front teeth and I can't bite anything even smallish with my front teeth.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, because there is nothing behind my front teeth holding them in place, they pulled in (originally fixed by braces but retainer couldn't hold it) so I have fucked up teeth and an awful smile, my default position is mouth open, I think partly due to my lower jaw being heavy or something. So if I don't actively close my mouth I look like an idiot....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to bother you but I'd like to ask some questions about sleeping with my mouth open. I find that my nostrils are often dry and they are quite irritating. I do not breathe through my mouth during the day, and breathing through my nostrils are fine. </p>
<p>However, when I lay down and fall asleep, I find that I automatically begin breathing through my mouth. I often wake up with a very dry mouth/throat with extreme thirst and sometimes even a sore throat. I also have this gross feeling in my mouth. Is this something I should be concerned about? Is there anything I can do to fix it?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
