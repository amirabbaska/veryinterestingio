			<div class="markdown"><p>This explains why it's 60 seconds per minute (instead of some other number); but doesn't get at why it's universally adopted across almost all cultures.  The answer to that is British!  </p>
<p>The British used the second / minute / hour system; many other places used different ones... but then the British invented a neat clock that worked on boats (as opposed to pendulum-type &quot;grandfather&quot; clocks that don't work when waves are rocking you about). Why does a clock that works on boats matter? In short because you can use time (and position of celestial bodies like the sun &amp; stars) to tell where you are on the planet Earth. If you're on a boat at sea, that's a very important thing to know! Determining your latitude (position north/south) is pretty easy, find something fixed like the north star and measure the angle it appears in the sky, do some math, know where you are relative to north/south pole and equator. But longitude (east/west) is harder when you're out at sea with no fixed reference point (that is... land). The sun moves during the day. So see the sun is straight up in the sky; you don't know where you are east/west unless you know a precise time. You could be either further east, or it could be earlier in the day; the more east you've moved the sooner the sun will be &quot;straight up&quot; above you.</p>
<p>So anyway; a guy in England invented a clock that worked well enough on boats that you knew the time; and then by measuring the sun / starts you knew where you were east/west. BOOM suddenly boats could reliably find their exact position on the planet. Now trading on the high seas becomes WAY easier. The British sailors bring these clocks everywhere and when people see them they're like &quot;whoa cool&quot; and want one too. So of course; the British are making tons of them (using the system they know) and sailors all over the world are like &quot;whatever, it's not our time system but now we can navigate&quot;. They take these clocks home and more people use them, and finally just adopt the British system instead of whatever they had before.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the length of a day is fixed, and if you define how much time a second is, and that 60 seconds are a minute and 60 minutes are an hour, a day has to have 24 hours?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's backward logic. Hours were established first. They were divided into minutes and eventually seconds. That's what <em>determined</em> the length of a second.</p>
<p>They didn't just go, &quot;hmm, I'm going to invent a second, and it's going to be...<em>this</em> long. 60 of then make a minute. 60 of those make an hour. And look, exactly 24 of those just so happen to conveniently fit into our solar day!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the Egyptians divided their sun dials into 12 equal segments for time keeping.  Obviously sun dials only show day light time, and night time was assumed to be roughly the same amount of time as the day time - thus 12 became 24.</p>
<p>it wasn't until hundred of years later that the Babylonians came along with their 60 based number system.</p></div>		</li>
