<p>&quot;Since their path to the New World went through frigid landscapes like Siberia and Alaska, they left behind some of the ancient infectious diseases that were vectorborne or had complex life cycles—malaria and Guinea worm, for example. The world they entered had never before been settled by hominids or great apes, so there were few local pathogens preadapted to
humans.&quot;</p>
<p>I haven't seen any other explanation in that book.</p>
<p>On the New World's diseases:
&quot;Relatively few pathogens, however, traveled in the other direction, from the Americas to
the Old World. Syphilis <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000148" target="_blank">(4)</a> and tungiasis (a flea that burrows into the skin) are the only human pathogens we are aware of that originated in the New World and have spread to the Old, although there may be others we haven’t yet recognized—for example, some epidemiologists suspect that rheumatoid arthritis is caused by a cryptic New World pathogen.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>We do know a bit about immunological differences between Amerindians and other peoples. We know that the Yanomamo (a much-studied group of Amerindians in the backwoods of
Venezuela) tend to produce high levels of antibodies against tuberculosis antigens rather than the more effective cell-mediated responses seen in Europeans. </p>
<p>Even though tuberculosis is common among the Yanomamo, few individuals have a positive response to a tuberculin test. This is important, because most Old Worlders exposed to tuberculosis mount an effective immune response (which causes a positive response on a tuberculin test)
and avoid symptoms. Only a minority develop active disease.</p>
<p>The Yanomamo also have extremely high levels of Immunoglobulin E (a molecule involved in defense against parasitic worms)—much higher than levels seen in Europeans with the same level of infestation. </p>
<p>Pre-Columbian Amerindians were subject to some parasitic worm infections but relatively few bacterial or viral diseases, and it may be that natural selection adjusted their immune system to face those threats.&quot;</p>
