			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: it's not that neither gene is dominant but that both are dominant, so they both appear. When there are two recessive genes it results in incomplete dominance, where the two genes create a blended phenotype (phenotype being how the gene is expressed. Ex. Y in a pea plant codes for a dominant yellow phenotype and y codes for the recessive green phenotype in pea plants)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Double edit: I forgot to give an example of incomplete dominance. Say you have a trait B, where the alleles are B (dominant), b (recessive), and β (recessive). Say if B codes for brown hair, b for blonde hair, and β for red hair, then if the genotype was bβ the offspring would have a blended hair color between blonde and red. </p>
<p>Note: these aren't how the genes for hair colour actually work, and is just an example.</p></div>		</li>
