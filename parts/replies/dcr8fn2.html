			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exclusive to the US. Rural populations have always been more conservative, this was remarked on fully first by Plato and then a few Roman authors. Urbanites tend to be more liberal because of more wealth and a detachment from nature itself, where they are not struggling to find material resources to survive and therefore seek more freedom over tradition, as the latter's foremost needs (who will tend to the home/children while the husband is out working hard in the field or forge? etc) are gone, but our minds and subconscious necessities are still there. This can be easily seen in the Baby Boomers and the 60's counterculture movement, which was directly nurtured by the post-WWII economic prosperity in the Anglosphere, particularly the US.</p>
<p><em>TL;DR</em> - People have always been more traditionalist and conservative when they have less to worry about. The human mind feeds off conflicts, real or imagined. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, the internet isn't awesome in rural areas but in most cases it's not enough to keep people from accessing social media. I come from a town with a population of about 750. There are about 3000 in the entire county. The internet sucks but everyone is on social media. </p>
<p>I think the rural/conservative thing is more about perspective than anything else. You tend to have much less diversity. The religious population tends to be more prevalent by percentage. People look out for one-another, but if you don't work hard you go without. Because of these things, much of the liberal needs get swept under the rug. It's much harder to admit that your teen daughter got pregnant or that you are gay. </p>
<p>I had a liberal teacher growing up, and we treated her like complete shit. It was flat out mean. As an adult I contacted her on Facebook to apologize for that and to tell her what a profound interest she had on my life. She thanked me and confided in me how hard it is. She still teaches there but every day she thinks of quitting. That kind of social pressure makes it very inconvenient to question your conservative beliefs. In a small town it could be social suicide to admit to having an abortion or to support gay marriage. In the mind of a farmer, for example, feeding someone else with the agriculture you worked hard for while they did nothing, it means they go without and the lazy man is better off. Put simply, small towns support conservative values far more than they do liberal values. </p></div>		</li>
