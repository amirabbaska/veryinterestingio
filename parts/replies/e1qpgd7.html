			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason it's sometimes described as a sea is that the three &quot;valence quarks&quot; per nucleon are really just the tip of the iceberg. Quarks and gluons in confinement are constantly fluctuating according to quantum chromodynamics, and it doesn't really make sense to try to assign a fixed number to them. Hence &quot;sea&quot;.</p>
<p>Edit: the article <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/283/5401/472.full?maxtoshow=&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;titleabstract=Proton%20Sea&amp;searchid=1&amp;fdate=//&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT" target="_blank">Exploring the Proton Sea</a> is a good intro. Here's a quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ephemeral nature of the sea's inhabitants, mass- and charge-carrying particles called quarks and force-carrying particles called gluons, belies their importance. “This virtual sea is responsible for many of the proton's properties, such as its mass, its structure, and its interaction with other particles and fields,” says Michael Leitch of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To put a number on the mentioned importance, valence quarks contribute less than 1% of the mass of the proton or neutron. The rest comes from the sea quarks and gluons. Numerically, it's as though a nucleon contains over a hundred quarks and gluons on average at any given moment, but that's just a conceptual snapshot on an extremely short timescale of what is really an uncountable number.</p>
<p>Edit 2: The video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LraNu_78sCw" target="_blank">What are Quarks? Sugar Edition!</a> provide a good overview that's not too technical. One thing it points out is that the valence quarks are really just due to a persistent net imbalance of the quarks types in the sea. They don't exist as permanent individual particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes, by &quot;sea&quot; here we do not mean &quot;unmeasurably many&quot;, like in common saying, but rather to distinguish between &quot;continuously&quot; and uniformly smoothly distributed things vs discrete chunks. Essentially the question is if the nucleus was more like a ball pit/jar of gumballs, or jug of water/gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A nucleus with A nucleons has 3A valence quarks. So there can be quite a lot of quarks in a nucleus.</p></div>		</li>
