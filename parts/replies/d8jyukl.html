			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that &quot;perfect RNG brain&quot; does not mean anything and I'd encourage you to define what you mean with it since you might discover a misunderstanding, which is what I suspect. Having a 50% chance to select the correct answer has nothing to do with our brains, it's an intrinsic property of a fair coin toss. Without human brains in the universe the coin (alien coin in this hypothesis) still has a 50% chance for each outcome, and any independent system that &quot;predicts it&quot; will have a 50% chance of being correct.</p>
<p>For example instead of brains I can use coin tosses to predict the outcome of coin tosses. I'll choose my prediction of a future coin toss with the result of a coin toss, if it's heads/tails I'll predict heads/tails. Doing so makes me correct 50% of the time after infinite tosses.</p>
<p>But I can also use another strategy. I can write &quot;heads&quot; in a sheet of paper. Then choose my preciction with whatever there's in the paper: always &quot;heads&quot;. This strategy also has 50% accuracy. Or I can write &quot;heads, heads, heads, tails&quot;, and choose each one sequentially and repeating. This also has 50% accuracy..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the thing about RNG, is that it isn't actually random. </p>
<p>And perhaps nothing is random, and the outcome of the universe and space is mathematically predetermined. A con flip is not random. It's result depends on its original state, the shape and size of the thumb, the air pressure, the composure of the air, the temperature, the force of the flip, and many other factors. Is anything really random? </p></div>		</li>

It died last century due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle" target="_blank">Uncertainty principle</a> and the newly discovered Quantum mechanics.</p>
