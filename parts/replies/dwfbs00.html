			<div class="markdown"><p>Sub light scattering is a huge reason for skin looking better. Light doesn't simply reflect of skin like a mirror, some light penetrates skin and scatters in different directions, giving it a distinct look in reality. CGI used to simply place a light source, say &quot;skin reflects x % of the source &quot; and hit render, but you get plastic looking stuff then. This is actually a large reason for shooting the T Rex  in the rain in Jurassic Park - when wet, much more light is reflected and the shiny, plastic looking skin seems real. The shots where she isn't in the rain are very fast, and don't spend much time on her.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>As an animator, things like facial/body ticks and movement imperfections are something we have been considering for far longer than audiences realize. You could go back and watch some <em>very</em> old 2D Disney animations and discover that many of the most talented animators (pioneers in the medium) were very aware of how easy it was to make everything &quot;too perfect.&quot;</p>
<p>In both 2D and 3D animation we actually have rules of thumb down to the frame count (depending on what framerate you're animating in) for how long eyes should remain still, how long an &quot;eye twitch&quot; should last, how much it should move to give the illusion of &quot;scanning&quot; what the character is looking at, etc.</p>
<p>I've often found myself spending inordinate amounts of time framing through animated shots that I find particularly appealing, and these can range from things that came out this year to like... Snow White, Bambi, Fantasia, etc. I've even downloaded clips from live action movies just so I could watch them frame-by-frame to try and deconstruct what's going on with a particular motion. You might be surprised how common this sort of thing is for animators :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, I hear you there and never meant to imply that animators don't do their homework, but we're talking about the difference between animated films and CGI realism. There is a very subtle difference between perfect CGI animation and the elements of a living being which, if missing, set off our subconscious evolutionary alarms and make us uneasy while watching. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is any of this publicly available in books or something, or is all of this trade secrets proprietary to each company, or what?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I couldn't play the video but I think Tia was being tongue in cheek with the interviewer. I've never heard of any facility with an &quot;imperfection&quot; department. Every person on the line is expected to add their own.
She's something like a surfacing (CG materials) supervisor, so yea, her job is, among other things, to ensure her team adds in imperfections.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer. People have always compared CGI to reality. The issue is we've gotten better at telling the two apart as the the technology has improved. Back when CGI was new, no one had any experience differentiating CGI from reality. Things that seem obvious now hadn't been around long enough for a pattern of &quot;this is happening so it must be CGI&quot; to emerge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as someone who grew up with the cgi evolving, people knew but it was the best that could be done, it was looked over for the sake of the story, same with stop motion, we knew it was fake just as good as it was, once it gets over used sloppily and better alternatives are out there only then does it begin to be unacceptable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think movie makers have also gotten better at hiding when it's CGI versus practical effects. It's no longer a novelty and now just a part of the process, so there's less attention drawn to it. They don't advertise &quot;brand new computer generated techniques!&quot; like they used to. As the technology has developed, the costs to use it have dropped significantly too. Older CGI on a budget is much more noticeable than CGI in something like Jurassic Park because not only were they good at hiding it, but they weren't treating it like something to reduce the budget either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very much to do with that &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&quot; 3D movies was proper amazing with Avatar because it managed to work a not-too-great effect with the green/red glasses into something really spectacular. Nowadays when you go to see 3D cinema it's mostly a boring old technology, or not done up to standard. Humans adapt so fast. But when it's brand new computer effects that you haven't seen before you're in total awe. Like how that pirate game the other day was on front page for having mighty realistic water effects.</p></div>		</li>
