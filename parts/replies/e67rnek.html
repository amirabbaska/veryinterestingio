			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I'd say that this (convection\conveyance) is actually a bigger factor a lot of the time than evaporation (esp when you aren't sweating much).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your skin cells are filled with water so your skin/body is much more humid than the air around it. Evaporation (diffusion) still takes place even when you aren't actively &quot;sweating&quot; (its why you get dry skin in winter)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This only works to a point. I was driving through Death Valley, about 111 degrees F, going about 50 mph, and you could only hold your arm out the window for so long before the burning became unbearable. </p>
<p>I did this several times cause it was weird. </p></div>		</li>
