			<div class="markdown"><p>Turtle Talk is totally different than the Storm Troopers. I'm seeing some conflicting statements here so I'll offer this: </p>
<p>There is a voice actor using a ton of cool technology to make Crush talk and move in real time. There is no soundboard. He says your name and answers questions directly and specifically. </p>
<p>The Storm Troopers say the exact same things every time without deviation. They almost certainly have a secret button they can hit to &quot;talk&quot;. The voices are too consistent. Finding and training voice actors seems like a less viable idea than just recording. </p>
<p>The buttons are probably located on the gun they are holding. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Turtle Talk and Monsters Inc Laugh Floor have very talented voice actors behind the screens. Two of my favorite things right there.</p>
<p>On the Universal Studios side (Islands of Adventure I believe), right near Poseidon's Fury, there is a water fountain. It will talk to you and address guests directly. If you look closely you can spot the camera.</p>
<p>I asked it what the meaning of life is and was met with a prompt and swift &quot;The meaning of life is forty-two&quot; in a nice and relaxed British accent. Sit on the fountain and it WILL yell at you. Fun times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vader and Ren have lines that are controlled by their gloves. It's incredibly obvious if you pay attention. Pretty sure the Stormtroopers are the same. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Like your phone's autocorrect. </p>
<p>If I had a bad Turtle Talk experience, I'd be crushed. </p></div>		</li>
