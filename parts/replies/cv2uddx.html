			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't know. It seems that there exist certain fundamental constants in the universe (such as how strong various forces are relative to one another) but c is perhaps the most-fundamental.</p>
<p>Interestingly, some scientists suspect that some constants (like c) might not actually be constant, and there may be frames of reference in which they're different (i.e. that there were perhaps 'times' at which the speed of light was higher, or 'places' in which it still is).</p>
<p>But basically, we don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Waves are a good way to start here. The same way waves in the water have a certain speed under certain circumstances, or sound travels at certain speeds depending on medium, light is just waves traveling through vacuum. Only difference is, there's no medium, so nothing slowing the waves down. But that means light must somehow be it's own medium.</p>
<p>As I think that the universe is more or less pure mathematics/logic, and consists of nothing but the waves which we call electromagnetic under certain circumstances, there has to be some speed at which movement happens, a random number, or the number 1, depending on scale.</p>
<p>On a side note, slower movements, by this model, are caused by some of those waves traveling in self-induced circles for reasons which cover all of physics (amplitude, frequency, magnetism, electric forces, maybe other forces...).</p>
<p>In this (admittedly personal) model, the main reason for the fact that nothing can go ftl is that we all consist of 'things' moving at light speed in circles, so when we approach that speed, the circular movement gets distorted, until there is none - we freeze, while time goes by around us.</p>
<p>Spacetime is just a (more correct) 4-dimensional way to see this, where it also becomes apparent why we see light approach at c even if we move towards or away from the source. That part is answered very well above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no force. Forces <em>change</em> speeds.</p>
<p>Photons are traveling at c from the instant they are created. There is no point where they weren't traveling at c. Hence, no need for propulsion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sadly the question you hope to ask may simply not make sense. Some things just are.  </p>
<p>Electricity and magnetism are linked, right? A moving electric field produces a moving magnetic one. Electromagnetic waves, then, are self-propagating E&amp;M waves that induce each other as they travel through space. The rate at which the universe &quot;ticks&quot; or allows them to induce each other is c.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no such thrust.</p>
<p>You might as well ask what thrust pushes you through time.</p>
<p>It is due to the geometry of the universe that things move this way. Why the geometry is the way that it is, no one can answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's more of a ELI10, yet I finally understood a lot of things I didn't before, so thanks.</p>
<p>So to parafrase:</p>
<p>An object moves through Time and Space at the same time. It can move faster through one, yet this means it slows down in the other. Everything has mass, so it will always move through space, even if it's going a light breaking speeds, so it will never go as fast as it can. Since Light has no mass, it can move though space at full speed, without wasting anything going through time, thus why when you get closer to the speed of light, time slows down.</p>
<p>Ex: Since we're standing still, we move through time faster than space, but once we get into a car and hit the highway we move through space faster than time. We get on a space ship that goes very very fast, 50% the speed of light, time slows down cause we're moving though space a lot faster.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Disclaimer: A car will never go fast enough to see these effects. Even if you attach 20 rockets to it at a landing strip, it still isn't fast enough. Going half the speed of light isn't enough. To see this effect, you'd have to travel to the Sun and back in 15 min and 58 sec.</p>
<p>Also... Two people on earth. One of them suits up and travels to the next star at 1/2 the speed of light. He goes and come back. To him, only 10 minutes have passed. The person on Earth, 10 years. Both saw the pass of time the same, yet one relative to the other moved slower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing to keep in mind is that the whole time being orthogonal to space analogy falls apart because of relativity.</p>
<p>If you are traveling close to the speed of light, you aren't travelling through time slower.   It only seems slower when compared to something with a different velocity.   </p>
<p>That is if you are traveling at .5 light speed in a ship flying away from earth, you will appear slower only to those on earth.    To an asteroid moving along side you, time isn't slower for you.   So you moving fast in space doesn't mean that your motion in time is slowed (orthogonal dimensions).   That would require an absolute frame of reference which Einstein's relativity disproved.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh... Well it is ELI5. You have to wait until they get to college so you can tell them everything they've learned up until now is all wrong. </p>
<p>But thanks for the clarification, so relativity is just explaining how once you <del>agrochemicals</del> approach the speed of light everything seems to slow down, yet the reality is that you are so fast it just seems that way?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry I know this is your 9 hour old post I'm replying to but I had a question. The explanation you give about a ship moving from earth looking slow to us but not to the ship itself...</p>
<p>I'm not educated in this stuff at all so please don't take this as me disputing you b/c frankly I'm not remotely qualified.</p>
<p>What I wonder and want to ask is though, how is that any different from an everyday example? Take a speeding car moving 50 mph. If I'm standing right beside it the car will seem to zoom past me at an  incredible speed. The further the car gets from me though the slower and slower it will appear to be moving.</p>
<p>Now is this the exact same thing you were talking about with the ship moving from earth? I ask b/c if time dilation is supposed to kick in when things approach the speed of light then why can we observe the same &quot;effect&quot; so to speak with things moving at a much slower rate?</p>
<p>Does my question make sense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The analogy still works, it's just that observers in different reference frames will disagree about how much an object is moving in the &quot;time&quot; direction vs. how much the object is moving in the &quot;distance&quot; direction. What all observers will agree on is the total distance traveled through spacetime, which is exactly where this &quot;everything moves at c&quot; business comes from.</p>
<p>A few caveats, though. First, spacetime is measured in units of distance, even in the time direction. The time direction is converted to units of distance by multiplying it by c. This is why we can talk about &quot;distance in spacetime.&quot; Second, this distance measured us the Mikowski Distance, which is different than the Pythagorean distance that is used in euclidean space.</p></div>		</li>

time is worth much more than space. you get 186282 miles of space for every second of time. that's why we don't see this in our day to day lives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how fast are we traveling on earth? Do I need to add the speed at which earth revolves around the sun and the speed it rotates? Also, do I add the speed of the Milky Way? Does our individual mass make us slower through spacetime or the mass of earth? I find all this fascinating but have a hard time getting my head around it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you answered the how.  Light moves at a specific speed.  how does it move at exactly that speed and no other speed, such as zero?</p>
<p>Also your statement that light doesn't travel through time doesn't make sense.  Some light that originates from our sun eventually hit Earth.  At different times it is in a different part of our solar system.    If the same photon exists at different times isn't it moving through time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But then how do you explain how we observe a photon being emitted at one time and recorded at a second, later time?  Granted we never observe a single photon twice (as far as I know), but the theory would suggest that a photon could only exist for the plank length of time (minimum possible quanta of time, assuming time is the same as space but just orthogonal to it).</p></div>		</li>
