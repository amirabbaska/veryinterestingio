			<div class="markdown"><p>True, although not the most common situation. The article I linked is quite clear, &quot;Mountain gorillas live in age-graded groups of, on average, 9.2 individuals, with one adult male (though there may be more than one), multiple adult females, and their offspring (Watts 1996; Doran &amp; McNeilage 1997; Robbins 2001).&quot; </p>
<p>And having the secondary sex characteristics is not related to dominance, is my point. Even if the gorilla can be dominated by a Canada goose, it can still have the secondary sex characteristics (tongue in cheek statement).  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/5ywsg7/gorilla_vs_canada_goose/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/5ywsg7/gorilla_vs_canada_goose/</a> </p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think we're clear on the mechanism, that is, why the dominant males will have more testosterone.  </p>

<p>Isn't it the other way around? The males with more testosterone will be more dominant?</p>
<p>I remember hearing about (podcast or radio I think) a study where they gave the bottom primate testosterone  injections and watched him climb the dominance ladder one challenge at a time, then when they stopped the injections he fell all the way back down one challenge at a time. Can't remember the species or any more source details I'm afraid. </p></div>		</li>
