			<div class="markdown"><p>If the moon is moving at the same speed as the finger, which I'm guessing is about 1 MPH, then I concur. But if it's moving at something like the moon's orbital velocity, so around 2200 MPH, I expect that the car would not in fact be okay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you flick your finger, you’re moving at 1mph? My flick motion from start to finish is faster than my eye can track. I just see windup then full extension. Isn’t that faster than 1mph?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, a finger flick is more like 50 to 100 mph.  A punch is about 15-25 mph and a finger flick is several times faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't that be the same as a car being dropped from a tremendous height, except about 10 times faster because a car's terminal velocity is probably only a few hundred MPH? Cars do not do well when dropped from helicopters.</p></div>		</li>
