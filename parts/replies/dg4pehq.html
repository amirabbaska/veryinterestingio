			<div class="markdown"><p>Mmmm that sounds really good. In that case the cheese was salted, pressed and then aged. </p>

And yes omg it was delightful. Expensive as hell, around $200 a pound. From an artisanal cheese maker in Madison, Wisconsin. Sad to say I don't think I could buy it again, not at that price. I savored every bite. </p>
<p>It had little calcium crystals throughout, which I'm told is part of the aging process and a sign of a good cheese. </p></div>		</li>
