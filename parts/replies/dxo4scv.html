			<div class="markdown"><p>As an Australian, I see no sign that the federal government takes climate change seriously; no matter what the pledges are, the policies that could fulfill them get shut down or shot down very quickly. Hell, the (supposedly pro-free market) government has been desperately trying to find a way to lend a coal company $1 billion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is absolutely no credible reason to believe that biosequestration (BCCS) will ever scale to the necessary proportion - not to mention that it's not worth pursuing until we're already at net zero emissions, since it's much more expensive than simply preventing emissions in the first place.</p>
<p>Sulfate spraying is a panacea - it will cause acid rain, will not stop ocean acidification, and is likely to be a cause of violent conflict as altered weather patterns are blamed on the perpetrator. Not to mention that if we ever <em>stopped</em> spraying sulfates, there would be a strong rebound effect that'd make warming much worse than if we'd never tried aerosols.</p>
<p>Also, as we shut down coal plants, the dimming effect of particulate matter will gradually dissipate, possibly leading to another 1C of warming on top of that already predicted due to greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>Quite simply, there is no sound, scientific reason to have any optimism about climate change at this point. Any 'we can innovate our way out' believers are fooling themselves and are high on hopium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good example of a view that is excluded from the public conversation on climate change because of politics. Saying 'climate change is real' loses you red votes and following it up with 'and there probably isn't anything we can do to stop it' loses you blue votes, so you will never hear it coming from a politician despite the fact that it seems like the most realistic appraisal of the situation.</p>
<p>Several years ago, I listened to a podcast talking about the ice caps, and it was fascinating how tenderly the scientists they interviewed were treading talking about the history of 'hothouse' and 'ice house' climates. Reading between the lines you could tell that they were aware that the transition that we are about to pass through is inevitable on a geological time scale, and that the predictions about a Venus-style runaway greenhouse effect are basically fear mongering, but they were also clearly aware that one word out of place could be a career ender.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The United States has reduced total emissions by around 14% from their peak and is still on track to meet its targets set out in the Paris accord which is 26%-28% by 2025.  Per capita emissions in the US have fallen below Australia since 2016 I beleive.  </p>
<p>China under the Paris agreement can continue to increase greenhouse emissions until 2030.  They appear to be on track to see peak emissions in the early 2020s.  </p>
<p>EU investment has kind of slacked off lately and it looks like they will have trouble meeting their commitments under the Paris accords of a 40% reduction in emissions from 1990 levels, but the investments they have made have reduced emissions by close to 23% from 1990 levels already.  </p>
<p>I don't beleive India has any target for peak emissions under the Paris agreement, but they do look set to beat their goal of reducing emission intensity by about 1/3 of 2005 levels by 2030.  </p>
<p>I think it is at least a good sign that three of the four largest greenhouse gas emitters are on track to meet or beat their Paris commitments and the the EU has reduced emissions so much already. </p></div>		</li>
