<p>Movies do this a lot to with scenes filmed in public places. They create a controlled environment and give it the appearance of a public location.</p>

<p>I've been an extra before. Nobody talking in the background of the shot is actually talking. They're all miming. I had no idea. I was using the lyrics of We Didn't Start The Fire to keep my lips moving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine is in porn. She messaged me out of the blue one day years ago asking if I'd be interested in being an extra. She said it would just be me sitting in a strip club at a table somewhere as if I were watching the &quot;show&quot;. I wouldn't do or say anything and I'd get a free catered meal out of it. </p>
<p>Unfortunately I was in a serious relationship at the time and had to decline. But I think about that offer and that girl from time to time. </p>
<p>I should hit her up and see how things are going.</p></div>		</li>
