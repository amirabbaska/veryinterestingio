			<div class="markdown"><p>You've got this idea that the peasantry can all rise up together against the tyrant and throw him out. That <em>NEVER</em> happens anymore, anywhere. Every single successful violent rebellion in the last 50 years was supported by outside nations, without exception.</p>
<p>It's an unfortunate face that the modern era allows those who control factories and communication systems to monopolize force to a degree that was impossible during all successful peasant revolts.</p>
<p>Or, in other words, you ain't gonna shoot down a drone with a handgun Bubba.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also that technology is stupid good now. What are you going to do against a force that has body armor, tanks, armed helicopters, and all manner of personal light and heavy arms?</p>
<p>Lets say the US populace gets super fed up with the corporate run government, and rebels. How the hell are they going to overthrow the government when the government has the most technologically advanced military? The only hope of such a scenario is if O7's and O6's are sympathetic to the population, and refuse to comply with the government to stop the rebellion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There could be lots of reasons, and it could vary for any particular individual. They might be true believers (it happens). They might feel that the tyrant's rule, while bad, is better than what might follow (anarchy or rule by someone worse), and they might think this is true for the whole society, or for themselves and their family/class. They might be sympathetic to the revolutionaries, but feel trapped--to refuse to do their jobs (or merely the express doubts, or even just not be enthusiastic ENOUGH about breaking heads) could get <em>them</em> arrested or beaten or imprisoned or killed (or their family or loved ones, under truly awful tyrants). They might fear being punished (as above) by the revolutionaries, assuming the revolutionaries win; payback and revenge aren't uncommonly aimed at those who supported the previous regime. Even if they turn on their masters, the revolutionaries might not trust them, and then they're trapped (and jobless) between both sides, with friends on neither.</p>
<p>As I said, there could be lots of reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One more tool they use, to add to your excellent points: External enemies.</p>
<p>One of the ways of keeping the displeasure and hatred from focusing on your regime or worse yet yourself is channeling all of this anger onto other groups or countries. By being constantly &quot;under attack&quot; or having &quot;war on&quot; things whether countries or even <em>acts and concepts</em>, it helps ease the propaganda's work.</p>
<p>All the ills can be blamed on these outside things, and nationalistic jingo demanding greater sacrifice and holding on just a little longer can be kept squeezing out the population potentially decades more. </p>
<p>All of that blustering and media panic between NK and USA greatly benefits those in charge of both countries, as a current example. It's conveniently distasteful, eventually even treasonous to question Dear Greatest Leader when nuclear annihilation hangs just above your heads, right?</p></div>		</li>
