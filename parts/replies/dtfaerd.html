			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt that, but who knows. Mostly because,  I am willing to bet that you could actually pay someone off enough to do the work for you instead of having to go to the trouble of kidnapping someone and hope they do a good job under duress. </p>

<p>On a rainy night eight years ago in the Colombian city of Cali, crack counter-narcotics troops swarmed over the first floor of a low-rise condominium complex in an upscale neighborhood. They found no drugs or guns. But what they did find sent shudders through law enforcement and intelligence circles around the world.
The building was owned by a front man for Cali cocaine cartel leader Jos� Santacruz Londono. Inside was a computer center, manned in shifts around the clock by four to six technicians. The central feature of the facility was a $1.5 million IBM AS400 mainframe, the kind once used by banks, networked with half a dozen terminals and monitors. The next day, Colombia's attorney general secretly granted permission for U.S. agents to fly the mainframe immediately back to the United States, where it was subjected to an exhaustive analysis by experts from the Drug Enforcement Administration and various intelligence agencies. The so-called Santacruz computer was never returned to Colombian authorities, and the DEA's report about it is highly classified. But Business 2.0 has ferreted out many of its details. They make it clear why the U.S. government wants the Santacruz case kept quiet.</p>
<p>According to former and current DEA, military, and State Department officials, the cartel had assembled a database that contained both the office and residential telephone numbers of U.S. diplomats and agents based in Colombia, along with the entire call log for the phone company in Cali, which was leaked by employees of the utility. The mainframe was loaded with custom-written data-mining software. It cross-referenced the Cali phone exchange's traffic with the phone numbers of American personnel and Colombian intelligence and law enforcement officials. The computer was essentially conducting a perpetual internal mole-hunt of the cartel's organizational chart. &quot;They could correlate phone numbers, personalities, locations -- any way you want to cut it,&quot; says the former director of a law enforcement agency. &quot;Santacruz could see if any of his lieutenants were spilling the beans.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a project in college where I looked at Data from the early 90's. It's probably changed, but at that time you could exsport cocaine lose 98% of the cocaine you're exporting and still make a profit. There doesn't need to be a conspiracy when the economics are that good.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also when not enough cocaine gets in they can increase the price and adjust for the lack of supply. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The war on supply aims to disrupt the market in products that are cheap and relatively easy to produce and to transport, and for which there is a high demand. In doing so it creates a black market, which radically inflates profits for producers and traffickers. A pure gram of pharmaceutical cocaine that costs about $15, for example, brings about $150 on the retail black market.</p>
<p>These high profits have a paradoxical effect: They provide a steady incentive for drug suppliers to remain in the trade, and for new suppliers to enter. So the &quot;stick&quot; of law enforcement intended to discourage black marketeers simultaneously creates a &quot;carrot&quot; (enormous profits), which encourages them. This profit paradox is a fatal flaw in the war against supply: As suppliers pursue these high profits, they keep the supply of drugs up, and that keeps prices from rising too high - undermining the aim of policy.</p>
<p>Production costs are so low and profits so extraordinary that the &quot;average drug organization can afford to lose 70 percent to 80 percent of its product and still be profitable,&quot; explained one former Drug Enforcement Administration official.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. And that is with paying local 5 to 10 times the cost of producing it in the forests (compared to what they could make of the land producing something else). When you include what is being made over the entire chain (farmer, cartel, dealer, though there are sometimes more links) then there is an over 1000 times turnover on coke. That beats most other succesfull industries by at least a 100 times (sometimes more for highly competitive industries). No wonder some people plead to just make some relatively safe drugs legal, tax them, and then fund any addiction help with the tax money and still have a lot of money left over.</p></div>		</li>
