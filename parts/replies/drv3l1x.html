<p>I'm pretty sure the Sony consoles use a FreeBSD backend, which doesn't have the hotpatching update mechanism that Linux does.  That's probably why they can't do an online update.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typical desktop Linux systems and Android don't use the hotpatching for kernel updates anyway, and also have middleware services that need to restart and need a new session to do it regardless. So the backend being capable wouldn't automatically mean PlayStation wouldn't have the same limitation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Linux can largely be updated with no restarting required, but that's because it can disable individual sections of the system, update them, then turn them back on.</p>

<p>That's not how application software updates are usually handled for Unix systems. The typical procedure is to replace the files with the new copies, then quit and restart the program. That results in much less downtime. The reason this is safe is because deleting and replacing a file with a new version doesn't interfere with the already-running program accessing the old version that it already has open.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And that's what you do on Linux. But you typically don't need to reboot the entire system just restart the individual processes except for when there's a kernel update in which case you need to restart (although hot swapable kernels do now exist it's complicated to work with so this is seldom used). Even then when you do have to reboot the entire system it's just a regular restart. By contrast to Windows which is a huge pain in the ass because you need to restart the entire system and get stuck on a updating screen on start up and shutdown for like a freaken hour just to install an update.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the Nintendo 3DS console, no online replacement of the OS core components is done, even though it is based on a microkernel design. The update system actually reboots the console using a copy/2nd version of the OS base (<code>SAFE_MODE_FIRM</code> and safe mode copies of services &amp; UI) in order to download and update the real system (<code>NATIVE_FIRM</code>, etc). Games/tools can however be updated while opened but still needs to be restarted for the update to take effect; the kernel keeps the old content until it can be safely removed and replaced by the new one.</p></div>		</li>
