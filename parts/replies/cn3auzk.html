<p>Fun fact, water of different temperatures actually causes water to form distinct layers that do not mix freely within lakes. In summer, warm water sits on top of colder water and the density difference prevents the water from mixing, causing all sorts of differences in the surface waters and deeper waters, including differences in oxygen, dissolved nutrients, and organisms. The same thing happens in winter, but it's reversed, with the warmer water (at 4°) sinking to the bottom, and the colder water sitting on top. The only time lakes really mix is during spring and fall, when the whole lake is roughly the same temperature.</p>
<p>Edit: Note that this specific pattern occurs in temperate lakes, which are generally lakes that freeze during the winter. Thanks to /u/un-scared.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was told about thermoclines during scuba training. Wasn't until I actually got into a lake and experienced one first hand until I realized just how sharp a difference it is.</p>
<p>Hand near body? 20°C water. Move hand down 1 foot? 12°C. Feels cold, man.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fresh water you can get interesting chemoclines at the bottoms of lakes that have very deep holes that resist turnover. Ive worked on lakes that are ~30m deep and have normal temperature profiles until 22-25m where they reach 4C, but then temperatures start to rise (just slightly) to 5C by 30m. This is due to increased ion load in the water (measured through a conductivity probe), which causes the water to be denser even though it is slightly warmer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely correct.  Some of us use the cross over point to define &quot;brackish&quot; water. That is, the salinity where the temperature of maximum density is the same as its freezing point (just under 25 PSU).</p>
<p>In my experience it is far colder than 4C below 4000m in the ocean.</p></div>		</li>
