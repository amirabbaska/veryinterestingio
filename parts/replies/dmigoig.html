<p>I would assume it is because the Emperor must be male and must be of a royal/noble line. By marrying a commoner she has chosen a husband that doesn't qualify for the position and as such she has to be removed from the line of succession.</p>

<p>That's exactly my question, who is considered a viable spouse if Japan lacks any aristocracy?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I suspect the real culprit here is the modern world.  In the past the royal line had a lot of kids with concubines.  Since that is pretty much taboo now they have to rely on their wives to pump out as many babies as they can and hope for a son.  If no sons are born the line dies because it is patrilineal.  Her child is only in the line if she marries a man in the line.  The last male to be born in the line(that is of legal age to wed) was Prince Akishino who is married, 51 years old and also her father.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems silly, considering there have been several femele emperors/empresses in Japan historically. I suspect this nonsense was added to the Imperial Household Law under American pressure in 1947.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to fill out a few details to your comments; I'm not sure which specific nonsense you're referring to, since there is much, but the nonsense of only men allowed to rule was added in the Meiji constitution of 1889. It was due to European influence, but nothing like the influence the US had in writing the post-war constitution. The writers of the constitution were trying to make Japan be more in line with European nations, so this was one way. Ironic that conservatives are so against women being able to be emperors, since Meiji reforms were radical and in general opposed by conservatives at the time, though they didn't object to the female emperor law specifically.</p>
<p>For those wondering, the last female emperor of Japan (ofter referred to as such to distinguish her as a ruler as opposed to an empress who is a wife of the ruling emperor) was 1762-1771, Empress Go-Sakuramachi</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the assumption that the male heir rule was added post WW2, but I suppose it might have been in the Meiji constitution. The US influence/pressure part still applies, however. The whole &quot;unequal treaty&quot; deal forced Japan to make change it otherwise probably wouldn't have. Some for the better (trains!), some for the worse (like the empress thing).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea but they were pre Heiyan period, the shinto priest who control the history discounted them as waiting for a male to be born to become emperor. They not going to crown a woman.</p></div>		</li>
