			<div class="markdown"><p>This is excellent! Thankyou! Given that the estimated size of the 'observable' universe is 93 billion lightyears, and we can assume the rest of space is infinitely bigger, doesn't this mean that space is expanding at huge multiples of the speed of light? How is this possible or measured?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is nothing that restricts space from expanding faster than the speed of light. That's why inflation at the beginning of the universe is ok. However, space is expanding much slower than the speed of light locally and it's doing that everywhere. So in small distances it's barely noticable, but as you get to larger and larger distances those small expansions that are happening everywhere add up and you find that very distant galaxies are moving away from us at speeds much faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>In the case of the spots on a balloon, two spots next to each other won't move too fast from each other as it inflates, but spots on opposite sides will seem to be moving much faster as the space between them gets larger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curious note:  If the rate of expansion is increasing, then the distances at which the expansion exceeds lightspeed will shrink.
This is one possible &quot;Death of the Universe&quot; scenario:  Eventually, the distance will shrink to the level of subatomic particles, at which point <em>everything</em> is ripped apart.</p>
<p>Now, the time needed for this to happen would be a considerable number of multiples of the current age of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Space&quot;  has no mass.  Mass is bound to the speed of light as its fastest speed... As far as we can tell.  Since space has no mass there is nothing stopping it from expanding faster than the speed of light.  We measure it using the hubble constant.  Look that up and it will give you your answer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, this isn't right. Photons are massless for example, yet also can't travel beyond the speed of light. </p>
<p>The real reason is that special relativity forbids two inertial frames from having a relative velocity larger than c, but general relativity puts no such restriction on the expansion of spacetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one part of space is expanding faster than light.  Think of it like this: any one small section of space is only expanding very slowly; but the farther away two objects are, the more space is in between them, and the faster they will seem to move apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>the galaxies are moving away from the Big Bang</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, this is incorrect. The Big Bang happened <em>everywhere</em>. Galaxies aren't literally moving away from anywhere (ignoring the movement caused by gravity). Space in between is increasing, which makes it look like they move away ... while they actually don't. (again, ignoring gravity here)</p>
<p>This is one of the times were semantics REALLY matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taking it to its logical conclusion, eventually everything will move so far away from everything else that nothing will be able to communicate with anything else and everything will exist in a total black void. </p></div>		</li>
