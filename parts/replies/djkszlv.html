			<div class="markdown"><p>Tragic. Some of these reports involve more than one fatality as someone will dive in or swim towards to person because there's no obvious danger until its too late. The first source I cited also mentioned that these deaths are occasionally misclassified as drowning which could leave the actual cause unfixed. </p></div>		</li>
