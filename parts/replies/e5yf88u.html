			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, lets do the second question first:</p>
<p>The pipe is 1 meter diameter, that means it has a cross section area of  about 0.8 m^2.  Multiply this by the distance from pole to pole gives you a volume of 5 million cubic meters.  The Skydome has a volume of 1.6 million cubic meters, you that is basically the volume of 3 Skydomes.</p>
<p>But the air in the hole will be at a higher pressure than sealevel pressure, so the air in the hole will be more than 3 Skydomes worth of air.  According to /u/CosineDanger and /u/HopeFox, the pressure in the center of the Earth will be 375 times sea level pressure.  So on average the pressure through the hole will be about 180 times sea level pressure.</p>
<p>If we assume normal temperatures (20 C) the amount of air that will fit in the hole will be about 540 Skydomes.</p>
<p>Would we notice if 540 Skydomes worth of air disappeared?</p>
<p>The Skydome is in Toronto.  Let's put Toronto in a big glass box with a height of 1 km, and then remove 540 Skydomes' worth of air from that box, and see if we can notice the difference.</p>
<p>The surface area of Toronto is 630 km^2, so 630,000,000 m^2.  The volume of a box 1 km high covering Toronto is 630,000,000,000 m^3.</p>
<p>We are removing 540 Skydomes worth of air from the box, which is 864,000,000 m^3.  We are removing 0.137% of the air from Toronto.  The resulting pressure change could be measured with sensitive equipment, but it couldn't be felt by humans.  </p>
<p>Just to put this into context, where I live right now, we haven't had any dramatic weather in the past two days.  The pressure during the past two days has varied from a low of 102.4 kPa to a high of 102.8 kPa, or a change of about 0.4%.  So just boring weather has changed the air pressure by 3 times more than this hole would change the pressure in a 1 km tall box covering Toronto.</p>
<p>So no, the air going into the hole would not have a significant effect on the atmosphere of the planet.</p>
<p>Now for your first question:</p>
<p>My speculation is no significant currents would be set up.  However, if the inside of the hole was hot, it would contain much less air, which means the effect of air going into the hole in the first question would be greatly reduced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vertical temperature gradient in the crust is very steep--like, 25 deg C per km. In the atmosphere, a temperature gradient of greater than about 10 deg C per km is considered unstable and prone to convective overturn (because if a &quot;parcel&quot; of air starts rising even a little, it will cool a little due to decompression, but will still be warmer than its surroundings and will therefore keep rising).</p>
<p>So, there's at least a possibility of strong convection within the crustal part of the pipe, but there are a lot of unknowns and I think this would be hard to model. Presumably if you knew the conductivity of the rock and the pipe, and the width of the pipe, you could maybe model how vigorous the convection would be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice analysis of the volume of air involved! In summary: the atmosphere is really, really big.</p></div>		</li>
