			<div class="markdown"><p>How long would it take two marbles if they were 2cm diameter and 50g, at 0Â°k in a perfectly empty universe w/ no expansion of space and they are 100ly apart? Would the collision speed be more than .000001m/s?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The time is proportional to the distance^(3/2) and to the weight^(-1/2). So the original answer x (100/1)^(3/2) x (50/100)^(-1/2) = original answer x 1414 (about
4x10^32s). I don't believe diameter factors in materially.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the diameter really that relevant to the equation when it's so small? 10cm vs 2cm diameter would barely change the answer, right?</p></div>		</li>
