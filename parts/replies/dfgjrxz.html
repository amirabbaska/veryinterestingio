			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible that she was transferred before having a psychiatric evaluation? To my understanding she was committed before her 72 hours began. She was prescribed a new medication today, so if nothing else I know for sure that she's been seen by a psychiatrist finally, and on a Sunday no less! I am very thankful for that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my limited knowledge, she shouldn't have been transferred prior to seeing someone although the hospital may have held her until she was seen and a formal 5150 was written up. Most hospitals will be pretty insistent if you come in with a psych issue for you to wait to be seen and if she came in voluntarily, I would assume she agreed to stay and wait. Anyone on call, including Psych personnel should be available 7 days a week, even if you have to wait awhile to see them, but I'm glad it wasn't delayed further and she was seen.</p>
<p>You should definitely find out from her if she is, in fact, on an involuntary hold and do some research on the internet on whatever she tells you. The hospital will not divulge information directly to you as per HIPPAA (sp?) but she is entitled to her information and can ask questions/request information and pass it on to you. </p>
<p>It's entirely possible the hospital she went to has a psych department and transferred her internally from ER to PSYCH after an eval. If that's the case they will keep her until her hold is up and she is cleared to go. Again, that's assuming she's on a hold, you should find out.</p>
<p>I'm not the best resource outside of involuntary holds and some hospital/transport procedure unfortunately.</p>
<p>I'm glad to hear she is being taken care of, best of luck to you both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very reassuring to hear. I think it's hipaa, and the scenario you've outlined sounds about exactly like what was described. She's been here enough to know if she's on a hold or not. Thank you for your advice, that was very reassuring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>5150 is the California statute. It's a Baker Act in Florida. Each state had its own statute. 72 hour also varies by state, some it's mandatory 72 hours, others it's the maximum amount of time to hold before needing a court order or voluntary admission. There's variations as to weekends and holidays as well. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A psychiatrist doesn't have to be the one to evaluate the patient in my state. Any board certified physician may do so. The typical workflow for a ER visit would be an ruling out medical causes of the behavioral emergency and then to either consult if one is available or just to simply write up the PEC themselves and discharge to a facility or transfer to psych if that department is available at their facility. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not trying to rain on your parade, but at my facility, our Resident Doctors can put in the orders for psych meds during the admission process. Don't know how it is where she is at, but having medications ordered is no guarantee that she has seen the doctor that is evaluating her. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in a state psych hospital. During the weekend, there is one doctor in admissions doing all of the new admits and on call for the units in case of emergencies. It's pretty rare that the unit doctors come in on the weekends. Those are the doctors that will do a more in-depth history, figure out what's been tried already med-wise and what does or doesn't work, and tailor the treatment plan more specifically to her needs. I know that not all hospitals are the same, and that some do have physicians rounding through the weekend, but usually the 72 hours is of psychiatrist observation rather than total time there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, depending on where you are your statement is not <em>entirely</em> accurate. In Virginia, the rule is 72 hours or the next available court date. The 72 hours begins at the time you're served the TDO (temporary detention order) paperwork, so if you're served Thursday night, you most likely won't have your hearing until Monday. The independent evaluator still has to see you over the weekend, you're only waiting for court to be &quot;available&quot;. Most people will not have a court date arranged until after their first 24 hours at the facility to allow time to accurately observe and treat the patient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I pray OPs girlfriend doesn't have to go. They always send you to a treatment facility that's absolute garbage. I've been to one both in California and Oklahoma. Both did the bare minimum to help me and I was able to get real help with a therapist and psychiatrist after. I hope she's okay. Those places suck.
