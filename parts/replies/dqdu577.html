			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but at low temperatures, translational modes are the most populated, followed by rotational with very few vibrational modes being active. It's not until you get into thousands of degrees that translational modes stop being quite so dominant over the other two. Also rotational and vibrational modes only exist in molecules, atoms only have translational modes available to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But they are active, they're just not as significant... except when you're shooting in photons that absorb in that range.</p>

<p>And that's borne out in tighter spectra and a different frequency response from atoms over molecules.  </p></div>		</li>
