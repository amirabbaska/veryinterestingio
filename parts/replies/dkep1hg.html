<p>what is the reason that almost every video game today has removed the ability for split screen, including ones that got famous and popular from having split screen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion it's similar to what has happened to LAN in PC gaming, rarely any games have it these days, game companies are not just small excited passionate groups of people they were 10-15 years ago (some are even today but its rare), you need an account for everything and some games require you to be online at all times (like Hitman or Battelfield), they want to have control, i say fuck em so i am not buying their stuff, unless its on a FAT discount or i buy a used account and then switch email...</p>
<p>I seriously miss those days when i bought games in their box editions, installed them and had LAN parties, kids these days are missing out, gaming was way better around 2005 (for both consoles and PC), games were way better and you had more options, i watched E3 and NOT for the cringe compilations...

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the games I work on, the biggest reason is graphics performance.</p>
<p>Running the simulation isn't a problem, the simulator works just fine and multiple inputs are handled fairly easily in most games, as more can be added just the same as we add network players.</p>
<p>Every reviewer seems to start with the graphics. If the graphics are not amazing, cutting-edge, using every last drop of graphics rendering power then reviewers proclaim the game looks like crap. There is no quarter given, even the tiniest graphical issue can bring death to a modern game in the press.</p>
<p>As bad as mainstream reviewers are, mainstream people are even worse. About five years ago, several people at my studio received death threats over the quality of our video game.  <a href="http://kotaku.com/5904367/another-day-another-death-threat-from-gamers-to-the-people-who-make-video-games" target="_blank">They are not alone.</a>  When working on a major game, the sad reality is that game studios must consider how the crazed idiots online are going to react to the game. </p>
<p>Imagine you work in an industry where if some people don't get the things they want, exactly the way they want them, they will send death threats.  And they will engage in SWATting, sending armed men to smash down your door, and hopefully not shoot you or any family members before they figure out the situation.</p>
<p>Split screen usually means double the rendering effort, which means about double the work, which would mean dropping the frame rate by half, and also reducing the number and quality of special effects.  Companies that do this face even more vitriol from their loyal fans.</p>
<p>We really want to bring out good games. And we strive to do so.  But the focus on graphics above all else, even to the point of death threats by crazed players, means it has dropped by the wayside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know what you mean by &quot;nowadays&quot;  The focus on graphics has been there since at least the late 80s (and probably earlier), when the sega genesis and super nintendo came out I remember my childhood hype about the graphics being through the roof.  and it's not like it lessened over the years.  When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDK_(series)#Reception" target="_blank">MDK</a> came out there was a lot of collective jizzing over the graphics.  I'd say there's actually <strong>more</strong> of a focus now on gameplay over graphics with the rise and massive success of games like minecraft, the plethora of indie games that get good traction, and the return to infinity engine type games like Pillars of Eternity and shit where graphics is clearly not the main focus.  These are all mainly PC games, but that's because I don't own a console from this generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Few people in the industry like it, the development studios certainly are not the ones pushing it.</p>
<p>The problem, though, is the vocal people and the industry media are extreme on the topic and they are responsible for most of the word-of-mouth advertising.  Games studios live or die based on those reviews. The only option allowed is to have spectacular graphics.</p>
<p>If your game supports 4K resolution and you drop to 1080 for something, or you're a 1080 game and you drop to 720 for something, or if your game drops some frames when the player triggers and effect that fills the world with special effects, the vitriolic groups will roast the developers online.  Sadly that type of review can make a difference between a big profit or declaring bankruptcy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a sibling, and we grew up playing splitscreen (we're old now, so I'm thinking stuff like Goldeneye 64 up through Halo (the first one)).</p>
<p>One hundred percent of the time, running split screen is going to reduce performance. This means stripping stuff out of multiplayer, especially local multiplayer. All of the CODs do it - I'm sure someone has done some side-by-side comparisons of single player vs split screen graphics just for kicks.</p>
<p>If you have 2 monitors, you can simulate this for yourself. Launch one game on one monitor, and another game (or the same game, if you know how to make that work) on the other monitor. I promise you, if you started with a game you could run smoothly at 60fps (but no better) you'll end up with a game you might be able to run at 30 on the same settings (or, definitely you'll get a performance hit - it may not be a 50 percent drop, could be more or less)</p>
<p>The real reason (split screen) games have gone away isn't because people don't have siblings, or because companies have forgotten you - its that the biggest spenders when it comes to multiplayer gaming are in that 18-34 demographic (the infamous one), and most of us live on our own (to mean - not with our parents and siblings). The truth is that while Timmy's parents might buy him some games sometimes, the big spenders are older people who buy their own games and systems - and this is especially true for most of the standard multiplayer heavy genres (shooters spring to mind).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true that split-screen does take more resources than single-screen, however it's not nearly as bad as compared to playing two games at the same time. That's because a lot of resources are shared, when you're playing split screen. Processor time is the same for all updates, RAM used is the same (or very very nearly the same), video memory used is the same. The only problem is graphics calculations; because you have to render the scene twice (from two perspectives).</p>
<p>But it's a fact that a game can be made in a way that makes that possible (CoD: Black Ops III actually has 4-ways split-screen on consoles. It doesn't work very well, but it does.). What also makes it easier, is the fact that each of the screens only takes part of the whole resolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not quite that simple, unfortunately.</p>
<p>For a single player, you can cull any polygons that the player couldn't see.  Levels are explicitly designed for this, in fact.  Walls and hallways and boulders are strategically placed to block a lot of stuff so that the local scene can make use of more detail.</p>
<p>Split screen messes with that.  Because you now have two different points of view, you must load all the geometry that <em>any</em> player could see.</p>
<p>Also, downgrading potato-quality 480p (if you're lucky) to rotten-potato-quality 240p is a lot less noticeable than when you downgrade something that started at a higher quality and higher resolution to begin with.  Gamers will accept a split-screen that <em>appears</em> to be mostly the same thing but only half the screen, but a half-size screen with a big downgrade in quality is very noticeable.</p>
<p>The final nail in the coffin of splitscreen, however, was 1080p.  The XBox 360 / PS3 generation were designed for 720p, really.  Games couldn't really hit 1080p at a consistent 30fps unless they used some tricks to simplify the graphics (cell shading can be used to simplify things by allowing you to make lower polygon counts an artistic choice).  However, 1080p TVs quickly proliferated.  The games were already facing a not-quite-native-resolution upscaled quality issue.  They tried to reach 1080p@30fps (or 1080p60 for some ambitious titles), but generally ended up being 900-something and upscaled to 1080p.  Faced with the fact that they were starting off under-quality, cutting that fake resolution in half again with acceptable visuals was even more difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, comparing it to running two separate instances of the game at full resolution doesn't make much sense.</p>
<p>That being said, it depends heavily on the game. The rendering itself is unlikely to affect performance, since as others have noted, you can render the scene twice at only half the resolution. Depending in your rendering pipeline, the GPU will not need to do significantly more work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, draw calls might increase significantly, and any dynamic approach to reducing draw calls will be doubled as well. Memory management could get more complicated. Open world games would face a lot of complications in that regard, if they allow players to get too far from each other.</p>
<p>In any case, I'm guessing it comes down to cost vs benefit. I love the idea of couch coop games, but adding couch coop support at the expense of features or graphics wouldn't make sense financially since most people probably aren't going to utilize the feature. The exception being games specifically designed to be couch coop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you're right, the problem is that any game that you might want to play in split screen is going to be GPU-bound (meaning that the GPU is the bottleneck in performance), which means it is as bad as playing two games at once, at least in terms of frame latency. </p>
<p>It's certainly possible, but you either have to take a <em>serious</em> hit on graphics overall, or you have to degrade the game in some way in split-screen but keep full-screen the same, which means now you have to optimize twice and deal with bugs in both. And it'll generally be very visible to the people in split-screen. </p>
<p>And the problem is that games do analytics on this all the time and the simple fact is that split screen is <em>not</em> that common, particularly in FPSes. They definitely lose sales because of it, but it's really not that much. They have to balance the lost sales against the amount they'll spend to make split-screen work well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While I agree that split screen will most likely cause a performance hit due to having to render each persons horizon the above test is not even remotely the same thing.  Using two monitors of equal size is going to double the amount of pixels that need to be rendered and will by itself greatly impact performance.</p>
<p>Your test is the equivalent of saying a 4000lb 500hp pickup truck that has a 2 ton load is going to perform worse than a 4000lb 500hp pickup with no load.  Well duh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the thing is, even if you're splitting the screen, you're also splitting the <em>resolution</em> for each screen. It's not like each screen is rendering at native res, that's bullshit (or lazy, because then they don't have to do anything fancy with the game engine). Ideally every split should be rendering <em>at that resolution</em>. Also ideally, dynamic res should always be implemented with split screen action. But then they'd have to code extra for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But also keep in mind that there's a chance that there's more CPU bound calculations. If two players are in two different places (unlikely for most games, but just for example let's take console minecraft. Player 1 is on the other side of the world from player 2, doubling the amount of loaded blocks total). Plus, old old game's &quot;physics&quot; engines might actually have trouble with twice the number of player sprites because old hardware was just so slow (I'm talking snes era though).</p>
<p>Edit: Yes, they could halve the blocks. But let's face it: Minecraft is horribly optimized and they don't. It was just an example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Resolution is not nearly the biggest factor here. Every object in a game consists of triangles, you used to be able to see that, but the tris are so small now that you can't see them in most games anymore. All those triangles are grouped in a smart way and added to a buffer. Those groups visible to the player have to be drawn to the screen every frame. Now, when you add another player he has his own list of groups to draw, this is the real bottleneck. The game is rendering twice the triangles, while also doing extra calculations on what to draw and what now (clipping and culling). Then there are some smaller things like input and sound that have to be duplicated as well. Lastly, if a process happens once a frame it can be optimized in certain ways which are impossible if the process happens multiple times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, his idea of split screen sucking up resources is exaggerated. For example, I ran 4 instances of Diablo 3 with slightly less performance than full screen single game instance.</p>
<p>Another good example is Mario Kart 8 on the switch. The single player game runs at 60 FPS but only drops to 30 FPS during four player matches. Performance takes a hit but not that substantial. It's certainly doable from a hardware standpoint.</p></div>		</li>
