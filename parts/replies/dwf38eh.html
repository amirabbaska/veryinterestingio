			<div class="markdown"><p>lol this actually bothers me. I think it is weird that HD is a static standard. The term strikes me as more of a thing that adapts over time. Coming up with terms like UHD just sounds so dumb to me. </p>
<p>In my head 1080p would be standard definition and 4k would be HD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People always say this, and there are studies that say this too, but I've been able to tell easily. There's something about 4K that just looks more crisp even on smaller displays with farther viewing distances than these thresholds they say are there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's no way. I have a 55&quot; HDTV. My friend just got a 55&quot; 4k UHDTV. The picture on his is insanely better than mine. I'm willing to bet if you set them side by side, 1,000 out of 1,000 random people could tell the difference. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Either youtube changed their compression, or my new glasses work really well with 1080</p></div>		</li>
