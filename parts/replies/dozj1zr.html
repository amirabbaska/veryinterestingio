			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because their facial expressions are generally not as involved as ours and their facial muscles less developed - surely you could be losing cortisol through sweat or urine or something, which indicates a social development. Obviously crying is a powerful social signal as well. I looked it up though, text cited from somewhere within this link which you are free to ctrl-f for: <a href="https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Darwin/Darwin_1872_06.html" target="_blank">https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Darwin/Darwin_1872_06.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;I was anxious to ascertain whether there existed in any of the lower animals a similar relation between the contraction of the orbicular muscles during violent expiration and the secretion of tears; but there are very few animals which contract these muscles in a prolonged manner, or which shed tears. _The Macacus maurus, which formerly wept so copiously in the Zoological Gardens, would have been a fine case for observation; but the two monkeys now there, and which are believed to belong to the same species, do not weep. Nevertheless they were carefully observed by Mr. Bartlett and myself, whilst screaming loudly, and they seemed to contract these muscles&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;the keeper of the Indian elephants positively asserts that he has several times seen tears rolling down the face of the old female, when distressed by the removal of the young one. Hence I was extremely anxious to ascertain, as an extension of the relation between the contraction of the orbicular muscles and the shedding of tears in man, whether elephants when screaming or trumpeting loudly contract these muscles. At Mr. Bartlett's desire the keeper ordered the old and the young elephant to trumpet; and we repeatedly saw in both animals that, just as the trumpeting began, the orbicular muscles, especially the lower ones, were distinctly contracted.&quot;</p>

<p>Another comment says they saw their dog cry when stressed and that's another socially oriented mammal, so I buy it.</p></div>		</li>
