			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people can go without blinking for long periods of time without noticing yes, but your eyeballs don’t like that. You just have good control over a certain part of your body. You still blink normally throughout the day without ever really thinking about it. Just like breathing. Some parts of your body are on autopilot until you shut autopilot off but autopilot will always kick back on without you doing anything. You can hold your breathe for as long as you can and if you happen to make it to the point where you pass out, your body automatically starts to breathe again while you’re night night. </p></div>		</li>
