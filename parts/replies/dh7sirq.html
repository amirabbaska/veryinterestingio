			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they're pretty secure.  It's possible that somebody somewhere has hacked one, but I've never heard of it.</p>
<p>Certain models can be programmed to accept &quot;coupons&quot; so if you run a business like a car wash or a photo booth or something, you can issue coupons with your company logo on it that are accepted by the bill validators.  You can order generic coupons, or custom made ones direct from the bill validator manufacturer.</p>
<p>Here's an example:  <a href="http://www.meigroup.com/usa/vending/vending_products/bill_acceptors/mei_coupons/" target="_blank">http://www.meigroup.com/usa/vending/vending_products/bill_acceptors/mei_coupons/</a></p>
<p>Side note, I'm not affiliated with MEI but they're one of the most common manufacturers of bill validators.  I'm only using them as an example because I'm most familiar with their lineup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No Bill Validators will only accept bills. MEI also makes the same or similar BV's for slot machines and they have pretty accurate detection systems. There are other systems used, I believe MEI uses infrared technology (not 100 percent been a while since I worked with them). But another company, JCM, has a BV called iVizion, which takes a picture of the bill and analyzes this way.</p>
<p>In short a BV knows what its looking for and if it doesn't find those security features (real or not) it will not accept it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, they could be programmed to accept anything, including a blank piece of paper. Car washes use BVs that accept their gift certificates. Casinos is BVs that accept the cash out slips. </p></div>		</li>
