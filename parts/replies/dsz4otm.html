			<div class="markdown"><p>The state dependant tolerances was one of the most interesting things I learned in my psychopharmacology class. Drink with friends at a bar every weekend, you're fine. Drink at parents when you go home, you're a lightweight. Drug users dying in bus terminals because they used the regular dose. A lot of it seemed to be enhanced by repetition and ritual surrounding the event. Truly amazing stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SO fascinating!!! I've heard colleagues even speculate that this is why people think that different types of alcohol affect them more dramatically; if you rarely drink tequila, then you might get drunker when you drink tequila! Never seen a concrete experiment to back it up, but it makes a lot of sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is an excellent question. Apparently in these studies they administer intravenous caffeine such that the blood levels of caffeine are similar to what you would experience when drinking a cup of coffee, so that should largely control for differences in the method of administration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are referencing is bioavailability and drug absorption. These are quantified by measuring the concentration of a drug at a given dose in the blood when given orally, and dividing that by the concentration in the blood after intravenous administration. By definition, the bioavailability of a drug when given intravenously is 100% (i.e. 100% of a drug is present in the blood when directly infused into the blood)</p></div>		</li>
