			<div class="markdown"><p>The western front of World War I was a war fought largely through bombardment. Countless battles proved that it's not really feasible to just sit back and annihilate a well-fortified enemy with long-range artillery. Artillery are most effective when used in combined warfare, with aircraft to identify key targets and infantry to actually take control of positions. Rolling barrages to protect your infantry and suppress the enemy are more effective than just bombarding the crap out of them.</p>
<p>These were the tactics that they started using at the end of the first world war, and they proved effective. So by WW2, everybody had already learned these lessons.</p>
<p>The Battle of Amiens, which launched the final stage of WWI was even a surprise attack, just like Normandy. It involved a rapid artillery barrage followed by a sudden assault, and proved much more effective than sitting back and bombarding the enemy - that generally just degenerates into a meatgrinder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember, too, that while they did shell the bejesus out of the place, they only had a fairly narrow window to do it.  If they didn't land on June 5 or 6 or 7, they'd have lost the tide for the month and would have had to delay.  And bombing one place too much -- say for a week ahead of the thing instead of just a few hours -- they'd have given away the landing zone to the Germans.  We needed to get the Americans and Canadians and British armies ashore in that window and any benefit to additional bombardment might have brought in more reinforcements than it would have been worth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, did the Germans not know that it was coming? Sorry I know nothing about technology or history, but it wasn't like now when satellites let you track ship movements? I know there were no satellites, but what about spy planes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The English Channel isn't that big, the movement took place over a few hours prior to the start of the invasion.  Even if they saw them depart it wouldn't have been much help at that point.  There were also decoy armies setup (Patton was in &quot;charge&quot; of one if I recall correctly).  It was quite an ingenious process.</p></div>		</li>

<p>this was not because of inaccurate fire, but rather the result of German skill in fortification building... </p>

<p>The crazy thing is that Normandy was not even the most heavily fortified region of the coast. The Calais region, further up the coast, where the crossing between Britain and the mainland was the shortest, was much more heavily fortified. The further you got from that point, the lighter the defenses got. Normandy was chosen because it was away from the heaviest fortifications but still close enough to Britain to have meaningful air support.</p></div>		</li>
