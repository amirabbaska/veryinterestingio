<p>Seagulls are also very common in cities in the UK for the same reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Warning harsh language:  </p>
<p>Here in Norway Seagulls are a fucking pest. They make so INSANELY much noise. I had a loft apartment in the middle of the city and I swear if I could kill each and everyone of those fuckers after the torment they put me through by waking me up all the time at night I would.  </p>
<p>Here's the insane part. For some fucked up reason, our retarded government has classified those god damn fucking flying rats as  a <strong>protected species</strong>. So there is nothing we can actually do about it. Humanity has exterminated countless species... but for some unbelievably stupid reason seagulls, those worthless flying fuckfaces, are &quot;off limits&quot;. Fuck Seagulls and whatever hellish God that spawned them and fuck our government for protecting that disgusting hellspawn which has no place in creation.</p>

They also eat pigeons! </p></div>		</li>
