			<p>If it was in the shore, it would get pushed into the land, so the wave of water or the height is not the problem. The water would collide with the ship pushing it into shore. It wont damage the ship. the collision with land will.<br><br>If its in open water, the wave would be 3 meters high, and 213 meters long...no one would notice it.</p>		</li>

			<p>Any boat, any aircraft carrier, heck you could be swimming in the water and you'd never know you were in a Tsunami. You only notice it when it hits land. </p>		</li>

			<p>No, /u/MrVicePres meant if the aircraft carrier were near the shore and a 10-metre wave passed by its location.</p>		</li>

			<p>Vessels close to shore would be pushed against land. That would damage them, but not directly from the water.</p>		</li>

			<p>Almost certainly.<br><br>You get smaller, more isolated waves approaching the 10m height in regions of the world such as the southern ocean. Most of the larger sea-faring craft can handle those large waves, when they occur. Frequent large waves would likely cause some structural damage to the hull (every so often there's one large boat in the southern ocean that has to return home lest they risk sinking in another storm due to cracked hulls), but a tsunami is not usually a series of 10m waves.<br><br>All of that is theoretical though, because waves of that height tend to only be reached as the wave approaches shore, I just think it's worth mentioning that ships of that size can withstand some rather brutal wave action.</p>		</li>
