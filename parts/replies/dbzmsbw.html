			<div class="markdown"><p>While this makes sense on the surface in a Pavlovian way, I would like to ask how this works with desensitization over time to the same emotional stimulus. </p>
<p>Wouldn't repeated encounters with stressors lead to less and less emotional response over time rather than cementing it into the evolutionary psyche?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're considering the effect of repeated exposure to emotional stimulus <em>within an individual</em>, rather than as a trait cemented into the species as a whole via natural selection. </p>
<p>Yes, in individuals, as they are exposed to repeated stressors they experience diminished emotional responses. This is why the first time a friend jumps out from behind a door they scare you, but the hundredth time it's just annoying. </p>
<p>What Tooby &amp; Cosmides are suggesting in the linked study is that early humans that showed a predisposition toward a certain emotional response had a better rate of survival, effectively breeding those emotional responses into the human species. </p>
<p>Going back to the fear of the dark, it's certainly plausible that a specific early human would experience desensitization to his fear of the dark throughout his life, but if he survives and another early human that does not have that fear does not, he will pass on his genetic predisposition to fear of the dark to his offspring, and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In regards to desensitization - this occurs is the emotion is <em>not</em> present when exposed to the stimulus, so in the case of darkness as long as the person continues to be scared (whether or not something scary happens) they won't desensitize in fact the bond will be stronger. Desensitization requires exposure to the stimuli without (or with a lesser I suppose) fear response. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that emotion is the base for memory to build on especially within social groups.  Think of a long term memory.  Usually an associated emotion (happy/sad/nostalgic/angry) comes rushing in to enforce what happened in that encounter and serves as a sort of &quot;flash card&quot; to remember cause/effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is highly debated though.  Tooby and Cosmides are probably wrong, in light of the past decade of research.  There's no good evidence to suggest that a fear module (or whichever emotion) evolved over time.  </p></div>		</li>
