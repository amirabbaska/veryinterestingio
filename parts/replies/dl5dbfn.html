			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't keep a tally of the numbers but it does monitor oxygen carrying capacity. If your blood isn't carrying enough oxygen one of the things that happens is the kidney notices and produces erythropoietin which stimulates RBC production. At the same time, other parts of the body notice too and increase your heart rate and breathing rate to try to compensate for the reduced capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body can detect low oxygen levels in the blood, and responds by releasing a hormone called erythropoietin. This stimulates more red blood cells to grow in the bone marrow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the blood flows through the liver where the liver cells extract and process some waste products, then the blood comes out again. Old and damaged RBCs are basically plucked from the stream as they pass by</p></div>		</li>
