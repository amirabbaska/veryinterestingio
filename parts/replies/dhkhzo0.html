			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's because the drugs cause dry mouth, so there is a decrease in the protective saliva. Also heavy drug users are less likely to remember or make a priority of brushing teeth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know much of it has to do with chronic dry mouth. Then it has to do with malnourishment, when it comes to the harder drugs. After all meth decreases appetite by a large margin, lasts a long time, causes grinding, and chronic dry mouth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drugs like meth are well known for destroying teeth. It is not just the decrease in saliva flow, it is the intrinsic effects of the drugs. It enters the bloodstream, and the acidic nature of the drugs also makes the saliva produced acidic. Hence with &quot;meth mouths&quot; you have the characteristic multiple cervical lesions (i.e. near the gingival crevice where saliva leaks out). The primary sites where saliva accumulates is where you have the most demineralisation of enamel.</p></div>		</li>
