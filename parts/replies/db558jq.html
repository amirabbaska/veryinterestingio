<p>Which, in the 3300 incidents number points to this webpage:</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: I noticed that this link is a portal link. Please do yourself a favor and click the hyperlink in the article over the 3300 incidents text. The second link may work /Edit</p>

</ul>
<p>Which, if you look at it, shows data for Air, highway, rail, and waterways. It then appears that they took the aggregate data for all incidents from 2011 through 2015 and added those <strong>from the rail section</strong> I don't know what they are talking about, but I can't see any evidence they looked at any pipeline data in that article. </p>
<p><strong>Edit 4</strong>: It appears that, after further investigation, the article that this poster got his information from incorrectly used the HAZMAT data which, ironically, is from Air, Rail, Highway, and waterway transport... /Edit</p>
<p>I went through the data from the PHMSA and this is what I found:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Between 2010 to present PHMSA has reported 2730 flagged incidents for liquid hydrocarbon spills. Flagged incidents are defined here: <a href="https://hip.phmsa.dot.gov/Hip_Help/pdmpublic_incident_page_allrpt.pdf" target="_blank">https://hip.phmsa.dot.gov/Hip_Help/pdmpublic_incident_page_allrpt.pdf</a></p>
</li>
<li>The PHMSA uses 5 different types of spilled commodities: 
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>REFINED AND/OR PETROLEUM PRODUCT (NON-HVL) WHICH IS A LIQUID AT AMBIENT CONDITIONS</li>
<li>CO2 (CARBON DIOXIDE)</li>
<li>HVL OR OTHER FLAMMABLE OR TOXIC FLUID WHICH IS <strong>A GAS AT AMBIENT</strong> CONDITIONS</li>
<li>CRUDE OIL</li>
<li>BIOFUEL / ALTERNATIVE FUEL(INCLUDING ETHANOL BLENDS)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of this post, I looked only at liquid spills, so that's Refined product, Crude, and Biofuel.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I looked only at On-Shore incidents</p>
</li>
<li>I did not look at incidents in Totally contained, operator owned facilities (i.e spills in a spill containment which did not migrate out of the containment).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>At this point there were 574 incidents</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I looked at all incidents above 5 bbl net spilled (Unintended spill + Intended spill - Recovered)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>207 Left</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I looked at all incidents over 100 bbls spilled</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>81 left</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All incidents over 1000 bbls spilled</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>22 left</strong></p>
<p>I should note here that only 18 of the total number of incidents were offshore.
<em>I should also note that the data for the deepwater horizon spill isn't in this report, so this report is for <strong>pipelines only</strong>.</em></p>
<p><strong>What I'm getting at here</strong> is that while there were over 2700 incidents in the last six years, the vast majority of those have been either C02, airborne (which isn't to say harmless) chemicals, or very small spills (like leaks in valves, etc). It's a relatively safe venture, when properly maintained. I do recognize that there are many aging pipelines, and that is worrisome. But on the other hand, if we don't build new ones, the old ones will continue to be used (here, not saying that they <em>will</em> replace the old ones with the new, but it limits our options if we don't build new, improved pipelines).</p>
<p>The data can be found here:
<a href="http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/pipeline/library/data-stats/flagged-data-files" target="_blank">http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/pipeline/library/data-stats/flagged-data-files</a></p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I suppose I should also add the disclaimer that this is all <em>flagged</em> incidents. Most operations are encouraged to report any and all incidents. This is primarily because small leaks do happen, and are usually repaired easily. If a site isn't reporting any issues, they can bet that the regulating body and inspectors will have them on the short list of sites to visit and inspect. And despite what people think, not reporting a <em>large</em> spill is a <em>huge</em> deal. Maybe not for the company, but for the guy(s) on the ground, it could mean loss of their job, personal fines, etc. </p>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: I feel I should note that for liquid hydrocarbon pipelines, the number of fatalities since 2010 is 8 in this report. I don't know where the 80+ number comes from as the gaseous natural gas, plus LNG, plus crude is 19 fatalities in the reports I see. Perhaps I'm missing something...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you- I was unable to access the data and honestly I was typing this while not doing my schoolwork in class so I didn't have time to look so far into where the data came from.  I just figured it was some sort of researcher-only database.  Thank you for finding it for me.  I believe the 80+ number comes from the compiled data from 2006-2015.</p>
<p>So I suppose a lot of the data I cited is fairly misleading, but my other points still stand- eminent domain is a terrible thing that is used to build these pipelines and really just needs to be gotten rid of entirely, and building more oil infrastructure is remaining in the ways of the past and not preparing for a clean, renewable-energy future.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They also tend to ignore Native American land rights and seize their land for eminent domain even though it's technically illegal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The government has a long history of doing stuff like this. They'll steal land and then develop something on it, and by the time the rightful owners of the land are able to get their land back, the damage is irreparable.</p>
<p>For example, back in the Civil War, the government illegally seized the home of Mary Lee (Robert E. Lee's wife) and started burying their dead there as a &quot;fuck you&quot; to the Lees. By the time George W.C. Lee (Robert's oldest son) sued the government and got the land back which was his by right of inheritance, there were so many graves on it that there was not much he could do except sell the land back to the government, for a substantial loss ($150,000, which is about $3.8 million nowadays; considering it was 1,100 acres, when an acre of land nowadays in Arlington is well over $1m, it was a huge loss).</p>
<p>Slightly over half of that land is now the Arlington National Cemetery, and the land extended to around where the Pentagon is now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Since 2010, over 3,300 incidents of crude oil and liquefied natural gas leaks or ruptures have occurred on U.S. pipelines. These incidents have killed 80 people, injured 389 more, and cost $2.8 billion in damages. They also released toxic, polluting chemicals in local soil, waterways, and air (Center for Effective Government). Let's take the Keystone XL Pipeline for example. It's predicted to result in about 91 major spills over 50 years, contaminating over 450 miles of water and violating the Safe Drinking Water Act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't really answer the question though, does it? Airplanes have killed people and cost money but they are significantly safer and cheaper than driving across the country which is why we use them. In that same vein you can't just look at the isolated risks of oil pipelines to conclude they are bad when
alternative ways of transporting fossil fules also have major risks.</p>
<p>Now i'm not sure whether pipes are LESS safe, but being that your entire argument hinges on that fact, it bothers me you didn't even mention this point.</p>
<p>I also don't know about your 3rd paragraph about needing to focus on renewable energies. Its not like we can only pick one here. If oil pipelines were significantly cheaper and safer (than alternative transport methods) at a level where they would pay back that investment despite the fact that we would expect to be transitioning away from fossil fules, then i don't think it would make sense to say 'nah, i want to focus on renewable energy' and ignore the potential benefits during the current transition period. That is, unless you think that pipelines and the like are able to slow the adoption of renewables, which again, is not something you mentioned despite your entire argument relying on it. I certainly can't take it as a given when current methods of transport in involve giant tankers burning additional fossil fuels to transport the oil which would only seem to increase the need for fossil fuels in comparison.</p>
<p>Just to emphasize: I'm not saying you are wrong in your views, but that your arguments depend on several assumptions which you neither state as subjective beliefs nor support as objective truth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>for that to make any sense, you'd have to believe that the oil would not be transported if the pipeline isn't built.</p>
<p>Otherwise not building the pipe is the same as saying it should be transported by other methods and the argument stands.</p></div>		</li>
