<p>It's just as likely that life exists in all temperature ranges, but we don't yet understand life in much warmer temperatures well enough to recognize it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's just as likely that life exists at all temperature ranges.  We're in a pretty sweet spot as far as Chemistry goes, allowing all sorts of complex interactions to take place at a variety of speeds.  Increase or decrease the temperature too much and that becomes much less likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple stages of stability, though, right? I remember reading a while back that silicon-based lifeforms could theoretically be possible, using ammonia in place of water as the universal solvent. These types of lifeforms aren't nearly as likely, though. Iirc, they are a lot less stable and simply less likely to have the consituent parts available, especially when you get to the next stage up which I believe was Boron-based lifeforms.</p>
<p>EDIT: I also think these lifeforms need <em>colder</em> temperatures, not warmer temperatures. Carbon-based lifeforms might be our limit as far as warmth goes, since it is the simplest element that has such bond flexibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Change things too much from what we're familiar with and the reactions and interactions we're familiar with are much less likely.&quot; You're not really saying anything here. The sole purpose of my comment was to get people to stop parroting the popular view and actually take a look at their intellectual biases.</p></div>		</li>
