			<div class="markdown"><p>For days I was cleaning dead/frozen fruit flies from just inside the freezer.  Every day, even every time I opened the door, there were dead fruit flies just inside the door.....like two dozen if it had been overnight.    I called  maintenance and they treated me like I was crazy.  They looked all over my kitchen for rotting food.   They knew they'd never find anything based on the way I keep my place but they didn't believe the fruit flies were inside an operating freezer.   I thought about it and asked them to check behind the motor in the freezer.  Sure enough, they found a &quot;nest&quot;.  It was warm, the fruit flies were reproducing and flying around in the freezer until they died.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, in my case, we accidentally put away a china teapot that unbeknownst to us had some soggy herbal tea in it. We'd searched the house up and down looking for the cause, but didn't think to check there until I started actively hunting the bastards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also, there's probably a drain there somewhere (deffo if it's a frost free freezer)</p>
<p>99% of the time it's a little tube leading down from the freezer to the compressor, there's a little pan on top of the compressor, defrost water runs down the tube into the pan - then when the compressor runs it gets warm/hot and the water evaporates</p>
<p>Im pretty sure that's the way every home fridge does it (I guess there's probably exceptions) and every frost free freezer</p>
<p>so I guess smelly smells coming out of defrost pipe - runway for flys</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, that's where I mentioned crawling up a U-trap. When it works right, there's some liquid acting as a barrier. But outgassing could eject that liquid.</p></div>		</li>

The liquid in u-bends will eventually evaporate and stop doing what they're supposed to.<br />
This is why if you have a rarely-used guest bathroom, you need to visit it from time to time and give it a maintenance flush (varies with weather, but y'know, once a month or so).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are correct, rather than the people saying the eggs were on the food going in. I also had a fruit fly problem, where my perfectly working freezer would always have dead fruit flies in it. I wasn't sure if they were getting in through the water line, or in air that was blown in, but they definitely weren't breeding in there. I imagine if they got in when the freezer wasn't working, they'd probably be able to lay eggs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, the air &quot;blown in&quot; to a freezer is really just air already in the freezer, blown past a heat-exchanger. It makes much more sense to cool already cold air than it would to blow in fresh room-temp air. Plus, to make room for that air, your freezer would need to be constantly blowing out cool air which would be an extra silly thing to do in the winter-time.</p></div>		</li>
