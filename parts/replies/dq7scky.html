			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the key here is the immense amount of information kept in the DNA and RNA in every individual cell. Moreover, all types of life inherit a complete set of this entire ANCIENT LIBRARY of information. </p>
<p>Reproduction in all life forms: fungi, cells, and bacteria, package the entire set of books in a library, accompanied with the shelves necessary, the librarian, a successful filing system, and alerts of intruders.</p>
<p>Building life from scratch is impossible, because the nature of life is to come from a replication and remnants of itself. Similar to building a library from scratch is impossible without filling it with books from other libraries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not actually the amount of info that makes it impossible. We actually have the technology to synthesize and assemble an entire bacterial genome from scratch.</p>
<p>The problem arises when you try to make that genome functional. You need RNA polymerase to make RNA. You can't make that protein without RNA and a ribosome, but you can't make ribosomes without RNA polymerase and other ribosomes.</p></div>		</li>
