<p>Except it's <strong>not</strong>.</p>
<p>The countries targeted do not provide a significant number of terrorist threats.</p>
<p>However, a number of countries were exempt from the ban - countries in which Trump has extensive business interests - and all those exempt countries <strong>have</strong> produced a significant number of terrorist threats.</p>
<p>This is chest-beating, it's security-theater. It's designed to make people think he's being tough while protecting his own financial interests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not trying to start an argument, but the countries that are exempt from the band are also generally considered US/NATO allies in that region. The fact that they are allies and relatively friendly with the United States could be one of the reasons that Trump has business interests in them. You could be right, but I don't find the correlation very persuasive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trump didn't pick the countries for the list. They were added to the list by Obama's Homeland security I believe in 2015 as &quot;countries of concern.&quot; By the way, Obama did the same ban for the same reason to one of the countries on the list in 2011 - Iraq, if I'm not mistaken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all I want to say thanks for taking the time to answer everyone's questions and source your stuff.  If you wouldn't mind answering, I have a couple questions about the executive order:</p>
<p>The only thing I see in the actual text of the executive order regarding which countries are affected is the phrase &quot;Countries of Particular Concern.&quot;  Is this an official name for the seven countries that were banned?  Or does it just give the secretary of homeland security freedom to decide?</p>
<p>Also, I have seen that Trump is going to give priority to Christian immigrants.  The only source I see for this is a 30 second clip of him in an interview and then CNN news people condemning him.  I can't find the full audio from the interview.  Does he actually say that Christians will be given priority?  Or is all he saying that they have been treated unfairly in the past?  I know this question is a little off of the main topic but it would be great if you knew the answer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The language of the EO cites to section 217(a)(12) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.  That section specifically lists Iraq and Syria as countries that the Secretary of state is watching. That section also grants to the Secretary of State the ability to designate other countries. I'm sure if you follow the rabbit hole down far enough you will be able to find out where the specific country list is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it is not an official name for the 7 that were banned. It is an instruction for homeland to decide. They have an existing set of criteria they use to analyze every country and if they a country meets that criteria they are of particular concern. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your response. I have another question.</p>
<p>I heard that Saudi Arabia, the country where the 9/11 terrorists were from, was not included on the list of countries to have their immigration suspended. Is this true? And if so, does this mean that Saudi Arabia is no longer seen as a perceived threat to United States national security?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saudi Arabia is not on the list of the 7 banned countries. </p>
<p>I personally believe that has more to do with him &amp; his business entities, as he has 8 there, according to The Hill:</p>

<p>Last I heard some or all of the 09/11 players were from SA. </p></div>		</li>
