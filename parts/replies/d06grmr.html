			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh. I chuckled.</p>
<p>However, most dancers are <em>well</em> over 40 pounds.  </p>
<p>The reason I chose 40 pounds is that most of the women don't have experience lifting heavy weights.  I used a metaphor they could relate to, rather than what I was experiencing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope.  Most of the girls I worked with were between 110 and 140.</p>
<p>However, most of them didn't find it as easy to visualize lifting 140 as lifting 40.  The point of the metaphor was so that they could visualize the difference between lifting a metal bar and lifting a bag of water.  So I used a weight that they were likely to be able to lift comfortably as a metal bar, but would struggle with as a bag of water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly!</p>
<p>And this is why it's so important that dancers hold center.</p>
<p>Additionally, when pirouetting (or other turns, like tour en l'air), you are balancing while rotating around center.  If your center shifts, you go off-balance really quickly, and that rarely ends well.  So it's not only the girls who need to hold center - we <em>all</em> do in order to be able to do the choreography.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it may have more to do with grip than we're giving credit for. </p>
<p>The dumbell is easy to lift up because its got a cleverly hand shaped hand grip to grip onto. </p>
<p>The forty pound bag of water, if it had a similar grip, would be just as easy to lift </p>
<p>Same concept with a human. The human is large enough that you can't get a good grip on him. A good grip is also easier to attain the higher off the ground you are. Hold a person by the ankle and dangle them 40 feet above the air. Very simple to carry now (if you correct for the obvious &quot;holy shit people weigh a fucking lot!!&quot; Factor). </p>
<p>Its not merely center of gravity. Its grip. But grip is an emergent property of several different basic properties. </p>
<p>Weight, shiftiness of the center of gravity, availability of obvious handholds, relationship of size of object to size of object holder, ground clearance height, shape of object, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my experience:</p>
<p>When my partner holds center strongly, I <em>balance</em> her on my hands - I don't need to grip at all, I just use my body (ususally hands, but depends on the lift) as a platform to support her.</p>
<p>When she's floppy, I <em>do</em> have to grip.  I can't shift my hands under her when her weight is on my hands.  So if she flops, and the weight is no longer centered on my platform, I have to grab on to keep her up.</p>
<p>Which is where my metaphor comes in.  When I explain (and, if necessary, demonstrate) this, then she understands why, on some lifts, my grip <em>hurts</em>.  This also empowers her to make it so that my grip doesn't hurt.</p>
<p>I do understand what you are talking about.  But again, as a dancer who lifted partners, grip isn't a factor when she's holding center.  It only becomes a factor when she's a bag of water.</p></div>		</li>
