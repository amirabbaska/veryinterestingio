<p>ou will notice this if you have ever left a nice knife at the bottom of your stainless sink for a while (if wet)</p>

<p>yeah, but aren't nice knives generally much higher in high carbon iron and much lower in chromium?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes because it is easier to increase the hardness this way which contributes to a very sharp edge that doesnt need a whole lot of resharpening.</p>
<p>However, the downside is that cheap, very hard knives are virtually not honeable in a household setting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. The point I should have made (my reply was already too long), is that &quot;stainless&quot; doesn't really mean anything and it's all relative. The sink and the knife are both &quot;stainless&quot; however they are still different chemically/galvanically. With the addition of an electrolyte (water), they will rust like all hell. </p>
<p>I'm not sure what type of stainless your typical fork/spoon/knife are, but I would say that it's going to have a lower carbon content since it doesn't need to hold an edge and is more similar to your sink which is why they don't rust as much at the bottom of your sink. </p>
<hr />
<p>Compared to the typical carbon steel knife prior to 1913 chromium steel knives &quot;stain less&quot;. My point simply was that stainless steels do in fact corrode, just less (typically). </p></div>		</li>
