			<div class="markdown"><p>The term was &quot;haute cuisine,&quot; or high cooking. The French Revolution made it possible for the average family to adopt the recipes and techniques. And since France was a booming economic hub in the 1600s-1700s, they had quite a bit of knowledge and expertise to draw from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yet the American public does not demand it.   No affordable French restaurants, no French drive-throughs.   Even the rich are just as likely to order Thai.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s because it’s so heavily engrained in American cuisine that you wouldn’t refer to it as French cooking. Watch any American cooking show or talk to a competent chef, most of the techniques are French (eg béchamel, roux, julienne, purée).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong on this, but I think that's because much of what we take for granted today as standard techniques and recipes actually derive from French cuisine. If you go to a nicer restaurant somewhere in the states that has American cuisine, I think it's likely to be basically french cooking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least in part. Knife skills, sauces - especially the mother sauces, soups, etc. all at least start with the French technique. You may finish it differently, but most western culture cooking would be heavily influenced by the French.</p></div>		</li>
