			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at the numbers they gave for oxygen and nitrogen, you'll notice that they add up to right about 99%. The remaining roughly one percent is nearly entirely argon. Ignoring water vapor, every other gas in the atmosphere is a very small fraction of a percent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on a submarine when I was in the navy. When we're underway, especially when we were on a spec op, we didn't usually generate oxygen we just scrubbed the CO2 out of the atmosphere. Often the oxygen alarm the Central Air Monitoring System would be flashing. People would sleep a lot because of the low oxygen levels. Also it was really hard to light a cigarette, you usually had to put two lighters together. When we put up the snorkel mast and brought in fresh air people would wake up. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Same's true for spacecraft. Spacecraft can't tolerate high O2 either because it makes everything super-flammable.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spacecraft (e.g. the Shuttle and the ISS) still use 100% O2.   Why?  If you want to run conventional N2/02 for breathing, the pressure (in the spacecraft) needs to be fairly high.  Higher pressure needs a stronger vehicle, which means more material, which mean more weight.  Spacecraft are all about being <em>light</em>.  Heavy stuff costs much more to loft into orbit and keep there.  However, with Apollo (not sure of current tech) ended up running N2/O2 in the capsule on the way up to orbit (pressure not an issue) and then it was bled out to pure O2 on the way up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can refrigerate air to  −78.5 °C and CO2 will fall out as dry ice snow.  This sort of refrigeration requires a great deal of energy and you must cryocool your entire initial volume of air, not just the &lt;1% of CO2 you want to remove.</p>
<p>There are membranes which are permeable to water vapor but not air.  Also zeolite absorbs nitrogen while under pressure but not oxygen, and releases the nitrogen when pressure reduces, allowing for mechanical gas separation (pressure swing adsorption, PSA).   However I don't know of any variant of PSA or membrane which separates CO2.</p></div>		</li>
