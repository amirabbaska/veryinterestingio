			<div class="markdown"><p>The evolution of some forms of life is absolutely amazing.  Just to think about all of the things that had to line up just perfectly for rabies to impact a certain nerve to facilitate its own transmission is remarkable.  </p>
<p>I'm in a really weird state of mind.  I just found a sense of beauty in rabies.  LOL  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well to be fair, we have never seen all those many forms of life that did not have things line up just right for them to remain sustainable, because they're gone.  So we have only the ones that have made it, and none of the failures to compare against.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In fact if people/animals with rabies were able to swallow, the rate of transmission would be reduced drastically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apologies if this is a stupid question, but wouldn't another form of transmission that doesn't kill the host, or at least doesn't cause symptoms easily recognizable to others, make more sense?</p></div>		</li>
