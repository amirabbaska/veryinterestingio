			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but it's also perfectly reasonable to talk about massless particles without involving quantum mechanics. Even leaving quantum physics aside, p=mv is only an approximation to the relativistic definition of momentum. The approximation is reliable when v &lt;&lt; c, so it can't be used at all for objects moving at the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Position and momentum of a particle are related by the fourier transform. All things which exist in space possess internal energy whose distribution and motion are governed in this manner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what the other person posted: light acts as a particle and as a wave. Because of this you can actually create experiments and such in which a collision between and electron and photon collide, causing shifts in wavelength of the photon, and movement in the electron. This is called the Compton effect.</p>
<p>Also the photoelectric effect (the thing that makes your calculator work without batteries) only works correctly of the photon is viewed as a particle due to some complications within the concept.</p></div>		</li>
