			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there different kinds of fat for particular functions (particularly in females). Android fat, is the kind that accumulates across the whole of the body when there's an excess of calories. Gynoid fat, plays a role in fertility and accumulates to the breast and hips and does not fluctuate as drastically as android fat when your losing weight. This is why there's a common trope &quot;Lost the weight, kept the boobs&quot;. BTW I learnt this through reading the book A Billion Wicked Thoughts, so I can't go into any further detail but I don't think I'm that far off</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hormones and genetics.  When you're pregnant, fat will relocate to your breasts to aid in milk creation.  Breasts aren't very useful (in a procreative way) at other times, and the lack of them makes physical activity easier, so people with an athletic figure tend to have smaller breasts (both women and men).  Thigh fat is closer to the thigh muscle, so is more easily accessible if most of your activity deals with walking.</p>
<p>And, of course, if you bench 200 lbs, that fat is going to be right near the chest muscle instead of out in your breasts.</p>
<p>Seems to me that there should be topical hormone therapies by now to change all that though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>could you tell me more about fat being stored and burned inside the muscles? carbs are stored as glycogen inside the muscles for this purpose but i cant find good documentation of fats being stored. also, wouldnt an athletic person with the same muscle mass as an unathletic person be able to store the same amount of fuel inside their muscles? creatine can extend the anaerobic threshold which is why its so widely used in weight training, but afaik fats have a limited impact on quick energy generation outside of ketosis, and carbs allow energy to return quickly, but over the course of a few minutes rather than the few seconds until the anaerobic threshold is reached</p>
<p>not trying to call you out, but thats what ive heard and read and im confused how it all fits together</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fat is stored at an intracellular level in the cell plasma near and in mytochondria, especially in cells who need a lot of aerobic energy such as type 1 (endurance) muscle cells. It is well documented that endurance athletes have more and better positioned fat/lipid droplets with reguard to their mytochondria inside the cells for optimal aerobic capacity. The opposite is also well documented, as in a sedentary person has worse positioned lipid droplets inside the cells which makes their cellular aerobic capacity very limited.
As for the storage, it is also documented that cells adapt to energy needs, as in the endurance athlete will store more fuel (fats as lipid droplets and carbs through glut4 translocation through the membrane) and more importantly be able to produce the energy at a much faster/more efficient way. </p>
<p>And yes i never said fats are used for quick energy generation, but more a steady flow of energy without much waste production such as marathon running. Creatine phosphate and glycolysis are sources of anaerobic energy such as in sports like weightlifting or sprinting so increasing the supply will indeed increase your anaerobic performance but more importantly training your body in how you use the resource will give you even more anaerobic performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thats interesting. as someone who does primarily weight training, i dont have a lot of knowledge on muscles trained for endurance. it makes sense that fats would make a good fuel for aerobic exercise, thanks for shining some light on it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So with this knowledge, to get rid of visceral and subdermal fat would it be more beneficial for someone to accumulate muscle in other areas (legs, arms) so the energy from food goes there instead? Wouldnâ€™t that make gaining muscle around the abdomen somewhat counterproductive to the cause of losing visceral fat? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its not entirely true that you store fat in your muscles. you do store energy, but as glycogen, a carb that your body can use to quickly formulate atp when your muscles are in use. glycogen is not stored in belly fat, just within the muscles. gaining muscle will not draw fat away from other parts of the body. core exercises increase thickness of the core muscles, allowing them to be more visible through a layer of fat, making the core appear leaner</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Muscle mass needs more maintenance than fat mass, which increases the metabolism and therefor the lipolysis in the whole body, yes. </p>
<p>When i say fat is stored in the muscle i am talking about a cellular level, as in lipid droplets inside the cell, this fat is never or almost never stored for very long. Visceral fat on the other hand is fat stored around the organs that is very metabolically active. It serves a lot of negative purposes such as hormonal imbalance, cardiovascular risk, diabetes risk, ... But just like other stored fat, it can be removed with simple exercise and diet. It should always be a priority to lower visceral fat levels as opposed to subcutaneous fat levels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read some cool stuff on subcutaneous (&quot;hunter&quot;) vs visceral (&quot;gatherer&quot;) fat.</p>
<p>visceral fat cells act more like parasites, wrapping themselves around your intestines and getting first dibs on all the energy digested from your food.  After they take it the good stuff, whatever is left will be released to the rest of your body.  They also complain more vocally to your brain when they're not being fed, so they make you feel hungrier.  They're more closely associated with heart disease.  The only way to get rid of them is to starve them out, which won't happen until you've exhausted the rest of the energy supply in your body.  But starvation is exactly what they're for... getting you through the long dark hungry winters between seasonal harvests.  We have not evolved to account for the past 100 years of refrigeration and global food trade that keeps our pantries stocked with carbohydrates all year long... and frankly we're probably not going to since that kind of natural selection isn't going on before childbearing age.</p>
<p>You can't even really kill these visceral fat cells, they'll just continue to hang around and complain about being starved out.  You can control somewhat how new ones are made, though... stress hormones appear to trigger their production.  Which makes sense... if you're chronically stressed out about the health of your harvest, your body is going to make preparations to survive a long miserable winter.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, fad on/off diets cause a lot of this type of chronic stress.  So by dieting in feast/famine mode for a couple months at a time during and after holidays, you're just encouraging these visceral fat cells to do exactly what they're good at doing.</p></div>		</li>
