<p>Chewing gum has made me ponder the voluntary/involuntary actions going on when I chew and eat food.   I don't have to think about not swallowing my gum, however, if I'm eating something like a cracker, I have to make a conscious effort to chew beyond a certain point.  </p>
<p>So is there a part of the brain that judges, based on amount and texture of food, how long to chew it and when to swallow?  I'm guessing there's something about chewing gum (texture?) that tells this part of the brain &quot;not ready to swallow, chew it some more&quot;.   Is that about right?   I've tried to swallow chewing gum and it feels like my tongue &amp; throat muscles are strongly rebelling. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It probably has something to do with the texture and the cohesiveness of the food. In my experience, the food you chew gets cut up and mixed with saliva. That saliva-food mix is what travels down your throat.</p>
<p>With chewing gum, it doesn't dissolve or cut up. This means that it can't mix with saliva properly and thus, the saliva-food mixture can't travel down your throat.</p></div>		</li>
