			<div class="markdown"><p>You need an inhuman amount of salt to raise the boiling point by a few degrees. Adding salt to cook your food quicker is bullshit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah seriously. I was always told that adding salt would get the pot of water boiling sooner, but now I feel like I've been tricked into doing it because it secretly makes food taste better.   </p>
<p>I guess I'm not complaining, I just feel stupid. </p>
<p>My mind just kind of assumed that the salt acted as a vapor catalyst point or something? I guess I like to think I understand chemistry more than I actually do.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes the pasta cook at a higher temperature, so it will take slightly less time overall.  Ever notice some packages say to cook longer at higher elevations?  It's because water boils at a slightly lower temperature at higher elevation (lower pressure) so there is less heat and it takes longer to cook the pasta.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I apologise if the question sounds a little stupid, but how is the vapour pressure of water, at say 25Â°C, more than 1 kPa? Do some of the molecules already possess enough energy to exist in a vapour state at that temperature itself? Another question, how/why does the vapour pressure being equal to the atm. pressure initiate boiling? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not stupid at all.  The vapor pressure of water at 25C is just over 3 kPa.  However, some of the molecules will have enough energy to spontaneously undergo a phase transition from liquid to gas.  This is evaporation, and will always favor the direction of water to atmosphere, until the humidity is 100%, at which point equilibrium will occur and the rate of transfer will be the same in both directions.</p>
<p>Your second question is great.  Boiling is not necessarily a temperature thing.  It also has to do with pressure.  If you put liquid water under a vacuum, it will &quot;boil&quot; at room temperature.  If you increase pressure, you have to increase temperature needed to boil.  When the vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure, the water molecules are able to undergo phase transition more easily and rapidly because those pressures are the same.  So the water molecules can go to the gaseous state, which has a much greater volume than the liquid state.  So bubbles form and the liquid boils as vaporization occurs.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		</li>
