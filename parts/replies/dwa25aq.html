			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a subject of extremely intense controversy in the dental community. </p>

<p>So far it's never really been shown to be majorly dangerous in a relatively long period of use in many people with many studies. </p>
<p>This doesn't prove it's entirely safe but does prove that whatever amount of unsafety it may have is pretty limited in scope or some smoking gun issues would have been found already. </p>
<p>That's about the best you can do sometimes in science. Because it's difficult or impossible to prove a negative, but you can place boundaries on a positive over time with diligent effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no particular insight. They do release a measurable amount of vapor, some of which gets absorbed. There's a lot of research and it seems (based on googling around for an hour or so) that the consensus is they're safe for most people in most situations. The dental industry also contributes significantly to environmental mercury pollution. Personally I'd probably choose against amalgam unless it was greatly superior to the alternatives in a given application.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thing is the current &quot;plastics&quot; based fillings also contain controversial chemicals. So i wouldn't say there are much better in that regard. of course the color matching your teeth is kind of a strong selling point.</p></div>		</li>
