			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually sitting in the doctor's office right now waiting for a hearing test because my right ear has had a persistent ringing sound for weeks. I'm hoping it's something that will pass and not hearing loss or tinnitus. I don't have any special insight into this. It was just odd to see this Reddit post while waiting here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. It looks like I've got some hearing loss in my right ear that could be causing the persistent ringing. I'll need to meet with the doctor to figure out if this means anything beyond I'm just getting older and how to address it.</p></div>		</li>

I don't think what OP is describing is permanent ringing. </p></div>		</li>
