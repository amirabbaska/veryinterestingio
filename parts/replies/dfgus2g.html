<p>specialist high schools with the industry where they basically train their employees from day one.</p>

<p>To add to that specific point: if you want to go into the trades in Germany, you apply for an apprenticeship (<em>Lehre</em>). This means that half of your two- or three-year apprenticeship is spent in the company where you're employed and the other half at school (<em>Berufsschule</em>, vocation school).<br />
In school, you have mandatory subjects like German, history, sports, ethics/religion, civics etc and some pertaining to your chosen profession, i.e. a hairdresser might learn some chemistry as applies to hairdressing, and if you want to become a car mechanic, you'll have lessons on engine physics.</p>
<p>Of course, most students (like students anywhere) are interested in some subjects and not in others. The German system is no guarantee for turning out butcher shop employees (Fleischfachverkäufer) who are super-aware of history and civics. But it's a start.</p></div>		</li>
