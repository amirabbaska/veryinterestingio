			<div class="markdown"><p>I was reading your post with hope until that second to last sentence! Why can't this happen today?</p>
<p>A partly know why and was being rhetorical. I was out house hunting and found a gorgeous two bedroom loft for $170,000. I asked the realtor if the price had come down and he said the price had actually gone up....for a house with a damaged foundation! I look around and see houses that are overpriced and there are at least 10 other offers waiting in front of my low baller figure. And the real kicker is I work for a state government in a well paid position but the salary has staid the exact same since 1994 (When I inherited my new office I opened the desk and found old paystubs from my recently retired colleague). My wife works with elderly people but doesn't make more than $1000 a month and we are paying $3200 a year in insurance premiums for her. We don't have kids and I feel our reticence is partly due to the monthly struggle to pay bills and ever increasing rent and food costs. </p>
<p>Sorry for the downer....I'm actually a pretty happy person that examines my life closely. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this a rhetorical question? Where in the US do you hope to buy a house, and then sell it for 4x the purchase price in ~10 years?</p>
<p>The only thing that Boomers had working against them in this respect, and that homeowners today have in their favor is interest rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but interest rates and real estate prices are generally speaking inversely correlated. So buyers 30 years ago paid more interest but the steady decline in interest rates since then acted to increase their home values, ultimately increasing their equity, and giving them the opportunity to climb the property ladder or refi at steadily decreasing borrowing costs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Darn tootin'. My parentsdesigned, built, and flipped houses all through university in the 80's. My dad was simultaneously an amateur architect, a dentistry student and an interior designer. They now live in a damned nice house, with a seriously good lifestyle. They were raised in low-income families of the time (in the 50's and 60's), yet managed to pull this off. Now, there's me. I'm in a high income (two doctors) family with a buttload of money set aside for university and living during university, but I couldn't afford the shittiest little box of a house. I can barely rent a good apartment on the seriously substantial budget my parents have been amazing enough to provide me. I'll note that my parents were doing this in Vancouver, BC. During university they lived in a waterfront home, though I'm sure they're kicking themselves for not holding onto that one and selling it now for more than what their net worth is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but you can't even buy a house to live in any more where I live. It costs half a million to get a run down home on no land even remotely close to the city, once you're within the city you're looking at a million or more. My parents bought the land their house is on for about twenty-five grand back in 1989, with the house it's now worth over three million. My dad had no intention of building that place to get rich but because of the absurd housing bubble in Vancouver, he could retire any day he wants to now. To say that there is lots of room for self employment is fine, but I wasn't even talking about that. I was talking about a housing market that was accessible to people who were raised in low-income families. Now I, having been raised in a mid- to high-income family, can't even afford a house, and likely never will be able to, despite the fact that my dad, who worked in a rail yard in the 70's, was able to buy a house with money just from that job. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, if you lost a job on Friday in the 80s there was a good chance you could start your new job by Monday. So if you quit, got screwed, or lost your job due to illness you wouldn't have to exhaust your savings. Nowadays it could be a month or more before you get your first interview.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a frequently repeated myth.  The current unemployment rate is 4.7%. It was NEVER that low during the decade of the 80s. It never was that low from October 1973 until September of 1997.   Finding a job sucks now, but it was pretty sucky back in the 80s too.  There's a lot of stuff wrong with the economy now, especially at the entry level, but finding a job in the 80s wasn't that easy.</p></div>		</li>
