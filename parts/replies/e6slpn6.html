			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried to blur the line between being awake and asleep when I first joined the Marine Corps. I was able to get a sort of restful nap while standing post with my eyes closed, but I was still able to wake up when people approached. While in mechanics school I fell asleep with my eyes open on a Sunday afternoon. It freaked my roommates out.</p>
<p>This mastery of sleep has been fairly useful to me even years later. I can sleep when needed and I always wake up if I hear a noise that could be a potential threat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried to zone out and relax as much as possible while doing things like standing post. It took a while, but it helps when you're doing physically demanding work all day and sleeping for 2 to 3 hours.</p>
<p>Sort of like meditation except the point is to rest.</p></div>		</li>
