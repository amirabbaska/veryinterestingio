			<div class="markdown"><p>They are getting taller,  but if I remember correctly everest is very close to the theoretical maximum height of a mountain on planet earth. Despite the fact that the plates are being pushed together and making it larger, the mass of a mountain eventually becomes so large that it's own gravity pulls it back into the earth and it sinks into the mantle. This phenomenon  gives earth (and every other planet) a maximum height any mountain can be as a function of its gravity and the structure of its crust.</p>
<p>I don't remember the exact formula offhand but you can use the same function to determine the maximum height of a mountain on mars, and it's almost the same size as olympus mons. </p></div>		</li>
