			<div class="markdown"><p>I should point out, one exception to the cold feet/cold body relationship you're describing is when there are circulation problems- sometimes feet are cold (and or numb) because not enough blood is getting to them. This can abruptly turn from mere discomfort to a very serious problem very quickly if you have some kind of progressive circulation problem, like arterial disease or diabetes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you have cold feet, it's because your body is colder than it wants to be, not because your feet themselves are cold. </p>

<p>You just said if you have cold feet it's not because your feet are cold.</p>
<p>Yes it is.  Touch them.  They're cold. </p>
<p>Your body may be restricting blood flow to them in order to preserve core heat, but your feet are, in fact, cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The feet are cold to the touch because there is no/less blood going to them to keep them warm. They are not cold because the environment is making them cold, but because your brain is telling your blood vessels to stop trying to keep them warm and instead focus on the organs that are important. That is the distinction that OP was making.   </p></div>		</li>

<p>Thats how the environment is making them cold!  Its the environment removing heat, not the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not impossible to have cold feet and a warm body. I have extremely low blood pressure and my feet are freezing cold a lot of times. I will have 6 blankets on top of me, 4 sweaters, 2 pairs of pants, I'll be way too hot to fall asleep and my feet will be so cold it hurts. Doesn't matter how many pair of socks I put on, wool or cotton. Only a hot water bottle on the feet helps. </p></div>		</li>
