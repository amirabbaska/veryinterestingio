			<div class="markdown"><p>So this is a phenomena I have only noticed in modern, aerodynamic cars. My old classic (and a few 80s beaters) could have one window open no problem, is that to do with its worse aerodynamics and poor sealing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure. Without being able to compare, I couldn't say for sure, but the poor sealing is an unlikely candidate in my mind. The 90s is when boxy car shapes started falling out of favor and the more rounded and aerodynamic shapes changing the way air flows around the sides instead of a scattering effect from a flatter leading surface could explain things. I couldn't say definitively either way, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fairness I've never noticed it at all. I've never felt the need to have a window open at high speed. Don't pretty much all cars have AC these days?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah I see. So your ear has 3 compartments. Outter, middle and inner. The middle ear is connected to your nasopharynx through what is called the eustachian tube aka pharyngotympanic tube. The purpose of this tube is to equalise your middle ear with the atmospheric air pressure (blockages of this tube causes what is called glue ear)</p>
<p>The outer ear is seperated from your middle ear by the ear drum (tympanic membrane). Hold your nose and blow, what you get happening here is the air pressure of your nasopharynx rise, and as a result the pressure in the middle ear (because its linked to the nasopharynx via the eustachian tube) rises. Because this air pressure rises more than intended you get that funny pop and &quot;pressurised sound&quot; (for several reasons I can think of, none which I am 100% sure of).</p>
<p>Now if you have constant fluctuations in air pressure your middle ear is constantly equilibrium with the changing atmospheric air pressure.</p>
<p>TLDR: middle ear changes air pressure along side atmospheric air pressure. So of atmospheric air pressure changes it also changes in your middle ear.</p>
<p>Just a second year in medical school. Feel free to correct anything I got wrong.</p>
