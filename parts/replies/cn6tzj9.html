			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientists speculate that Jupiter may have an iron core, but there's no way to know for sure since the only spacecraft we've sent there just fell into Jupiter until it was crushed under the it's pressure.  Saturn however, is less dense than water.  It would be able to literally float in a giant ocean of water, so you probably could fly right through it.  Not sure about Uranus.  Neptune however, is believed to have an active or large solid metal core as its temperature is hotter than what would be expected from a planet so far away from the sun.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The density of the entire planet as a whole is less than water, but it may have a highly dense core with the outer layers being less dense than the average.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sun is incapable of producing any element heavier than carbon in its core.  But that doesn't mean that other stars couldn't have produced iron in their core.  Any elements that are heavier than hydrogen, helium, and lithium are made from fusion in stars or from supernovae.  All the iron that exists and any element heavier the three i mentioned earlier is literally stardust.  Life came from stars.  The stars we see in the night sky were made from other stars and their material when they died.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the sun is massive enough to go beyond the carbon fusion stage.  Iron, which is the end point of stellar fusion (as fusing iron creates a net loss of energy), generally marks the end of stars large enough to end in novas or supernovas.  Ours isn't nearly big enough to have such a violent end.</p></div>		</li>
