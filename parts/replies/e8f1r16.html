<p>This is part of the reason stimulants are used to treat ADHD - to excite the parts of the brain that are doing a poor job creating the natural tunnel vision we all need to focus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>stops the part of you that's trying to move from doing what it wants.</p>
<p>the brain isn't like your desktop, it can do multiple things at once, and there are resources that can't be reallocated. the part of you that fidgets was never able to do math, and it never will be. but the part of you that's responsible for your attention <em>does</em> keep &quot;hearing&quot; the fidgety part say it wants to move, and then spending resources to prevent it. </p>
<p>it's like trying to shop with a child. you spend a bunch of energy keeping them out of trouble. if you just let them go run around in the play area, then you don't have to worry about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can balance on a bike while you're moving, right?</p>
<p>But what about when it's not? You fall over.</p>
<p>The human body is exactly the same - it's constantly making minute adjustments. If you stood completely still and someone came over and turned you into stone with a magic wand, you'd fall over.</p>
<p>When you're in deep thought, your brain has to shut out other processes - it has to stop the mind from wandering, it has to stop you from getting distracted, so it's making constant tiny adjustments to balance the mental load. There's constant sensory input. If you're jiggling your leg, then you're getting sensory input that isn't distracting while letting the body &quot;vent&quot; by doing its thing. It's like handing a dog a chew toy to stop it shredding up your shoes. Its letting the body follow natural urges in a way that doesn't distract you from the task you've set it.</p></div>		</li>
