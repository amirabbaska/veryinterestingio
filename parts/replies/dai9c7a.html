			<div class="markdown"><p>That also comes into my mind whenever I drive with my car, I could drive into someone else at any time. It freaks me out how I have to tell myself out loud to not turn to that other car. The freedom we have in our actions could easily turn out real bad, luckily our minds have the ability to stop ourselves lol otherwise I'd have already been dead several times</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did have an intrusive thought like this once, and acted upon it. It wasn't serious, however.</p>
<p>I was holding a cup of tea in my kitchen, and I suddenly had the overwhelming feeling of knowing that I could drop my cup at any time. After taking a few more sips trying to persuade myself not to do it, I entered a trance, stood and stared at the opposite wall, and let go of my cup.</p>
<p>There was a resounding smash and the tea went everywhere. My sister, who was in the room, just looked at me. I looked back. Now that the existential freedom was no longer unknown and scary, I greatly regretted dropping my cup.</p>
<p>I cleaned up the mess and made another cup of tea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense, I get these feelings too. But I also get these ideas and feelings of doing things which aren't mortally dangerous but socially dangerous i.e. I think about how bad it would be to run around naked at work. I kind of shutter at the consequences and put the thought away... following which I wonder if I'm a little crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you're not crazy, only more in tune with your existential freedom. The examples I used were a bit more extreme, but it can be about anything. A common phrase I hear is, &quot;Oh, I could never do that because I'm ___.&quot; I'm a girl, I'm Christian, I have self-respect, I have common sense, so on and so forth. Your wanting to run around naked sounds like one of these less extreme. The basis is that you are capable of doing those things, you simply choose not to. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've never gotten the feeling of wanting to jump. Whenever I'm near a cliff type deal I feel overwhelmingly like I'm going to be pushed or slip or something over the edge. It's 100% a fear for me, 0% an urge to jump.  </p>
