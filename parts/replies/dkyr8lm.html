			<div class="markdown"><p>So I have a question I can't sleep with a pillow I find it very uncomfortable, so about a year ago I started taking a blanket and bunching it up to put on top of my hands or my forarm to put my head on. And now every time I go back to a pillow it's such a difference in my sleep that I refuse to use one. Would that case spinal damage later in life? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it is important to know that everyone's bodies degenerate over time and pin-pointing what factors will impact that degeneration is hard given the number of confounding variables of large, long-term studies.    I dont think anyone can tell you definitively that using or not using a pillow will make you any more or less likely to have spinal pathology in the future.   I would say if you are particularly concerned or in any pain currently, I would seek out a medical professional as I do not intend to give any medical advice over reddit.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Unless you're sleeping on hard ground, or you have a stone bed, Its not a big deal for you. I'd you're sleeping supine (on your back), it's preferred to have no (or a thin) pillow (if you have breathing problems, please do use a pillow) . If you're sleeping sideways, then you need a pillow to maintain posture. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>babies do need a supporting surface (sheets, soft crib bottom).  They are more at risk since their head size is proportionally larger to their bodies.  Occipital pressure ulcers are most common in babies, neonates and young children.  <a href="http://ajcc.aacnjournals.org/content/24/4/342.full" target="_blank">http://ajcc.aacnjournals.org/content/24/4/342.full</a>  (babies dont use pillows for risk of turning over and suffocating)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it weird that I sometimes prefer sleeping with no pillow at all or just a double folded towel?</p>
<p>And I've been wanting to ask this for a while, after a car accident a few weeks ago I found laying down straight with no support was hell on my back. Using a pillow under my back, flexing my abdominal muscle or stretching all the way out would reduce pain significantly. The pillow seemed to cause me to stretch out further as well.</p>
<p>I hit an oil spot or something else slippery on the road and made a mistake by trying to steer out of it and hit a tree head on going 70-80km/h. The back pain was gone within 3 weeks and I forgot to ask my therapist back then and it seems a bit odd to go back now.</p></div>		</li>
