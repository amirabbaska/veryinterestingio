			<div class="markdown"><p>The only cameras using active autofocus that come to mind would be phone cameras with laser autofocus. Could you please list some more?</p>
<p>I was under the impression that most cameras now used either phase or contrast detection, but I haven't really done much reading in this area.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I found that it seems that first reaction is about 1/5th of a second after the flash happens. Then it can take upwards of 1/2 a second for a significant portion of the pupil to be covered.</p>
<p>So the delay between the red eye reduction flash and the standard flash should be at least 1/2 a second. </p></div>		</li>
