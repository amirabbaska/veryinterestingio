			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there is some kind of sleep debt but it isn't fully understood. We also know that it isn't the only factor in feeling rested : When you sleep you repeat a cycle of different brain activity paterns. We believe that you will feel more or less tired depending on where you were in the cycle when you woke up. This would explain why naps can be heavenly good or make you feel like shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of, yes. It's sounds in line with insomnia to be honest. Many insomniacs &quot;crash&quot; and get a lot of sleep every so often, approx once a week. It also sounds like you have a shift work disorder given your crazy schedule and have reinforced a certain pattern over time. (Source: I work in a sleep clinic) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But its not insomnia. I hold a normal sleep schedule when I am not working. But when the season hits its game on. its hard to describe you will stay awake till you are loopy but you know your supposed to be up. Salmon trolling is worse when you got a 17 day season. You have to be either traveling or delivering in the dark (because that is when salmon don't bite) and you better trolling during the day to maximize profits. You don't have to sleep. Even if you want. its a mind set and once its over, your normal state reemerges and you have to &quot;catch-up&quot; on sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah I see what you mean. That's good you're able to get back to a normal schedule part of the year. It'a probably your saving grace, otherwise it would probably turn into insomnia(still is treatable). In your line of work you're really exercising your fight or flight mechanism. Kind of like someone at war. So that what's probably keeping you awake. And when you're sleep deprived and delirious it's kind of like being drunk, so don't necessarily trust your feeling of being fine after just a few hours of sleep. ;) Critical thinking greatly diminishes when sleep deprived.. so you might think of it as an investment to try and get a few more hours sleep. Best advice I can give is to try and move away from that schedule if you can, and if not then try looking into sleep hygiene information and see if there are things you can alter to get some more z's. I do understand how it might be unavoidable though, good luck. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First you have to figure out how bad yours is. Are you facing life changes due to lack of sleep? (failed relationships, being laid off, etc) If so, seek professional help. There's actually sleep therapy clinics that help you retrain yourself to sleep properly.</p>
<p>If it's not to that level, there's all sorts of factors you can monitor ranging from preparing a good sleeping quarters, to setting alarms to go to bed, as well as to wake up.</p>
<p>At first it's hard because your body is so used to staying up, but I promise it gets easier.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it true that many narcoleptics don't realize they have narcolepsy since they don't have the sudden loss of muscle control symptom that most people associate the disorder with?</p>
<p>I dream pretty soon after falling asleep, have had sleep paralysis ever so often, and I have unfixable daytime sleepiness despite a good sleep schedule. I heard this might mean I have narcolepsy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you have something going on but I don't think narcolepsy. There is a form that doesn't produce &quot;atonia&quot; but both forms are rare and it's commonly misunderstood. There's a daytime sleep test that can determine if you have it or not.  Personally I'd see a specialist and have an overnight study, it's important to know how your nights-rest is before ruling out sleep disorders like narcolepsy. Especially since you're getting enough hours at night, probably something about it is not as refreshing as it should be (more often than not). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be boring. I have seen a lot of shit most people haven't seen or can imagine. Ever hooked a blue whale with a trolling wire? ever gone up on the beach and had to be the one to jump off (not the captain) to swim a tow rope to another vessel to get you off? Ever lost power? Ever lost steering right of the beach? Ever dealt with flooding in the dead of night and only woke up because you knew &quot;something &quot; was wrong? I doubt it and I doubt most people could relate</p></div>		</li>
