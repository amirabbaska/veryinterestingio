			<div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: disageed, the heavy one will be the fastest. Let's make it numerical like in OPs example to see it. </p>
<p>You have the 1360 hp engine in the 1360 kg car
versus </p>
<p>the 1000 hp engine in a 1000 hp car.</p>
<p>Making some assumptions*, we can have a look at the force the motors are exerting on the vehicles. We disregard the conversions, and just call their exerted force 1360 Richards and 1000 Richards respectively.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You have this car with 1360 Richards on it weighing 1360 kg and </p>
<p>the car weighing with 1000 Richards weighing 1000 kg.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Newton's second law states F=m.a (force equals mass times acceleration), so a =  m/F, and the acceleration for both vehicles will be exactly the same. </p>
<p>In an ideal, friction-less world, that is.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In the real world though, you will have effects like for example air resistance. This will depend on the shape of the car and the speed it is going, but once again assuming that they have exactly the same built and are going at the same speed, then you will have a air resistance force acting on it like:</p>
<p>F_air_resistance =  100 Richards.</p>
<p>Now here this makes a difference. For the lighter car, 100 Richards on the 1000 Richards of the motor makes quite a difference (10% less force in total).</p>
<p>For the bigger car howevever, 100 Richards resistance is only 100/1360, 7,35% of the force lost.</p>
<p>This makes the difference and will make the heavier motor/heavier car go faster in similar conditions.</p>
<p>They have the same force-to-mass-ratio, but the heavier one will 'feel' air resistance relatively less than the smaller one.</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>This is the very same reason why two identical boxes but with different masses will fall at different speeds (heavier one hits the ground first). Their mass-to-acceleration is the same (gravity constant g), but the heavy one is less influenced by resistance than the lighter one.</p>
<hr />
<p>*Horsepower is a unit of power, which is a certain amount of force during a certain amount of time over a certain amount of distance (N.m/s). But lets us look at a specific distance and time, lets say comparing them for 1 second of thrust over 10 meters, then they will both exert the same ratio of force on the vehicle. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Assuming same shape in the cars (as you do with the boxes), and assuming the same acceleration neglecting air friction, you come to two different conclusions. In the first, the heavier will be slower, and in the second the heavier one will be faster. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for pointing this out, the heavy one will go faster, both on the boxes example as the cars. </p>
<p>I mistakenly copied the first sentence of the parent post, I was not really paying attention, I'm proving the opposite of course, heavy one with big engine faster. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the reason why you can't scale things exactly in a wind tunnel. It can be thought that the air molecules don't scale and thus they act differently on one object vs the other if they are scales of each other.</p></div>		</li>
