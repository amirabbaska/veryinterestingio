<p>vaping becomes a lifestyle of sorts. It's something a lot of people who begin vaping reaaaally get into.</p>

<p>Can confirm this. It turns an addiction into a hobby. I'm not sure that's such a good thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I vape, I have one friend who vapes. That friend also happens to run with a very pot-lifestyle drug-friendly sort of crew. Dude has certainly made a hobby out of it. It's nice to have someone to talk to about the stuff, and I definitely have a better vaping experience thanks to his knowledge, but damn. To me vaping is a supremely satisfying addiction that I try to be discreet about, it's crazy to me that people turn it into a lifestyle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought there was a study that showed the flavouring is the part that causes the most damage? The magnitude of the damaged varied between different flavourings?</p>
<p>Here is one relaible <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/news/heart-and-lungs/flavouring-found-in-e-cigarettes-linked-to-popcorn-lung/" target="_blank">source</a> of many.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This correct. Eating a Big Mac is one thing. But breathing in the flavors can be unhealthy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Also, while nicotine does work in place of a neurotransmitter and result in mad crazy physical dependence, I believe it's also been linked to improving memory and cognition / staving off altzeimers or dementia or something. I didn't actually think nicotine itself was that harmful in the dosages we inhale it (toxic by ingestion though). Still, no sources from me though. But some things to look up if interested. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would like to second this.  I am in an allied health profession and have been telling my friends for several years not to vape because of the potential for Bronchiolitis Obliterans.   They didn't believe me. Fox News has a recent article saying diacetyl, which causes Popcorn Workers Lung, is also found in e-juice.   <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=12&ved=0ahUKEwiXkd7E8aPWAhVCeSYKHQtwBlAQFgg6MAs&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fhealth%2F2017%2F07%2F20%2Fpopcorn-lung-are-people-who-vape-at-risk.amp.html&usg=AFQjCNFImukopPiFI4n5LuxI6A13SDzEdw" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=12&ved=0ahUKEwiXkd7E8aPWAhVCeSYKHQtwBlAQFgg6MAs&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fhealth%2F2017%2F07%2F20%2Fpopcorn-lung-are-people-who-vape-at-risk.amp.html&usg=AFQjCNFImukopPiFI4n5LuxI6A13SDzEdw</a></p>
<p>If you vape, please read about the symptoms.   This is one of the most devastating lung conditions you can have and has caused some to need lung transplants.   </p>
<p>Please don't vape. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not true at all. The flavorings are the worst part of vaping. We have no idea what heating and inhaling them is doing to our bodies. Nicotine has proven time and time again to be relatively harmless. </p>
<p>Please don't comment as an authority when you really don't know what you're talking about. </p></div>		</li>
