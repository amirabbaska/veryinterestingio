			<div class="markdown"><p>The converse of this is that we have no idea how loud we and our bodies are outside the frequency that we can hear. Judging by cats and dogs reaction to us, I'm going to guess <em>quite</em> loud.</p>
<p>One example of a man made object that is loud outside of our range of hearing are disc brakes. Disc brakes, when they squeel, are quite loud, but that's simply when a fluid gets on them to bring them into our range of hearing. They're probably that loud all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disk brakes also have a mechanism that is designed specifically to screech when the pad has worn past a certain point. Hearing that screech (under normal operating conditions that aren't wet) means you should think about replacing your pads. So if you aren't hearing that screech every time you brake and your mechanic suggests new brake pads, they may be being overzealous (though there are other reasons to replace pads).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>It's a change in materials, isn't it?I thought the bottom layer of material had a lower resonating frequency which aurally signalled edriver that it was brake time.</del></p>
<p>This is incorrect, apparently there is a piece that when it touches the disc it makes a loud noise and you know it's brake changing time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alternatively, if your mechanic is saying to switch break pads yet you don't hear the screech. It could mean what you say, or it could also mean that you've worn your disk too far where the mechanism no longer works. You can tell if it's past changing time because the disk itself has deep scratches on them.</p></div>		</li>
