			<div class="markdown"><p>How is that possible, my nails are so tough that I have press twice before my thumb or toenail cuts through. That's why I usually clip my nails just after sauna or hot shower so that they're softer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done this all my life and I'm the only one I know that does it, I don't know if my nails are just naturally soft but there is a bit of technique to it, you use the edge of the nail on the one you are trying to cut and sort of push just right into the &quot;grain&quot; and it separates, once you get good at it you can make it pretty much perfect so it nearly looks like its been clipped with a tool.</p>
<p>I've had people tell me that I can only do it because my nails are soft but I've never had a problem with broken nails and played sports and what not too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. There's no need to either bite them off or use tools. </p></div>		</li>
