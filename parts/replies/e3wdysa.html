			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a common misconception that space-exposed skin would reach &quot;interplanetary space temperature&quot;.</p>
<p>Vacuum is a great insulator, it reduces heat loss from conduction and convection to effectively zero. A human being in interstellar space would only lose heat via radiation.</p>
<p>Which happens to be exactly the same way that we lose heat on a clear night on Earth. <a href="https://misfitsarchitecture.com/2013/03/01/its-not-rocket-science-5-night-sky-radiant-cooling/" target="_blank">Night sky cooling</a> is entirely due to radiative heat loss to outer space.</p>
<p>So human skin exposed directly to the vacuum of space would be in trouble due to the vacuum, but would not experience a massive temperature drop. You'd feel roughly as cold as if you were outdoors on a clear night, with air temperature equal to skin temperature so that you're not losing heat to the air.</p>
<p>That's actually not very cold at all.</p>
<p>Objects like the Moon can reach extremely cold temperatures in shadowed areas because they have no internal heat generation, any heat they lose to space is gone forever. The human body constantly generates a significant amount of heat, so our shadowed side is never going to reach absurdly low temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think you're making a bit of a jump here. Just because the earth loses heat to the night sky via radiation does not mean that being on the ground during the night sky feels the same. The way you would feel is almost entirely dictated by the air around you. You do make the constraint &quot;with air temperature equal to skin temperature so that you're not losing heat to the air.&quot; But this just prevents you from losing heat completely. Anything you radiate to the sky will just be replaced by the conduction of heat from the air to your skin. You just don't ever get to feel that heat loss. So it's hard to put in context with anything we can experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are wrong because the tissue in your skin that surrounds your cold receptors would freeze. Your body may be heating your blood at 98.6 in your heart, but the IR emissivity of white paint, we can use that value, is like .91. As the blood moves through your body it loses heat to the skin, which you can essentially think of as an extended radiator. The tips of your fingers will not be the same temperature as your elbow. Which will not be the same temperature as your chest. Assuming your heart doesnt stop and your blood doesnt freeze (which is what would happen), you would have a massive temperature gradient across your body which would indeed activate the cold receptors in your body. The difficult part of this problem is that your body maintains your blood at a certain temperature, and it uses variable heat loads on your blood that are dependent on flowrate. Aka more work than I would do on paper. </p>
<p>Edit: I just realized you said the vacuum is an insulator. If that were true than spacecraft would all fry. You radiation to deep space in all directions that ate not facing an object, aka pretty much everywhere practically, and the temperature gradient across your body caused by freezing on one side and having the sun burn you on the other would kill you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partially right but flawed reasoning.</p>
<p>Mammalian heat generation is due to metabolism, so it happens everywhere. Blood evens things out, but it isn't the mechanism of distributing heat. Assuming a 2000 Calorie diet, that's roughly 100W of heat generation (assuming you're not moving). Radiative heat transfer is surface area dependent, so using q = σAT^4, with σ = 5.67x10^-8 W/K^4/m^2, A=2m^2, and T = 310K, that's roughly 1kW. The extremities will lose heat faster (surface area vs volume and all), but not that dramatically at first. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>True, but on Earth you lose about <a href="https://www.mottchildren.org/health-library/tw9037" target="_blank">65%</a> of heat through radiation, so the gradient would be less dramatic than it is on Earth. You'd lose body heat either way though, at which point hypothermia kicks in, blood flow is restricted to the extremities to conserve heat in the core, and your limbs cool even faster.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Vacuum is a <em>perfect</em> insulator for conduction and convection, but not for radiation. Because of the aforementioned area dependence of radiation, if you make radiators big enough, you can anything.</p>
<p>Edit: this assumes you're naked, breathing somehow, and in the shade. </p></div>		</li>
