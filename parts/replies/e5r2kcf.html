			<div class="markdown"><p>Would like to add on to this that breathing nitrogen(and other gases) at depth has effects ranging from tipsy, drunk, and hallucinating and dying depending on the depth you’re talking about. This is something scuba divers are taught about because even at ~70 feet you can start to feel mild effects of this. Like dcs it is highly variable to when and how severely it happens on a case by case basis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One interesting side-effect of nitrogen being the primary gas we breathe is that if you breathe pure nitrogen (ie with no oxygen), your lungs don't start burning. Over a couple of minutes, you just get giddy, slip into unconsciousness, and die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually that happens with any inert gas except CO2.  The burning, can't breathe feeling is not triggered from a lack of O2 but from a excess of CO2.  It's why confined spaces can be so dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add a little more to that yes atelectasis is more common in our patients who can’t tolerate being on less than 100% oxygen because the oxygen flushed out all of the N2. It’s  also
linked to blindness in premature infants. And it’s tricky to use on patients with chronic breathing disorders because they are used to having lower levels of O2 and could stop breathing with higher O2 usage </p></div>		</li>
