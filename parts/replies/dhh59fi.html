<p>Ask around Reddit. You'll find plenty of people who've learned complex words at early ages because....people tell kids words they maybe shouldn't be exposed to. People are weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The anterior insula is believed to be one of the major contributors to the ability to experience disgust as well as detecting disgust in others. It projects to the amygdala which is associated with fear conditioning, and I would assume an associated sympathetic response.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually fainting at the sight of blood affects a certain percentage of the population, I forget what. But it's not a matter of being squeamish as some people mistakenly think, it's a physical reaction like your other response said. </p>
<p>Growing up in a family of nurses, I had never experienced this first hand but years ago my husband sliced open his hand on glass. When he did it he held up his palm and said &quot;I feel weird&quot; and almost immediately fainted. Then he spent the next few minutes in a cold sweat while I cleaned it out and wrapped it up. This is from a man who is calm and unaffected by like every situation I would get stressed out in haha. Guess it's good I don't have that reaction to blood. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a friend of mine became pregnant one of the first symptoms she had that made her realise something was off was that she became incredibly squeamish at the sight of blood. If she saw a paper cut or any blood on tv even she'd run to the bathroom to throw up. </p>
<p>It made sense to think of the body becoming extra sensitive to things that can cause infection and illness in order to protect the baby by triggering that reflex, but it annoyed the hell out of her.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Fainting at the sight of blood is not really a disgust reaction <em>per se;</em> it causes your blood pressure to drop (reducing blood loss) and helps you play dead, which may have been a useful survival trait if you or your buddies were mauled by a dangerous creature.</p></div>		</li>
