			<div class="markdown"><p>Wing tip launcher rails are mini-pylons of sorts that are attached to the wingtips of an aircraft. Usually, they hold things like a short range Air to Air missile, like an AIM 9. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.f-16.net/g3/var/resizes/f-16-photos/album38/album71/album47/abj.jpg?m=1371915474" target="_blank">Here's one on an F-16</a></p>
<p>As far as to why an F/A-18 can't fly without wingtip launcher rails, I believe they are a permanent attachment to the wing. I can only assume though, never been near that specific airframe. </p>
<p>EDIT: Spelling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a huge vortex of turbulent air that's generated by a naked F18 wingtip that'll contact the top of the wing and ruin  aerodynamics of the aircraft, and the vortex trails for miles and ruin the air for every other airplane to the rear. The rails, or more ideally wingtip mounted missiles, will prevent cyclic airflow  at the wingtip and dampen the strength of the vortex.</p>
<p>Same idea, but to a lesser extent, for the winglets on airliners.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cyclic airflow isn’t “preventable”. Winglets actually support a pressure differential which results in induced thrust on the winglet and less induced drag over the wing. </p>
<p>A wingtp rail cannot support a pressure differential and thus cannot improve the wing’s characteristics the way that a winglet can. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aircraft are covered with things called 'vortex generators' that aren't really obvious. They generate vortices that 'wipe away' stagnant boundary layer air, reducing drag and increasing performance.</p>
<p>If you want to know what I mean by 'not really obvious', look at this:</p>

<p>See how the pylon doesn't quite meet the leading edge of the wing? That particular shape induces vortices on both sides of the pylon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern fighter aircraft employ a flight control computer that takes into account external stores, as well as internal fuel loads and distribution.  In other words, the aircraft knows what types of bombs and missiles are installed, where they are installed on the aircraft, and how much fuel is on board at various stages of flight.</p>
<p>The flight control computer assesses all of these parameters and governs the maneuverability so that the structural capability or controllable flight envelope of the aircraft is not exceeded.</p>
<p>For instance, consider an F-16 loaded with 2x 2000 bombs, 2x AIM-120 missiles, and 2x AIM-9 missiles, and ECM pod, Targeting Pod, and 2x external fuel tanks.  Near the time of take-off, the Flight Control Computer might limit the aircraft to maneuvers that impose 6.5 Gs on the airframe.  Later in the mission, lets suppose that the pilot has released his two bombs, and jettisoned his external fuel tanks.  Now the aircraft is much lighter, and the Flight Control Computer will allow the aircraft to perform maneuvers that may exceed 9 Gs.</p>
<p>In short, no matter how hard the pilot pulls on the stick, the Flight Control Computer typically allows only what is safe depending on the real-time configuration and condition of the aircraft.</p>
<p>In some circumstances over-G conditions can occur.  An over-G is an event where the airframe has been subject to G-forces that are beyond what is considered safe.  Massive structural damage can occur during an over-G, such as warped skin, or worse damaged bulkheads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The software that governs the flight control computer is pretty powerful.  It does not have any trouble keeping up with flight commands.</p>
<p>To answer your question if flight characteristics change due to an asymmetrical load configuration, such as if only one wingtip missile were present: the answer is yes, there is a measurable change, but it is so minute that it is imperceptible to the pilot.</p>
<p>What is more impactful than flight characteristics in an asymmetrical configuration is Center of Gravity (CG), and asymmetric stressors on the airframe.  Imagine if you have a 100 pound missile on the right wingtip, but no missile on the left wingtip.  That incurs a 100 pound difference in weight/mass balance.  Now pull an 8g turn.  That weight/mass imbalance is now 800 pounds.  Now calculate the moment of 800 pounds along the length of the wing to the point where it attaches to the center fuselage.  That calculation constitutes a strong asymmetric stress on the airframe and a very significant weight and balance distribution dynamic.</p>
<p>Aircraft are typically designed with a very forgiving CG envelope, so it is typically not a problem.  Especially in flight and at altitude.  Given enough airspeed and altitude, a pilot can recover from just about any deviation from the flight envelope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back during WWII, Italy had designed a heavy fighter/bomber called the Breda Ba.88 Lince. It was one of the fastest aircraft at the time, but it was tested before the Italians had loaded the armament on it. Once all the guns/bombs were equip it was extremely slow and overall a terrible aircraft.</p>
<p>The weight of the armament greatly affects performance.</p></div>		</li>
