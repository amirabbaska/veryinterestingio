			<div class="markdown"><p>Physician here. There's a phenomenon called &quot;Saturday night palsy&quot; where the radial nerve in your arm can get compressed (the classic story is the drunk passing out with their arm draped over a hard edge like a bench). This can cause a temporary neuropathy of the radial nerve leading to wrist drop (inability to extend the wrist). It's usually temporary, but in some cases it's severe enough that it has lasted weeks to months or can even be permanent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the lack of nervous stimulation. What happens is the compression of the nerve causes compression of the vasa nervorum (small blood vessels within the nerve sheath responsible for blood flow to the nerve itself). Once you compromise the blood supply of the nerve, you begin to compromise the nerve itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.  Yes, the cause is nerve impingement, not lack of blood flow.</p>
<p>No, it's not always &quot;no harm done.&quot;  Long-term nerve impingement can actually have nasty consequences for the use of the limb.  There have been cases where people only ever recover partial use or feeling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would depend highly on the positioning of the limb and how severe the impingement was; it's pretty hard to put a concrete timeline on it.  Notably, though, our bodies are pretty well wired to move or wake when things like this arise.  Most of the situations where permanent issues occur are due to being somehow incapacitated or held in place (passed out, pinned under something, etc.).</p></div>		</li>
