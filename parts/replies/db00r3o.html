			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most accurate answer. Simplest answer would be: &quot;Lasers and shit&quot; </p>
<p>Nothing gets started before the surveyors. Well, you could do general stuff like start digging for foundations or whatever based on the prints (because you can be a foot too wide with a footing and all it really impacts is the volume of concrete needed) but shit that needs to be exactly right (like curb face and property line related stuff) has to wait for those guys to stake it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Yes, there are managers. Yes, there are architects. Yes, there are general contractors, and men in the crafts and trades, and labororers. None of this answers the latter portion of OP's question:</p>
<p>&quot;... how do they get everything so accurate when it all begins as a pile of dirt and rocks?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Because surveyors measure the site with <em>extreme</em> accuracy.</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, extreme precision. On my current job we have a questionably accurate survey and it is making everything that much more complicated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. I was a surveyors assistant to my Dad. He made us re-shoot a survey for being tenths of an inch off over a mile stretch... Of course he may just be a precise bastard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a Union Dockbuilder who puts Piles in the ground for the foundation of bridges and buildings this comment is the best. Yes plenty of other people do plenty of work to plan and design and coordination the building of structures. But without the Surveyors nothing would come together to look like or function like the structures desired. Literally nothing. </p></div>		</li>
