			<div class="markdown"><p>This argument excludes the ocean from being a colloid, but not by any material properties of seawater.</p>
<p>If the corner of a uniform block of cream cheese (a colloid) is exposed to air and loses a small amount of water content to evaporation, then the block of cream cheese is no longer globally uniform. By this argument, the block of cream cheese is not a colloid, but certainly not because cream cheese as a material isn't colloidal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is yes, but wait, there's more:</p>
<p>There are 3 types of mixtures to consider here, solutions, colloids, and suspensions.</p>
<p>Solutions are mixed evenly at a molecular level. For example, salt in water dissolves so each Na and Cl ion are floating among the water molecules.</p>
<p>Suspensions are mixed, but not evenly. The suspended particles break up a little, but not down to single molecules. Dirt in water is an example of this. Microscopically the little dirt particles stay somewhat intact, and given enough time most of the particles in suspension will settle to the bottom.</p>
<p>Colloids are in between solution and suspension because the colloid particles are bigger than molecules, but they stay floating in the liquid. Milk is a good example because the milk fat, sugar, and proteins can be more than a molecule, but it doesn't separate out when you leave it alone.</p>
<p>Ocean water is a solution because it has sea salt and other ions completely dissolved  in it. It's also a suspension because it has dirt and other little particles floating around in it.  There are also particles (organic matter and tiny minerals) in the intermediate range that are not dissolved, but also won't settle out, so the ocean is also a colloid.</p>
<p>There might be some nuances I'm missing, like it's not a perfect mixture, so maybe we shouldn't call it any of those things, but then again nothing is a perfectly pure mixture, these are all just ideas we invented to help us understand how things act</p></div>		</li>
