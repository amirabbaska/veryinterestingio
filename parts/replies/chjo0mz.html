			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a really good and complicated question, and one which makes sense to ask. The answer is kind of unsatisfying in that it's pretty vague, but for one, it involves the evolutionary advantage of the caterpillar not having to compete with adults (butterflies) for food. Caterpillars eat leaves and butterflies eat nectar, so we can see the advantage in not having to compete with butterflies for resources. This explains the advantages of a species having a completely different form as children than adults. </p>
<p>The thing we do know is that some species of flying insects, including butterflies, have these highly organized groups of cells called imagineal cells that they develop while still in their larval stage (before they even become full-on caterpillars) that have all the necessary starting cells to one day become a butterfly. When they liquefy themselves, these groups of cells are what they keep, and they each become a different part of the butterfly- one becomes a wing, one becomes an antenna, etc. Some kinds of caterpillars even have fledgling wings and other flying insect parts under their skin, which can be seen in dissection. </p>
<p>But the answer to how this happened is incomplete as of yet, although there have been discoveries of insects in the fossil record that seem to show an in-between stage in the evolution of species that completely transform. The major hurdle to get over is the fact that we humans experience time in a very limited way, and we aren't used to fathoming the vast time scales involved in evolution. We tend to see things and fall victim to the logical fallacy of &quot;if I can't understand how this happened, it must not have happened,&quot; when we know that the imagination of humans, marvelous as it is, doesn't hold a candle to the natural wonders carved by the evolutionary forces of survival over hundreds of millions of years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome response, thank you very much! </p>
<p>I have a very curious mind; when I don't understand something, even though I know I can't know the full answer, I try to learn some popular opinions on the matter. I've studied philology so far in high school and will study Architectural Management in college starting this autumn. Having those in mind, I am fully aware that I cannot fully grasp the knowledge of some biology theories, but this particular question really baffles me. </p>
<p>I get what you are saying that the caterpillars don't compete with butterflies in terms of food, but that &quot;what happened in their evolution?&quot; question I find amazing. Basically, how did it happen that a &quot;worm&quot; ended up turning into a cocoon and then transforming into this beautiful flying insect? How did evolution come up with that? </p>
<p>This particular issue probably remains one of the very few evolution-related topics which remains unanswered to me. I find it fascinating how nature thought &quot;turning this insect into a completely different one at one point in it's life will give them both great chances of perpetuating the species&quot;. </p>
<p>Thank you again for your insightful response and please excuse any mistakes I have  made in my paragraphs, as English is my 3'rd language after Romanian and Slovak and I'm still learning. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a lot of evolutionary traits that seem to be an inefficient waste of energy or an unnecessary complex process are often just about gaining mobility to spread out your next generation as far as possible. </p>
<p>This has the advantage of having your next generation more likely find more food instead of depleting all local food.</p>
<p>A lot of flightless lifeforms gain the ability to glide, fly, jump further or get stickier just to spread out the next generation of colony a but further. Just because this is a significant evolutionary advantage over time against those lifeforms who did not get that ability.</p></div>		</li>
