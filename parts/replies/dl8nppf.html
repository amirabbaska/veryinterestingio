			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's... there's a lot to unpack, and when I asked the question, I was trying to simplify it. There's definitely more to get into just by trying to touch upon one element of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth mentioning here that the &quot;paradox&quot; of the Twin Paradox comes from the fact that there's no fixed reference point. That means that, while moving relative to each other at a high fraction of the speed of light, BOTH twins would each see the OTHER twin as aging more slowly than they are. But that seeming impossibility can be explained by the timing of the light travelling between them; their true relative ages can't be determined until one or both of them undergoes acceleration to bring them back into the same reference frame, and acceleration is <em>not</em> relative. So the choice of who does the accelerating is really what determines which twin ages how much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;It is not good to introduce the concept of the mass of a moving body for which no clear definition can be given. It is better to introduce no other mass concept than the ’rest mass’ m. Instead of introducing M it is better to mention the expression for the momentum and energy of a body in motion.&quot;</p>
