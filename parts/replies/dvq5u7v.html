<p>For the non-ELI5 phrasing: aromatic compounds tend to be cyclic, and cyclic molecules tend to be lipophilic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Most</em> seals are imperfect. Short of a vacuum sealed bag, a mason jar, or the fancy gasketed Pyrex, containers really just serve to keep food from drying out. You can smell fried cabbage, leftover taco meat, a cut red onion, etc. right through the plastic lol. You can mitigate it to a point by stretching plastic wrap over a container before you snap the lid on.</p>
<p>Another factor is oxidation. When you put food in a container, you're also putting air into that container. Oxygen reacts with leftovers to change the character of food as it sits. Oxidation is why guacamole turns brown and leftover bacon gets funky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why just aromatic compounds? Surely the smell is also due to aliphatic compounds, given that being aromatic doesn't necessarily mean it smells and not being aromatic doesn' necessarily mean doesn't smell</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah it seems a bit sketchy someone claiming to have a degree in chemistry thinks aromatic means the compound is smelly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume he was just using aromatic in the general sense. I guess he could have said volatile but people know the word aroma. Plus if you donâ€™t interact with other scientists regularly that nomenclature stuff goes right out the window</p></div>		</li>
