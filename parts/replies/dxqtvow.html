			<div class="markdown"><p>The main risk of &quot;overdosing&quot; on vitamin D is indirect - it causes an over-absorption of calcium, which can have negative effects (calcium being stored where it shouldn't be, blocking bloodblow, liver &amp; kidney damage, etc)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main symptoms of vitamin D overdose which are those of hypercalcemia including anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. These may be followed by polyuria, polydipsia, weakness, insomnia, nervousness, pruritus and ultimately renal failure. Furthermore, proteinuria, urinary casts, azotemia, and metastatic calcification (especially in the kidneys) may develop.[140] Other symptoms of vitamin D toxicity include mental retardation in young children, abnormal bone growth and formation, diarrhea, irritability, weight loss, and severe depression.[24][44]</p>

<p>Fucking hell. I wonder what the mechanism is there. Has this ever been demonstrated with d3 or just d2?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So 6 months ago I was given monthly pills of Vit D, can't remember how much was in them but I'm also taking a multivitamin that contains Vit D (only 5,000iu). Apparently my blood test showed that my Vit D level was actually <em>lower</em> despite the pills so I've been upped to a weekly dose of 40,000iu and told I can still take my multivitamin and I'll have another test in 6 weeks. That's a weekly dose of 70,000iu. Should I get a second opinion? It feels like a lot. </p>
<p>Edit: it's worth mentioning that I live in the UK and I'm mildly allergic to the sun anyway so I don't get much activation naturally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I recently learned this as I am taking a vitamin d supplement as well. It’s a fat soluble vitamin, so you have to make sure you are taking your vitamin d with a source of fat or it will not be absorbed by your body. I always take mine with meals now!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a doctor. This is common in my practice. Ive never really seen Vit D levels increase with supplementation. The body has a hard time absorbing it.
Either way, the normal level of Vit D is changing as our knowledge of whats normal changes. Also, supplementation has never been shown to improve osteoporosis, which is the general reason why we use it. Its also not harmful.
In rare cases, the lack of improvement of the Vit D level with supplementation can sometimes be the only symptom of celiac disease which causes malabsorption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My vitamin D levels were hysterically low last winter (it was in the single digits, I believe 6 or 7) and was prescribed Vitamin D2 50,000iu once weekly for 6 weeks, and then told to take a standard to take a daily supplement. I was never retested as it was assumed that this did the trick, and since pretty much everyone where I live is deficient anyway. We'll see if that's the case when the rickets sets it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't take more than 10,000 IU per day and you'll be fine. It's about the equivalent of 30 minutes of sunshine. Your body stops producing Vitamin D after this limit has been reached, so you will never overdose from the sun, but you can from eating supplements. Once you start reaching 50,000 IU per day is when organ failures start creeping up on you and it will only be a question of time before you die. </p>
<p>I take about 5000 IU per day, and I have haven't had a cold yet and my mood is better. I used to get colds once every two-three weeks, but I haven't gotten any now in six months since I started taking Vitamin D. I don't know, but I think my skin improved as well.</p></div>		</li>

No known dose for &quot;optimal health.&quot;  It's true about supplementation, HOWEVER.................lifeguards have almost 3x the &quot;minimum&quot; levels.  So, the sun may be more necessary for our health than we have been taught in the last 30 years (just like dietary fat!).</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's absolutely no comparison between taking two thirds of a million units via IM injection and taking the same dose orally. The bioavailability is completely different.</p>
