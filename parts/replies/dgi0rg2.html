			<div class="markdown"><p>Wool socks never give me this issue, just FYI. The top of my foot is pretty foresty and regular socks have always started rashing the top of my foot after 9-10 hour days, if I don't take them off immediately after a long day of walking then they get bad. </p>
<p>However, (real) wool socks don't ever bother me in this way. Not sure why, but it's awesome!</p></div>		</li>
