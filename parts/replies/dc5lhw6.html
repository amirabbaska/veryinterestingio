			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good response, but as a fellow ad-man, I'd like to highlight a somewhat concerning takeaway from this:  <em>we generally don't know if the adverts are working</em>. </p>
<p>And the reason for that, as /u/jonmds has highlighted, is because ATL ads don't really offer any solid metrics on performance.  A LOT of ads don't - even direct response marketing campaign is offering recognition value beyond the solid sales - but how much? </p>
<p>I always think of the Freakonomics anecdote they relate, it may have been in one of the books, I can't remember - where Steve Levitt is invited to a giant retailer to assess the value of their ad campaigns. </p>
<p>This retailer - probably a grocery chain - took out print ads in newspapers across the country.  Levitt found one instance where NO ads ran to a specific county - and that county had zero change in sales.  Therefore, he concluded in a report that the print ads were likely bringing either zero or negative ROI, and that they company should stop. </p>
<p>Despite that, the company promptly totally ignored him, and kept doing what they were doing - because it's <em>what they always had done</em>. </p>
<p>So why does Coke do TV spots?  Who in the entire world <em>hasn't</em> heard of Coke by now, anyway?  Well, they do it because Pepsi does, and because <em>that's what they always have done</em>.  Are they getting a positive ROI from their TV ad campaigns?  They don't really know - but what they do know, is that if they stop, Pepsi will keep going, and therefore be more visible than them.  So they keep going.</p>
<p>There's no question that all advertising is valuable - but unfortunately, we often have very little clue WHAT advertising is most valuable, or even how to calculate the sort of less-tangible &quot;brand recognition&quot; value that doesn't necessarily immediately drive sales, but causes a shift in public consciousness towards your brand that may pay off down the road. </p>
<p>As with anything else involving human behavior, advertising is tricky because people are unpredictable, fickle, and often difficult to extract meaningful information from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As another fellow ad man, I feel the statement that &quot;we generally don't know if the adverts are working.&quot;</p>
<p>It is true that we don't have the instantaneous, granular metrics available with digital. However, it is possible to correlate sales and advertising by geography and demo after the fact. Lower or pause advertising and you can save some bucks in the short-term, but long term sales will falter. </p>
<p>That is why Coke still advertises... if they don't, Coke sales will eventually drop off and the brand will falter.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Even Visa advertises!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the rise of DVRs? I feel like that has to make TV ads less valuable. All of ad-supported TV seems like a house of cards to me at this point. I watch a lot of TV, but very little of it is live anymore. I skip every ad. More and more people watch TV like that, especially as old people die off. They're going to be making less and less money off of ads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's too complicated to say &quot;digital has made TV ads less valuable&quot;.  On the one hand, obviously digital marketing has ballooned and challenged everything that was once familiar about advertising. </p>
<p>On the other hand, <em>a ton of people still watch TV</em>.  The demographics for this site, which tend to be heavily skewed towards middle to upper class white males between 18-34 with an above-average level of education are definitely <em>not</em> watching as much television as they once did.  And because of that, they tend to assume that <em>everyone</em> is consuming media in exactly the same way that they do. </p>
<p>But that is, and <em>is not</em>, the case.  Its both.  Some television spots have certainly gone <em>down</em>, while others, specifically those in prime spots durring events which people watch live as a sort of ritual (like the super bowl), have arguably gone <em>up</em>, because people tend to want to watch these things live, and you've filtered out easily distractible people who were never really likely to watch / pay attention to commercials anyway.  So you've done a bit of viewer distillation, which, while causing numbers to go <em>down</em>, tends to result in a higher quality per eyeballs viewing the ad. </p>
<p>To be successful in advertising, it is critical now, more than ever, to keep a close watch on every dollar.  It used to be simpler, and the bulk of the work was focused on content.  Now, content still needs to be as good, if not better, but marketers need to be hyper-focused on exactly where their ads are appearing.  </p>
<p>TV is still a good medium, but not as a blanket-space anymore.  You can't just throw money at the networks like before and get good results.  You need to negotiate packages that ensure your ads are running during programs and events with the  highest likelihood of success, during times of peak viewing, with an intense scrutiny on viewing demographics. </p>
<p>That also goes for digital; it becomes as useless unless you're paying close attention to, and managing, where your dollars go online.</p>
<p>In the future, say, 10 years down the road, I <em>do</em> think television as a medium will virtually cease to exist as we know it; but until then, TV ads are still very valuable, they just need to be more closely micromanaged.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a follow up question.</p>
<p>What's the point of ads on sites like YouTube, where you can usually skip the ad after five seconds? Sometimes the ad itself is short enough that it doesn't allow a skip, but Sony is running a PlayStation ad on there that's about 12 minutes long, and I don't see how that's viable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Digital marketer here. </p>
<p>YouTube has a really cool ad offering called TrueView. As an advertiser, I only actually pay for that ad spot if you watch 30 seconds or longer of my video advertisement, or to completion (whichever comes first). </p>
<p>If you click Skip after 5 seconds but I strategically got the bulk of my message across in those first 5 seconds - awesome for me! I just got a free ad and you still got the TL;DR of my message!</p>
<p>If you do watch more and I end up paying for it, still awesome for me! That (hopefully) means my ad was interesting enough to you to keep watching and because of that, it was probably even more impactful. It's a win-win. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to get irrationally annoyed when advertisers would put up ads that gave no relevant information in the first five seconds, which seemed really frequent when Youtube ads were new. By the time I skipped I didn't even know the company, or what the ad was for. Not that I wanted more info but I used to think, don't they know I'm only going to watch the first five seconds of this? Why don't they front load the information? I feel like they've gotten better at it though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this hilarious because the only times I've ever not skipped a YouTube ad that has a skip ad button is when it's a new Tai Lopez ad (because he's a giant meme). The only person who has paid to advertise to me on YouTube is the one whose products I will never actually buy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are usually just existing YouTube videos that get circulated by the uploader as advertisements on other videos. Like before, sometimes even getting the brand name in your head is enough for them, but I have had some instances where I'll stay on a YouTube ad even after the 5 seconds is up. If the service, message or product REALLY grabs my attention, I'll sit for it a little longer. YouTube advertisers don't seem to understand how to grab people in those five seconds, though, so most people just end up skipping. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some advertisers know the get their brand on screen in those 5 seconds at least.</p>
<p>Others.. I skip and I have no idea what <em>type</em> of product they're advertising, let alone what brand it was.  That seems like wasted money </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ad guy here. Honestly, that's probably poorly placed recycled content, which is surprising for PS who does great work normally. They probably bought that media space and didn't shoot or plan accordingly to fill it appropriately. I'm guessing it was website content they popped in because of shortened timelines or tight quarterly budget. It may seem simple to edit and reformat a spot to fit the media, but a lot of clients either don't fully get the need to do it or are strapped with time/cash to make it happen (everything in advertising is super expensive). Digital media placement is a little outside of my expertise, but for placement like that there's normally very specific guardrails you use; show brand, message, and benefits in the first five seconds. Geico pre-rolls are the best example of this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, it seems as if the newer generations, one's with the internet, are kind of avoiding ads and do actually care less. Do you, as someone in the field, feel like there will come a point when ads are going to become pointless/reach a plateau? Or do you think they'll evolve in some way?   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a simple answer, but it's correct! Advertising is evolving faster than ever, and that evolution is still accelerating even now. I couldn't tell you all the forms of advertising that have appeared in the last 10 years (and I wouldn't, it's my job to keep them secret from the public), not to mention all the ways of targeting advertisements. Would you believe me if I told you that, with just your IP address, I could tell you all your hobbies and interests, all the purchases you're thinking of making, everything you've bought in the last 5 years, the brands you like and the ones you don't, your age, sex, location, ethnicity and even your height and weight, all in under a second? Such is the power of advertising today. So I'm not worried. If there is a plateau, it's a long way away. Certain forms of advertising, including TV, may fade into obscurity, but just imagine when we start putting ads on Netflix!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I mean, if you're at the store and you Spaghetti XYZs^^^TM, which costs about $5.10 and its competition, Spaghetti YZZ for $4.85 and then finally Spagetti - no name brand, $3.50, you're probably going to think 'well, I saw a commercial for XYZ, which means enough other people like it enough for them to run a commercial. Probably a good brand. YZZ is cheaper, but also you don't know it exists, so it's probably worse. No brand super cheap food? Probably not very good but at least it's cheap! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a real answer but I think think it will become subtle and subjective. Here in Germany in the Bundestag too many people pissed near the edges and that stuff apparently went everywhere. Someone came up and put a target sign right in the middle where the splash is minimized and reduced the &quot;spray&quot; from people by 80% and no one really knew how that target came to be there although the answer is easy when you know it. Or Berlin train station had massive problems with people smoking in there. Signs saying that this is a no smoking area didn't do much. But signs telling them where the next smoking area is made a huge difference.</p>
<p>We figure out how we tick more and more. I fear what's to come tbh. :P</p></div>		</li>
