			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes a lot of sense.  Thank you.  I realize it wasn't a matter of the colors not existing, but maybe a limitation of the tech at the time.  I also don't recall seeing any photos or print containing neon colors pre 80's</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not surprised you haven't seen much neon in pre 80s photos since neon wasn't terribly popular in the 60s and 70s when color photography became really common. Also neon colors tend to fade, particularly over decades so any printed materials are going to look more washed out than when they were new.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wait untill we start seeing that SUPER BLACK and SUPER PINK colors in real life. I guess viewing them on a computer screen, the screen can't show you how dark or how pink the color actually is. It's much more vibrant in person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While generally correct, your commentary overlooks the contributions of Day-Glo Color Corp. who developed mass-produced, stable florescent paints for consumer goods and litho/printing.  Their invention and production of these pigments for advertising in the 1950's was specifically responsible for the subsequent explosion of fluorescent colours in adverts and consumer goods.  In fact Day-Glo's pigments are so stable, you can even tell looking at vintage toys and prints today which are Day-Glo and which were a knockoff or close-to pigment, which have faded over the years.</p></div>		</li>
