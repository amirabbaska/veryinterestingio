<p>You can't sense that either. You only sense temperature flow</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Proportional yes, but also dependent on the material's specific heat or basically how easy it is to change its temperature. This is why 70 degree water feels much colder than 70 degree air. The water is absorbing more heat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat flow is proportional to the temperature difference <em>times the conductivity</em>. That's why metal that is slightly cooler than your skin feels really cold, and why metal slightly hotter than your skin feels really hot, whereas plastic at those same temperatures would feel slightly cool and slightly warm in contrast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a more technical level, could it be said that its not the flow we feel, but the heat in our body caused by that flow? I get the whole idea about how we can touch hot things and not feel the heat due to low flow rate, but I also can't imagine our heat sensors actually detect the flow of heat, but instead the change in heat around them caused by the flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You bring up a good point! They sense the change in local temperature due to the heat flow, so the total perceived sensation of cold or hot in an area is due to how much heat is flowing, so I said that we sense the flow of heat. That's at the human level. On the cellular level yes, they are detecting changes in temperature and then our brain integrates the signals to figure out the heat flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Insulating objects cause heat to get &quot;backed up&quot; and you eventually feel warm. Conductive objects just need to be a little warmer or a little cooler and heat is rushing into or out of you.</p></div>		</li>
