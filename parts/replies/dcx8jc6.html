			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely so. Certain organisms can also see UV and Infrared. It's just that we've evolved to be specifically sensitive to a very small range of the spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not quite so straightforward. Not only is the visible spectrum a range of wavelengths that are strongly emitted by the sun, it's also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum#/media/File:Atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg" target="_blank">what the atmosphere transmits</a>.</p>
<p>Shorter wavelengths (ultraviolet and down) are blocked by scattering in the atmosphere, which is convenient since they damage to our cells and DNA. Most of the infrared spectrum is absorbed by atmosphere gasses. Even longer wavelengths are transmitted, and are used for radio and telecommunications, but the long (&gt; several centimeters) wavelength would make it useless for sight. If the sun had a significantly lower surface temperature our best bet would be the ~10 μm near infrared window. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. The atmosphere is only transparent to a certain spectrum, including some a bit above and below the visible spectrum. In addition, radio waves can move relatively unhindered. Take away visible light, and the atmospheric transmittance is moot, hence the various blind cave species. But if the sun mostly emitted short UV rays, then sight would be less important, because it would be difficult to see long distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We get lots of different kinds of light, including ultraviolet. Visible light is an incredibly narrow part of the whole spectrum of possible energies — i.e., wavelengths — of light. If the whole spectrum is the history of western civilization from AD 1000 to the present, the visible spectrum is the fifteen minutes after lunch on the third day of the sack of Constantinople. But it's an important invisibly tiny slice of the spectrum, because it happens to be the part where the wavelength of light is more-or-less close to the size of molecules that are typically found in living things. Some spiders can sense UV light and snakes infrared, but it has more to do with inherent nature of carbon bonding than the wavelength of light from the sun. So the answer to both questions is no.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there is an expected amount of time for a random photon to reach the surface (I think I get understand this from /u/RobusEtCeleritas's video), but &quot;No light goes from the core to the surface&quot;.  </p>
<p>Why come up with the expected amount of time for something that doesn't happen?  What absorbs the large amount of UV light from the core before it can reach the surface?  Do you mean that probability of the random walker situation dictates that we're likely to get photons from near the surface, or something else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can calculate the average time it takes, it's very long. Don't take the analogy with the video too far, because a random walk in a 2D plane and a random walk in a 3D sphere are different. You can actually show that on average the object in an infinite 2D plane eventually always returns to the center. In 3D this is not the case. Maybe there's a YouTube video somewhere about a random walk in 3D spherical coordinates.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That makes no sense.  Unless there is some sort of constraining &quot;mechanism&quot;, if an object can random walk there, it can random walk back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really happen because there is no way of distinguishing photons. There is no universal way to tell the age of a photon and there is certainly no way of tracking an individual photon as it travels. At the quantum-mechanical scale, photons are just little discrete, particles of momentum that bounce around. This shouldn't be used to describe Thomson scattering.</p>
<p>Instead, think of photons as quantum states of the electric field. Which dispenses rather neatly with the question of how an electron can just emit and absorb photons. In that view, photons aren't things. They aren't objects. They're just states of the field of which the electrons at the core is a source. That should make understanding Thomson scattering and the time it takes for photons to move from the core to the surface much easier.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is also why the sun mostly emits visible light, because near the surface, the sun is only a few thousand degrees.</p>

<p>So is this why electric light colour temperature  is given as a few thousand Kelvin?</p></div>		</li>
