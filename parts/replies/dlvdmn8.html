			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m almost certain that people attempt to slap flies with way more force than is required in order to do it quickly. They end up telegraphing their movement too much and move <em>way</em> more air than they need to. I’d bet that the latter is probably why they miss more than anything else though seeing as how the flies are well versed in air movement. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Changing air pressure. That's why fly swatters are effective. They allow the air to pass through, instead of creating a pressure wave with a cupped hand. Fly's have tiny hairs on their bodies that sense changing air pressure, along with changing light patterns from your hands casted shadow that trigger a chemical response to that event. It's not thinking &quot;Oh shit here comes giant hand monster&quot; it's just reacting as biology has instructed it to. Insects don't posses the interpretive media to comprehend danger in the sense of learned experiences. Just an automated response intended to further species reproduction. &quot;wings do this when the air does this. No splat. Make babies later.. Hey, look!  babies do that cool wing when the hand thing comes too!&quot; and so goes evolution. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have tried slapping flies at various speeds and haven't found that slower speeds work better. I think you're really better off just doing it extremely fast (like your life depends on it), if it's not perched on a delicate surface.</p>
<p>I've actually found that the best strategy (taking a cue from fly swatters) is to spread your fingers out and strike quickly, bringing your fingers together just before they meet the wall. Works for me the vast majority of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably in part. Flies are very sensitive to movement of air around them. It's hard to swat a fly with a flat object that pushes the air around it, but if you use an object like a fly swatter that has holes and reduces it's effect on air flies are far easier to swat. I reckon in this case there is a large reflexive component as well as heightened time perception.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, the dodging behavior of a fly is a reflex (i.e. a direct or near-direct  oculo-muscular activation stimulated by something suddenly beginning to expand in the field of view), and not a conscious process, if anything in a brain so tiny can even be considered &quot;conscious&quot; to begin with.</p>
<p>These sorts of reflexes exist in humans, too. For example, your eyelids fly shut when something suddenly appears to be flying into them, like a bug. Ever ride your bike when suddenly your eye is closed and there's a gnat caught between your eyelashes? That wasn't a conscious decision by your brain (even though in hindsight it might seem that way), that was a reflex from visual ganglia that directly innervate your eyelids so they can react quickly to these sorts of things. </p>
<p>As an aside, the same thing goes with visual target tracking—your eyes can follow something in motion with an absurd amount of precision, even if you're moving your own head too, owing to direct innervation of your eye muscles by low-level visual + vestibular neurons (the ones in your ears that measure head motion). Your conscious brain would be too slow at this. This is also why your eyes can remain fixed on a position even if they're closed—they can stabilize against head motion and remain pointed somewhere specific (like on the position of running prey) even if you have to close your eyes briefly (to run through some branches). Try this yourself if you want: look out the window at a tree, then close your eyes and while still &quot;looking&quot; where it is, shake and nod your head quickly for 2-4 seconds and then reopen them. Maybe even jump once or twice. Your eyes will still be pointing right at it when you reopen them. Now try this again except moving your head very slowly (i.e. too slowly for vestibular system to sense), and you'll notice that you do a poorer job of keeping the position steady than before—you might have to dart your eyes back over to lock onto it again. </p>
<p>Anyways, examples aside, responses that happen <em>that</em> quickly are reflexes. They have to be; processing the sensory stimulus consciously to make a case-by-case decision would take too long, so a reflex instead directly wires a specific response to a given stimulus that is &quot;good enough&quot; for the vast majority of scenarios. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>humans have the ability to change their metabolic rate depending on their diet and lifestyle, does that mean we have the ability to change our perception of time. Also building off that idea do you think we perceive some days as faster than others because our metabolism is faster that day compared to what it usually is?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This seems to be consistent with the idea of metabolism impacting time perception given metabolism should be faster with higher body temperature.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's talking about the <em>resolution</em> of time perception....but do we really have any way of knowing that other animals perceive the <em>passage</em> of time differently?</p>
<p>By that I mean, sure a fly may be able to distinguish one millisecond from the next (while we can't), but does a minute feel as long for a fly as it feels for humans?</p>
<p>I'm not even sure this is a valid question. We have no way of knowing if a minute feels the same for different humans.....let alone different species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a question fundamentally about qualia that cannot be answered without a more technical definition of &quot;perceive&quot; that probably clashes* with what OP is aiming for. As is we can't even say for certain that any two humans perceive the passage of time at the same rate.</p>
<p>Also how exactly does OP expect passage of time be measured? Seconds per second? I would argue that this here renders OP's question not only unanswerable but nonsensical under conventional terms. (Or renders the answer an obvious &quot;yes&quot; as each thing in existence experiences one second per second). Factor in the non-simultaneity issues from relativity and you have a huge clusterfuck.</p>
<hr />
<p>* for instance the root comment here, while actually answering a broader question about temporal perception and not exactly the &quot;rate&quot;, still makes a highly dubious assumption: that <em>sight</em> is the sense that governs our perception of time. Aside from that I'd say his answer probably handles the issue of the definition of &quot;perceive&quot; the best, offloading &quot;rate of passage of time&quot; to &quot;resolution of input&quot;.      </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that sight doesn't govern perception of time, but it's the easiest to test. The &quot;subjective environment&quot; which is the sum total of the sensory perception input into the nervous system would determine the perception of time with a hard limit being the speed of transmission along the neurons. </p>
<p>Thank you for your comments, I appreciate it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well really we can not possibly know what it's like to differentiate between milliseconds so the only way to represent that in our heads is by using slow motion as an analogue. Its like high speed cameras, they capture video at many frames per second and we slow the footage down so we can see that.</p></div>		</li>
