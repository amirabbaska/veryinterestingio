			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there no way you can caption it in a way that brings up the context correctly?</p>
<p>This feels morally wrong to me.  Fuck the rules, I wouldn't actively participate in defrauding someone because a piece of paper says I have to.  I would try to keep my job, but I'd try to make it clear from the context if I could.  I mean, seriously.  &quot;I need the money sent Western Union&quot;, the caller says scammily.</p>
<p>&quot;This is Rachel from credit card services&quot;, a robot voice says.</p>
<p>Can you at LEAST tell the recipient qualities about the voice of the call without breaking the rules?  A deaf person cannot hear that a voice sounds robotic or is clearly a recording.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, we do! Part of the job is telling the customer whether they are talking to a live person, a new caller, or an automated one. For example, if we can tell that the call is pre-recorded or they're talking to menu options, we add (Automated Voice) before captioning. And if it switches to a real person, we add (New Voice). Most of the time the customer looks at the phone and catches on quickly that they're dealing with a machine but there are some people who don't look at the screen at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>FCC regulations clearly defines that we have no business intentionally altering the conversation to alert the poor old biddy that gets drawn in to these kinds of things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone needs a class action lawsuit against the FCC for allowing this.  It sounds like some ADA violation.</p>
<p>The Federal Government is assisting in scamming the handicapped.</p>
<p>If someone calls to threaten their life, demand a ransom the FCC says that translators can't report crimes? That's INSANE.</p>
<p>That's unethical. But totally American in every way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a crime within the past 10 years involving a man who called a Video Relay Service (uses interpreters to connect Deaf and Hard of Hearing people with people that can hear, sort of like facetime) to call the police, and told the Interpreter &quot;I killed my wife&quot;. It was sticky but I think the interpretation was legally protected because of wiretapping laws. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So here's the thing we're taught at this job. We're not NSA and talking about specific phone conversations or altering captioning content infringes on FCC requirements for captioning and the right to customer privacy. The customer needs to feel that whenever they're on the phone they can trust their live interpreter to translate what they can't hear as accurately as possible and to not interfere with private conversations. This is especially important because sometimes we hear credit card numbers or banking information through the phone and a company can lose credibility pretty fast if word gets around that calls can be altered or the interpreter makes themselves known in the call. </p>
<p>We are trained to be interpreters, not crime stoppers. We're just the medium for helping the hard of hearing, but like I've said before we do forward call IDs of scams over to operations. I'm not sure what they do about it, but I do hear that they analyze and then compile 'newsletters' to customers to keep them up-to-date on new scams. That's as close as we can get to actually helping.</p>
<p>I personally haven't had a call recently where someone has fallen for a scam. Most of the time the customer hangs up which I'm grateful for. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How'd you get into that line of work? Those captioning phones need an automatic disconnect trigger for the phrase &quot;Windows key and letter R&quot; among many others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really not that difficult so long as you have a call center stationed in your area. They don't do remote monitoring for obvious reasons so you're physically in a cubicle taking calls. The only things required are a basic understanding of English and grammar (or Spanish now that we caption Spanish calls now), understanding basic computer software, a high WPM typing speed, and the ability to repeat fast conversations verbatim into the software (ours is Dragon). There's only two tests: the typing test and the captioning test. If your score is high enough, you get hired and sent into training. Graduating from training lets you loose into the actual call floor. </p>
<p>It's a pretty cushy job and I like the people who work there. If you spend most of your life in front of a computer and hate talking to actual customers this is probably the job for you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can't screen calls and disconnect them on a whim.  The FCC pays us to act as a captioning service. If we don't take calls, we don't get paid, which I get. The service is used to help the customer's discomfort talking on the phone, not screen the calls like Big Brother. </p></div>		</li>
