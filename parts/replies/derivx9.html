			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not convinced it is learned. It's a very clearly stereotyped behaviour in children with learning difficulties across many different cultures. Many children, with lots of different learning difficulties (but maybe the most common/familiar to people will be autism) very excitedly clap their hands/flap their hands/stamp feet when they're happy/excited. I think it's something more deeply ingrained in humans, the same as smiling and <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26144646/ns/health-behavior/t/pose-champion-innate-study-finds/#.WML5ghLyiqA" target="_blank">arms in the air after a victory</a>, which are seen even in blind people across many cultures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's certainly some kind of underlying biological predisposition for the behavior (otherwise it wouldn't appear organically and we'd be able to point to somebody who invented it), and I think it could simply be explained with &quot;when you're laughing really hard, your body produces chemicals that excite you and spur physical activity beyond just laughing.&quot; Beyond that, I figure it's up to cultural influences that determine exactly how you gesticulate in order to convey that you're having a good time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think cultural influences can overcome instinctive reactions, but I do think we have some built in gestures that are actually quite specific- the arms up in victory being an example. That same study looked at signs of shame and found that there was a strong cultural influence on what athletes did when they felt shame; Asian athletes tended to have similar visible responses, while Western athletes did not. They suggested that there may be an instinctive shame gesture that Western athletes learn to suppress, because shame is stigmatised in, for instance, the US, whereas displays acknowledging shame are culturally expected in many Asian cultures.</p></div>		</li>
