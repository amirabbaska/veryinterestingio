			<div class="markdown"><p>A few months ago, I watched the film <em>Anomalisa</em>. Basically, it's about this dude who meets a random girl at a hotel convention and falls head over heels for her immediately. The rest of the movie is more or less him trying to win her over. It got <strong>rave</strong> reviews, and though I didn't hate it, it certainly wasn't particularly memorable for me. </p>
<p>Last week, I was talking to a friend of mine who's a film buff. He mentions the movie, I talk about why it was so bland, and he mentions in passing the fact that</p>
<p>… wait for it…</p>
<p><em>every single other girl in the movie had the same fuckin' face</em>.</p>
<p>Man, some people will never know the struggle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is that like for you? Like, do you recognize people in photos? I'm making an assumption off of the name &quot;face blind&quot;, but I'm not 100% sure what it is. I'll google that, but how do you feel it affects your relationships with people, if it does at all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since nobody responded, I'll try to explain it in a (hopefully) better way than a cursory Google search would, since this is a super complex topic with tons of research. People with prosopagnosia (face blindness) are typically able to identify people close to them by secondary characteristics like hair style, voice, or body language. They cannot recognize people in photographs unless there are telling objects also pictured (you might recogize your mom in her wedding photos because her wedding dress is hanging in your closet, for example.) It's a fairly debilitating disorder that results in a great deal of difficulty in social situations, but I don't have it and can't describe exactly how difficult it is, sorry.</p>
<p>Halfway sciencey explanation of what's actually happening in the brains of prosopagnosiacs, for anyone who wants it: essentially, with prosopagnosia, the facial fusiform gyrus (the brain structure that identifies the combination of eyes+mouth+nose as &quot;human face&quot;) is damaged (either by an injury or from birth) and the brain uses the less-refined object recognition system to try to make sense of human faces instead. People with a functioning facial fusiform gyrus recognize people based on their unique <em>combination</em> of features - this is why it can be hard to identify even a well-known public figure from a picture of only their mouth or nose, or why those pictures of celebrities' faces made to be symmetrical look so strange. Even though you've seen a thousand pictures of Brad Pitt, you've probably never really paid too much attention to each of his features, you just know what the combination of all three looks like. Someone with prosopagnosia doesn't process that combination of features, instead seeing eyes, a nose, and a mouth as separate objects. Since they can't combine those objects into a coherent whole, everyone with eyes, a nose, and a mouth just ends up looking the same.</p>
<p>This might sound silly and it's not a perfect analogy, but imagine if everyone in the world started carrying around the same object but with minor differences, like apples. Your brain doesn't process an apple much beyond &quot;that's an apple&quot; because the exact shape of it or the length of the stem just isn't really important, so if you put your mom's apple and your sister's apple next to each other, you probably couldn't tell which was which. Prosopagnosia is sort of like that, only your brain doesn't think facial features are important and you wouldn't be able to tell it was your mother and sister standing in front of you and not a couple strangers.</p>

<p>He describes navigation/sense of direction similarly as that you can have a type of agnosia that is topographical in nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>Conciousness and the Social Brain</em>, Michael S. A. Graziano (Ph.d, Professor, Dept. of Psychology and Neuroscience, Princeton University) posits that the sense of the self (awareness) having a specific place, a location in space (sort of in your head and behind your eyes), is explained by the attention schema theory of consciousness. In the book, he describes several experimental, repeatable illusions that can fool the participant into perceiving false locations for their limbs, spatial displacement, and other similar effects in otherwise healthy subjects, showing that our spatial map of the world, although based on physical reality is plastic and sometimes illusory. According to his theory, we evolved to create a physical and conceptual map of entities in the sensory vicinity capable of having <em>attention</em>, or directed awareness, and to what they are attending. In this map, or schema of attentional entities and what they are attending to, is the self–and the self is quite simply the entity on this spatial map closest to the geometric origin of the map! We are literally, according to the theory, self-centered. Pun intended. The only thing special about the sense of self with respect to the other entities, according to the theory, is its location.</p>
<p>It is easy to see how such an attention schema would be helpful to survival and naturally evolve, and be plausible in multiple levels of sophistication. It is surely valuable to know if hungry eyes are upon you, or if your dinner knows you are watching it, and how far dinner is from you. </p>
<p>Perhaps that would mean someday we may be able to validate this theory by correlating the locations of neuronal damage in special cases like those of Dr. Sacks' with the areas of the brain responsible for an attention schema. It would be exciting to definitively understand, at least in terms of spatial awareness, exactly why we feel like we are inside our bodies somewhere–the dualists' illusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not even necessary to have a neurological disorder. &quot;Out of body experience can be induced reliably in a laboratory,&quot; <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/out-of-body-experience-master-of-illusion-1.9569" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22593890" target="_blank">2</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee4-grU_6vs" target="_blank">example of set-up of Ehrsson, H. H.</a>). </p>
<p>From the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Out-of-body experiences are traditionally reported in states close to sleep or near death or under partial anesthesia. One difficulty of with studying this type of experience is that the mental functions of the person are so impaired that it is difficult to accept the report. It is difficult to disentangle a genuine perceptual illusion from a garbled account of a confused memory. However, the out-of-body experience can be induced reliably in a laboratory by putting people in a highly controlled, virtual-reality environment and by manipulating visual feedback and somatosensory feedback. People can be made to feel as they they are floating in empty space or even as though they are magically transported to a location inside another body. The self feels as though it is somewhere other than inside one's proper body.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omg- I have this EXACT issue- thank you for giving it a name! Topographical agnosia! I also have prosopagnosia, which is awful and everything I'm joking when I tell them! I'm really not..
Same, I couldn't get to my childhood after like 20+ yrs without gps lol before gps I just never left lol luckily maps and google maps and some for of gps has basically been around my whole life.</p></div>		</li>
