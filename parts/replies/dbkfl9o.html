<p>Base representations are just how we observe numbers</p>

<p>I love how you phrased this. I was a mathematics major in college many, many years ago, but my career and work since has had very little to do with that old love of mine. I had a similar thought, but couldn't quite get a handle on how to present it. I suppose you're flair points to the reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An example that shows his point: suppose you have 5 apples. 5's a prime number. Now switch to base 2 and you have 101 apples, which is the same prime as 5 in base 10. Your bowl of apples hasn't changed and is still prime in any base. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The simplest way to think about it is this:</p>
<p>You have five apples.</p>
<p>In decimal that's 5 (five) apples.</p>
<p>In binary that's 101 (five) apples.</p>
<p>It's the exact same number, five, in both cases. You're just writing it differently. The number is five, not 5. 5 is its representation in decimal.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember when I was first taught to write numbers, each power of ten was treated like a column title in a table. So to write one hundred and twenty five in numerals, they'd explain &quot;one in the hundreds column, two in the tens column, five in the units column&quot;. Didn't strike me until years later this was teaching in a generic way that could be applied to any base. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to try and add to your recent understanding.</p>
<p>Every column in any base can be written as X in the power of the column number. X being the base number. ( X^Why )</p>
<p>The units column is number 0. Any number in the power of 0 = 1. ( X^0 )</p>
<p>As you go for bigger number columns, you add 1 to the power level (I don't know the actual name for this) and as you go for lower number columns you subtract 1. Going into negative powers for numbers smaller than the units column.</p>
<p>Using base 10 as an example: | 10^1 = 10 | 10^0 = 1 | 10^-1 = 0.1 |</p>
<p>This works for any base. Be it decimal, binary, hexadecimal or any base you'd want to try out.</p>
<p>EDIT: Used X for both variables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was once explained to me that for a time it was fashionable to try and teach 'fundamental' math to kids. Things like 'what actually IS a number?'</p>
<p>Usually this is a university level sort of concept (i studied it in my third year of comp sci). However some teachers got the idea that because it was 'fundamental' it should be taught first. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a similar concept in language. The word &quot;pipe&quot; is not a pipe. It's a representation of an object we call a pipe. In the same way, five is not five of something. It's a representation of an amount we call five.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you rarely here mathematics described in terms of the signifier and the signified. It was a great way to present how far from correct the notion behind the original question lay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you count as important. It does change a lot of things in floating point numbers such as what's divisible into clean decimal representations that don't lose data and when base two is used you can cheat and gain extra precision by stripping the implicit 0b1 from the significand of your scientific notation value. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has everything to do with base. 1/3 cannot be represented by a finite number of digits in base 10. Whereas in base 3 the representation is just 0.1</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way to put it: a base system is just a matter of notation. It's similar to the difference between writing 4/3 and writing 1 1/3. The only difference is in the notation.</p></div>		</li>
