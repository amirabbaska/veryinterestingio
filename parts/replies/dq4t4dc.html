			<div class="markdown"><p>On macOS <code>cmd+shift+c</code> takes you directly to the select element tool. Presumably there's some equivalent on windows (<code>ctrl+shift+c</code> maybe?). Click once --&gt; hit delete on your keyboard. Should be heaps faster.</p>
<p>edit: <code>ctrl+shift+c</code> does in fact seem to be the windows shortcut. Also, backspace should work instead of delete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingâ€” what device/OS version/Chrome version are you using?</p>
<p>I ask about the device because if I'm not mistaken apple has been labeling backspace as delete for quite a few years.</p>
<p>Anyway, backspace and delete should both work (though that doesn't help you much if the shortcut isn't doing anything).</p></div>		</li>
