			<div class="markdown"><p>so that in turn would mean that the water in the oceans now is actually saltier than the water back a few million years ago?  lets say dinosaur times?
or am i getting sth wrong</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. In broad strokes that's true but there are also ways for salts to be sequestered away from the oceans. For example, when a large shallow body of salt water with no outflow evaporates over time it leaves the salt behind in &quot;evaporite&quot; deposits. The Great Salt Lake is a related example of a body of water with no outflow for salt. And salt flats are examples of evaporite deposits that are still at the surface. Under many common geologic conditions evaporite deposits can be covered by rock and buried underground. This is how you get structures that can be mined and why a substantial amount of salt comes from underground salt mines instead of salt farms that use evaporation of sea water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if there was no outlet for the lake.   Examples include the dead sea, and the great salt lake.  There are relatively few lakes like that, though.  Most lakes are just big swollen parts of a river.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mineral concentration in the soil is not constant; it varies from region to region. Also most/all lakes have a freshwater source and an outflow. So broadly speaking, no.</p>
<p>However, he ultimate fate of a lake with no outflow would indeed seem to be excessive salinity, based on the Dead Sea.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Salts (plural), to be more precise. It should be noted that all kinds of salts end up in the oceans.</p></div>		</li>
