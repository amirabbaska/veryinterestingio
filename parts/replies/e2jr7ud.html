			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great post. Only things I can add are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The refractories are added in layers. Outer layer would be something like solid steel for a ladle, to provide structural strength, which is lined with a safety layer of brick, then another lining of standard refractory brick, then finally the inside would have a sprayed-on layer of refractory (a working lining), which is meant to wear down over time. For furnaces, they'll often have water cooling systems in place as well (a bunch of pipes running along the outside to sap heat away). </li>
<li>The type of refractory lining chosen may depend on what slag will be used as well. The slag chemistry can put a lot of wear on refractory linings, depending on what compounds are stable at what temperature and pH. There's a lot of expertise in this area of which I'm ignorant, but I do know that it exists and is an important consideration for both slag selection and refractory selection. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say &quot;slag selection&quot;, it kind of implies slag is something that is added to the cauldron to be melted with the metal. Isn't it the case though that a lot of the slag is the chemical composition of whatever ore the iron combined with? I get the fact that you often have to have some kind of chemistry going on in the cauldron to separate the iron from the other elements of the ore, but isn't the slag going to largely depend on what elements are in the ore, not what you put in with it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're smelting from ore, sure, it will largely depend on what's in the ore. But now that remelting scrap steel has been economically feasible for a while, we do add slag intentionally (and make additions to the melt that result in slag formation) to control slag chemistry and fluidity (I guess?). Depending on the grade of steel and what casting problems are associated with it, you may need a certain slag chemistry to make sure it can be degassed properly, to be able to protect it from the atmosphere long enough to let nonmetallic inclusions float out, and to &quot;foam up&quot; and be robust enough so that bags of alloy modifications can be added into the ladle.   </p>
<p>I'm sure these aren't <em>always</em> considerations, and I'm sure there are other considerations I missed, but these are some of the big ones we deal with as an EAF melt shop. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is so cool.  So the ladles you see in foundries are actually steel with a ceramic liner?  Do they have to do something special to make sure that the steel and ceramic have comparable thermal expansion so they don't crack when heated? </p></div>		</li>
