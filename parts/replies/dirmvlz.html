			<div class="markdown"><p>The fog isn't vapor, it's miniscule droplets suspended in the air. Water vapor is invisible. There is always a certain amount of water vapor in the air, which isn't hot. Making water hot just increases the vapor pressure, allowing more of it to evaporate.</p></div>		</li>
