			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, many of the extremely expensive condos are empty, because it's cheaper to pay the rent than to take care of tenants.</p>
<p>The same happens with unbuilt lots, instead of doing something with it some speculators simply wait for the land itself to get more valuable.</p>
<p>This is why unleashed capitalism is so efficient...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also tax reasons, in states with property tax you get a deduction if your property is “for sale” and they also tax by the sqr/ft of the building that’s on it, it’s usually cheaper to tear it down and have an empty lot than have a vacant building that’s just going to fall apart anyways.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Which...you may call Capitalism, but it is the opposite of a free market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can they afford it? Wouldn’t it be cheaper to put the money into investments elsewhere? Like American companies or bonds? Won’t super expensive condos or houses incur thens of thousands on taxes every year? A $200000 house in the state of Florida without homestead exemption (you are a resident of Florida and the house is your primary home that you live in) your looking at over $3000 in taxes every year, if you’re from out of state it’s even more and I can’t imagine how much out of country pays. Why would a millionaire investing in property they basically have to rent on top of buying in the hopes that the appreciation out paces the taxes they pay? Like is real estate harder to reposes than bonds or other investments or even just gold on a vault somewhere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then they presumably wouldn't invest in property in Florida in this way but rather would go for jurisdictions with less expensive taxes. I don't know how much $20K gets you in Florida but is it going to be a mid-city property which you could reliably sell for a profit in however many years?</p></div>		</li>
