			<div class="markdown"><p>Same concept. whether you use combination IV or IV and gas induction, you give a certain total dose of anesthesia, that work together to give you the depth and quality of anesthesia you need. It turns your brain and nervous system off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most inductions for general anesthesia in the adult population are done via a combo of IV meds (fentanyl for analgesia and help blunt the SNS response of laryngoscopy to place the ETT, lidocaine given prior to propofol to help numb the vein because commoly used sedative hypnotic agents like propofol and etomidate irritate the vein, then some form of paralytic like succinylcholine or rocuronium is given to help open the vocal cords for ease of placing the breathing tube). The mask is only usually to deliver oxygen while these meds take effect. If more than standard dosing off the IV stuff is required to accomplish the goal, the volatile anesthetic is turned on by some to help facilitate the process. There are some situations where gas is utilized instead of the IV route, like if the IV you planned to use is not working, or in a pediatric setting where the IV is not placed until the child is asleep and unaware of the needle. In this case a volatile anesthetic like sevoflurane is combined with Nitrous to speed up the process of getting the anesthetic on board to induce unconsciousness. All in all, I guess it would be situation dependant.</p></div>		</li>
