			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok that's interesting, I was unaware of that, thanks. In BWRs, is this not also partially down to the effect of boiling the coolant would cause the pH in your system to skyrocket and lead to an increased rate of corrosion? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe thats right. We inject hydrogen to our coolant actually to help promote h2o recombination due to radiolysis in the core, along with zinc and other noble metals to reduce electrochemical corrosion potential. </p>
<p>The water chemistry is very tightly controlled to minimize corrosion and extend vessel life. It's one big reason why reactors can go more than 40 years. </p></div>		</li>
