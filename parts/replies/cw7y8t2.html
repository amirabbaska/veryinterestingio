			<div class="markdown"><p>Just off the cuff,. Hawking and others recently revised their notions of event horizons to suggest they're more dynamic and apparent rather than a firm mathematical state. In that case energy and mass can leak from the shifting barrier. That wouldn't be Hawking radiation. It would add to it and likely be many orders of magnitude higher.</p>
<p>As far as I know Hawking's radiation itself firmed up in a theoretical sense and through related work about the natural of virtual particles. Those are testable. The LHC and others have results. Not from black holes, simply on virtual particles and their related analogous mathematical models. Ie results in A suggest similar in B. There's no way to do on-site testing without a long trip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mechanic for Hawking radiation is called the Casimir effect, which deals with virtual particles becoming permanent and the black holes losing an equivalent mass, and has been experimentally proven, although not with black holes specifically.But since gravity is the felt exact same as every other force, the leap to extending this effect to black holes is reasonable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you search for &quot;timelike lines become spacelike&quot; you'll get a bunch of hits. Its tough math but there are some simple explanations kicking around. The basic idea is that near a black hole &quot;r&quot; or the radius becomes like &quot;t&quot; the time was, while &quot;t&quot; starts to look more like a spacelike line, ie it becomes r-like.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add real quick that hawking uses this explanation for the beginning of time as well at the big bang. When the universe was infinitismally small, the time dimension becomes increasingly spacelike, and so approaches an asymptote. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all about reference frames. For an observer outside the event horizon it appears to take an infinite amount of time for things inside to reach the center. However, for an observer inside the event horizon it takes a negligible amount of time. Once something crosses the event horizon it simply accelerates toward the singularity presumably in the same way anything accelerates toward an object of greater mass. Since these masses tend to be colossal at the singularity of a black hole, the inward velocity would likely accelerate to a reasonable percentage of the speed of light (unless it is already light of course...). Of course, it doesn't help that we can't see information once it crosses the event horizon, either, making all of this speculation based on the models we can predict. The presence of black holes in general seems to violate much of what we know about physics so it is possible there are other effects we have never predicted or thought about that affect what really goes on inside the event horizon.</p>
<p>As for the idea of &quot;time-like lines becoming space-like&quot; there is certainly something interesting about the idea and it isn't all that farfetched. Under the present model, time is expected to be linear in at least some local reference frame. There is an interesting theory about the arrow of time that suggests the expansion of the universe causes us to experience time in its current direction and that if the universe were to contract instead we would experience it in the opposite direction but even this construing is linear. If a black hole were treated as a microcosmic version (feels weird to suggest) of the universe expanding and contracting one could suggest the theory that time may run in reverse inside the contracting region of spacetime that a black hole is affecting.</p></div>		</li>
