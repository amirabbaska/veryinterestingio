			<div class="markdown"><p>It always surprises me the way Europeans (mostly Europeans of Germanic origin) commit to plans that take decades to bear any kind of fruit. And South Americans here cry and scream when something is said to take 5 years to be completed and demand immediate results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think partly it comes down to stability which allows people to plan for the longer term. There was one major disruption with WW2 and a partial flooding of one polder by the Germans troops as they were losing the war in April 1945. Otherwise, what one generation started, benefited their grandchildren, despite many changes of government over the years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Floodwater comes from upstream, so the same thing that happens to any farmland flooded by a river. You lose that harvest and re-sow once it's drained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the floods they're talking about will neither re-salinate the soil, nor wash it away? In most flooded rivers, there's a lot of good, deep soil. In other areas, a big drought and dust storm can blow away the few inches of topsoil, ruining it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The more usual danger is fresh water from rivers or the artificial sea. However a polder next to the sea or an estuary risks salt water inflow which is harder work and possibly several years of cleaning. The main dyke/barrier on the Zuiderzee separate the North Sea (salt water) from the new artificial freshwater sea and <em>then</em> the polders behind further dykes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I went there we visited the museum and I was blown away by the scale of the engineering undertaken by the Netherlands after the storm of '53.</p>
