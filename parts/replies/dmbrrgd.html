			<div class="markdown"><p>Ummm, in the U.K. and our power lines are mostly not underground. Unless you just meant cities??</p>
<p>There was a petition a while ago to make our power lines underground but the cost outweighed the environmental and health concerns. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High voltage lines are relatively easy to replace compared the a city grid.</p>
<p>Also, the US grid is uniquely vulnerable due to a very old infrastructure and a high demand. Anywhere else in the world either has a much lower demand or much more resilient grid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Afaik it would introduce a local spike in electricity that blows it out. These things also act as drains, power plants pump electricity into the overland net, transformers dump it into city grids where it gets used.</p>
<p>If a couple hundred transformers short out at the same time power plants can't quickly enough stop feeding electricity into the net, which blows out more transformers, which increases the power on the remaining ... It's a cascade. At the end you have a blackout on like 1/3 to 2/3 of the entire country, like the entire East coast for example.</p>
<p>The true problem however is that we don't have much production capacity for transformers, because we usually only need to replace them as the break down after a decade or three, and the production capacity we do have depends on electricity being available...</p>
<p>It would be a very, very bad situation. You'd need a Marshall plan more than the Germans did after WW2 to come out of that with just a decade or two lost.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Voltage spike breaking down insulation? Current spike melting the windings? In which direction? Why does the transformer not just saturate?</p>

<p>Current is drawn, not fed. If you kill demand instantly the effect is overspeed of the prime mover and 'instant' break of the main VCB on over-frequency. How can this affect downstream grid transformers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, have you ever been listening to a radio during a thunderstorm? You know how you can hear an audible crackle sound every time a lightning strike takes place? This is because those lightning bolts produce wide-spectrum electromagnetic interference, which the antenna on your radio picks up. This is translated into a loud burst of static noise. Now imagine if this energy burst were <em>much</em> more powerful (HAND) and you had a <em>much</em> larger antenna (hundreds of miles of power lines) to collect the &quot;signal.&quot; All that energy gets pushed through whatever it is connected to, in this case the transformer, and overloads it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in what form is the energy/signal transmitted in the lines?</p>
<p>I don't like the term overload, as it can't really be applicable to this. It kind of implies excessive draw from the secondary which would just saturate the core.</p></div>		</li>
