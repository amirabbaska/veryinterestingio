<p>For objects you can't see with the naked eye, there are some techniques for finding them in the telescope. Usually you use &quot;star-hopping&quot; to find it. You first locate some known, visible stars that the object you're looking for is near. Look through your telescope and you can see dimmer stars, then keep referencing your star map, matching up the patterns, and slowly make your way from star to star until you land on the object. This is made trickier by the fact that everything in your telescope is reversed and upside down, so you have to keep that in mind when moving your scope.</p>
<p>Also I had a <a href="https://agenaastro.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/o/f/ofin-te-tel-1s_6.jpg" target="_blank">Telrad finder</a> on my scope that helped. It has illuminated bullseye rings, the rings are (IIRC) 1, 2, and 4 degrees diameter. So if you know your object is 2 degrees from a star you can see, you set that star on the largest ring and then your object should be in the center.</p>
<p>It's pretty thrilling to spend some time doing this, and have it pay off when you finally check your eyepiece and BOOM, there it is! Takes practice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If some hyper-advanced civilization tried something <em>even remotely like</em> this, they almost certainly wouldn't use a traditional lens, not least of all because the lens would be many kilometers thick across most of its diameter, and so the optical medium would have to be supernaturally clear to transmit any light at all.</p>
<p>Most likely the objective element would be a huge, astonishingly thin, rotating parabolic mirror, with its shape maintained by carefully manipulated forces.</p></div>		</li>
