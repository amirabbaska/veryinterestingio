			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, most tech starts out like this.  And...it's equally - or even more profoundly true - that most tech ends up in the shitter.  This isn't a spiritual question, not about &quot;attitude&quot;, it's about the fundamentals being practical, safe, affordable and superior to alternatives.  </p>
<p>What we shouldn't give up on is safe, environmentally friendly, transportation.  But, stubbornly insisting that the cool option of the week is good because we sure as hell don't want to be negative is lousy reasoning for continued pursuit of an idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If everyone could stop riding Elon Musk and think for a bit, that would be great.  Space X is really going well, but that doesn't mean the hyper loop is sound.  </p>
<p>Fun fact, the hyper loop idea wasn't even original.  NASA was working on the concept back in the space race but gave up due to infeasibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The concept of hyperloop is some 100 years old which never became reality because of its impracticality. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the question asked how the Hyperloop works specifically. Turns out, it just doesn't with our current materials/resources. That doesn't mean that thinking outside the box is bad. Just that this box is a little wonky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had rockets before we attempted space travel. We had an understanding of lift before we created air travel.</p>
<p>There is currently no technology that is able to create and maintain a vacuum of that volume, and using current technology introduces an error rate that is neither profitable or safe.</p>
<p>To keep those trillions of liters of air outside of the tube, millions of compressors running in parallel will be required both in order to create the vacuum and to maintain the vacuum.  The structure of the tube also needs to be able to maintain compressive forces of thousands of pounds per square inch - and any failure means the entire system is compromised and lives may be lost.</p>
<p>There's a difference between &quot;possible&quot; and &quot;doable&quot; - and it's the error rate that creates the difference.</p></div>		</li>
