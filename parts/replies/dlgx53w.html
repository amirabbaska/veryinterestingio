			<div class="markdown"><p>Completely agree to that in terms of how <em>you</em> are viewing <em>your</em> partner but what I've also noticed is that gfs of friends of mine got more and more unattractive judging by looks. IIRC that's caused because they feel safe in the relationship and (not all of them tho!) don't take care of their looks as much as they did in the early stages of the relationship. Some of the gfs of my friends are still as good looking as they were when they met. I guess some people take care of themselves for others while some are taking care of themselves for themselves.</p></div>		</li>
