			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? Wow. I had always thought a large amount of oceanic salinity was due to minerals dissolved on land and left in the oceans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not convinced it has to do with geothermal vents yet, agree with your theory. Unless the dead sea has a lot of geothermal vents that I don't know about. Or the Great Salt Lake. It's the terminal point of the water cycle, the water is evaporated off and the salt remains.</p></div>		</li>
