			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I saw this on a photographer's twitter and in the discussion someone posted the RGB histogram showing that the photo actually has red pixels in it, and quite a few. That's due to the way our current display technology displays colors/grays</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not red pixels, per se, but red color data or rather red subpixels. You can have one part be R:150, G:60, B:152 and compared to something else that's R:0, G:60, B:75, you have some areas with more red in them than others. Parts of the strawberry that look red are actually a purple grey color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course it would. There is still red data in the photo which is why we see red. This is really simple and has become too convoluted</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just like how we perceive temperature. Warm things feel warm to the touch because we have less thermal energy than the object we feel. When we touch something cold, it's not because the object &quot;is&quot; cold, it's because the object isn't hot and that we experience a transfer of energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except something can be colder than your hand and still feel warm, because we are generating energy constantly, so we have to lose energy to feel comfortable. For example, water at ~30 degrees feels hot, even though our internal temperature is usually 36.5 and our skin is in the range of 32-35 degrees.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dragging the color picker across the entire thing you never approach any color even close to red. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm partially colorblind, and if I block out the whole picture except for the &quot;strawberry&quot; color swatch on the right side, the swatch looks red to me.  I think it has to do with the RGB pigments, even if it's considered &quot;green&quot;, it has more red pigment in it.</p>
<p>I don't see green all that well, so it's just my best guess</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a visual demonstration, here is the image isolated to each channel individually: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Sa9CL" target="_blank">album</a>.</p>
<p>More interestingly though, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/CoXUn" target="_blank">here is what happens when you swap red with the other two color channels</a>. Notice that the berries appear to be green/blue when swapped with that respective color. The effect isn't <em>quite</em> as convincing because the of the blue+green overlay but it should be pretty visible. The reason for this is explained by u/someMeatballs <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5x3wr2/the_allgreen_picture_with_red_strawberries/def1ruu/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>
