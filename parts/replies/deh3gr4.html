			<div class="markdown"><p>You briefly touched on this, but a massive part of it is how remote they are. Africa is absolutely massive, but it is cut off from the rest of Eurasia by the Saharan desert. A desert that is almost the size of the United States. </p>
<p>Historically, there was very little trade with sub-Saharan Africa compared to the exchange that was going on up north.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't a constant threat by predators <em>drive</em> innovation? If you've got a <del>tiger</del> lion wanting to eat your family it seems to me that you would want to get really good at building to ward off potential predators. </p>
<p>Edit:
I think something that gets forgotten is that tribalism is still a problem a major problem in African nations. They possibly haven't been able to stop fighting amongst themselves enough <em>to be able to</em> innovate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is the solution might not always be something which looks like progress to us. For instance one way successful African civilisations prevented malaria was to build their settlements away from water sources. As the settlements didn't have nearby water sources they were limited in size no matter how wealthy or sophisticated they became. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure. But still, there's the people left over. There family and friends have been dying from disease for thousands of years... and there's been no medicinal innovation? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any problems posed by large predators is effectively solved by just not being alone.  there are very few animals that would ever attack a group of humans openly, so no real innovation is necessary.  Dealing with disease, the real killer, would first require effective medicine, something simply not available most of the time, but also an understanding of germ theory and epidemiology.  Outside of trial and error, how do you even create new medicine if you don't even understand what is killing you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most African countries are former colonies. Colonies are usually (religious being an exception) set up with an infrastructure and bureaucracy that facilitates extraction of resources to be sent of to the parent country. When the colonies were abandoned, political leaders were able to replace the former colonial governor and exploit the system to funnel wealth into their pockets. The perfect system for corruption. You find this problem in many former colonies.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>just to be clear in no way am I saying that western people aren't partially responsible (they play a part and they need to own it) the only comment I was trying to make was when you have autocrats like Mugabe who live with almost unlimited wealth while his people starve to death, there must be a connection. </p></div>		</li>
