			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of applications that involve a burn-in period either by design or by necessity. This isn't typically true of structures, sure, but plenty of sliding surfaces and other moving or meshing parts are intended to wear in a lot shortly after installation. </p>
<p>This is why transmissions on cars often call for their first fluid change at a low milage compared to their typical maintenance interval (initial wear sheds lots of metal dust and shavings). An aircraft-specific example is the Pratt and Whitney F135 engine (which powers the F-35); it requires a controlled burn-in period to wear the engine components. This was required to reduce friction in the engine during high-stress maneuvers that resulted in cracked blades in new &quot;un-worn&quot; engines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite right, actually I did neglect the very initial part of reliability models which do accoubt for burn in period failures.  I was more speaking from a material standpoint, as in use a fatigued material so that your design works optimally.</p>
<p>And quite honestly, Id consider burn in periods on engines such as you mentioned to be a part of the manufacturing process.  But hey, thats because I work in reliability. Actually wotk with some teams at P&amp;W for reliability of their jet turbine blades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In many cases that's the only purpose they serve; they demonstrate the engine (or other component) operates correctly and according to specification. A &quot;burn in&quot; is a different animal, where the purpose is to wear parts down, often after they're installed as part of a bigger system. This occasionally means operating in a controlled manner to wear things in, but that's pretty rare (this is the deal with the PW-F135; it's a bandaid to fix some issues they found in flight). </p>
<p>More commonly you'd just have closer maintenance intervals early in the system life to monitor/handle the process. This is pretty common for geartrains as the gears wear on each other due to imperfections in their machining; wear occurs quickly at first and then slows down as the gears stop sliding and start meshing. This doesn't necessarily mean they start performing &quot;better&quot;, but they do break in. Anything that slides, slips or spins can have a similar process. </p>
<p>Either case is more common if the installation tolerances are tighter than the manufacturing tolerances for the parts. It will usually mean there was a conscious decision to accept wear-in period to save money on manufacturing, or that someone made a mistake that a burn in happens to fix.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In general, this is not common practice.  Most reliability models (statistical or mechanical) predict a product to be mpst reliable initially and deteriorate from there; as the chances of failure increase as the product is stressed (as the plane is flown).  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's actually incorrect for a huge range of components/mechanisms etc. What you're describing is wear or fatigue failure but actually many <em>things</em> fail in substantial proportions at the beginning  of their life. A failure Vs life curve is  very often some variation of a &quot;bath tub&quot; with high &quot;infant mortality&quot; blending in with wear/fatigue type failures to produce a bath tub shape </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So yes, in traditional &quot;old school&quot; reliability, that is the thinking.  But the bathtub model is fundamentally flawed, and newer engineering methods (thanks to technology, finite element) are taking hold in industries where reliability is critical.</p>
<p>Why is it flawed?  Because it is a statistical model applied to an engineering problem.  Why was it adopted?  Because to run a business, you need numbers to model failures.  And at the time, engineers didnt have the computing power to model complex mechanical systems as we do today.  So, statistician came up with the bathtub curve.</p>
<p>Ehat we do now is actually model every mechanical part or subsystem - sometimes down to the atomic level - to understand each failure.  This ubderstanding is then used to improve the design of the product - not something a bathtub curve would help with as its a statistical measure.</p>
<p>How are they related?  If you line up all the individual engineering failures on a graph superimposed, they tend to look kind of like a bathtub curve.</p>
<p>But heres the point, and why infant mortality has nothing to do with OPs question.  From the reliability engineer standpoint, infant mortality is not a design choice, these failures happen because of manufacturing defects and production issues (thats what we know from the reliability engineers' studies into mechanical failures).</p>
<p>A burn in period is simply a way to weed out these type of failures; it doesnt have to do with the design of the product.  Its just a part of the manufacturing process.</p>
<p>So from a mechanical standpoint, typically materials do not reach their peak performance after some time of refular use; their best performance istypically when its new.  A burn in period has nothing to do with this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really reliability and performance don't have much in common so  our points don't really connect to OP's question which seems to be about things getter better.</p>
<p>As for your points on reliability I don't really get what your trying to say. Is it that because infant mortality is outside design (it isn't) that it can't be considered part of the 'true' reliability curve or that 'burn in' makes these failures  irrelevant (that the end user never actually sees them)?  The former, is irrelevant, infant mortality happens for multitude of reasons, <strong>including</strong> poor design. You seem to be suggesting that  the engineering process is so flawless with FE, atomic level design (whut) that infant death can't be part of the proper design and manufacture but actually it can. Further to this point, clearly this perfect design process (if it even exists) is not always available or economic so you are going to get design failures.</p>
<p>With respect to to your less clear point about &quot;burn in&quot;. I don't really know how you exclude these failures. Only when it pays to will items be &quot;burnt in&quot; before use, otherwise the failure will be part of the product life, so actually important.  For many items it's hardly economic to test each and every and such tests only exclude a category of immediate failure modes. Infant mortality by definition is just the part of the reliability curve where failure rates decrease with time. It can be any proportion of the products' life, sometimes years. </p></div>		</li>
