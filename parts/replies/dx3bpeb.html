<ul>
<li>This seems to be the educated consensus in this thread..and here I was under the assumption it did.  It appears that the reduction of Na is still the most effective thing one can do.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Potassium chloride (KCl) is <strong>utterly harmless</strong>. It's analogous to table salt (NaCl) and is a major ingredient in many common liquid products. This is especially true in medicine because NaCl and KCl are often used to guarantee that any injection has the same osmolality (saltiness) as the recipient's blood - this improves injection efficiency and reduces damage to nearby tissue. Example: if a patient w/IV drip is dehydrated, the injection is 0.9% NaCl solution, not pure water.</p>
<p>TL;DR KCl and NaCl are totally safe and native in the body, but imbalances can occur (salty food).</p></div>		</li>
