			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard that the marshmallow experiment showed that children's ability to wait for a second marshmallow was environmentally controlled. Children whose trust is betrayed are less likely to believe that the second marshmallow is really coming. They pick a short term reward. I think that early childhood stress may forge habits of impulsivity, which may also be related to addiction and other life problems.</p>
<p>Found this on the wikipedia page for the marshmallow experiment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A 2012 study at the University of Rochester (with a smaller N= 28) altered the experiment by dividing children into two groups: one group was given a broken promise before the marshmallow test was conducted (the unreliable tester group), and the second group had a fulfilled promise before their marshmallow test (the reliable tester group). The reliable tester group waited up to four times longer (12 min) than the unreliable tester group for the second marshmallow to appear.[11][12] The authors argue that this calls into question the original interpretation of self-control as the critical factor in children's performance, since self-control should predict ability to wait, not strategic waiting when it makes sense. Prior to the Marshmallow Studies at Stanford, Walter Mischel had shown that the child's belief that the promised delayed rewards would actually be delivered is an important determinant of the choice to delay, but his later experiments did not take this factor into account or control for individual variation in beliefs about reliability when reporting correlations with life successes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly why I opt for the short term rewards. Part of me doesn't believe that I will be rewarded for my long term decisions. So it's like, well I can get what I want now! Self esteem plays a big role in how I feel. Feeling inadequate on the daily makes me believe that long term rewards are for good humans. Also, I can never be certain when these alleged long term rewards will come. But I do know that I can smoke a cig or a bong whenever I want. It's a really fucked up cycle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All joking aside i know op is looking for a serious answer but, as in the past, South Park does a really good job of succintly explaining in a comedic environment a very poignant issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Satan</em>:  So you got dopamine, right? That's the chemical that gets released in your brain whenever you do something pleasurable, like eating, sex, and that's just nature, right? Like rabbits and fish and shit. They need dopamine so that they want to consume and reproduce.</p>
<p><em>Stan</em>: Okay</p>
<p><em>Satan</em>: But because humans have progressed and now have access to all the shit they want whenever they want it, it's easy for them to overdo and have dopamine problems. You know, it's not fuckin' rocket science, this stuff.</p>
<p><em>Stan</em>: So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?</p>
<p><em>Satan</em>: Fuck no! <strong>It's like, okay, it's like being diabetic. You know, it's like you can eat wrong and eat wrong and chemicals get released from your liver in a weird way, you know, you've been eatin' gluten and shit, and then eventually you've got a chemical imbalance from your liver. And something clicked, and now you're diabetic forever, right? So like, if you keep doing something too much, eventually there's, ummm, a dopamine fuckup, right, and you're kind of screwed up for life.</strong></p>
<p><em>Stan</em>: So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?</p>
<p><em>Satan</em>: Yeah, that's pretty much what it means</p>

It so accurately described mobile game microtransactions that it was hilarious.  Actually it was pretty much exactly what the OP of this comment thread described.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, I've always been curious about this. See, I would have eaten the marshmallow straight away... but probably because I don't like marshmallows <em>that</em> much.</p>
<p>They're <em>alright</em>. But getting two for waiting doesn't really seem like much of a reward to me personally.</p>
<p>So they would have categorised me a certain way.</p>
