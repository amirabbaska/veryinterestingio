			<div class="markdown"><p>Sea lice is a big problem for the industry, but it's harmless to humans. The main problem is anisakis simplex which can be found in all wild fish. Farms fight that by using feed that has been heat treated and removing any fish that appears sick or lose weight. I can't really answer for other countries, but you'd be hard put to find parasites in Norwegian farm-raised salmon and it's eaten here without freezing.</p>
<p>Comparisons to wild Pacific is often made when people try to tear down farm-raised Atlantic, but frequently for the wrong reasons.  Pacific and Atlantic salmon are quite distinctly different and even belong to separate genera (plural of &quot;genus&quot;, and yes, I had to look that up) which is above &quot;species&quot; in the taxonomy. When people point to a slab of wild Pacific next to farm-raised salmon you'll find the same differences between wild Pacific and wild Atlantic as well.</p>
<p>There are a number of problems with the farms, but parasites in the finished product is not one of them and any arguments from appearance are also moot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some reason, I think it's awesome that (1) a person would ask such a random question like this and (2) a random expert - bc you obviously know what you're talking about - just swooped down and answered the question so eazy-peazy. Fucking Reddit. </p></div>		</li>
