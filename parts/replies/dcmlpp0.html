			<div class="markdown"><p>for those of you who say that the large intestine doesn't absorb any nutrients, apparently none of you have heard of &quot;good gut bacteria&quot; which is all the rage recently</p>

<p>extracted this paragraph</p>
<p>&quot;While chyme moves through the large intestine, bacteria digest substances in the chyme that are not digestible by the human digestive system. Bacterial fermentation converts the chyme into feces and releases vitamins including vitamins K, B1, B2, B6, B12, and biotin. Vitamin K is almost exclusively produced by the gut bacteria and is essential in the proper clotting of blood.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
