			<div class="markdown"><p>The college I went to had an electronics lab paid for by British Telecom to train people as electricians and phone technicians. A corner of the lab was marked off with hazard tape on the ground and any active electronic circuit passing through the taped off area had a high chance of just dying from random components frying. This had been going on for a couple of years and twice a year our physics department, and several of the other local college physics departments would come around and try to figure out what was causing it. The prevailing theory were &quot;magic&quot;, &quot;elves&quot; and &quot;someone is playing a really detailed joke&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i fix electronics for a living, including power supplies. im often baffled at surge and fire damage while multiple fuses, protection diodes, surge protectors remain intact. its like the electricity decides &quot;nope, not taking this path, im just gonna blow up some random components over here then burn up all your cables.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's so bizarre because electricity seems like such a &quot;hard&quot; science. Like, by rights, we should always know what it's going to do because it's governed by physical laws that we've got pretty well understood (we have, right?).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do know all of this. </p>
<p>We definitely can model it. It's hardly applicable becouse it's a lot of work (usually not worth the hassle), and you would need all exact parameters (becouse real components are never perfect) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! How does a surge on the 120Vac go through the 12Vdc power supply, through the security control panel, through the card reader controller (which again regulates the incoming Vdc to 12V) and burnout card readers!? Maybe it's the antenna coil in the card reader that picks up stray voltage and kills itself? Who knows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived in Germany for a few years and was amazed how the houses were all cast concrete -- entire walls and floors.  I wish we had those kinds of houses here in Texas, as they'd be really safe in the storms and tornadoes we get here.  What do we get instead, wood frame houses built like matchsticks.  At least it does make it a lot easier to rewire things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Over half the house is rewired, it's just some of the plugs and lights that have the old stuff. We have a whole new fuze box, proper grounding and the house was already overkill on power supply with 3 phase x 90 amp, 220v service (was a butcher shop before) So a rewire will be for whoever buys it after me :)</p></div>		</li>
