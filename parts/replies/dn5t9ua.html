<p>Charlie Brown: &quot;How was I to know that I shouldn't give cigars to beagles?&quot;<br />
Lucy: &quot;It wasn't a real cigar, blockhead!  It was the chocolate!&quot;<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's in the top right corner, but it doesn't stand out because it's absolutely not uniquely simple/stark. <em>Lil' Pedro</em> and <em>Seventeen</em> both have more whitespace, and <em>Pogo</em> (in the lower right) has fewer characters and similar inking complexity. I actually thought that <em>Pogo</em> <strong>was</strong> <em>Peanuts</em> at first glance.</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, Bill Waterson cites both <em>Pogo</em> and <em>Peanuts</em> as major sources of artistic inspiration for <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em>.</p></div>		</li>
