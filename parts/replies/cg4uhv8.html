			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick run down for those not in the field: The BICEP telescope measures the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). </p>
<p>The CMB is light that was released ~380,000 years after the Big Bang. The Universe was a hot dense plasma right after the Big Bang. As it expanded and cooled, particles begin to form and be stable. Stable protons and electrons appear, but because the Universe was so hot and so densely packed, they couldn't bind together to form stable neutral hydrogen, before a high-energy photon came zipping along and smashed them apart. As the Universe continued to expand and cool, it eventually reached a temperature cool enough to allow the protons and the electrons to bind. This binding causes the photons in the Universe that were colliding with the formerly charged particles to stream freely throughout the Universe. The light was T ~= 3000 Kelvin then. Today, due to the expansion of the Universe, we measure it's energy to be 2.7 K.</p>
<p>Classical Big Bang cosmology has a few open problems, one of which is the Horizon problem. The Horizon problem states that given the calculated age of the Universe, we don't expect to see the level of uniformity of the CMB that we measure. Everywhere you look, in the microwave regime, through out the entire sky, the light has all the same average temperature/energy, 2.725 K. The light all having the same energy suggests that it it was all at once in causal contact. We calculate the age of the Universe to be about 13.8 Billion years. If we wind back classical expansion of the Universe we see today, we get a Universe that is causally connected only on ~ degree sized circles on the sky, not EVERYWHERE on the sky. This suggests either we've measured the age of the Universe incorrectly, or that the expansion wasn't always linear and relatively slow like we see today.</p>
<p>One of the other problem is the Flatness Problem. The Flatness problem says that today, we measure the Universe to be geometrically very close to flatness, like 1/100th close to flat. Early on, when the Universe was much, much smaller, it must've been even CLOSER to flatness, like 1/10000000000th. We don't like numbers in nature that have to be fine-tuned to a 0.00000000001 accuracy. This screams &quot;Missing physics&quot; to us.</p>
<p>Another open problem in Big Bang cosmology is the magnetic monopole/exotica problem. Theories of Super Symmetry suggest that exotic particles like magnetic monopoles would be produced in the Early Universe at a rate of like 1 per Hubble Volume. But a Hubble Volume back in the early universe was REALLY SMALL, so today we would measure LOTS of them, but we see none.</p>
<p>One neat and tidy way to solve ALL THREE of these problems is to introduce a period of rapid, exponential expansion, early on in the Universe. We call this &quot;Inflation&quot;. Inflation would have to blow the Universe up from a very tiny size about e^60 times, to make the entire CMB sky that we measure causally connected. It would also turn any curvature that existed in the early Universe and super rapidly expand the radius of curvature, making everything look geometrically flat. It would ALSO wash out any primordial density of exotic particles, because all of a sudden space is now e^60 times bigger than it is now.</p>
<p>This sudden, powerful expansion of space would produce a stochastic gravitational wave background in the Universe. These gravitational waves would distort the patterns we see in the CMB. These CMB distortions are what BICEP and a whole class of current and future experiments are trying to measure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this context, flat means &quot;not curved&quot; rather than &quot;much smaller in one direction than in another&quot;. It's easiest to get the distinction by thinking in two-dimensions rather than in three.</p>
<p>Basically, there are three possible &quot;curvatures&quot; for the universe. The two-dimensional analogs of these can be identified as</p>
<ol>
<li>The surface of a ball, or a sphere, which we called &quot;closed&quot;;</li>
<li>An infinite flat surface like a table top, which we call &quot;flat&quot;;</li>
<li>An infinite Pringles chip (or saddle) type shape, which we call &quot;open&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to distinguish these is by drawing triangles on them. If you draw a triangle on the surface of a ball and add up the angles inside, you get something greater than 180^(o). If you do the same for the table top, you get exactly 180^(o). Finally, if you do it on the saddle, you get something less than 180^(o). So there is a <em>geometrical</em> difference between the three possibilities.</p>
<p>When /u/spartanKid says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we measure the Universe to be geometrically very close to flatness</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He means that an analysis of the available data indicates that our universe is probably flat, or that, if it isn't flat, then it's close enough that we can't yet tell the difference. For example, imagine that you went outside and draw a triangle on the ground. You would probably find that, to within your ability to measure, the angles add up to 180^(o). However, if you were able to draw a triangle that was sufficiently large, you would find that the angles are, in fact, larger than 180^(o). In this way, you could conclude that the surface on which you live is <em>not</em> flat (you live on an approximate sphere). In a similar way, cosmologists have made measurements of things like the microwave background and found that the results are consistent with flatness up to our ability to measure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw an explanation for this in another thread a few days ago and I'm not sure I can find it again , so just a disclaimer - this may not be correct (in which case, someone correct me). From what I understand from that thread is that in a flat universe, lines are straight as opposed to curving over long distances. If you start at any point and head in one direction, you'll just keep going and never get back to the place you started at, or you'll reach the point where it ends. </p>
<p>For a curved universe, if you head in any direction and go far enough, you'll eventually come back to where you were before. Think of it like earth. Start basically anywhere and head west - eventually you'll come back to the point where you started. A curved universe is a similar principle as it curves back in on itself. By contrast, a flat universe is like a flat earth - you can walk in any direction for a long distance and eventually you'll reach the end of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To summarize, and to test whether I understand this correctly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We have observations about the current state of the universe that that the linear expansion we observe today cannot fully explain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A period of very rapid inflation would resolve many of these discrepancies but we didn't have direct evidence for it</p>
</li>
<li>Recent observation of gravitational waves provides some direct evidence that this inflationary model correctly describes the early universe</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. Except that the third point should read &quot;recent observations of the effects of gravitational waves&quot;. They gravity waves themselves weren't observed directly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientists have measured the EFFECTS of a specific type of gravitational wave in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). </p>
<p>These gravitational waves produce very specific distortions within the CMB pattern. The size of these patterns tell us the energy contained within these gravitational waves. These gravitational waves are the product of what is called Inflation. Inflation says that the Universe underwent a period of exponential expansion very early after the Big Bang. The more energy in the gravitational waves, the stronger the distortions are, and the higher the energy of Inflation. </p>
<p>Inflation is a modification to the original Big Bang model that helps resolve some problems with it. </p></div>		</li>
