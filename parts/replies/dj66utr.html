			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a special exemption for <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162" target="_blank">certain employees of publicly traded companies</a>.  Specifically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the case of any publicly held corporation, no deduction shall be allowed under this chapter for applicable employee remuneration with respect to any covered employee to the extent that the amount of such remuneration for the taxable year with respect to such employee exceeds $1,000,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With certain exceptions including:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other performance-based compensation: The term “applicable employee remuneration” shall not include any remuneration payable solely on account of the attainment of one or more performance goals, but only if—</p>
<p>(i) the performance goals are determined by a compensation committee of the board of directors of the taxpayer which is comprised solely of 2 or more outside directors,</p>
<p>(ii) the material terms under which the remuneration is to be paid, including the performance goals, are disclosed to shareholders and approved by a majority of the vote in a separate shareholder vote before the payment of such remuneration, and</p>
<p>(iii) before any payment of such remuneration, the compensation committee referred to in clause (i) certifies that the performance goals and any other material terms were in fact satisfied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that's a pretty broad definition of attainment of performance goals, which means executive compensation becomes a sort of kabuki dance between companies and executives where most of their compensation comes in the form of a performance based bonus rather than base pay, and <em>lots</em> of negotiation over what the performance measures will be and at the end both employer and employee expect almost all the bonus targets to be achieved in most circumstances.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>The question is about society and how CEOs respond to it. Not payment structures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. The bonuses could still be sky high in a bad business period if they are pegged to the right metrics. Remember the bonuses reported right after the 2008 meltdown?  Even then, they are sticking to the contract, getting the most they can by the terms of the contract. The whole thing about the Japanese CEOs is that they voluntarily take less than their contract says. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mention that it must be &quot;tied to performance,&quot; but in what way would a financial auditor measure performance? What's stopping Joe CEO from saying &quot;I'm doing <em>exceptionally well</em>, I deserve a $50 million bonus&quot; even though he has done nothing except typical revenue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The law specifies these tests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other performance-based compensation: The term “applicable employee remuneration” shall not include any remuneration payable solely on account of the attainment of one or more performance goals, but only if—</p>
<p>(i) the performance goals are determined by a compensation committee of the board of directors of the taxpayer which is comprised solely of 2 or more outside directors,</p>
<p>(ii) the material terms under which the remuneration is to be paid, including the performance goals, are disclosed to shareholders and approved by a majority of the vote in a separate shareholder vote before the payment of such remuneration, and</p>
<p>(iii) before any payment of such remuneration, the compensation committee referred to in clause (i) certifies that the performance goals and any other material terms were in fact satisfied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which means Joe CEO's goals are anything he can get &quot;2 or more outside directors who comprise the compensation committee&quot;, and the shareholders to approve.  Then the compensation committee needs to certify meeting the goals, after that it qualifies and he's getting his bonus.  What it should prevent are after the fact decisions (the shareholders must vote before payment), so if he can get the compensation and shareholders to approve of a bonus plan that pays a $50 million dollar bonus for typical revenue production he'd get it, but it's going to be difficult for him to get them approve a change, if the goal had previously been 15% revenue growth.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah okay, that's a wonderful description. So essentially it's just up to the shareholders and a couple of board  members to decide what to compensate and what the goals are huh?</p></div>		</li>
