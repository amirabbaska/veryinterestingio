			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this: there is no <em>drinking water</em> shortage in Southern California. </p>
<p>There is an acute shortage of water for irrigating crops, watering golf courses, and washing cars. But there's plenty of water for everyone to drink. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The big thing is the crops. The car washing and golf course watering come from the same supply of water, so you have to ration it to save for agriculture. And ultimately the rationing doesn't really help that much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of a silly Idea I had when I was still in middle school.</p>
<p>Why don't we just make large, flat fields barely under high tide level at the beach, screen or something to keep animals out if needed.</p>
<p>High tide rolls in, covers a couple square miles of flat pavement in a half inch of water or so, a lip retains the water for as long as it can so it can evaporate, the process repeats itself forever, put more water vapor in the air, more rain, everyone wins?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll reduce drainage for rainstorms, increasing flooding. </p>
<p>Your salt bed would also have a reduced effect as the salt built up, taking longer and longer to evaporate. Unless you invest heavily in robots to clean it.</p></div>		</li>
