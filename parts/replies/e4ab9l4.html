			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my god, that;s great. It honestly feels as if dental science is still in such early stages. I'm terrified of losing my teeth, and have always had good hygiene and not a single filling, but recently despite the same maintenance ive always been doing, ive had a lot of serious dental issues. As a result I've done a lot of intense research on preventative measures, what I'm doing wrong etc. It seems a lot of what I've found is contradictory claims, confused ideas and some pretty big statements. It feels like a lot of people still have no real idea, and it's very frustrating.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But remineralizing teeth as they call it, is literally why there's fluoride in toothpaste

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't help that any products invented that tasted good (fluoride, filling material etc.) Or any other new product to improve your dental health are usually purchased by major dental manufactures and then discontinued. Anything that's a threat to the current norm. It's bogus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep like products with NovaMin. Ten years ago you could buy them in US stores. GSK bought NovaMin and was instantly persuaded to not sell it in the US. As licensing deals came up for other products (Burt’s Bees being one) they didn’t renew and the products disappeared overnight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dentistry industry is not monolithic, nor does it have a monopoly on product development. Anyone could make a profit developing and selling such a vaccine, if indeed the vaccine works and can be manufactured at scale for a reasonable cost. My guess would be that it doesn't, or it can't.</p>
