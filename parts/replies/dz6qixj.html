			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a discrimination problem and general ignorance of our legal system.  It doesn’t mean that the system is bad or wrong.</p>
<p>Our legal system is built on the premise that the accused is assumed to be innocent until proven guilty.  If you look at an arrest photo and see a guilty person you are doing it wrong.  I wouldn’t want to live in a country where a mere accusation marked me as guilty.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry, but you live on a planet where a mere accusation can taint you for life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but a person should be allowed to request it be unpublished if they aren't charged with a crime, and I'd certainly have it illegal for 3rd parties to extort money from people by publishing arrest records and charging money for takedowns.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was. I forgot to pay a ticket for a rolling stop violation. Two years later I was pulled over and got taken to jail because of a warrant for my arrest for the ticket. My&quot;arrest&quot; was in the paper and everything. Obviously I just paid it and left it was no big deal but the fact of the matter was that I was put in cuffs and taken to jail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. in some states you are given a default court date which is the deadline for paying the ticket. So you don't pay, you missed court, you go to jail.</p></div>		</li>
