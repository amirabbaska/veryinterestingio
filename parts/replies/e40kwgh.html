			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. They’re probably not but bacteria can be very resilient, and deodorant will take away the smell temporary, but as you wear them again it will mix with the dead skin and sweat and get broken down by the bacteria causing more smell, and more bacteria, </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly, I don’t know haha but I do know it has to be around what your normal food freezer is set on, about minus 5-10 to make sure they don’t survive, </p>
<p>You can always put them in plastic bags and then stick them in your freezer </p></div>		</li>
