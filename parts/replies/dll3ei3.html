			<div class="markdown"><p>Your description of blood groups is partially correct, but you totally contradict yourself. You start by saying &quot;O- lack blood antibodies&quot; and then go on to say &quot;if you are - you have anti Rh [...] O- have antibodies that are anti A and B&quot;. Which one is it? By this logic AB+ would be the tastiest for mosquitos.</p>
<p>Anyway, it doesn't really make much sense that mosquitos would be concerned with these three specific types of antibody out of the hundreds of thousands that all human blood contains, regardless of blood type.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And against that well reasoned argument, I'm AB+ and I'm the first to get bitten in any crowd. I slather on bug spray and still get bitten. I get bitten during times of day when no one else even notices a mosquito. I'm not a noticeable mega-sweater, and since I work out in the evenings I tend to shower twice daily (once before work, once after work out). Nothing that I've read corresponds with me being any different than any other person, and yet I get feasted on. Guess I'm just dee-licious!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same way. O- and the bugs just don't touch me.  I can work up a good sweat backpacking and even when everyone else has to put bug spray on at night I don't need to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So everyone has different surface bacteria as well. And everyone eats a different diet. Is it reasonable to think that even different populations of mosquitos are looking for different things? It seems like too many factors for anyone to really tie down.</p></div>		</li>
