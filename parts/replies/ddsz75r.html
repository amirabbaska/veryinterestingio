			<div class="markdown"><p>Most smartphones are now smart enough not to keep topping itself up just barely all the time. Just like laptops, they only charge if they drop below a certain percentage (e.g. 95%). Your iPhone likely can be charged to 110% of what is displayed. That's why it takes quite a few minutes of use before your phone drops to 99% from 100. So when your phone is plugged in overnight, it's drawing standby power from the power cord, and is not topping itself up very often at all - maybe once at most.</p></div>		</li>
