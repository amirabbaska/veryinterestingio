			<div class="markdown"><p>Some research I did based on the Banfield database (a network of primary care veterinary clinics in the Lower 48) seemed to indicate that dental cleaning has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on survival that is not just a consequence of regular vet visits. We are working on that manuscript and are hoping to submit something later this year.</p>
<p>Other than that, keeping your dog at a healthy weight, regularly exercised and up-to-date on its vaccines, dewormers, heartworm, flea and tick preventatives is a good thing to do. Yearly vet exams are probably also beneficial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a stupid question at all, and <em>yes</em> you should get them dental cleaning. Plaque builds up on their teeth same as ours, and they rot same as ours, and they run the risk of fatal heart disease from infected gums same as us.</p>
<p>The good news is that is a fairly cheap operation and your vet can do it when combined with other operations- it does require, for most dogs, that the animal is sedated. The even better news is that you can do a good deal of preventive maintenance by brushing their teeth with some regularity: once or twice a week at a minimum. The bad news is that you'll see why they need to be sedated :), but start small and easy and with a chicken-flavored toothpaste and they'll eventually get used to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would definitely cook fresh food for my dog if I knew it would benefit him, he's a 13 year old bassett hound with no sign of slowing down. Currently feeding him grain free and whatever my son throws from his high chair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently had to put my 15 (almost 16) year old basset down. Moving to grain free really improved her quality of life when we made the switch, which was when she was around 10. I wish we had done it sooner. My son is 4 - he still misses his doggie. :(  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just got my first basset hound and she is about 4 months. What is this grain free type of food that you guys are talking about and why is it so good for basset hounds?? Do you guys recommend me changing her food or wait for her to get older?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another redditor said below: </p>
<p>This link has some information which may assist you. It lists different toxins and nutrition requirements. Most vets will tell you as you can see in the link making your dogs food at home is inadvisable and can likely result in malnutrition or disease. Unless it is medically necessary I would caution you to only feed food made at home. No evidence supports this is better for dogs, in fact the evidence says it's incredibly dangerous.</p></div>		</li>
