			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard stories of organized crime families in NY and NJ investing heavily in hot dog carts. Good markup, lots of cash, and no paperwork. They'd buy a shitload of cheap hot dogs for a few cents each, dump them all in the river, then tell Uncle Sam they sold a shitload of hot dogs for a couple dollars each. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I like the pizza idea though. Just gotta remember to place orders for the raw materials for those ghost pizzas. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one of the ways laundering fronts get caught, expenses such as gas/electricity to power the ovens, water usage, raw materials, labor expense have to match the sales volume. </p>
<p>I'm sure there are laws/regulations around casinos having to declare earnings if a player wins above certain threshold. Doubt such rules exist for losing. A main casino on the vegas strip is probably more likely to follow the rules. But it's a good way to pass off $100k to a million on a one-time basis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There certainly are. If you win above a certain amount, the casino has to remove the taxes before you can leave with your winnings. I'm not sure if it varies state to state, but it was any winnings over $1200 the last I knew. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There's no real reason to care about the loser, unless they are both arrested at the poker table of course. But you don't have to declare lost money and the casino can't be tracking every losing customer!</p>
<p>But of course, they may notice that you are cooperating and report you both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it really matter who wins? Couldn't you just play normally for a bit then cash out, declaring that as your winnings even if it was less than you started with? I'm assuming that the money the other person is losing is coming from you anyway, not that that person is paying you through this method.</p></div>		</li>
