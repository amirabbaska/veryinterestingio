			<div class="markdown"><p>It amazes me how people with 0 work experience are our elected officials. Some kid I went to high school with ran for class president every year and always lost. that was 8 years ago, he has been running for state Assembly every year since and has literally never worked a job. The worst part is he will probably eventually win an election bc no one knows he can't do anything but take pictures in a suit </p></div>		</li>

<p>Hate the suits though. Don't think I can do suits or ties. I'm also uncomfortable with asking people for money. </p></div>		</li>
