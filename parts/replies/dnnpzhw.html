			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, also if you have a better diet your shit may not smell as bad as others. Shit smells worse the longer it sits in your colon so a low fiber diet can result in some stinky poos.</p>
<p>Additionally, each body has a different bacteria profile which affects how the food is digested and in effect can alter the scent of the feces. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe that's accurate at all. It isn't &quot;adapted to like it&quot; so much as having response to the variety of  chemicals excreted along with it. Endocrinologists have studied the hormones in feces.</p>
<p>It is slightly anecdotal, but I know of studies where if given a panel of shit you would like some, dislike others and strongly dislike a few.</p>
<p>Studies have been done along these lines with females responding to males' sweat and how there is a correlation with genetic diversity and hormone response.</p>
<p>these/similar/other hormones are also in shit, ie how you can study feces to determine pregnancy, stress or disease</p></div>		</li>
