			<div class="markdown"><p>If this is happening on a smart phone, you can use an app such as &quot;ShouldIAnswer&quot; that pulls spam numbers from a user generated database.  It will use a method of blocking that will automatically answer a spam number and immediately disconnect so that they don't reach your voice mail.  You will get the occasional new number that hasn't been flagged yet, but it will reduce the number of spam calls you get by a decent number. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They will often spoof the phone number, so this is somewhat questionable in utility, as it can appear to be anything, which gets around the blocker.  </p>
<p>There's a similar system built for IPv4 that blocks every malicious IP address, and it has currently worked its way through about 3/4 of the possible addresses, since they change over time and can be spoofed.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might just be a fishing expidition to find where the active phone users are. When I worked in a survey call center, some of our assignments were just ranges of numbers on the computer. Maybe I would be responsible for calling 757-555-0000 to 757-555-0499. I (the computer auto-dialer) would dial every number in that range; either giving the survey or recording a variety of incomplete responses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Line Disconnected</li>
<li>Line Busy</li>
<li>No answer</li>
<li>Voicemail</li>
<li>Respondent declined</li>
<li>Needs Spanish Caller</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if I didn't complete the survey, responses about the line activity can lead managers to select numbers to call again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gahhh yeah it sucks. I just hate that now they started masking with my area code since my dad is getting older and I'm always worried it's the hospital or something... Honestly the Caller ID apps work well that use crowd source reporting of spam. </p></div>		</li>
