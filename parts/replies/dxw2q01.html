			<div class="markdown"><p>A slightly of topic question I have always wondered but never seen bright up:
During CPR can the addition of something such as epinephrine help the heart to start beating again? I believe that epinephrine causes an increased heart rate when used under normal circumstances. Would this aid the efforts of CPR in any way, or are the mechanisms that would cause this effect just not functioning at that time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Epinephrine is used heavily during cardiac arrest! paramedics in the field, and nurses/doctors in the hospital administer loads and loads of epinephrine during CPR. It's in our ACLS (advanced cardiovascular life support) algorithms, which are basically flowsheets to follow when someone goes into cardiac arrest. </p>
<p>Epinephrine helps to increase blood pressure by constricting blood vessels, and can increase heart rate (a patient in cardiac arrest can still have electrical heart activity, it's just not in an organized rhythm which means blood isn't flowing anywhere) </p>
<p>Source: am EMT, just finished ACLS training as part of a paramedic program </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You give epi during cardiac arrests. It can help achieve ROSC however you have to remember that epi could give a rare steak a heartbeat. Sometimes the pulse you do achieve is purely off the drugs and will go away.</p></div>		</li>
