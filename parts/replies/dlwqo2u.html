			<div class="markdown"><p>Very concise answer, thank you! </p>
<p>I have a (maybe completely unrelated) follow-up question: in the number you just mentioned, where the sequence is a 1 followed by 1+n 0's,  I realize that it's not repeating, but a person or child could recognize the sequence and predict the next digit very easily through what most would call pattern-recognition skills. </p>
<p>Is the number you provided not considered to follow a pattern in spite of that? Or is this just me mixing up the verbiage of &quot;pattern&quot; in mathematics versus in common usage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if there is any relevant mathematical definition of &quot;pattern&quot;. liberulo's example certainly does not have a simply repeating pattern, making it irrational.</p>
<p>If it still has too much of a pattern for you, consider this number: </p>
<p>3.14152653587323...</p>
<p>It has the digits of pi with all the nines removed. If pi has no &quot;pattern&quot;, then I would say that this number has no pattern, either. But, this number is not normal; it doesn't contain &quot;9&quot; or &quot;95&quot; or &quot;0009&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotcha. Thanks for continuing to explain! I guess that yeah there might just not be any significance to the word &quot;pattern&quot; mathematically, so I guess an irrational number could have any sort of pattern, as long as there isn't one sequence that repeats itself indefinitely (or ya know if the number ends) </p></div>		</li>

<p>Predictability; if I don't tell you a digit, can you determine what it is based on neighboring values</p></div>		</li>

<p>A good definition comes from information theory. A pattern can be thought of as a sequence of information. If a sequence has no information, it isn't a pattern. A random sequence with a uniform distribution of symbols is impossible to predict without resorting to guessing, and is as &quot;patternless&quot; as you can get.</p>
<p>In your example, say that pi's digits are random, and every digit appears just as frequently as every other. In this case, pi can be said to have no pattern. If you know the digits of pi to a certain number of digits, you will have no information about the next digit, no matter what. In this case, an optimal algorithm would guess the next digit correctly 10% of the time, no matter what algorithm was used. In the same way, if you try to guess coinflips, you will be right 50% of the time no matter what algorithm you use; whether you alternate between guessing heads and tails, guess tails all the time, or only guess tails every fifth flip, it won't affect your average accuracy. There is no information in the sequence.</p>
<p>However, if you remove all the 9s, then a pattern emerges; namely, the lack of nines. Now, I have a small bit of info, so if you asked me to guess the next digit, I would make sure not to guess nine. Even though the technical number of possible states are the same(it's still a base 10 number), the observed number of possible states are less, and that constitutes a pattern.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, anywhere where you observe an informational &quot;foothold&quot;, that's a pattern. Even things never happening, or things always happening, are patterns, they're just patterns that are so predictable, you take them for granted and put them out of your mind. Whereas with rolling a dice, the ONLY thing you know for certain is that you won't roll a 7.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the following decimal construction. Define a number who's decimal digits will have an alternating sequence of a single 1 followed by a number of zeros defined by the digits of pi excluding the zero digits. You have the randomness of pi so you can't use pattern recognition. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being able to predict the next digit means that the number is computable. Most irrational numbers - Pi, e, sqrt(2), whatever - are computable.</p>
<p>However, &quot;repeating patterns&quot; in this context refers to the concept that if the number has a finite number of repeating patterns then it can be reduced to a rational number, but the example above can not.</p></div>		</li>
