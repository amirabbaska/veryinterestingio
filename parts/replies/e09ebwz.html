			<div class="markdown"><p>But CNG tanks are different than propane / LPG tank. Can they be re-certified tho?</p>
<p>I'd be willing to get it re-certified than changing it considering the cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CNG tanks are expensive as hell and worth rectifying. Propane tanks are cheap and are not. The only ones really bothering are those propane tank exchange places you see out front of stores. You know, the ones that rip you off by giving you 15lbs instead of 20lbs. They ‘underfill for safety purposes’. The safety of their wallets. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Tanks are good for 12 years and then you can recertify them for 5 years. If you have a standard 20 gallon tank, the kind that you connect to your grill, you can just take an expired tank to one of those exchange places and exchange your tank for a current one. Home Depot and Lowes both offer exchanges and will exchange an expired tank.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just hopping in to say this information is accurate to propane tanks, but not natural gas. Also, those exchange programs do not always give you a new tank, often it's a recertified tank from 1988 that's been repainted about a thousand times, each time it came in to be exchanged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are they actually recertified though? </p>
<p>I thought they stamped a new date on them when they recertify, but I’ve definitely gotten exchanges that were expired with now recert stamp. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking about the Blue Rhino thing, that's convenient if you don't use a lot of propane, but the propane is more expensive. If you take a cylinder to get filled, you get 20 lbs of propane, but if you go to a cylinder-exchange place, most of the time it's 15 lbs for about the same price. I mean, it's fair since they're removing an expense for the customer, but it's something to be aware of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. Very good advice. I would only use those services to exchange an expired tank. Otherwise propane is MUCH cheaper at a gas station or other place that sells propane and propane accessories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>unlikely. unless you leave it in particularly corrosive conditions, there are far more delicate parts that should fail long before the walls of the tank break down. </p></div>		</li>
