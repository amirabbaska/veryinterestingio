			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a neat question roughly a week ago on r/science (or somewhere similar) asking how deep sea fish sleep. The consensus was that they operate off of many smaller sleep cycles rather than just one. I can’t necessarily provide sources on this as it’s from comments, but if you want to learn more about it that might provide you a direction to search.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there is no animal that doesn't sleep. There are animals that have irregular sleep cycles, but have evolved around this propensity. I can't recall what species they are, but there are some pretty fascinating creatures out there with strange sleep behaviors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned about how white tail deer and dolphins sleep, it blew my mind. Deer are essentially semi conscious. They'll have their eyes open and ears up more often than not and will easily wake to any movement or sound. Dolphins supposedly sleep half their brain at a time so they're always up and moving (I wonder if that means they act like idiots when one half is asleep)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_insomnia" target="_blank">Fatal insomnia</a> takes months to years to kill you. Average survival time is 18 months. However, it isn't entirely clear whether the death is a direct effect of lack of sleep, or a side effect of the neurodegenerative process which causes the development of insomnia in the first place.</p>
<p>We know that rats will die after about a month without sleep from an experiment done back in the 1980s, but it still isn't clear <em>why</em> they died, just that they all did.</p>
<p>No human outside of a disease state is known to have died directly from sleep deprivation as far as I know, but it is likely that if anyone did, it wasn't really well monitored.</p></div>		</li>
