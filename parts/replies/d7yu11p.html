<p>Leaving the light on for one day would propel the flashlight to about 0.009 m/s or almost 1 cm per second. Unfortunately, operating a 3 W LED for a day uses about 260 kJ of energy. Regular AA batteries have somewhere around 10 kJ of energy (depending on the type). And at a weight of 20-30 grams per battery, you can't carry put more than 2-3 in the device without violating our original assumption of a 100 gram device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That... that's actually way way way faster than I would have expected, even acknowledging the lack of batteries that would provide the necessary energy at the required weight. Awesome calculation... thanks!</p>
<p>Suppose we were to create the usually-a-joke &quot;solar powered flashlight&quot; and keep it in that weight profile. I'm not sure of the efficiency of our best solar cells currently, and I'm not sure it would be sufficient to generate 3W even if all the battery weight was replaced with a solar system, but at whatever trickle it gave, would that provide a basically unlimited (albeit ridiculously low power) propulsion system? Does the acceleration continue to build up over time (1cm/s day 1, 2cm/s day 2, etc) or would it hit an exceedingly low maximum speed in relatively short order (ignoring the effects of gravity and such). I'm having amusing visions of a tiny flashlight puttering off through deep space for all eternity. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're suggesting is an inefficient approach to building a &quot;solar sail&quot;. Instead of catching the sunlight with a solar panel, converting it to electricity and then using said electricity to power a flashlight, with losses at every step along the way, you can simply take a large reflective surface and let the sunlight bounce off it.</p>
<p>The incoming sunlight has some momentum and when reflected completely, the outgoing light has equal and opposite momentum, which means that the net gain in momentum by the spacecraft is twice the momentum of the incoming light. By changing the angle of the reflective surface with respect to the incoming sunlight, you can steer the craft.</p>
<p>You'll only ever be able to move away from the sun in this way, not closer. But the same is true if you would capture the light with solar cells and use it to power a flashlight (which can shine in arbitrary direction), since capturing the light with a solar panel also causes a momentum transfer from the sunlight to the craft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was with you until &quot;the net gain in momentum by the spacecraft is twice the momentum of the incoming light.&quot;  </p>
<p>Is that accurate? If your only input into the system in the momentum of the incoming light, there's no way the spacecraft gains twice that? Isn't some of the momentum transferred to the reflecting light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you could keep the flashlight turned on indefinitely, and ignore all other outside forces. The flashlight would keep accelerating. Inertia of the flashlight will keep the speed of all the previous days, and the light will keep accelerating the flashlight. Given enough time (and assuming it's not acted upon by any other forces) the flashlight will approach the speed of light. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's worth clarifying that &quot;low speeds&quot; is anything slow compared to the <em>speed of light.</em> This is basically everything that we experience daily, except (of course) light.</p>
<p>As stated, at low speeds, the equations do align, but they are both still mere descriptions of the same thing.</p>
<p>Newtonian and relativistic approaches describe the same things, just with different levels of accuracy, depending on the context.</p>
<p>It's just one of those things that I didn't realise until too late, so I thought I'd share for anyone in a similar situation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reposting a comment I made about this a couple weeks ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's true that p=mv, but that's only generally true for classical physics. You need relativity to understand why photons have no mass, but still have momentum. The relativistic relation between energy and momentum is:</p>
<p>E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^(2))^2</p>
<p>This is the real reason behind the famous E=mc^(2): If p (momentum) = 0, then E=mc^(2).  But also notice that if m=0, you have </p>
<p>E=pc</p>
<p>Photons have no mass, but they <em>do</em> have energy, which is</p>
<p>E = h*f</p>
<p>Where h is Plank's constant and f is the frequency of the light.  So higher frequency (bluer) light has more energy and thus more momentum than lower-frequency (redder) light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Combining those equations gives p=hf/c.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only in the classical mechanics. The equation in special relativity is:</p>
<p>E^2 = (m c^2 )^2 + p^2 c^2</p>
<p>m is mass, E is energy, p is momentum, c is the speed of light. When m = 0, the equation reduces to:</p>
<p>E = p c</p>
<p>Also, when a massive object is stationary, p = 0, so you get:</p>
<p>E = m c^2</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it worthwhile to point out a consequence of the Einstein mass-energy-momentum relations that is easy to see, but not necessarily emphasized enough. It is particularly relevant to earlier mentions about EMDrives and Newton's third law.</p>
<p>The consequence is this:</p>
<p>Eprop &gt;= pc</p>
<p>where Eprop is the &quot;propulsive energy&quot;, that is, the energy required to generate momentum p using a reaction engine. This input energy must always be at least pc. In an &quot;ordinary&quot; rocket engine, this energy is supplied primarily in the form of the rest mass energy Er = mc^2 of the rocket propellant. In a photon engine or other massless-propellant engine, <em>all</em> this energy has to be supplied by the power generator. This is why that photon engines are extremely inefficient. And there doesn't appear to be any way around it: Einstein's laws say that if you have that much momentum, then at least pc worth of energy MUST exist in that system, either in rest mass or in something else.</p>
<p>Any engine with even a small amount of massive propellant will, therefore, be FAR more efficient than a photonic engine. One can minimize the propellant arbitrarily by jacking the exhaust velocity. Of course, as the mass of propellant approaches 0, the bare minimum energy requirement from the power generator must approach pc. That's the main trouble, making an engine which can produce high thrust with very high exhaust velocities at a reasonable mass, of a massive propellant. Ideally we'd like a spacecraft that is more ship than it is propellant mass, but to do that we need insane exhaust velocity to reach any reasonable speeds.</p></div>		</li>
