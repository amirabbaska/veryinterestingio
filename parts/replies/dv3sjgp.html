			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on this, a lack of good sleep has been shown to lead to mental health issues, specifically anxiety and depression. It may be a cause and effect type thing- your lack of good sleep leading to some anxiety, thus your being more &quot;sensitive&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on this piggyback, I personally found that how &quot;heavy&quot; I slept, was very much a mental game. I'm a typically normal level sleeper.  I can sleep through some things, but it doesn't take much to wake me. </p>
<p>So...I did this little experiment.  I turned my alarm up realllly really loud for a while and put it somewhere moderately inconvenient, then stayed up too late, too many nights in a row.  I found that after a week or so, I became accustomed to the loud alarm, and could sleep through it.  After that, even with plenty of sleep, I could sleep through the alarm, <strong>or anything</strong>. </p>
<p>In order to overcome this new...heaviness of sleep, I did exactly the opposite. I first waited until I was going to bed at a reasonable time, then I set my alarm clock on one of the lowest volumes.  The first night, I woke up what felt like dozens of times making sure I hadn't over slept.  I, again, continued with the low volume for a while, and consequently I became a very light sleeper.  <strong>Any</strong> unexpected noise became an alarm for me. </p>
<p>I now keep my alarm at a normal volume.  Nothing too quite, but nothing that would bother my neighbors either. These days, I love how well I sleep.</p>
<p>So, <strong>tl;dr</strong> I agree with the above comment regarding some type of anxiety being related to you being a light sleeper.  That doesn't mean it's depression or health.  For me, being concerned about oversleeping/missing my alarm, caused me to wake up more than necessary, and to any noise. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I sleep the same way. Extremely light some 90% of the time, especially falling asleep. But apparently have times of very deep sleep, usually in the middle of the night. I thought only deep sleep was associated with apnea. Makes me question why I'm such a light sleeper. I hate it. I feel so finicky that it gives me anxiety to sleep away from my own bed, like vacations or at other ppls houses and such. I and completely unable to fall asleep unless its absolutely quite. It drives me nuts that I'm this way. Were you able to not be such a light sleeper? Do you have sleep apnea? Very interesting. Thanks for some insight! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep apnea is a sleep-breathing condition. The eli5 is that you stop breathing in your sleep, briefly wake up to breathe, then fall back asleep again. You don't fully wake up, so you don't know that it is happening. It disrupts normal sleep patterns, which could possibly reduce the amount of deep sleep you get. I'm not saying that you or anyone else has it, because it can't be diagnosed that simply (although one of the tests is really easy to take). I personally don't have it, but it runs in my family. It's also incredibly common in general, although severe cases are rare.</p>
<p>For your particular case, you should absolutely get checked out. Sleeping should never be a stressful activity. It's possible that you have some other problem as well, or it could merely be some bad habits. All of these things are fixable, so there's nothing to worry over if you go see a doctor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see, thank you! It feels very environmental to me for why I cant sleep. Not so much my own body, I sleep great by myself or when I'm at home and my husband isnt snoring. I just long to be able to fall asleep without such specific needs being met. But ill try and see how I can improve my own sleeping habits, maybe that will help. Thank you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe I have sleep apnea, though I suspect my husband may, as he's a heavy snorer and he does the waking up and breathing and falling back asleep thing. But I'm the exact same way, I can't sleep in anyone else's house, not even on my own couch. I once had an overnight bus ride back home that was about 14 hours and I couldn't sleep. And when I'm extremely tired, it's harder for me to sleep as opposed to if I went to sleep moderately tired. But the weird thing is I don't feel bad if I get very little/no sleep but I'm exhausted if I sleep 7+ hours. Ugh I'm a mess! Glad to know I'm not alone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well now I feel like an oddball because I seem to be a &quot;deep sleeper&quot; but with very specific exceptions. I've slept through earthquakes and roommates having loud sex but I will wake up instantly if I hear my mom's voice, either of our service dogs whining, or if I smell anything vaguely like burning (which means nobody can cook bacon without waking me up, boo. but I'm better than our flaky ass smoke detector at notifying people something in the house is on fire, yay.) and these things will wake me up regardless of what stage of sleep I'm in. I've been woken up by my mom talking both when I was just barely starting to doze off and while I was in the middle of dreaming, which suggests it's the specific stimulus causing me to wake up rather than me being in one or another specific stage of sleep that is &quot;lighter&quot; than others, especially considering dreams happen during one of the &quot;deeper&quot; sleep stages.</p>
<p>Is there an explanation you know of for why these kinds of exceptions happen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a bit beyond me, but suffice to say that being in a deep sleep doesn't guarantee that you'll sleep through anything. I can't really give you anything specific beyond that. I'm just a layman who has more reason than most to know some basics about sleep science.</p>
<p>There is always the possibility of confirmation bias here or there too. It's possible you sleep through some of this stuff and, for obvious reasons, never know. It's also possible that you are sensative to particular stimuli. &quot;Self-diagnosis&quot; in terms of sleep-related stuff is very tricky because your mind is working differently when you are asleep, particularly around times when you are going down or about to wake up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Confirmation bias is definitely a possibility. The thing about bacon/burning smell waking me up was something I hadn't noticed, my mom was the one who pointed it out to me. But that doesn't exclude confirmation bias for the other two. I'm gonna have to find a way to objectively track this stuff now, lol, cuz I'm curious.</p></div>		</li>
