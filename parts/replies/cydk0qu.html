<p>but there are a couple of IQ tests explicitly intended in conjunction with ADHD.</p>

<p>Which tests are targeted at ADHD folks? Those tests would be really interesting for me to look at because I look at the relationship between persistence and intelligence (both performance and ability).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You actually do not. What this person likely means is that their cognitive functioning in the areas that tend to be associated with right or left hemispheric functioning were measured at different levels.  Due to individual variation in how the brain delegates functions to different regions, this typically isn't a very informative way to think about things.</p></div>		</li>
