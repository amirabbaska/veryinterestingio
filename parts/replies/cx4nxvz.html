			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation! The only thing that I would add is that a lot of these treatments are shown to be effective in culture (cells/bacteria/viruses grown in plates, flasks, and Petri dishes). Most culture conditions are designed to keep the organism of choice happy but aren't necessarily representative of the conditions that, say a cell, would be under in something like a mouse or a person. Because of this, unforeseen interactions between the treatment and other components in the body can reduce how effective a treatment is.</p>
<p>Additionally, when a treatment is shown to be effective in something like a mouse model it is important to keep in mind that the mouse model is designed to have the given illness. It is generally easier to fix something artificial like this as the mechanisms for why that disease develops as a result of the graft or insult is better understood than when it occurs naturally.</p>
<p>To fit it into the baseball analogy:</p>
<p>--It's like your new special bat is really effective in little league. But as you advance through the age groups and other kids around you get better and have more tricks of their own it becomes less of an advantage. Eventually when you reach the big leagues the talent around you is so good and has been able to adapt to so many other tricks that they've seen in the past that it isn't really worth using the special bat anymore.</p>
<p>--The second component would be more like if you started using a special ball that made your special bat even more effective. Of course it looks great with your special ball, you designed it to do just that. But when you go back to using the ball that everybody is used to the bat just isn't as good anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to piggy back onto this comment since you bringing up that these &quot;treatments&quot; that we read about are usually done in petri dishes.  This is actually the more correct answer. After this step you must do the following. </p>
<ul>
<li>Found something that works in Petri Dish</li>
<li>Animal testing</li>
<li>apply for Investigational New Drug (IND)</li>
<li>3 phases of human testing</li>
<li>FDA review of testing</li>
<li>Apply for New Drug Application (NDA)</li>
<li>FDA decides to file or not </li>
<li>FDA reviews</li>
</ul>
<p>Just the last FDA review process takes about a year.  Imagine how long each of those steps takes previous to that.  Getting money, resources, testing locations, etc etc.  </p>
<p>I'm exhausted just thinking about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solid addition.  I don't think any one answer is more &quot;correct&quot; than the other.  It's a complex process that you can focus on the business side like the OP, small scale science, or bigger picture approval process.  All of the components are important in drug/therapy development.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it though?  I mean, it would disperse the fluid containing the cancer cells, but I don't imagine they'd die right away.  You'd have little tiny globs of cancer cells all over the table, they could last quite a while.  </p>
<p>EDIT: Everyone below me has very valid points.  As of Wed Nov 18 15:12:53 EST.  Anything posted after that I cannot vouch for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a scientist -- I think the kinds of problems listed here explain very little of the issue that OP is asking about. I think the problem is more like:</p>
<p>Billy shows that his prototype is easier to hold than the other bats. He publishes his study showing easier bat-holding. Journalists read the study and write a press release proclaiming BILLY MADE A BETTER BAT. You read the press release on reddit.</p>
<p>Follow-up studies show the bat is easier to hold, but it doesn't increase the number of balls Billy hits, the distance the balls fly when hit, or the number of games won when using the new bat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, it's usually PR people who write the press releases and send it to journalists, who then publish it to fill space even though it's not a conclusive study. Journalists on a deadline aren't going to read a study in-depth unless it's a really big, done deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, the journalists rarely read the studies. Instead they read the research lab's press release, and neglect to investigate the studies shortcomings. The editor gives it a click-bait headline loaded with hyperbole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and that is sometimes problematic when it comes to press releases coming from pharmaceutical companies... they sometimes try to make their drug sound better than it actually is by using relative risk assessments to make the positive aspects sound better, and absolute risk to downplay the side effects or negative aspects. There are other tactics they use, but those are two of the more popular ones in press releases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great ELI5. I would add the following:</p>
<p><strong>Not actually effective</strong>. Perhaps Billy is a great hitter anyway and he compared his results with league averages, which has worse hitters on average. Or perhaps it was just a lucky streak and over longer testing it doesn't do any better.</p>
<p><strong>Time to market</strong>. Perhaps the bat is perfectly fine, but it requires years of statistical testing and tweaking, study to determine what are the properties that make it a better bat, design improvements, regulatory approval, and will become a regularly used bat in about 10 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the point is that this is not at all an exhaustive list. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of potential barriers which could prevent the item ever becoming useful on a significant scale. And a vast majority of them have to be tested, especially in medicine, in order to ensure that this superficially useful method or product conforms to every code. </p>
<p>A single test in a thousand could reveal that the product is unfit for production because it falls just a tiny bit under the desired outcome for a specific test. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I think this is a huge part of it.  Subby says &quot;never hear about it [again],&quot; but it hasn't been very long since the first mention.  Subby just hasn't heard about it again <em>yet</em>.</p></div>		</li>
