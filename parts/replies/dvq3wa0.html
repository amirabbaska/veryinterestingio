			<div class="markdown"><p>You've piqued my interest. I've noted that my doberman is left pawed, she will not ahake her right paw whereas my lab is ambidexterous but leads with the right. Both dogs are female, what and how many breeds did you test?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tested whatever I could get my hands on in the dog park and tbh my testing wasn't rigorous. It was only a highschool experiment afterall. As to the experiments conducted, each instance taints the likelihood of a trained response of the next test so repeated testing often results in a trained paw preference, the same for if you test a preference based on 'shake'. I don't have the source for the experiment run in the 60's cuz it was a newspaper clipping but I remember they noticed a huge discrepancy for their Dalmatian population with 80ish percent being preferential to their left of the females and only 60 percent of the males. Other species had varying results but were noticeably skewed to the left preferential.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My  Samoyed is so strongly right pawed that the muscles have shortened on that side.  To make a sharp left turn,   she makes three small right circles (kind of like an incomplete command/option symbol on an Apple keyboard. It kept her from obtaining her herding instinct certification and massage therapy was only minimally helpful because her paw dominance is so very strong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My male cat I've noticed has a right paw preference. Whenever he plays with toys or swats at my hand it is always with the right paw first (I say first because sometimes he will play with both hands)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the primary determinant for a paw preference, whichever they use first. Though it is important to note many factors in such tests, the side of approach, trained responses, injury and parent preferences. </p>
<p>Try taking note of other cats, their division by sex and breed and any patterns you might observe as such.</p></div>		</li>
