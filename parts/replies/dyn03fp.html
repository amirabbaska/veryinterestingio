			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the reason for this seemingly &quot;carefree&quot; attitude about working with Radium is because knowledge of it's dangers were <em>NOT</em> common knowledge - people higher up in the company were aware, but they kept it to themselves.  It was fairly new science that wasn't being taught readily and most who worked with it didn't even know there was anything to be concerned about.  That changed though, as people started getting sick and dying from exposure and eventually banded together to sue the company for not making the risks clear (read up on the Radium Girls - interesting history).</p></div>		</li>
