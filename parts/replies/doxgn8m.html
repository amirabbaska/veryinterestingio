			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also modify pushups in the other direction, making them significantly harder (mostly through increased leverage):  </p>
<ul>
<li>hands together pushups  </li>
<li>forward lean pushups (putting your center of gravity forward, increasing both leverage on shoulders and total body mass lifted)  </li>
<li>decline pushups (mentioned by others)</li>
<li>handstand pushups  </li>
<li>planche  </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: at no point do you lift 100% of your own body mass, since your hands and forearms are always at rest and all of the motion is above the elbow. </p>
<p>Edit: body segment weight data as measured by Paolo de Leva says that hands and forearms average <a href="http://www.exrx.net/Kinesiology/Segments.html" target="_blank">4.46% of body weight for men, and 3.88% for women</a>.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are doing kipping HSPU you use momentum from your hips/legs and you push a much smaller % of your body. Also if you are doing it against a wall (not freestanding) a small amount of your weight is transferred to the wall.</p>
<p>My point is depending how you do it, it might not be near 90%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would be lifting everything above the last point of articulation (your shoulders), plus a percentage of the weight between the first and last points of articulation (wrists and shoulders basically).  Probably really difficult to figure out the exact numbers since as you shift your weight on your hands different muscles are activating to take some of the load off.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can use the stairs to make pushups easier or harder.</p>
<p>Easier: Start with your hands on the 4th step up, then work your way down as you get better at them.</p>
<p>Harder: Start with your feet on the 1st step, and work your way up as you get better at them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then chop off your arms at the elbows and weigh them.  Subtract this from the total since you arent using muscles to hold them, lol.  </p>
<p>Of course, if you do it with your forearms at an angle, you'll have to do some trig and use a little bit of statics to figure out how much to subtract.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a cool idea. I was thinking of loading up your back with additional weights to the point that you can barely do one push-up. Then compare with how much max weight you can bench press.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very similar, just think of the angle your body and arms make with each other at the end of each, so it's not 'quite' the same... pushup is like a 'decline bench-press' towards the end, so using lower pecs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok I did it.</p>
<p>Body weight: 207 lb</p>
<p>Weight in plank position with hands on scale: 161 lb</p>
<p>On average, an arm weighs about ~5% of total body weight, so let's call it 20 lb for both arms.</p>
<p>151 / 207 is 73%. </p>
<p>I can bang out 40 pushups no problem but I could only bench 150 about 15 times. ymmv</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The floor is stationary though. You're likely benching free weight. Try pressing 160lbs on a bench machine. Curious if you can do around 40 reps. </p></div>		</li>
