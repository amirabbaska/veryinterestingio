			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, and if that person is good enough, they can adjust the slice thickness subtly to allow for extra time if a replacement carved item is taking longer than expected, or demand is higher than expected. But mostly they are there to induce guilt at over-consuming carvery items.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is why you will never see a buffet without a time limit.</p>

<p>The rest of what you say sounds correct, but this is not my experience. The majority of buffets I've been to are open all day, as part of how the restaurant operates. A few restaurants I know of have the buffet only at certain times. And a lot of the all-day buffets change out what is offered, only having certain foods for limited times. </p>
<p>But I've never encountered one that had any time limit on how long you were to stay. And those that have limited buffet hours have a long time, far longer than anyone ever actually stays, so I can't see how they serve as time limits. </p>
<p>The main tools I see in trying to get customers out the door are no longer bringing refills, asking for desert, or offering to bring you your check--though most buffets I'm aware of have you pay either up front or on the way out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are psychological limits rather than actual limits. Most places I have seen the time limit is 1.5-2 hours, which I agree is much longer than most people will sit (although I have experienced my fair share of marathon eaters), but knowing there is a time limit encourages people to load up faster at the beginning, get full faster and leave faster. I am sure there are some buffets that don't have this time limit, but in my experience most do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also point out that the above tactics don't work for non-buffet all-you-can-eat operations (like some sushi joints). I have never worked in that environment, so I can't speak to their tactics, but I am sure things like adjust the ration of garnish to protein as the meal progresses, extra water, longer wait times between waiter visits, that sort of thing all come into play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those places typically limit how much you can order in one round and may bring the dishes out one at a time so you have more time to start feeling full before more food arrives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only tactic I've seen work for a buffet was an infuriating '40 per table max' limit on sashimi. Other than that, maybe the threat of paying for the leftovers do well in keeping customers from ordering far more than they can possibly eat - or at least from ordering it all at once, giving you more time to feel full and hopefully ordering less afterwards.</p></div>		</li>
