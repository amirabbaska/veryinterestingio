			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, they absolutely do -- but you don't have to use them (at least not enough to appreciably affect breathing) while running.  It means that humans can take longer, deeper breaths, rather than having to inhale and exhale every gait.</p>

<p>E: You can talk while running.  That requires a remarkable amount of control over your lungs, ignoring whatever your legs happen to be doing.  When really exerting oneself, it starts to have an audible effect, but all things considered its quite minor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the use of the legs is different. In a quadraped the front leg are to support the animals body weight, and the hind legs are for the power/thrust. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point, though the front legs provide a little bit of forward momentum as they pull themselves into position for the next stride. </p></div>		</li>
