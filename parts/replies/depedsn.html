			<div class="markdown"><p>When you're TIG welding, you have to &quot;strike&quot; the arc initially, either by touching the workpiece or by using a high frequency start.  Once the electricity is flowing, it ionizes the air between the tungsten and the workpiece, which greatly reduces the resistance of the air so the arc can be maintained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Welding uses high current, so the voltage can vary a lot, but something like a barbecue igniter button uses thousands of volts with very little current to send a spark through the air.</p>
<p>Barbecue lighters use pressure to generate their own electricity. They're piezoelectric.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once the arc is started, plasma is bridges the air gap.. The voltage is reduced to keep the current within limits and the arc under control. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>At standard temperature and pressure, you'd need 3 kV per mm of distance,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the real answer. It's not voltage or current, it's field strength. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>in your case, you would need to apply at least 1500 V in order for the gap to be bridged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not necessarily. Depending on the shape of the electrodes, the arc might start locally at a place where field strength is concentrated, even if the average voltage divided by distance is not enough to breakdown the air everywhere in the gap at once. </p>
<p>Once the arc starts, the air in that region becomes ionized and the arc can propagate across the gap.</p>
<p>This is why in devices that are meant to create a spark you'll generally see at least one of the electrodes having a pointy shape. Looking at automotive spark plugs, the point is very blunt, but still narrower than the bulk of the electrode, probably to increase the lifetime of the electrode. If you google &quot;esd spark gap&quot; images you'll see a case where a sharp point is preferred.</p>
<p>(/u/Rannasha, based on your flair for sure you already knew all this, but I thought it was worth giving more detail for OP's benefit)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschen%27s_law" target="_blank">It's complicated</a>.</p>
<p>But even in hard vacuum you should still, with a high enough field strength, be able to strip electrons off of the cathode. This would probably be a different physical process, though, than the arc discharge we've been talking about here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the operating principle for vacuum tubes generally (cathode ray tubes, or CRTs, being just about the only place these are seen these days - and not very often, thanks to flat screen LCD panels), although in most cases, the cathode is also heated to help with electron emission, so it's not just the voltage causing the emission of electrons.</p>
<p>Note that you don't get the same kind of electrical arc that you get from, say, lightning, static electricity, or high voltage electrical faults (see Youtube for some of those!).  The jagged random look for arcs in air is caused by the ionization of air between the two electrodes and the random motion of air molecules along the path.</p>
<p>Instead, you get a linear emission of electrons along a path from the cathode toward the anode, along the electric field gradient.</p>
<p>In some types of vacuum tube, an additional electrode between the cathode and anode can be used to regulate the flow of electrons by modifying the electric field across the gap.  And in CRT displays, electromagnets are used to deflect the electron beam so that the beam can scan across the entire surface of the screen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, see the following post for a summary of the mechanism that allows for arcs or similar discharges to arise even though the voltage is only strong enough near an electrode: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5wdyhc/why_is_the_voltage_of_lightning_so_low_compared/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5wdyhc/why_is_the_voltage_of_lightning_so_low_compared/</a></p>
<p>It's about lightning, but the mechanism is very similar in smaller discharges.</p></div>		</li>
