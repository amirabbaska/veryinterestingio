			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, indeed! The elephant studies I mentioned in my reply to red_bob showed that they have lots of copies of the TP53 gene. That probably makes them less likely to suffer loss-of-function mutations in the apoptosis machinery, just as you suggest. </p>
<p>The in vitro notion is really interesting, and may indeed be the way forward with these questions. There is a problem, though. Cultured cell lines are really weird and generally not much like real cells. The culturing techniques selects for cells that already have mutations that tend to make them act more &quot;cancerous.&quot; But techniques have improved for making artificial tissues, so I'll bet that such studies will make contributions soon. </p></div>		</li>
