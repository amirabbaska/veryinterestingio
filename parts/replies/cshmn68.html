			<div class="markdown"><p>TPP and TTIP are NOT &quot;free trade&quot; agreements. They are massive Corporate Power grabs dressed up as trade deals to get them to pass.</p>
<p>A selection of other TPP and TTIP articles and information are listed below. Basically everyone, from both the left and the right, who isn't in the pay of the big banks, big pharma, big oil and Monsanto etc. very strongly opposes these deals, because they are very bad news for over 99% of ordinary people.</p>
<p>People who openly and strongly oppose these deals include Joseph Stiglitz, Robert Reich, Noam Chomsky, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pat Buchanan and Paul Craig Roberts.</p>
<p>Robert Reich is very strongly against TPP (the same reasons also apply to TTIP in Europe) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM8osDtyKt0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM8osDtyKt0</a></p>
<p>Bernie Sanders has written a very strongly worded statement condemning these deals, which I would recommend everybody read <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-trans-pacific-trade-tpp-agreement-must-be-defeated?inline=file" target="_blank">http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-trans-pacific-trade-tpp-agreement-must-be-defeated?inline=file</a></p>

<p>“The corporations have bribed the political leaders in every country to sign away their sovereignty and the general welfare of their people to private corporations. Corporations have paid US senators large sums for transferring Congress’ law-making powers to corporations.” – Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former Assistant Secretary to US Treasury, former editor of the Wall Street Journal</p>
<p>Rule By the Corporations - TTIP: The Corporate Empowerment Act <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2015/06/01/rule-corporations-paul-craig-roberts-3/" target="_blank">http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2015/06/01/rule-corporations-paul-craig-roberts-3/</a></p>
<p>Geraint Davies (UK MP) “The harsh reality is that this deal is being stitched up behind closed doors by negotiators, with the influence of big corporations and the dark arts of corporate lawyers. They are stitching up rules that would be outside contract law and common law, and outside the shining light of democracy, to give powers to multinationals to sue Governments over laws that were designed to protect their citizens.”</p>
<p>Caroline Lucas (UK MP) pointed out in support of this that “the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland, who are in trade agreements that include this kind of investor-state relationship, have been sued 127 times and have lost an amount of money that could have employed 300,000 nurses for a year“.</p>
<p>UKIP oppose TTIP because it is NOT a free trade deal. It's a Corporate power grab dressed up as a trade deal.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Warren fires back at Obama: Here’s what they’re really fighting about <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/11/elizabeth-warren-fires-back-at-obama-heres-what-theyre-really-fighting-about/" target="_blank">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/11/elizabeth-warren-fires-back-at-obama-heres-what-theyre-really-fighting-about/</a></p>
<p>The purpose of Fast Track is a) to remove the Constitutional requirement for a two thirds majority (which is otherwise required for a treaty or international agreement) and b) to prevent any amendments to the deals being allowed or proposed. It becomes a simple up or down vote.</p>
<p>The reason for the draconian efforts to keep the texts of the deals a secret up until now is to enable Fast Track to be passed without a riot on the streets. It won't really matter after Fast Track is approved. It will be very hard stopping them getting approved (in the US).</p>
<p>These Corporate Power Grab deals transfer Sovereignty to Corporations. They will only benefit the top 0.1% - the major owners and boards of large Corporations. They are dressed up as &quot;free trade&quot; deals in order to get them to pass. They will lose well paid jobs, increase unemployment, depress wages, increase poverty, increase pollution and jack up the price of prescription drugs. They basically screw both your health and your wealth. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The TPP covers a huge number of issues. Goods, services, rules of origin, labor, environment, government procurement, and intellectual property, among many others. It is unlikely that any of these issues will mean anything for you in your daily life[..]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The deal itself is not secret. The draft, the stage it is still in, is secret. Once it gets up for a vote in Congress the information will be publicly available. However, at that point no major amendments can be made. The Congress can either pass it or veto it.</p>
<p>In addition, all trade deals are drafted in secret, because if they would open the doors to the public it would be impossible to make a treaty, considering all the different parties that would like to have a say in the discussions. Stuff like this is just done by technocrats and it is probably better and more efficient to have it that way.</p></div>		</li>

Yes there are some revolving door lobbyists that work there (source: I work next door to their offices) but most of those people provide experience and insight as to the concerns of a given industry and where the hangups are (such as auto tariffs)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's secret largely because most deals are negotiated privately/secretly. It's not as if we have a whole lot of details about the possible nuclear deal with Iran, except for the very, very broad strokes. This is how it is usually done with international agreements. To negotiate publicly would, say, give China the ability to pre-empt the TPP by modifying its own proposal. But if your goal is (as the US's is) to reign China in and prevent them from dominating their neighbors, then you don't want that to happen.</p>
<p>The other thing I would note is that everyone is making a BFD out of the TPP, but is largely ignoring TTIP. They're fairly similar, but only one is getting the attention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People in high places in the U.S. admire China's iron fist and rather than wanting to rein them in they want to implement what they do in the United States and around the world. </p>
<p>Once a one world government takes affect, there will be no individual state or country sovereignty about anything. Freedom will be a thing of the past beyond whatever one can do to stay under the radar and participate in the ever-growing black market. </p></div>		</li>
