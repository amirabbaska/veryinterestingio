			<div class="markdown"><p>The slightly more exact answer is that the Earth accelerates towards where the Sun <em>was</em> 8 minutes ago extrapolated to where it would have moved based on its velocity and acceleration 8 minutes ago. The fact that the position is not quite the same as the &quot;instantaneous position&quot; (ignoring complications due to relativistic fuckery), is the very reason why the Earth-Sun system spits out gravitational waves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know <em>how</em>, but for relativity to work, it has to be that way. Because of relativity, even though the whole solar system is moving through the galaxy very quickly, all the parts behave as if the system were stationary. If the earth was attracted to where the sun was 8 minutes ago relative to its position in the galaxy, we'd be orbiting a point roughly 110,000km away from the center of the sun.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh hey, I just thought of a good way to explain how it works, and it's actually pretty simple. Just imagine a ball moving through space emitting pulses. The pulses are traveling outward from the ball, <del>but they're also moving in the same direction as the ball and at the same speed. If the ball suddenly stops moving, the pulses that were emitted when the ball was moving will still be traveling along at the same speed.</del></p>
<p><del>I guess when gravity waves are created, they inherit the velocity of the thing that created them.</del></p>
<p>EDIT2: I crossed out the last part because it occurred to me that, since light doesn't carry the inertia of the body it comes from, then gravity waves probably don't either. So I was trying to understand it, and I found something that seems like a paradox. Let's say you have a ship moving through space and it emits two beams of light, beam A in the direction it's traveling, and beam B in the opposite direction where it came from. If an observer on that ship measured how far the light had traveled after a certain amount of time, he would see that both beams had traveled the same distance. But, if you had a stationary observer, he would see that the ship is closer to beam A than beam B since it's traveling toward A. So how can both of these scenarios coexist? What am I missing here?</p>
<p>EDIT3: OK, so thanks to some explanations, particularly  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4zwl8e/is_the_earth_pulled_toward_where_the_sun_is_now/d6zu7bf" target="_blank">this one</a>, I understand this a little better now. Basically, since the observer on the ship isn't able to observe the actual beam, just the information that travels back from it which is limited to the speed of light, he isn't able to tell that he is closer to A than B, even though that may be true from the stationary observers perspective.</p>
<p>So back to the metaphor with the ball. A pulse would behave the same way as the beams, but in all directions. To the stationary observer, the pulses don't travel along with the movement of the ball, they just travel directly outward from where they started. BUT, from the perspective of an observer on the ball, the pulses, as far as he can tell, ARE traveling along with the ball. If he were aware of the experiment going on and knew that he was moving relative to the stationary observer, and saw that the pulses stayed centered around the ball, he might conclude that the pulses inherit the balls velocity, even though it's really an illusion.</p>
<p><em>So,</em> if there were an object orbiting that ball, and you wanted to make calculations about it, you would calculate <em>as if</em> the pulses were moving along with the ball, even though they aren't, because from the ball's frame of reference, they essentially are.</p>
<p>On a related note, I suppose that, even though we see the sun <em>as</em> it was eight minutes ago, it appears to us to be <em>where</em> it would have traveled to eight minutes later. So even though there's a delay in the light, we still see it in its current location.</p>
<p>I think so anyway. If this is true, would the same thing apply to distant galaxies? If we look at a galaxy a billion light years away, we see it as it was a billion years ago, but does it also appear to be in the location it would have traveled after a billion years? Or does it appear to be where it was when the light was emitted? Would we have to be moving along at the same speed as that galaxy to notice any strange effects like that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I'm not understanding your question but the velocity of the mass isn't really a thing that gets encoded. Mass causes a &quot;curve&quot; in space time.  If a massive object is accelerating then it will curve space time more because it has more energy - mass and energy are interchangeable (E=mc2). The curve in space time <em>is</em> the gravitational field.</p>
<p>But I think maybe you are asking about the field itself?  How the particles that make up a massive object interact with spacetime to cause the gravitational field?  anyone who can give you that answer will win a Nobel Prize.  That would be the discovery of the Graviton - a force carrier (boson) that I believe would determine or translate to what degree spacetime is warped with a given amount of mass. </p>
<p>You may remember news a few years ago about the discovery of the Higgs Boson (after physicist Peter Higgs). The Higgs Boson is a force carrier sub atomic particle that determines how much mass an atom/ larger object has. It does this by interacting with the Higgs Field - a theoretical field that permeates through out the entire universe. </p>
<p>Does that mean there is a field for gravity?  What about where I said that the effect of gravity is basically the result of warped/curved spacetime?  </p>
<p>This all boils down to discoveries in quantum gravity which has not been done. Sorry, this is kind of a piss poor explanation... Check out some articles on quantum gravity, the graviton and the Higgs field. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems tricky to understand... Robus's explanation is a good start but it still didn't make sense, so I found this paper: <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/grav_speed.html" target="_blank">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/grav_speed.html</a></p>
<p>I have an undergrad degree in physics and have thought a lot conceptually about relativity (I think I can explain the common mind-warping elements of it pretty well), but this still doesn't make sense to me. Maybe if I spent more time studying the paper I linked to...</p>
<p>The best I can come up with right now is &quot;Due to relativity's effects on moving gravitational fields, forces 'conspire' in a way such that gravity points to the sun's updated position, not its old one.&quot;</p>
<p>But I still don't understand the exact mechanism by which that happens. Does anyone have a better, more ELIF explanation? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the mechanism you're looking for is in the 6th and 7th paragraph of the article you linked.</p>
<p>in short, you have 2 particles orbiting each other via EM force or gravity, you can shift your frame to either particle, and have it be stationary.  a stationary charged particle does not radiate energy.</p>
<p>however if we assume that the other particle orbits based of the retarded position, then you have a change in the angular momentum of the whole system, which means you have acceleration, this is inconsistent with your stationary frame.</p>
<p>this means that there's another (imaginary) force that 'conspires' to cancel the time retarded potential.  this imaginary force comes from the fact that gravity isn't a central force under certain limits in GR.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'll freely admit it's been a long time since I took any Physics classes, but what I can remember is that the velocity of the source particle wouldn't affect the electric field but the magnetic field, which in turn could affect the target particle I guess. Is there some kind of equivalent of &quot;magnetic&quot; field for gravity?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. If the sun disappeared the Earth would move towards the point where the sun was supposed to be for 8 minutes. The same happens if there is a sudden change in the velocity or position of the sun. If the sun suddenly accelerated then the earth would keep moving towards where the sun was headed before the sudden acceleration.  You can kind of think of this like the classic bowling balls moving over a trampoline example. Massive objects create significant gravitational distortions when they move at very high levels of mass and velocity. If a bowling ball is moving over a trampoline the curvature of the fabric infront of it will be greater than behind it, as the fabric has to first stretch at a higher tension to accommodate it's movement. </p>
<p>The interesting thing about gravity is that the &quot;stretchiness&quot; of space time is directly proportional TO the speed of light, which is also the speed at which gravitational effects propagate. The net result is that an object with a high momentum creates essentially the opposite of a &quot;bow&quot; wave that you'd see coming from a ship, so instead of creating a higher force as it passes receding in a cone shape from the object, it creates a higher force INFRONT of it in a cone shape as it has to essentially pull the space infront of it as it travels forwards to maintain it's space time curvature while moving. It just so happens that the way a moving object's gravitational force is deflected by it's own motion will be exactly proportional to how it's gravity would work if it were pulling on you from it's future position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Average Joe here.
I understand from this thread that we're really being pulled to the current <em>actual</em> location of our sun. Now, this is, correct me if I'm wrong, because moving bodies shift their center of gravity ahead of them, nicely explained by this excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The net result is that an object with a high momentum creates essentially the opposite of a &quot;bow&quot; wave that you'd see coming from a ship, so instead of creating a higher force as it passes receding in a cone shape from the object, it creates a higher force INFRONT of it in a cone shape as it has to essentially pull the space in front of it as it travels forwards to maintain it's space time curvature while moving. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others have maintained this as well, but what puzzles me, is how come it happens to be that this shifted location coincides with the sun's real location after 8 minutes or whatever time it takes for the information to reach us? Is it really as you said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It just so happens that the way a moving object's gravitational force is deflected by it's own motion will be exactly proportional to how it's gravity would work if it were pulling on you from it's future position.</p>

<p>It's just a happy coincidence?</p></div>		</li>
