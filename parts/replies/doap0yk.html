			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only does the human brain take longer to form these more complex circuits, but we also have far more myelination than other species <em>and</em> are born earlier in our development so our big heads don't rip our mother's hips apart too badly. </p>
<p>As a species we've gone real ham on the brains over brawn thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if we can get that much more efficient... So I'm still going to root for centaur bodies. I just really like the mental image I'm getting... Although sex would get a lot less intimate, that's a bit of a shame... Oh, and the loss of dexterity... Vulnerability to getting stuck in small spaces... Alright, maybe it's not that much better. On the plus side, we'd no longer be one of the slowest creatures...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be extremely difficult to develop more effiecient brains. Its taken millions and millions of years to evolve to where we are now, if there was a more efficient way for us to have a brain of our intellect it would have happened already. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember when I learned this I tried to think of any other two legged mammal that births a fully formed infant and couldn’t think of any. Kangaroos and wallabies birth an undeveloped foetus and it finishes growing in the pouch. And I can’t think of any other two legged mammals right now. </p></div>		</li>
