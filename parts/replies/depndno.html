			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a slightly different concept, more to do with emotional state and specific moments where you brain has a variable frame rate for recording memories but a fixed one for playback, so when something is very emotional your brain encodes it at a higher frame rate, but when it plays it back at the normal rate, it seems like that event took a long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you think about how long a day was, all you are doing is remembering all the events in that day, and measuring how long they took, which absolutely is influenced by their enclosing.</p>
<p>The increased emotional content of a memory can influence the experience as well, but the attention paid in the encoding of a novel event is the primary driver of the perception of time.</p></div>		</li>
