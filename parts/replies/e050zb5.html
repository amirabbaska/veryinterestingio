			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a really good idea!  I'd also love it if an unaltered pet got picked up by animal control, they were going to be spayed/neutered before the owners could get them back.  Way too many strays are strays because they're out looking for booty.  Fixing your pets cuts down on wandering a whole bunch.</p></div>		</li>
