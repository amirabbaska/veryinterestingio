			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a detailed dream I had last night that I wrote out this morning.
...........
Some guy was holding a large glass cup and fell on the deck. The glass shattered and he was covered with glass. I fell trying to help him and I also got covered. My back had many little shards and my stomach had a few large pieces sticking out. My mom called my phone to tell me she is out front in her car and we're having chili for dinner. My dad comes out to say she's here, and I have my shirt on so he can't see the glass. I walk back onto the deck outside clearly upset and he follows. I show him the shards and he gets very angry, and after his anger subsides he begins to pull the little shards out of my back. Once he's done I remind him that I have larger pieces in my stomach. He grabs a towel and begins to slowly slide them out one by one. There was a large piece right under my belly button and a large but smaller one directly underneath. There was a third large piece further to the left in my stomach on the same level as the first. The first came out fine and we applied pressure and a towel. The second began to spray blood and water. Pressure was applied with another towel. The third sprayed blood and another towel was applied. He went inside to get more towels and I found a blanket to curl underneath. Everything began feeling numb and I was getting very cold. The towels were soaked. It seemed like dad was gone for a long time and jordin (nephew) came over and I asked him to get my mom and dad. When it didn't seem like he was going to get them I started hoarsly yelling for help. After 5 yells my dad comes back out with more towels. He takes the towel off the lowest cut and in that moment I tried to tell him to not take it off and to just put the other towel over but I didn't say it quick enough and he ended up opening the cut further. I panicked and stood up while a mixture of water and blood gushed out of the area directly below my stomach, probably my bladder or water reservoirs (dream logic) and blood began to rush out of the other cut large cut to the left. I yell to mom because she's still in the ready-to-go car and jump into the passanger seat and tell her I need to go to the hospital and that I'll need a stretcher. As soon as I sit down I feel dizzy, weak, sick, and the weirdest thing was the taste in my mouth. Because everything, including water, was gushing out of me it caused a horrible dry morning taste. We got to the hospital and I somehow departed from my body like a ghost. For the time I thought I was dad, overlooking my body like I was looking at my son. I took my body and put myself on a stretcher, wheeled myself inside and took a left. The hospital looked abandoned. I looked through a door's window and it was pitch black with a small blue light coming from another room. I turn around and on the opposite side of the hospital I see a nurse. I kept yelling for help as I rushed over with my body on the stretcher and screamed that my son was dying and he needed help. The nurse took a look at the pale (surprisingly clean) body on the stretcher and didn't show concern. She believed there was no way to save me. She took the stretcher and wheeled it up the stairs behind her. I went up to help her so they could save my son faster and she somehow made it incredibly fast on her own. As I'm climbing behind her I get to a point that I have to jump across in order to keep up and I think to myself &quot;am I dead?&quot;, now realizing that I had been guiding my lifeless body. Or perhaps I passed away while being taken up the stairs, and at that moment I had a sudden feeling and understood I had died. I jumped across and felt no pain when I expected a bit of pain. I took several more steps up the stairs and made it to a makeshift operating station at the top of the stairs, not even in a designated room. The nurse and my mom are already there. She declares the body is lifeless. More people show up and observe. She asks what would have caused the wound to open so wide and I told her I opened it accidently, covering for my dad's mistake. I began to wonder how people could see and hear me and someone pointed to a bright blue machine in a nearby window. The machine allowed restless spirits to be seen and heard. I think it was Tara (my ex girlfriend) that was standing next to me. I started to cry and woke up.

TLDR; Some dreams are random and mean absolutely nothing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking from mere experience with no scientific evidence to back this up - dreams are able to be more detailed, have a logical flow, and are more memorable if the dream occurs during a sleep that doesn't include the full cycle. My job and course schedule allows me to sleep in most days, so if I wake up at 8am and go back to sleep from 8:10 to 10am, better dreams happen. At least for me :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you become aware in a dream, this is called a lucid dream. You can learn a lot more about it in /r/luciddreaming . A lot of people train to do this and can become lucid in their dreams many times a week. This usually allows the dreamer to control all aspects of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lucid dreaming is so fucking interesting. I have had 2 lucid dreams in my life (that I remember) and both were when I was much younger. These were totally random and I have never really 'tried' to lucid dream. It really feels like the &quot;I need guns&quot; scene in the matrix because as soon as you realize you're dreaming you can literally make shit up on the spot and it will happen around you!</p>
<p>There's also sleep paralysis which I think I have had a very mild case of once, not terrifying but I definitely felt the overpowering dread that people talk about and woke up unsettled. Take this how you will but I like to compare lucid dreaming to psychedelic drug trips, with sleep paralysis being the bad trip that you have a risk of going through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've learned that when I smoke weed multiple days in a row and then don't for a few days, those few days cause insane dreams as well as sleep paralysis. It's come to the point where I know in my paralysis that it's sleep paralysis. I've found that you can either hold your breath or hyperventilate to get out of the paralysis in several seconds. The sleep paralysis was only scary the first couple times but now it's not so bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The funny thing about lucid dreams is that shit is just like Peter pan. You can fly and do whatever you want, but you have to really believe you can do it. You can be totally lucid but not have the confidence to fly and just fall flat on your face. I usually need a running start because to my mind it's much more believable for me to start flying by gaining momentum, jumping and pulling up like an airplane rather than just jumping standing still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to lucid dream a LOT when I was a kid, it was like my personal virtual reality playground. I remember getting frustrated though because even though I knew I was in a world of my own creation, completely generated by my mind, I could almost never just make what I wanted to happen happen. I remember thinking stuff like &quot;Okay, I wanna ride around in a tank and blow shit up. Okay, materialize tank now!&quot; and nothing would happen. I remember being in lucid dreams where the entire thing was me just walking around in a dream world that looked exactly like my real world but I couldn't change anything, and the dream was so realistic sometimes that I wasn't sure it was 100% a dream and didn't want to accidentally kill myself or do something that would have me commited</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love lucid dreaming. I started training for it when i quit smoking weed for a drug test and started having more vivid, intense dreams. I started writing down bits of dreams I remembered or telling the story of my dream out loud. This is supposed to help your brain realize you want to remember your dreams. I saw in the movie &quot;Waking life&quot; that in your dreams, you can't tell time or adjust the lights. The time thing is the only thing I've picked up on. I started wearing a watch that I checked semi regularly to see if what I was experiencing was real life. It's nuts when you finally do that double take and see the clock's hands spinning or the digital watch going nuts. </p>
<p>I have the same thought every time I realize I'm dreaming.. Game on :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The watch thing is a pretty common tactic used by those who attempt to &quot;train&quot; themselves to lucid dream.  It's kind of like the totem in Inception, but not usually so private or obscure.  It's usually supposed to be an action that you train yourself to do all the time that you associated with &quot;dream checking&quot;.  Feeling for your watch, tapping your left foot twice, rotating a ring, etc.  It should be something small that you can do at any time, and that you start doing regularly in your waking life.</p>
<p>The point of it isn't so much to test when that object isn't there or if the rules of physics aren't working, it's just to train your mind to always be periodically checking to see if you are awake or dreaming.  Simply, making the thought &quot;Am I awake right now?&quot; a regularly occurring thought in your day.  When awake, you are clearly aware that you are awake, so you answer &quot;yes&quot; and move on with life.  When you are dreaming, there is almost always some level of doubt.  If the answer is ever &quot;well, maybe.&quot; or &quot;I think&quot;, then you know you are dreaming and can &quot;take over&quot; the dream, turning it lucid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The clock thing is what triggers a lucid for me every time. It's usually a classic digital clock, and the little bars that light up always form weird shit instead of numbers. It immediately clicks a &quot;wait.. That's not right&quot; in my head during dreams and suddenly bam, lucid. </p>
<p>It's always random for me though, I've never gotten the training methods down no matter how hard I followed them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never understood this because I have certainly looked at a clock and seen the time during a dream, but it's always on my phone. And the time never matches up with the light. If it's day time my phone will say some time at night, and vice versa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can typically exert a small level of control, but not like that.</p>
<p>For a long time I suffered sleep paralysis induced nightmares. I learned to recognize the signs of being in a dream to counter it. Otherwise, I would be up all night fighting myself</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most convincing I've heard is that it's your brain sorting out the day's information from your short-term memory into long-term memory, and what it should ditch. Your hippocampus is right next to your visual cortex, and while it's working, it touches along those synapses sometimes, and so you end up &quot;seeing&quot; it.</p>
<p>That's why your dreams are always relevant to your life in some way, it's because they're what you've been thinking about regularly. If you've gone through something particularly negative in your life, no doubt you spent some of the day thinking about it, which then comes around while your brain is going through your memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think I mentioned this theory in my post. I tend to feel like this is probably true. Still, however there is no scientific consensus. And it's not always the case. It's often highly symbolic, and can be unrelated to your life</p></div>		</li>
