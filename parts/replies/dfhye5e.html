			<div class="markdown"><p>Your argument is that the we don't understand because the brain only sends signals and has no need to understand the mechanisms down the line. But even still, I'm not aware of all the signals that my brain is responsible for sending out, nor do I have an awareness of how it decides to send those signals. I don't have any examples because I'm completely uneducated on the body, but this is just based on some good-ole folksy introspection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, no, I'm not making an argument that I /should/ be aware or understand. I'm just pointing out that our not understanding is not simply a function of only sending out signals.</p></div>		</li>
