<p>a return stroke zips back up to the sky.</p>

<p>What is the content of the return stroke? (perhaps content is the wrong word)</p>
<p>If the cloud is negatively charged, it has an excess of electrons.  The ground being positive, has a lack of them.  </p>
<p>The lightning stroke would be the movement of electrons from the cloud to the ground.</p>
<p>So if the return stroke is moving upward, what is actually moving?  Is it pulling electrons from the surrounding air until it meets the excess in the cloud?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not completely sure, but I imagine the upward strike is an 'electron hole' interface moving up into the cloud. That is, once the lightning has touched the ground, the circuit is complete at the electrons in the air 'in the lightning' rapidly move to the ground, from the ground upwards, causing the illumination to start from the ground and move into the cloud.    </p></div>		</li>
