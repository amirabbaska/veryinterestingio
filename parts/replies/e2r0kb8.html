			<div class="markdown"><p>The magnetic fields for stars is often pretty different from those of Earth's, and it looks like there's a lot of different effects coming into play.  As an extreme example, stars often have more than one north or south magnetic pole, and the poles will often wander around independently of the rotational axis.  Additionally, the other comments go more in depth, but the 11 year cycle of the Sun isn't exactly calculated, but more &quot;observed.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general stellar magnetic fields are generated in the outer convective envelope while the terrestial magnetic field is generated by convection in Earth's core. </p>
<p>Also stellar magnetism is strongly related to the mass of stars and the size of the convective envelope. Solar mass stars actually tend to have weaker magnetic fields with more complex field geometries, e.g. lots of high order contributions from quadrupole or octopole components. Low mass stars often have stronger magnetic fields with simpler structure. e.g. AA Tau. However more complex fields are possible as well. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.8194.pdf" target="_blank">In figure 11 in this paper there are some examples.</a></p>
<p>More massive stars than our sun often don't have any measurable magnetic field at all. The exception to this are the Ap/Bp stars that have strong and very simple dipole fields that might be left over from their creation (pre-mainsequence stars, i.e. Herbig Ae/Be stars). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an extention to this.. the boundary conditions are quite different. In the Earth you have solid boundaries at the top and bottom of the convective region and somewhat solid body rotation throughout. In Solar type stars you have a single solid boundary at the bottom and a stress free top boundary. The convective region is also deferentially rotating.</p></div>		</li>
