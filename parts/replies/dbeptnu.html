<p>all radio waves are light and they're all wobbly.</p>
<p>There ya go.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Imagine a wide doorway that is wide open, but gurded by some guards. Those wide doorways and its guards are atoms and molecules. </p>
<p>Imagine people go to that doorway and want to pass through. The people do have coloured shirts on, some red, others blue, others yellow. Those people with their fancy shirts are particles of light.Now to equate the &quot;color&quot; with the each of those fancy shirt we let the people run or walk slowly. Those who wear blue shirts run fast, those with red just walk casually, all other colours are somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Each of the guards in the doorways have orders whom they can let pass and whom they need to send back. The order might be &quot;You let all green and red clothed people pass, everyone else you send back!&quot; or &quot;You let everyone pass who isn't running too fast! (meaning blue gets blocked, everyone can get past). They guards don't think, they don't talk, they just accept their orders and do their job.</p>
<p>Now as the people approach some can get past the guards without any issues, others are &quot;blocked&quot;, they are absorbed. The same happens in matter: as the doorways and guards let some forms of people though, they block others, simply because that is how they work. </p>
<p>That is why normal glass is fully transparent, all &quot;light particles&quot; of all colours can pass it. Other types of glass are coloured, i.e. if there is some fancy red glass it means all the other colours are blocked, cannot go through, so all that shines through is the red. You have &quot;matter&quot; that blocks certain &quot;colours&quot; and others not.</p>
<p>Now that brings us to radio-waves. Radio waves are just &quot;light particles&quot; that have a &quot;colour&quot; that we cannot see, simply because our eye is not built for it, but apart from that, the analogy stays the same.</p>
<p>Now the guards in &quot;Brick doorways&quot; simply don't have orders to stop those &quot;colours&quot;, but they block all others. Imagine someone giving out the order said something as &quot;Block all colours, you now, red and above!&quot;, that would leave that doorway completely transparent for those &quot;radio-wave-coloured&quot; people but completely intransparent to see through. It is basically the same as with the &quot;coloured glass&quot; from above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Walls are opaque not because of light absorption, but because of scattering. While this is an accurate, if long, explanation of why molecules don't <em>absorb</em> radio waves, it doesn't really answer the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took an overview physics class in college which finally taught me about the electromagnetic spectrum and how that all works. This specific question wasn't covered well, though, but your answer jives with everything else I learned in the class. Thank you!</p></div>		</li>
