			<div class="markdown"><p>As for the last point on ransomware, an obvious follow up question could be “well why don’t they just keep asking for more?” But it’s actually in the scammer’s interest for a relatively small one off payment to be the end of it, or nobody would ever pay the ransom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going after Johnie Hacker in Wisconsin who has made 12,000$ over three years is definitely not happening as often as going after John Hacker who made 400,000$ in all sorts of currency which required him to not only hack local but global targets as well.</p>
<p>Basically LEO would need you on their radar to go for you, and the odds of the call center in Mississippi sending them after you in Wisconsin is lower if you wound up being just a nuisance. Bonus points if you do it within state lines as you avoid involving the feds in some cases.</p></div>		</li>
