			<div class="markdown"><p>You got that a little wrong, its actually they have complete access to your phone android or IOS and then can attack apps like whatsapp telegram etc... by getting the data before it is encrypted. So every phone is completely vulnerable and encryption apps have weakness's which cant be fixed (atleast not easily)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. Like said, I don't expect my post to be completely accurate, but it's the best I could come up with from what I've read. But that's what I was meaning when I said that they can bypass the app itself. I'm not at all familiar with WhatsApp or Telegram, so I couldn't say what the response from them will be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh its fairly accurate, but just want to make that clear to people as its a huge distinction. Being able to break into a safe isnt the same as having the lock and keys to everything in a house and also the safe if that makes sense</p>
<p>Whats app and all other encryption apps (because it is ALL APPS they have access to including heavily encrypted ones) will be nothing. Maybe they will do a PR move but as far as implementation nothing will or really could change, the best they can do is make a virtual keyboard and emulate everything the OS does to try and bypass the system, thus making it much more difficult to break the encryption (as now it is intercepting the data between the OS and app)</p>
<p>Also everything in these leaks (so far) have been known for years upon years, but these leaks are amazing to actually have documentation for it, and have a possibility of national discourse</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little late, but- Do they have access directly to those? I was thinking about custom Roms and firmware on Android and iOS devices and was wondering if modified firmware (which is quite common with custom Roms, on Android at least) would still be as easily exploited.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now people like me and paranoids have known for years that various government agencies could and do spy on the general population at the drop of a hat. I've always said it doesn't matter how much security, custom encryption protocols or firewalls you have. If someone with that much power wanted to find out something about you, they could either by physical force/violence or by hacking into your systems (remember these guys have 1000's of expertly trained hackers and super computers at their disposal vs your home or small business network). </p>
<p>The thing is as much as we all hate it take some comfort in knowing that there are 1000's of millions more interesting people to spy on than you. No matter how weird or perverted you think your Google searches for Brazilian midget scat porn are there are going to be 100's of millions that are far more twisted and perverted than anything you could even conceive or come up with. Remember just because the government CAN spy on you doesn't mean they do, much of the privacy concerns today are with automated data mining (for targeted advertising or selling the data to companies, much of this data cannot be used to identify you specifically) </p>
<p>If you really do have information you absolutely MUST keep 100% secret but also send to someone then do it offline, (eg. give someone a USB key with the data on it, and do not connect it to any computers with internet access). </p>
<p>Now the big black elephant in the room and the worry everyone has and why you should always still try to stay as secure as possible is not because of the government (because let's face it, as much dark shit that happens behind closed doors, they aren't out to 'get you') but because of scammers and black hat hackers. Having end-to-end encryption, secure passwords and 2-step authentication will often stop a black hat hacker in their tracks. </p>
<p>This leak is both a good thing and a bad thing, a good thing because now what has been knowledge to technical people, geeks and paranoids is now knowledge to everyone and as a result things will be made more secure and tightened up. The bad is that black hats now know where to target to get access to these viruses and worms and if they do the results could be disastrous. All in all despite the temporary damage this could cause I'm 100% all for it being leaked and made public. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is, from practically any conceivable perspective, the opposite of comforting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you that this leak is a good thing in terms of public awareness. It was also obvious to everyone willing to think along those lines, that the government already had the capabilities described in the leaks.</p>
<p>What was not obvious however, is the lack of care they display by having these things leaked. Ultimately it's not surprisng: If you have a house full of the most talented key-makers and burglars and you hand them a skeleton key to everything, then you shouldn't be surprised if they make copies.</p>
<p>But the fact that these Tools and Documents were leaked indicates that with reasonable risk it is possible to extract these tools from your workplace machines and bring them to light. The leaker(s?) chose to do the right thing and allert the public. But how many before them did not and sold the tools to the highest bidder instead? Or used them for their own interest?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very nice response. I don't much trust the government in the first place, and especially after the Snowden leaks. It was easy to joke about Big Brother before you realize everything and anything you could think the government's doing, they are doing. The leak would allow for those affected to become more secure, all the while making the agencies' jobs harder. I don't like the idea of spying on their own citizens, as I believe there should be compromise to privacy and security, but I do believe people that are actively being sought by the NSA, CIA, FBI, are likely to have probable cause for their being actively spied on, and not passively stored as data. Blackhats and, in turn, script kiddies will bring out the worse of it, as you can hope for the agencies to use these as some kind of way to keep our country safe, whilst the blackhats would intend to do the opposite.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At this point, we should definitely be alerted and aware of this, because if such tools end up in the wrong hands... </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many would say the CIA are &quot;the wrong hands&quot;. </p>
<p>While it's true that it's beyond most end users ability to circumvent these vulnerabilities, it's not beyond the ability of the OEMs. We should put pressure on companies like Apple and Google to make it so CIA can't end run our encryption. </p></div>		</li>
