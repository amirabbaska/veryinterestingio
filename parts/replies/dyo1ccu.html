			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called 'Experimental Procedures' in that journal. Just scroll down. Yes, it was genetic engineering but pretty straightforward. Was there anything in particular you wanted to understand?</p>
<p>Edit: I'll just tell you about something cool. We use Agrobacterium to introduce the new DNA. This bacterium is a natural genetic engineer that injects DNA into plant cells to produce galls, or growths on the plant, that make sugars and amino acids that the bacteria need. We just replace the genes that the Agrobacterium normally injects with ones that we want to add. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's awesome. Does the agrobacterium only change part of the plant? Does it need to get into the original seed to change the whole thing? How do you put the genes in the agrobacterium?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember learning about this in plant biology, but I never learned how the DNA is introduced.  Is the DNA sequence introduced as a transposable element or is there some other type of mechanism?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this sounds suspiciously similar to programming, or more specifically, hacking (injector? cmon)</p>
<p>I'm not gonna go any further because I read somewhere if we solve the universe it will reset on a harder difficulty.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's well established that we can <em>make</em> pretty much anything fat.</p></div>		</li>
