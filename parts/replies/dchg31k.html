			<div class="markdown"><p>Every orbit is an ellipse with the center of mass of earth at one of the foci, and the ellipse must intersect where you started the orbit (because orbits are closed under newtonian physics). If the orbit starts on the ground, the ellipse must intersect that point in the ground, which means it enters the ground somewhere else and shoots back out from the original point where it started. That won't happen because the orbit obviously ends when it crashes into the ground. </p>
<p>Note that the &quot;original point&quot; I described above won't really be the same point on the world map as the Earth rotates. It will be a point on the earth's surface though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that makes sense if there was only one gravity well to consider, but couldn't you launch it so that the moon's gravity makes it possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only way to do this would be to have a stationary platform in the area you want your orbit to be. Use a 200 mile tall tower to launch your projectile and you'll put it in orbit. It'll hit the tower though, so you've got to get it down at least a little bit before your satellite comes back around. Not exactly practical. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In one sentence, because F=ma. The trajectory of any projectile outside the atmosphere, with nothing but gravity acting on it, is a solution of that differential equation -- and there are no solutions that fit your description, no matter what the initial conditions (launch velocity and direction) are.</p>
<p>If the projectile isn't going fast enough to escape Earth entirely, its path will be <em>repetitive</em>, which means it will pass through the launch point after once around -- except that Earth is in the way, which is what I meant by &quot;splat&quot;. In order to get a successful orbit, you have to apply some thrust <em>after</em> it reaches a certain height.</p>
<p>If you'd like to pursue it in some detail, at an undergraduate level, read <em>Fundamentals of Astrodynamics</em> by Bate, Mueller &amp; White, universally known as &quot;the BMW text&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds reasonable.  But you seem to be ignoring the moon.  Couldn't you throw something up to the L4 or L5 point?</p></div>		</li>
