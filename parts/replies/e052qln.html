			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The youngest went through precocious puberty, which is why she was able to get pregnant. I think she was like 8-9 or something. Puberty is starting a lot earlier in recent years because we're getting more well fed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so those cases are kind of different then, if the girls went through puberty unusually early which i guess is a medical condition of it's own?</p>
<p>how does having better diets affect puberty times? is it just like, the body having more access to nutrients so it's able to get major processes underway quicker?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Far from an expert but I heard it isnâ€™t about being well fed, but being fed animals who have been given growth hormones that is causing periods to be had at earlier ages. </p></div>		</li>
