			<div class="markdown"><p>What are the leading causes of death, and how often can they be assessed? More on the trauma side, illnesses, malnutrition?</p>
<p>40 seems a very reasonable age to reach outside of these, but maybe the harshness of life means more wear and tear</p>
<p>Can we relate any of this to the lifespan of current populations living away from civilization, or are their ways of life too far from that of our ancestors?</p>
<p>Edit: forgot to thank you for a great answer to op! Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
