			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't mind, would you answer some questions? (I'd ask for an AMA but I'm sure you have things to do with your time.)</p>
<p>1) What is the biggest / most widespread misconception people have about infectious diseases and their transmission?</p>
<p>2) What is your &quot;worst case scenario&quot; about a disease spreading out of control. Which one would you think it'd be, what dangers would it carry and what would your gameplan be?</p>
<p>3) Do you have any stories or general info you'd like to share?</p>
<p>Obviously feel free to tell me to jog on, I jusr think stuff like this is really interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not the person you are replying to, and I haven't finished training yet, but I work as an an Infectious Diseases doctor.</p>
<p>In answer to question 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Probably the biggest misconception people have is that Staph aureus is the dreaded &quot;superbug&quot; that has 99.97% mortality. Treatment is usually very effective, (even if it's methicillin resistant (MRSA), and although quite dangerous (up to 20% mortality in debilitated patients with Staph aureus bacteraemia), most people respond just fine to treatment. </li>
<li>The other message I'd like to share is that HIV is NOT the same as AIDS. In developed countries, AIDS is incredibly rare. Antiretroviral treatment is so effective that HIV+ mothers can give birth to HIV- babies, HIV+ men can get HIV- ladies pregnant without disease transmission. </li>
<li>Remaining on the topic of HIV, In the country where I live (factoring in epidemiological incidence and prevalence), the likelihood of a HIV- man contracting HIV from a known HIV+ female from a single heterosexual vaginal intercourse encounter (insertive penis -&gt; vagina) is very low. Estimated transmission rate is 1 in 2500 per encounter.</li>
<li>HIV is an entirely manageable disease, with life expectancy equal to non-HIV individuals provided managed correctly. </li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It still feels like a very scary disease to catch. I have recently been tested (the exams are for free in my country to try and prevent transmission from people that are not aware that they're infected with HIV) and couldn't feel more relieved. It's not seen as something easy to catch here, so I wonder how many are infected without knowing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because your body is trying to fight a potential infectant. Your body doesn't know if it's bacteria, or a splinter in your case. Therefore it sends white blood cells to the site of infection, hoping to neutralize what's there. Of course it's not gonna do a whole lot to a wooden splinter, but it most certainly will try to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man imagine the relief you'd feel after that bastard popped out? There'd still be some discomfort but instead of the fiery, acute pain from pressure applied to the splinter it's more like a &quot;hurts so good&quot; kind of pain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most dermatologist tips I read online state to avoid picking at them, although from your comment it sounds like it's best to drain it if it becomes greatly visible.</p>
<p>Am I reading your comment wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you care about your future complexion don't pop 'em until they feel really tight and are grossly visible (like a bit smaller than a bb, give or take). Even then drain them slowly and gently. I used to have terrible facial acne like some of my friends and I almost never popped or picked. I just sucked it up, tried to eat better and waited it out. They now have little scars here and there and I have pretty clear skin for a 30yo smoker.</p>
<p>I think above commenter was speaking more about infected wounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general I think this is true but some people are just more prone to scarring regardless if you wait it out or not. I've had pimples that scarred without me touching it and I've had ones that cleared up nicely after a pop. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Popping and lancing are very different. When you pop a zit by squeezing it until it bursts, you rupture the skin unevenly, which increases the risk of scarring. It's like a jagged wound from a dull knife. </p>
<p>I keep a small sewing pin and some alcohol wipes in my bathroom. Sterilize it (and the pin), poke a small hole in the side, then squeeze very gently until all of the puss clears out. That small, clean pinhole will heal without scarring. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although your comment's advice is probably frowned upon by the medical community,  I would at least add &quot;wash your hands thoroughly&quot; to this.  Also, wash the affected area thoroughly afterwards as well.  Alcohol wipe is good, but best to be as hygienic as possible.  Shower would be the best place as you can wash before and after immediately.</p>
<p>In reality, I would avoid self-lancing (and especially popping like you said) zits and boils if at all possible.  It's a good way to form a big old abscess if you're not careful enough, and an abscess on your face especially is dangerous territory.  I'm not saying you aren't careful, just adding some advice to the conversation so that others who are less knowledgeable are informed. </p>
<p>Edit: spelling of abscess</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Buy some sterile lancets from the pharmacy or Amazon. Much better than than using a pin. They go right into the skin and they're already sterile, so you just need to alcohol your skin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Order a proper set of comedone extractors, it will have all the tools you need.  Watch a couple of popping vids using the tools so you know how to properly use them.  Keep it as hygienic as possible with alcohol wipes etc.</p>
<p>Popping with fingers leads to scarring and likely infection because no matter how much you wash your hands there is always bacteria under your fingernails.</p></div>		</li>
