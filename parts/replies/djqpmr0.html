<p>You're probably safe wearing your socks though :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know, at 121C for 15 minutes I reckon you'd burn your feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most practical way to kill bacteria in household tasks is with chlorine bleach. The downside is that bleach is damaging to some fabrics and dyes (and needs to be handled safely).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because a line has way better air circulation and is cooler than the inside of a dryer. If your dryer is as crap as mine and doesnt completely dry your clothes in 1 cycle, youre looking at a nice warm, dark, moist cave where bacteria will be sipping champagne as they drive their Ferraris through your tightey whiteys. A line is none of those things.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's so much that either drying or washing kills microorganisms (I'm sure that both processes do to a certain extent). I think the main reason clothes don't stink if you dry them right away is because you've removed the water, which prevents growth. </p></div>		</li>
