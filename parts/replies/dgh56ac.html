This is because of many factors: Pharmaceutical investment/payout and historical research are the big ones. There is a lot of fascinating history behind research into psychological drugs, that I suggest you look into if interested. An interesting one to start with is the use of lithium in bipolar disorder: No one really knows exactly how it works, but it has been proven to be effective.

You might have two people who are experiencing the exact same symptoms from the exact same neurochemical triggers, but their metabolisms could be different, which causes one patient to break down the medication into base metabolites and just poo it out, never experiencing a change in neuro chemistry. A change in primary or even secondary drug action might yield different results. Then, there's similar symptomology stemming from different triggers, but we won't get into that. </p></div>		</li>
