			<div class="markdown"><p>Danish children take longer than our Scandinavian neighbours to learn to speak properly, but babble about their parents as much as other children. What takes longer is not learning to name their parents, but learning to speak in general, which is generally attributed to the emphasis on a fairly nuanced vowel system in Danish phonology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in Cape Breton we're too lazy to pronounce hard constants on the end of words (&quot;what&quot; is prononuced &quot;wha&quot;). We just say Ma and Da. I'm not sure if that comes from Gaelic/Scotland or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Finnish, it's not even using the common sounds. &quot;Äiti&quot; for mother (eye-tee) and &quot;isä&quot; for father (eee-sah). Finnish children don't seem to have problems with it though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think It's specifically because of the vowel sound of the o in Mor. Kinda like... &quot;Moo-å&quot;. Hard to shape properly without practice </p></div>		</li>
