<p>To be clear, it does NOT go into their pockets. Not legally, at least. It is used to help them campaign, achieve reelection, and achieve other political goals. The problem is, it's still possible to &quot;buy&quot; or unfairly influence politicians by giving lots of money to their reelection campaigns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On that note, I think it's important to mention that this phenomenon isn't necessarily indicative of corruption or malice. If politicians exist who support platforms A, B, C and D and major donors/lobbyists exist for platforms C, D, E and F, then the overlap between the two (C and D) are the platforms that are most likely to achieve viability. This might still be a problem (maybe voters are most interested in A or B), but it's a different problem than bribery in which the politicians are actually changing their stance in exchange for the funding.</p>
<p>The same goes for non-monetary aid which is what makes things really complicated. People who influence the general media (everything from sitcoms to news outlets) influence the things that do and don't get talked about. Additionally, if you imagine research publications as the body of knowledge from which we form and critique policies, the the wealthy who fund think tanks and research can cause disproportionate coverage of topics or sides of issues. These are neither political contributions nor are they anything near as direct as bribery, but they change the landscape in ways that makes it more favorable for people of certain platforms to run elections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are examples, but I wouldn't call it &quot;lots&quot;. Most times we point to money in politics there isn't a tangible flip in policy. It still may be at odds with what the voters want and need to be reformed, but it's less sinister than bribery and doesn't deserve the same kind of vilification. Where there is a change in policy, in many cases it's likely already illegal under bribery regulations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It must be understood that even if the legislator is just out for themselves, they still need to satisfy their party.  That means they can't completely flip-flop on major topics.</p>
<p>However, what large donations can do is get them to change their minds on specific, usually local things.</p>
<p>For instance, you want a new coal plant in some Democratic legislator's district?  The legislator may have a weak leaning against the plant due to environmental concerns and general Democratic party thought patterns, but it is really just a local matter, the national party won't get involved.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, he has a serious primary challenge against him from a more environmentally concerned challenger.  He needs more money to run some ads against this competitor.  The national party is somewhat apathetic (they'll accept either candidate), so our incumbent is not getting national cash, so he's sort of on his own.</p>
<p>Fast forward and now there is suddenly a big donation to the incumbent Democratic party congressman from Coal Company, Inc. and he &quot;remembers&quot; that this would help out his local economy, and the local unions are in favor of the jobs.  Now, he's in favor of the coal plant. </p>
<p>This congressman may have gotten elected originally because of the noises he made about the environment, but now, he's all about jobs.  Mostly, he really doesn't give a shit, he just wants to get elected again and keep his job.  All he needs to do is stay within the Democratic party (the unions angle), and his principles become flexible.  </p>
<p>However, if the national party hated that particular coal plant, that incumbent would either have to toe the line, or face his primary challenger getting heavy support from the national party.  In that case, the donation might not have any effect.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Bah. Here's a &quot;Non-Edit&quot; because I just searched the above terms and voila:</p>

<p>And the NW;DC (no way don't click), it goes back to donors, or can be used in various political ways that do not enrich the candidates. It's actually pretty loose on how you can use them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't go into their pockets? Interesting. What if, I'm just spitballing here, someone ran for president who actually owned multiple different businesses and then solely contracted with those businesses while running their campaign? Maybe, purely hypothetical, because that person both controlled how the funds were spent and the prices that those businesses charged for services, he could, in a way, siphon the funds from their election campaign into their personal bank account. For example, now this could never happen, they could double the rent of the office building they own, but then have their campaign rent out an entire floor of that office building. In fact, if this person became president they could continue doing this for their entire presidency. This is all hypothetical and would be completely immoral and could never happen, of course. </p></div>		</li>
