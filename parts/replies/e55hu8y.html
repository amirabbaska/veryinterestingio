			<div class="markdown"><p>Same as true for TV shows as well. Few networks mean most people were tuning into similar things and had an easier time talking about and connecting over them. Now there are so many options plus people who barely watch TV at all and only a few shows really stand out.</p>
<p>At the same time, I think the current situation with music has blurred the boundaries between indie and mainstream, so itâ€™s possibly had a negative effect in that regard. Where I live, it seems like most trendy young people (&lt;30) are more into trap/soundcloud rap and alt-r&amp;b and some mainstream hiphop than indie related music, which is different than 10+ years ago. </p></div>		</li>
