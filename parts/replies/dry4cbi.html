			<div class="markdown"><p>VINEGAR
and i'm not kidding you. Washing vegetables with vinegar has proven to remove pesticides, bacteria and most certainly any kind of fly eggs. But /!\, just passing them through (vinegar OR water) is useless, you need to let them soak for a few minutes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I had was in french, and wasn't scientific enough, so I looked a little. I found this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3907644/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3907644/</a> it's long but quite thorough, about how to wash away pesticides from vegetables. If you search using vinegar's scientific name (acetic acid) you'll surely find more info :)</p></div>		</li>
