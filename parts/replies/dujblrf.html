			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but IIRC there was a crazy woodsman/Crocodile Dundee dude who did an &quot;experiment&quot; where he lived with a pack of wolves in the wild for an extended period of time.  When they were play fighting, the wolves <em>would</em> lick his wounds and according to his &quot;research&quot; the ones they licked vs the ones they didn't actually did heal faster.</p>
<p>Pretty sure it was a Nat Geo documentary, but this was years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because the equlibrium only works inside the mouth, not outside of it. Also, there are bacteria on the skin that can cause infection when it breaks, but otherwise not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda guessing, but I think that’s infesting your wound with too many different microbes at once.  Puncturing your skin with something sharp inoculates the wound with the staph and strep living on your skin AND you get all the awful stuff living in your mouth in there, too.  Polymicrobial Armageddon overwhelms the local immune response, probably.</p>
<p>Sometimes different strains of bacteria keep each other in check by competing for resources or inhibiting each other but sometimes those little assholes make each other more potent, like Strep. agalactiae’s CAMP factor making Staph. aureus’ beta-hemolysin destroy red blood cells more effectively.</p>
<p>Not sure the specific microbes/combinations responsible for human bite infections but Staph aureus and Strep pyogenes always seem to be safe answers for “why is pus coming out of this?”</p></div>		</li>
