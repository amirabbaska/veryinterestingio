			<div class="markdown"><p>Your level of coercion for entrapment is WAY WAY WAY too low. A plain clothes cop going &quot;hey I've got an eight on me for $30, want it?&quot; is not entrapment. &quot;Offering&quot; an opportunity to commit a crime is not entrapment. </p>
<p>Entrapment is actual coercion, and is usually held to a high (sometimes unfairly so) standard to prove. Threatening to hurt someone's family if they don't help them rob a bank is entrapment. Just asking someone if they want to partake in a heist is not entrapment. I don't know where you are getting this from.</p>
<p>To get an idea of just  how far cops can go without it being considered entrapment, there's a pretty popular story about a high school student who was tricked into helping an undercover cop posing as a fellow student to score some weed and then got busted for selling drugs. I believe he was autistic, and she tried to convince him that she was romantically interested in him over the course of an extended period of time. On multiple occasions she asked him to get her some weed, leveraging his feelings for her. He refused several times but eventually he caved cause of his feelings for her and found someone to buy some weed off of. When he sold it to her, he got bust for dealing drugs.</p>
<p>Even THAT wasn't considered entrapment in the court of law.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also I heard cops can't kiss someone they aren't in love with so I kiss all my criminal co conspirators just to make sure</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is pretty common. The police have the student do the entrapment, the law only prevents police from doing it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I oversimplified for ELI5, but if a cop was pushy about it and coerced you, that would be entrapment. Generally, they will be a bit more vague so they can pick up the easy cases, &quot;are you looking for (a good time, sex, a party, drugs, etc)&quot;. That would be bait, asking someone if they are looking to break the law is still reasonable and common. </p>
<p>If a cop was to follow you, pressuring you into commiting the crime, that would be entrapment. </p>
<p>Here is the most common exploit of the entrapment law, and a real example from my own life. Mike got caught with cocaine and told the police he would get his dealer. The problem was, Mike was scared of his dealer, he knew his dealer would kill him. He came to work and asked Juan to get him some cocaine. Juan didn't deal drugs, but knew some people, but still told him no. Mike asked him every day including offers of money, Juan still said now. Finally, after being pressured by the police, Mike told Juan that unless Juan helped, Mike would be killed by his dealer. Juan finally said yes, arranged a pickup and got arrested. If the police acted like Mike, then it would be entrapment, however since they were &quot;only&quot; telling Mike to set up a deal with his dealer, they did not entrap. A loophole in the law is that only an government agent can entrap, not a private citizen. </p>
<p>tl/dr: simple requests are not entrapment, it takes pressure. Police have private citizens do their dirty work</p></div>		</li>
