			<div class="markdown"><p>Prions are natural proteins, predominatly in the brain.</p>
<p>If they adopt a conformation rich in beta sheets they become prion^Sc (Scrapie form prion), which encourages an aggregate state. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, they're super hard to break down. Why can't the body break them down with it's natural defenses that fight against denaturing protiens? Is it an issue with those enzymes or the misfolded protiens themselves? We really don't know. Prions are relatively new in the scheme of things, compared to other disease causing things like viruses and bacteria</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well enzymes work on a structural level, if it can't get a &quot;grasp&quot; on the protein it can't break it down.  I think this is the issue with beta-amyloid?  I'm at the limit of my knowledge here so maybe a biochemist can add to this.  </p>
<p>I don't think prions are new either, protein folding is intrinsic to biological processes and over 5 billion years and countless protein generations prions must be a pretty regular thing.  They must get broken down though before they can cause damage or the organism only gets sick well after their reproductive years.  They seem to progress slowly.  We probably only see them now because we live so long.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Super hard or robust on a protein level doesn't mean that they're made of steel or a carbonfiber/titanium alloy or whatever. It just means that cells don't recognize them as proteins they need to get rid of and/or that there aren't any common enzymes that &quot;fit&quot; (for lack of a better term) on the prions to take them apart. Imagine the usual enzymes that cut up proteins are pairs of scissors that can only cut paper but the prion is made out of thin plastic.</p>
<p>If an enzyme then comes along that can cut plastic efficiently it'll chop it up just fine, the prion won't stand a chance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're hard to break down because they're extremely thermally stable. Think of protein folding as a landscape with hills and valleys. Normal, functional proteins are generally at a local minimum of energy (a valley). Prion-forming folds like amyloids are usually at a global minimum in the folding landscape - simply put, they're so stable that our cellular machinery cannot input the requisite amount of energy to get them out of that valley. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also interesting that some prion based diseases like BSE as mentioned are transmissible to humans, but others like CWD don't appear to be.  The scary thing about CWD is that it's present in free ranging cervids.  There's not really a good way to stomp it out of existence at this point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In sheep it's called scrapie. Almost impossible to get it out of a flock because it takes years for symptoms to show up and transmission is poorly understood, and prions can survive in the soil for a long time. </p></div>		</li>
