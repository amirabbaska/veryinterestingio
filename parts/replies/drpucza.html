			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll jump in here and just say, one human to another, this is a poor way to talk to or about people. We don't need to be toxic to one another. Would you say this to somebody's face? Just take a look at yourself and think about what kind of energy you're putting into the world. Are you proud of it?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best counter-argument is to take him out on a pier and show him the boats disappearing over the horizon. If the earth was flat the boat should just get slowly smaller and smaller but never flat-out disappear. If the world is round, youâ€™d expect the boat to disappear as the curve became too great and it sunk below the horizon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really the best argument because of refraction, I think the best argument is the flight from S. America to Australia, on a globe it takes roughly 12 hours flying by antarctica, but on a flat earth it's about twice that, this is a fact that can be experienced and measured by anyone, it's absolutely undeniable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find that the best counter argument is that we have daylight on one side of the globe and night on the other. It doesn't work on a flat map of the Earth and any sort of spotlight sun explanation is easy to shoot down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, the primary factor is that the atmosphere takes time to heat up. But since the question seemed to concern angle I wanted to point out that angle can certainly make a dramatic difference in the power delivered. </p></div>		</li>
