			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered about the wave collapse. I'm sure this is common knowledge for people familiar with it so forgive my ignorance, but; Is it possible that when working on a quantum scale, the act of measuring or looking at the wave somehow interferes with it, causing its collapse? For example, looking at it sends out some sort of energy that we aren't able to perceive? Meaning, something sent out from the recording device interferes with the natural state of the wave function.</p>
<p>If this were the case would that kill the MWI theory and solve (as far as I know) what is one of the biggest questions in quantum mechanics? </p></div>		</li>

<p>We know exactly what energy is interfering. In order for us to observe something then we need to shine &quot;light&quot; (photons) on it.
For an electron to become detectable, a photon must first interact with it, and this interaction will inevitably change the path of that electron. It is also possible for other, less direct means of measurement to affect the electron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense. So in that case wouldn't it be more probable that those photons are the cause of its collapse? It seems as though that idea is never even mentioned when talking about the collapse. </p></div>		</li>
