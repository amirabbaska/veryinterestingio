			<p>I don't need to, Bretton Woods ended in 1971 under Nixon making the US Dollar a fiat currency.<br><br>The British Pound dropped the gold standard in 1914 when WWI broke out.<br><br>The Euro has been fiat currency since it's introduction. <br><br>That's pretty much every western country, though the question is irrelevant.</p>		</li>
