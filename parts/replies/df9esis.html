			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I think this &quot;paradox&quot; occurs due to how we imagine the reference frames. The photon travels a straight-line path but it also is traveling speed C (so this frame is a bit weird to think about). The lensing from a massive object will bend the photon's path and this is what we observer from the massive object and most frames you would consider outside the photon. This path is curved and the frame we are observing from  is not at speed C, so it's a frame a little bit more relatable to. The photons that the massive object absorbs, are the actual straight-line paths an outside observer would see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. You can see something that's right behind a singularity in a black hole. There wouldn't be a straight line from you to the object, but the gravity of the singularity would bend the light in a way that would reach you anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we can see a star after its already burned out, then can't we see a star that has something blocking the view? Like, the light passed the point of the object and we won't know an object even crossed the path until a few years after or whatever?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The notion of &quot;already&quot; is interesting when we deal with cosmic distances and the speed of light. </p>
<p>We won't &quot;know&quot; it's been burned out until we stop getting information from it - let it be a scout we sent who transmits 'I'm alive' signals, receive light from it, or see its gravitational affects (which Einstein proved travel at the speed of light). </p>
<p>We can't really tell what's happened first or second between two objects at a huge distance that don't interact, unless they do interact (like light from this long-dead star hitting earth)</p></div>		</li>
