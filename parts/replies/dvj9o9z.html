			<div class="markdown"><p>Each of the colors is a different variety. Like red peppers start green and ripen to red, orange peppers start green and ripen to orange. Each plant makes a certain color. Red, orange, and yellow are not different ripenesses of a single plant, but the fully ripe version of their own plants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this myth is perpetuated because the reds and yellows etc. go through a stage when they are green.  But you're right, they are different plants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah there's a great deal of misunderstanding in this thread. People are thinking peppers progress through green to yellow to orange to red, but it's green to yellow, green to orange, and green to red. The green peppers you buy at the store may be any of those unripe peppers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, this talks about how the peppers help you taste the rest of the dish. The entire reason I hate bell peppers is because when it's in a dish, no matter the quantity, literally all I can taste is bell pepper. The flavor is totally and completely overwhelming, and ruins anything it's put in for me. </p></div>		</li>
