			<div class="markdown"><p>So to take it to the next level, why is peppermint filled with holes? Is it just a material saving measure, or does it have a flavor component? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its also likely due to the fact that hard candies, such as peppermints, are made white by stretching and folding the hot sugar over and over, forming millions of tiny air bubbles which changes the uncoloured candy from a yellowish colour to white. The bubbles where always there, and as the candy erodes in your mouth, the bubbles cavitate and join with other bubbles, and so on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct about where the air pockets come from, but nothing cavitates. That is not what cavitate means at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So with this logic, you have to eat two peppermint candy canes to equal one solid candy cane. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has a flavor component.  <del>Supercavitation</del> Microcavitation maximizes the surface area that's exposed.  That, in turn, maximizes the flavor surface exposed to your tongue. So the peppermint is cramming a much larger surface area into something that will rest comfortably on your tongue, delivering way more flavor than one of those hard candy mints ever could.</p>
<p>[Edit] thatâ€™ll teach me to type while distracted.  Supercavitation of course means to create a cavity outside; mints are covered in tiny holes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not what supercavitation means. That being said, you should look up supercavitation because it's cool too. Unrelated to candy though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused, I thought supercavitation was the proscess of creating an air cavity around an object moving through a liquid to reduce drag. </p></div>		</li>
