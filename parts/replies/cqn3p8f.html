			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been satisfied with some of the answers, but you're right, that's what I meant.</p>
<p>When I see closeups of octopus cells changing colors, it makes me feel like they're clenching or something, so I wonder how much energy they have to exert to change/maintain a color/pattern. Is it more like blinking or like flexing a six pack?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The answer to this is yes, technically, but the opposing forces aren't that great to fatigue the animal past being able to use the muscles.</p>
<p>It is <strong>not</strong> opposing muscle groups at work, essentially like what occurs in the iris of a human eye, between the iris sphincter muscle, and iris dilator muscle. At rest your muscles are not straining, but only one muscle group is at work in these chromatophores.</p>
<p>The animals contracts radial muscles to expand the pigmented cytoelastic sacculus, and when relaxed the sacculus, which is elastic, constricts back on itself.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, this slightly clarifies things but leads to some followup questions.</p>
<p>To make sure I understand your explanation correctly, are you saying that it takes very little effort for an octopus to change colors, and that it could hold the color change for a few hours without fatigue, much like a human could sit in a lit room all day with no problem?</p>
<p>I imagine different principles apply for its texture changing ability.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It takes energy to maintain.</p>
