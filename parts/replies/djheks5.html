			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the purpose of the web is to be destroyed.  If the spiders web is perfectly intact after a day, then the spider didn't catch anything.  The web can't be so strong that it won't break and tangle the prey.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to throw bugs into spider's webs too. Particularly golden orb web spiders (they're big bastards and spin a very strong golden/yellow coloured web).e feeding the spiders horrified my grandmother - she wanted me to be a ballerina or something. <em>shrugs shoulders</em> Oh well!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spiders also build based on environmental conditions. For instance, airflow and light are two important factors.</p>
<p>Spiders primarily catch flying insects that tend to ride airflows. A spider won't catch much by making a web parallel to a wall for instance.</p>
<p>And when a spider builds a web, the first beginnings aren't very controlled at all. Most spiders start by letting out single threads into the wind while spinning them longer and longer until the end of the thread hits something and sticks. That's how they cross gaps with their silk.</p>
<p>Once that first thread has crossed a gap, the spider will use it as a bridge to start laying more threads across the gap at varying angles. It doesn't start laying down sticky threads until it starts weaving lines between it's original bridges.</p>
<p>For a spider, a web is just a disposable tool. They can build one in the space of a few hours and will often abandon webs that don't catch anything in a night or two since they're obviously in the wrong spot.</p>
<p>On top of that people underestimate just how numerous spiders are. In most places there's numberous webs in every square meter of greenery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people don't realize that spiders can actually eat their own web, digest it, and use the nutrients to spin more web in the future. If you destroy a web, they likely clean it up and do it again, but if you remove it completely (and take away all the silk), the spider might be a bit disappointed.</p></div>		</li>
