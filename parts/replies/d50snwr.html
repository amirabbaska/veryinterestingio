<p>Why do the effects of acids differ so enormously when the quantity of H+ is almost the same at low pH values?</p>
<p>E.g. the fraction 100 / 1 vs 100 / 0.01. The latter is much lower on the pH scale and considered much more acidic, but the absolute number of H+ ions is almost the same. Why does a <em>relatively</em> small change in the OH- quantity present weaken the acid significantly?</p>
<p>Illustrative example: I have a substance containing 10000 of A and 100 of B. This has a certain effect. If I instead mix a substance with 10099 of A and 1 of B, the effect is much stronger. How come? Why does B disrupt the effect so strongly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But this is for the same volume, so concentration =&gt; quantity, and the above applies, no?</p>
<p>Let's say pH in 1L liquid, quantity of H+ for pH 5 vs pH 3. </p>
<p>edit: wait, maybe it's not that simple. In 1L liquid the proportion 100/1  could obviously represent 100/1 or 100bn/1bn...</p></div>		</li>
