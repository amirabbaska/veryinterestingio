			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an structural engineer (civil license, specialize in structural, will be taking my structural license exams in two years). I work in the bay area. Yes you can retrofit foundations. I mainly design, retrofit, and remodel 1 and two store wood shearwall buildings,  which work very well in earthquakes, because they are very light compared to steel, concrete, and masonry, so you can actually design the connections  to transfer all of the loss from an earthquake.</p>
<p>Back on topic.
During the recent Napa earthquake many of the older wood builds essentially slid off of their foundations, because older buildings didn't use as many, or any anchor bolts from the bottom of the walls to the foundations. To retrofit this buildings, which already had decent foundations, we moved the buildings back onto the foundations, replaced the older diagonal sheathing with plywood shearwalls, , drilled holes through the wood mud will plates into the foundation and either epoxied new anchor bolts in, or installed anchors that don't need epoxy and just bite into the concrete. At the end of shearwalls we also add &quot;holdowns&quot; which are and anchor that screws onto a vertical wall post or studs and has a longer threaded rod embedded into the footing. These keep the was from tipping over/ lifting up.</p>
<p>Some of the really old buildings in Napa had rock and mortar foundations, where they just piled rocks and put mortar between them... in these cases whole sections of the foundation fell apart. To retrofit these buildings we either completely removed and replaced the foundation, one section at a time.</p>
<p>When we have farm buildings or older houses that people want to retrofit and upgrade into a house/ better house, we usually remove and replace sections for foundation under shearwall for lateral load, and put new footings under heavy vertical loads, but leave existing foundations in place if they are taking minimal load and appear to be performing well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I was under the impression that sill plates almost never move, and sliding buildings usually slide at the attachment between sill and floor, so that tie-downs are more important than adding anchor bolts. Is this not correct? BTW, do you have a reference I could look at? Much obliged!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, currently the city I live in is doing a whole bunch of that (or simply tearing the building down if it's not worth it). We had a 7.8 quake last November that er... jolted people into action.</p>
<p>One of the techniques is to install base isolators. These are big rubber and lead shock absorbers that the building sits on.</p>
<p>The city council put out a <a href="http://wellington.govt.nz/~/media/services/rates-and-property/earthquake-prone-buildings/files/eq-prone-buildings-guide.pdf" target="_blank">document</a> on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about that NZ museum, however there is a Le Corbusier designed museum in Tokyo where Base isolation was installed on the building years after its construction. <a href="http://www.siecorp.com/lfe/Projects/Seismic_Isolation/National_Museum_of_Western_Art/national_museum_of_western_art.html" target="_blank">http://www.siecorp.com/lfe/Projects/Seismic_Isolation/National_Museum_of_Western_Art/national_museum_of_western_art.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact! Here (Wellington, NZ) one of the reinforcement techniques is to get the structural columns and wrap them in carbon fibre. Actual carbon fibre, actual epoxy, huge 3mm (ish) thick sheets of it. I <em>think</em> the idea is:</p>
<ul>
<li>That the concrete in the columns cracks and goes, for want of a better word, biscuit'y in an earthquake.</li>
<li>But this is OK because the carbon fibre stretches not one little bit so you just end up with a carbon tube, full of bits of concrete that are under compression but can't go anywhere and as a result...</li>
<li>They don't. And the building remains upright :)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of the story of <a href="http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/eqmaps/fixit/structsuccess.html" target="_blank">architect Michael O'Hearn</a> who owned two identical houses.  He completed a retrofit on only one of them just before the Loma Prieta earthquake struck.  He unwittingly performed an experiment on the value of a retrofit.</p></div>		</li>
