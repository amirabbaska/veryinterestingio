			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Its mainly from picking hit things out of the oven when youre too busy to put on mits. Hurts for about a year but eventually you pretty much cant feel it.  </p></div>		</li>

It probably wasn't much of a problem for her, but most fingerprint scanners (like the one on this phone) don't work for me. Some sensitive ones still do. </p></div>		</li>
