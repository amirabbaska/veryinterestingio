<p>the visual area in the brain is probably functional albeit not as developed as a normal person, then yes.</p>

<p>Considering the plasticity of the brain, a younger subject would probably adapt easier. </p>
<p>It would be interesting to see if this is like language and there is a certain point at which the brain will no longer accept visual input.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually answerable. There is a &quot;critical development point&quot; for all animals I know of for vision. If vision is impaired during that, there is irreparable permanent damage. Critical period of visual development would be the keyword to search. I want to say it's somewhere between birth- 6 weeks or 4 months in humans. Not hard to search if you have more interest.
Vision barely develops if this critical period is missed (due to temporary blindness from say, disease, or something as simple as an eyepatch)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a disorder, although I don't remember to term, where people cannot recognize the people's faces. This usually due to the person not having proper corrective glasses as a child. So, they learn other coping mechanisms like paying close attention to a conversation. If they are talking to some woman that's their mother's age that knows personal details, then it must be their mother. Does someone know the name of this disorder? ... Or, am I batshit crazy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that we know of. You can slow the decay simply by living healthy but plasticity decays at different ages in different people. Plasticity starts decaying very early (within the first few years of life) and the rate increases with age</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neurobiologist checking in. I'm on a phone right now but did a big presentation on the future of visual posthetics a few years ago.
There is a strategy being worked on with a camera linked to a processing chip which feeds straight into the visual cortex and the subject can &quot;see&quot; lights depending on the region stimulated. With more refinement it should be possible to project the camera input into the correct blips of light based on brain-target to &quot;see&quot; what the camera is recording. No optic nerve required. That being said, the visual prosthetics built on the retinas of people with functioning optic cords are already vastly more successful and easier to use. </p>
