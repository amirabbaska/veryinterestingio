			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense.  If they block it it's they're fault and their consumers will look for a different option (albeit probably they're only other option).  If just Netflix is slow, it's Netflix's fault.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slowing their traffic might be more effective than blocking. Because if it's blocked,people get the idea &quot;there's something my internet company doesn't want me to know&quot;,and they may be tempted to bypass the block or look it up somewhere else. Slowing can give the impression(even if only subconciously) that that competitor's network is inferior since &quot;surely it couldn't be your current ISP's fault since the other sites are loading quickly&quot;.
A dirty trick imo</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats a big thing - there are a lot if things that really big companies really like.  One of those things is using their power and influence to make sure that they stay large and powerful.  It works best when they can use that power to block out competition from threatening that balance.  It really isn’t a free market when it comes to internet access, and the ISP’s want to keep it that way.</p>
<p>I recall that one time the city if (i believe it was) Chattanooga TN wanted to lay out the infrastructure to provide faster service than the local ISP for less money.  The ISP sued the city and won.  I think they cited unfair competition.  Either that or they had some regulated monopoly grant from years ago.  I can’t remember.  Point is, they don’t like competition - even with their own services.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is horrifying and its why search engines which specifically emphasis NO collection of data like duckduckgo.com have become more popular as of late. Anytime you use ANY service that you sign in to, your actions on that service are liable to be sold to advertisers (or anyone with $$). I say liable because many of these companies have T&amp;Cs that state that they will never sell anything but de-identified data for research purposes (google is one of these companies). </p>
<p>This bill on the otherhand is talking about ISPs, and ISPs are covered within the Cable Act of 1984- which makes it illegal to reveal identifiable information about their consumers. AFAIK the most ISPs will be able to do with the passing of this bill into law is release the same aggregate de-identified data that marketers use for trend analysis, ROI reporting, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Just because carriers are allowed to market against data doesn’t mean they’re allowed to sell individual web histories. The campaigns seem well-intentioned, but that’s just not how it works.</p>
<p>In fact, what the campaigns describe would be illegal no matter what the FCC does. The Telecommunications Act explicitly prohibits the sharing of “individually identifiable” customer information except under very specific circumstances. It’s much more permissive when it comes to “aggregate” customer information, which is where things get squishier and the FCC rules become more important. We could argue all day about whether a targeted ad is individually identifiable or not, but if you’re paying Verizon to find out which sites Paul Ryan visited last month, that’s pretty clearly individual information, and pretty clearly illegal to sell. If you want to get really clever, the Wiretap Act also makes it illegal to divulge the contents of electronic communications without the parties’ consent, which arguably includes browsing history.</p>
<p>But we don’t even need to get that far, because even if it weren’t illegal, carriers would never offer a service that unmasked all the gross and horrible things their customers do online. Targeted ads can be creepy, but they’re not that creepy, and they every major network has robust safeguards in place to prevent you from working back to a single person’s web history.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>The truth is, large companies have been invading your privacy for almost a century now, regardless of the technology involved. </p>

<p>It's a little different now though because of the highly detailed data an ISP can get from you. </p>
<p>Facebook gets all the information about your likes, key words from posts, location data from photos, ect. They can push ads to specific groups. But the second you leave Facebook (not via hyperlink though) they stop getting that data. They have no idea what you buy on Amazon, or what bank you use. </p>
<p>But your ISP does. They have everything. They can stitch info and data together from multiple streams. So now they can go to Bank of America and say &quot;hey we have all this data about Chase customers that also seem to be unhappy with their current bank, would you like to buy it?&quot; </p>
<p>ISPs will be able to know everything about you. Oh don't forget your Cell Carrier counts as an ISP in regards to this so anything done through your phone is also available for recording, and selling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's why I think it's more of an issue. Because someone who desires privacy can opt out of using Facebook. I don't know a lot of people who can actually opt out, or choose a different internet service carrier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would basically have to go off grid to not be affected by this. Mobile carriers actually have a leg up now as they also have your call history. </p>
<p>I'm actually curious how this will play out with businesses. I'm sure there are a lot of businesses that would not be happy with an ISP sifting through their history. </p></div>		</li>
