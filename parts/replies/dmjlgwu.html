			<div class="markdown"><p>And it depends what you're trying to achieve.</p>
<p>For instance, Monster University averaged at 29hours <em>per frame</em> to render. 24fps, 104mins runtime, you do the math.</p>
<p>That was partly because they had a lot of characters on screen at any time (complex scenes), but also because Sully in particular had 5.4million individual hairs in his fur. Rendering that is a nightmare (it's also why Lotsa was cut from Toy Story 1 - they couldn't do fur well back then - note all the TS1 toys have smooth surfaces - plastic like Woody, Buzz and Potato Head, or Porcelain like Bo Peep - rendering smooth surfaces is <em>relatively</em> easy).</p>
<p>So if your animation uses relatively few textures/assets or rigged models, the animation is more straightforward. If you want realistic fur, water or fire then you're going to get a big bill from the render farm because you're buying more hours of their compute time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I went to a Pixar exhibit and the amount of time/steps it takes to model, animate, light, and render... It bogles the mind</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes you realize how impressive PC gaming is. Things look a lot more realistic and they can render a whopping 60 frames of it per second. Sure, it doesn't look as indistinguishable from real life as CGI, but they look amazing for what you get</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, games essentially strip quality from the process until it can be rendered in real time. Realistic-looking CGI renders happen slower than real time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Decent enough answer, but I just want to add that the process is a lot more creative these days. You definitely don't have to be a computer programmer.</p></div>		</li>
