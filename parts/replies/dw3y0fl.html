			<div class="markdown"><p>So trippy to think about.  How we're basically in a Truman Show type situation.  Granted the world we live in is huge compared to Truman's, but there is still life beyond the point in which we're not allowed to see past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't understand what you meant until the last statement. I particularly like how you chose to say &quot;not allowed to see&quot;. &quot;Not allowed&quot; like a adult say a child can't have candy, but more akin to the physical limitations of what is able, or &quot;allowed&quot;, to be seen. It really helped me get perspective on the scale of the observable universe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah its infuriating and tantalizing.  if its any solace, the amount of matter in our finite observable bubble may as well be infinite. billions of <em>galaxies</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the reasoning for it <em>not</em> being an actual edge is because of how freakishly homogenous everything we can see is, suggesting that this just goes on forever.  imagine you are looking straight down at a field of pure grass with no weeds or bushes, just grass. you can sees a 100 meter length of grass.  do you think its likely that there is more grass outside of your view? or does the grass abruptly end the first inch outside of your view? you obviously cannot <em>know</em>, but it seems likely the grass just continues</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heard this example but with the ocean. Basically expecting the universe to not be more of what we can see past the observable parts is like looking off the coast at the ocean and expecting an abrupt wall where the water doesnâ€™t continue at the very point of the horizon </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if the reason we cant see past the observable universe is because there is nothing to see, rather than it moving faster than we can see it? What if the &quot;observable&quot; universe was just a huge cluster of matter in a void? What if the &quot;expanding&quot;  universe is just the matter spreading out in the void? Like the balloon example, what if there was an infinite emptiness outside of the balloon, but within the balloon was matter. Take that balloon, and remove the balloon itself. Just leave the matter that was in it. Now, like gas, it just spreads out into the nothingness around it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible to disprove the hypothesis &quot;our observable universe is entirely contained inside a black hole inside some other 'superset' universe&quot;? Your inside-out event horizon metaphor made me wonder.</p></div>		</li>
