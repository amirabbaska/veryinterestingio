			<div class="markdown"><p>That was an amazing answer. Thank you so much for taking the time to write it all for me. I think I actually understand now. So, in the most basic way, if I understand correctly, the more times you experience a certain thing, the easier it is to remember because it's not new anymore, right? </p></div>		</li>

<p>In a way! Let's say we're trying to remember a particular flower we saw on the way home. At the moment of perception, our eyes receive physical photons/wavelengths that we eventually process as color information, shape information, etc. Part of the visual pathway is responsible for object recognition, this will then trigger a series of neurons that are associated with the image of prior flowers we may have transcribed in our memory, as well as all the peripheral associations we have learned about flowers (i.e., flowers are pretty, flowers smell good, etc). Neuronal information is going through all these pathways and so long as we keep &quot;thinking&quot; about it, consciously or unconsciously, we will be making small synaptic (the junction between neurons) changes. So, it's not so much as it's new, but because our neurons are continuously firing in similar &quot;routes&quot; or circuits when we encounter this object. Thus, even when we come across the flower the next day, even though it's not new information, we are still training a neuronal pathway when it comes across our gaze. </p>
<p>This is also true for non-visual cues and probably an easier way to think about it. Think about musicians. I'm sure you've heard the term muscle memory. A pathway leading to your fingers has been repeatedly practiced and more prone to activation (due to the same synaptic changes I explained in the parent post), which is why eventually playing a series of keys needs little conscious effort. </p>
<p>So: Physical sensory information (let's say, sheet music) > Sensory organ interprets physical info into electrical/chemical info > neuron on a pathway triggers > another neuron on the pathway triggers > etc > eventually a very weak signal reaches your fingers. </p>
<p>We continuously do this, and now that original physical sensory information is able to relay that info much faster and stronger than previously possible, because each neuron has become more sensitive to that information as they each add additional NMDA/AMPA receptors! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that why when you are driving and think about a type of car suddenly you notice there are tons of them on the road. So basically they are just background noise until you activate your memory of that vehicleâ€™s characteristics and then they stand out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any scientific understanding of why some people like myself have an excellent memory for numbers but an absolute horrible memory for names?  </p>
<p>I've learned to transliterate the names of new people I meet into numbers and it helps me remember much better. When I encounter them again, I recognize them and convert the numbers I assigned to them back to letters and usually get it right.  </p>
<p>So while that seems to be an unnecessary extra step or two, it's effective for me. Just curious if there's any name or whatever for that kind of roundabout mental processing.  </p>
<p>Thanks in advance, /u/4298042980 ... errr, I mean /u/fwompfwomp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, interesting question! </p>
<p>Just through logical deduction, if numbers come more easily to you then you probably work with numbers enough that neural circuits associated with numbers and working through them are stronger than remembering faces. Enough so, that that extra step is more efficient. But, remembering faces and names has a lot of steps to it.</p>
<p>I believe remembering someone's name is more so something at an encoding level; I am absolutely horrible at remembering names. I think in part it's because when we introduce ourselves to someone new, we really only get one shot at receiving their name, encoding, and transcribing that information. If it's somewhat a formal meeting. we don't really have a large impression of this person unless they are majorly significant. I also know there are specific regions in the left hemisphere that deals with facial recognition, maybe there's some sort of circuitry between there and a hippocampal region that isn't being conditioned enough? Totally spit balling. </p>
<p>Funnily enough, what you're doing is a version of pegging, a version of a memory strategy with a lot of cog psych research behind it. So, hey, what ever works for you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it usually works for me so I guess I'll keep on with that strategy. I honestly can't even remember when I started using it and it still seems somewhat awkward to me (in the sense that recognizing someone feels more digital than analog), but that's all internalized so I don't think it really affects me socially.  </p>
<p>Thanks for your reply and input!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, pegging is an interesting name for it.</p>
<p>I always found interesting that I don't have problems remembering new names, meaning names that I have not known beforehand (happens mostly with people from other cultures). I am not sure if this is because I simply take more attention to it and therefore would remember any name better or if it is because it is another part of learning. With &quot;known&quot; names, I think I just don't make the connection between a name I already know with a new face. It just dissapears or I know that one of these people is called Michael, but not which one it was.</p>
<p>Numbers are easier, but I like numbers, so that could explain it.</p></div>		</li>
