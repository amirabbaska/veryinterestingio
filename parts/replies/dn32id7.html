			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! Or at least it probably does. Basal metabolism obeys a power law; basal metabolic rates increase with body size at a rate somehow between being proportional to body mass and body surface area. But that can't quite resolve the paradox because we would still expect to see more cancers than we appear to in larger organisms if that were the only explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could it also have anything to do with the physical nature of cancer detection? What I mean by this is, in larger animals, is there simply more space for a cancer cell to &quot;hide&quot; and divide before being found by the immune cells, compared to a smaller animal?  Also, in larger mammals, since distance would affect Fick's law in diffusion, could there also be a build up in reactive oxygen species which is causing DNA damage? </p></div>		</li>
