			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Here's an easier way to see why it's wrong:</p>
<p><code>0 = 0</code></p>
<p><code>0 x 5 = 0 x 6</code></p>
<p>Dividing by zero on both sides,</p>
<p><code>5 = 6</code></p>
<p>Hope that clears it up why this rule exists</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><pre><code>  2 x 5 = 10   10 ÷ 2 = 5  
  3 x 6 = 18   18 ÷ 3 = 6  
  0 x 7 = 0     0 ÷ 0 must be equal to 7... 
  0 x 8 = 0     0 ÷ 0 is now 8? 
  0 x 1,123,142 = 0    0 ÷ 0 is now a seven digit number!??</code></pre>
<p>Following this pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can't do 10 ÷ 0 because there's no way to get 0 x n to equal 10.</p>
</li>
<li>You can't do 0 ÷ 0 because it the answer would have to be 7 and 8 and 1,123,142 and 2.5 and 99 and every other number as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>In mathematical terms, n ÷ 0 is undefined.  There's no answer that doesn't break math somehow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trick in this solution is because normally you can divide both sides by a common factor. The specific reason why it doesn't work here is because we're initially given a=b+c, which rearranges to: a - b - c = 0.</p>
<p>So if we added another step into the provided solution it becomes a little clearer what is going on:</p>
<pre><code>a(a-b-c)=b(a-b-c)   // from the submitted solution
a(0)=b(0)   // substituting a-b-c for 0, given that a=b+c.</code></pre></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many ways that don't necessarily divide by zero.
For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>e^(i<em>theta) = cos(theta) + i</em>sin(theta) (Euler's formula - a result from complex analysis)</p>
<p>let theta = Pi</p>
<p>e^(i<em>Pi) = -1 + i</em>0</p>
<p>e^(i*Pi) = -1</p>
<p>square both sides</p>
<p>e^(2i*Pi) = 1</p>
<p>Natural Log of both sides</p>
<p>Ln(e^(2i*Pi)) = Ln(1)</p>
<p>2i*Pi = 0</p>
<p>divide by i*Pi</p>
<p>2 = 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spoiler:
This false proof is actually abusing the fact that the natural log function on the complex plane is one-to-many. Ln(1) in the complex plane has infinitely many solutions due to the underlying trigonometric functions. Ln(1) = 0 is only one such solution. All of the solutions to Ln(1) are 2n*i*Pi for some integer n. So for n = 0, Ln(1) = 0. For n = 1, Ln(1) = 2i*Pi (which is the value you see in the above proof).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ln(1) in the complex plane has infinitely many solutions forming a circle. Ln(1) = 0 is only one such solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The possible values of log(1) are 2in*pi for integers n (with 0 as the principal value), which do not form a circle in complex plane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, not all of them, just the ones used by 14 year olds trying to seem smart. So if someone who seems like they don't know a proof from a poptart shows you a proof that leads to a ridiculous answer then yes, it's almost always a divide by zero problem. </p></div>		</li>
