			<div class="markdown"><p>i don't doubt we find a new species from time to time, but it isn't like they are crawling out of a primordial ooze like our ancestors did.  so why aren't we finding new ooze monsters?  </p></div>		</li>

<p>One can truly appreciate the lightning-striking-water thing, if we just grasp the time scales involved. The first organisms probably took hundreds of millions of years to form from this chemical soup in the ocean. There were so many molecules, and so many interactions, and so much time, that probabilistically molecules that could self-replicate were bound to form. Also, it helps to remember that these molecules wouldn't 'go bad' with time, because there were no agents that consumed them.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: Yes nature does do step one of the process, but there isn't enough time or lack of disturbance to actually proceed with biogenesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nature is randomly creating a TON of complex things all of the time, but the Earth or even a single galaxy is too small of a sample size so it just <em>seems</em> like its been a while. Locally, life itself is pretty damn random in the past few billion years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so nature can make things by accident that we can't begin to fathom making on purpose? a puddle of muck and some lightning are really too much for modern scientists to replicate?  sounds silly.   </p></div>		</li>
