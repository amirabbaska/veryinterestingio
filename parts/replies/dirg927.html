			<div class="markdown"><p>Can someone entering an MLM be successful if they themselves know it's a suckers game? Like they go in, thinking &quot;I just need to recruit desperate suckers&quot; or will they always lose out, regardless of knowing how it works? Are they just playing themselves, does the suckee become the sucker?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the MLMs and the wit of the person. Some are rigged from the start, however since recruiting is more important than sales to most of these companies, it's not inconceivable. The issue is the social cost, that person would become &quot;The person who ruined my life&quot; or &quot;The person who ruined my mirage&quot;. to so many people. Also they don't really make any money unless their recruits are buying product. So the turnover rate would need to be high. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Thankfully Amazon and eBay are slowly killing off MLMs profitability however since MLMs focus all on proprietary products/brands this erosion is slow.</p>

<p>I'm not sure companies like Amazon and eBay can kill off MLMs.  They make it increasingly unlikely that individuals within the MLM will make money, but those people don't make money anyway.  Even if they can't sell the product, they still buy the product in order to get started, which is how the people at the top of the pyramid make money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I sad &quot;Slowly&quot;. The slowing effect eBay and Amazon is having on MLMs is making it difficult to recruit, since people are getting smart enough to realize the internet is king and you can't out compete it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'm just saying that there's even really a slowing effect.  You're assuming &quot;people are getting smart&quot;, which doesn't seem to be the case.  MLMs seem to be booming.</p>
<p>If anything, it seems like the success of Internet companies have increased people's belief in get-rich-quick schemes.  Everyone thinks you can quickly write an iOS app that will sell for a billion dollars.  So now, people who don't know anything about computers are feeling left out, and looking for their own get-rich-quick opportunity.</p>
<p>In addition to that, social networking, spam, and other online marketing is making it easier for these companies to find new rubes all the time.</p>
<p>If anything is going to kill MLM schemes, it'll be that they exhaust their audience.  That is to say, there's a finite number of people in the world, and if enough get burned by an MLM scheme, there might not be enough people left to allow the scam to be successful.</p>
<p>The other possibility is that the government could get involved and regulate these things, but I wouldn't bet on that.</p></div>		</li>
