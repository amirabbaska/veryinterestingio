			<div class="markdown"><p>As med students on call nights we used to see who could hold their breath long enough for their O2 sat to drop - pulse ox on finger, sit and wait.  It's actually really hard to get it to budge.</p>
<p>If you hyperventilate first and blow off some CO2 it helps.  But don't do this, especially around water - some people can (supposedly) get their O2 sat down really low this way and then pass out, though it's actually still quite hard.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And then on the other hand you get the 70 yr old COPD sufferer  that's sitting st 75% saturation and is talking to you like nothing was wrong and will only complain about lightheadddness and slight need of air  at 70%...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You get it.  Severe hyperventilation is the key, providing two key effects: lowering blood CO2 level,  and increasing O2 levels far above the inaccurate &quot;100%&quot; SpO2 gauge reading. The Sp02 reading is designed to be an estimate of &quot;normal&quot; oxygen saturation...the 100% reading has nothing to do with the true oxygen-carrying capacity of RBC/hemoglobin.  The SpO2 meter's reading of 100% actually only correlates to a measurement of about 100 mmHg (partial pressure of oxygen).  This begs the question, &quot;Can I create an environment where my blood can carry more O2 than the 'normal' 100%?&quot;  Sure, easily.  </p>
<p>You can hyperventilate using 100% O2 <del>from your scuba rig</del> to get your true O2 level up to  300-400 mmHg.  You can then increase it over 500 mmHb by increasing your hematocrit (% of RBCs in your blood) via &quot;blood doping&quot; (EPO injections or transfusions).</p>
<p>Remember: the cute little SpO2 finger meter will never provide a reading over 100% (~100mmHg) though...but you would get a much higher (accurate) reading if you stabbed your artery for an ABG test.</p>
<p>TLDR:  You too can hold your breath for 5+ minutes if you utilize blood doping and hyperventilation.  It actually has very little to do with &quot;practicing&quot;.  They really should teach this stuff in med school.  A critical thinker would not allow a contestant to run to the bathroom 5 minutes before the official &quot;hold your breath test&quot;...or at least search that bathroom for the little 100% O2 canister hidden in the back of the toilet reservoir.</p>
<p>Another note:  It doesn't help that chemistry professors sometimes don't know what they're talking about.  This is complete garbage:  &quot;An SaO2 of 97% simply means that of every 100 hemoglobin binding sites, 97 are occupied with an oxygen molecule and the other three are either bound to something else or are unbound.&quot;  This is far too simplified (and inaccurate) for a graduate level chemistry class (bad Nebraska!).

<p>The urge to breath becomes intense very quickly because your body doesn't actually have anyway to sense the amount of oxygen in your blood but rather senses the build up of CO2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Close, but you do have a hypoxic drive as well.  It's not as strong as the central drive to breathe (driven by acidity/CO2, which is essentially the same thing in this case).  Central receptors respond to increasing acidity by increasing respiratory drive, however, in cases of long-term CO2 retention (think COPD), central chemoreceptors get desensitized.  This leaves peripheral chemoreceptors, which do sense PO2, as the only mechanism left to drive respiration.  When these patient get O2, they sometimes lose their hypoxic drive and actually stop breathing because peripheral chemoreceptors drive down respiratory drive (due to increased O2 saturation) without recompense by the central chemoreceptors.  They literally suffocate to death while having perfect blood gasses.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>His bit about inhaling pure oxygen wouldn't do much either right? Our blood oxygen saturation is normally ~97%, and the 3% remaining isn't because of poor perfusion but rather just a physiological shunt, yeah?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It mostly has to do with actual blood flow to the brain and not o2 sat of the blood.  The whole 6 minute thing is related to talk about ischemic strokes where you completely prevent blood flow to a region of the brain.  No blood no oxygen dead brain.</p>
<p>That's why for people in cardiac arrest you can do good quality compressions for a long time (say 20 minutes) without giving breaths and people can still have an alright outcome, but of course at some point you need to reoxygenate the blood.</p>
<p>And about the hands tingling - just an interesting side note - not really from blood shunting away from the extremities - the hyperventilating (being out of breath) causes a relative alkalosis (blood is less acidic than normal).  When this happens the proteins in your blood more avidly bind calcium - the relative hypocalcemia that develops leads to paresthesias (tingling).  You normalize your breathing, calcium releases, tingling stops.</p>
<p>Ok that is all.  I'm sure no one will see this.</p></div>		</li>
