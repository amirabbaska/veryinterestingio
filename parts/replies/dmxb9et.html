			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent answer, but not the end of the story. You may have heard of molten salt reactors, invented in the 1960s and recently 'rediscovered'. They are capable of 'burning' the waste products and used fuel left behind by conventional nuclear reactors, converting all that toxic radioactive debris into usable energy. They are also smaller, simpler, and safer than existing reactor designs, requiring far less shielding, containing no water or pressurized steam, and being effectively immune to meltdown. </p>
<p>The problem was, the molten salt reactor was too efficient... The government didn't want to burn up the waste for fuel, they wanted to extract the Plutonium and enriched Uranium from the waste to build nukes instead. So they canned the molten salt reactor projects and built fast breeder reactors instead. </p>
<p>In recent decades the focus on nuclear technologies for many countries has shifted from bomb development and production to safe and efficient energy. Currently China leads the world in molten salt reactor design, but the United States is not far behind. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thorium based reactors actually make a lot of sense. I hope we rediscover them for power generation. The problem with wind and solar is they don't generate when the wind isn't blowing or the sun  isn't shining. </p>
<p>We've been sitting on zero emission power for so long, it would be nice to use it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem still is that molten salt fuel is corrosive as hell. So you need a whole new plant every few years instead of 40 like the current ones.</p>
<p>Its a problem of material. To boost up the molten thorium reactors we need a new cheap alloy that doesn't corrode with that solution. Stainless steel still does.</p>
<p>Edit: Not to mention that whatever it corrodes stays on the mixture, reducing the overall purity of the fuel.</p></div>		</li>
