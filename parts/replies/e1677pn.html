<p>What is the memory that causes relapse or repeated use?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's the million dollar question - people can stop using drugs for months or even years, and then suddenly fall off the wagon and go back to using. This is a really big area of interest in drug addiction research circles. </p>
<p>(To give a very simplified answer though, in rodent models, drug addiction can be modeled by a couple different ways. The gold standard, in my opinion, is self-administration, where an animal performs a response, like a lever press, to get an i.v. infusion of a drug. The animal learns that pushing the lever leads to a &quot;good feeling&quot;, but, importantly, this can be broken if you &quot;extinguish&quot; that behavior, essentially changing the paradigm so that a lever press <em>no longer</em> gives a drug infusion. Eventually the animal stops pressing the lever because there's no reason to do it anymore. Once the animal's extinguished, you can examine drug-seeking behavior by one of three methods - give a cue previously associated with the drug, stress the animal, or give the animal the drug itself (called cue-induced, stress-induced, and drug-induced reinstatement, respectively). The biological underpinnings of these relapse-like behaviors are a huge area of interest for a lot of addiction researchers out there. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The old addiction neural pathways are still there, simply misused and forgotten but as soon as you trigger the same neurons the whole circuit lights up releasing unexpected dopamine, all of a sudden your old addiction pathway is freshly exposed and your dopamine system reinforces it for more and you have to quit all over again, step by step. </p>
<p>Completely out of my ass but well thought out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an experiment done with a control group of rats in a bland environment with nothing to do and a set of rats in a stimulating environment. Both sets had access to a lever that would give them a small amount of a stimulating drug (meth or cocaine). </p>
<p>There is some research that shows rats will be less likely to self-administer the drug if they have a &quot;stimulating environment&quot; with things to do that make rats happy, like running wheels, a maze, some social interaction and so on. </p>
<p>So there is some evidence that a happy life makes rodents less likely to turn to drugs. Also, some recovering alcoholics will try to &quot;fill the void&quot; in their lives with pastries, painting, music or whatever can give them pleasure</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genetics plays a large role in sensitivity to most drugs. It may mean that you have fewer neurotransmitter receptors that are sensitive to caffeine, or that your individual receptors themselves don't respond as strongly to caffeine.</p>
<p>This has been proven, at least for nicotine attaching to acetylcholine receptors. Mice engineered to lack a certain gene, which made their receptors less sensitive, did not show an increase in dopamine when given nicotine, unlike most normal mice.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's me and I just drink a lot of it if I want caffeine. Usually, I also consume some powdered l-theanine (a subtle anxiolytic found in green teas) mixed in water. It's been shown to reduce the jitteriness in some people and I can attest to that, as I need to drink heart racing levels of caffeine to benefit from it mentally. </p></div>		</li>
