<p>Why would you want to go to hospital if you have no symptoms?  If you think ambulance charges are high, wait till you find out what emergency departments are capable of.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Way better than paying 1000s of $$, esp. if you are in a situation where you do not necessarily need to be stabilized or need medical attention on the way to the hospital</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s competent refusal, or “what would a reasonable person do?” If you’re obviously certain to die or be injured further by not going to the hospital, they can force you to go under law.</p>
<p>Edit: I’m catching some flak for this, so I want to assure all of you that I know what I’m talking about. You can be, under law, deemed incompetent to refuse care. For example, if you attempted suicide. In these circumstances, either an ambulance crew or the police will be taking you to the hospital, whether you want to or not. You could try to sue, but it will not hold up in court. Speaking from a lot of first-hand experience here.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Okay. Getting an ambulance is free or nearly free for everyone in all developed countries apart from <a href="http://health.costhelper.com/ambulance.html" target="_blank">most</a> of the US and maybe apart from 1% of Canadians.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't completely true. Atleast in Ontario, an ambulance ride is $450, but 90% is covered by OHIP (Ontario Health Insurance Plan) which is our universal health coverage provider. So it comes out to $45.00 for a resident of Ontario and I think that's very reasonable. Visitors and out of province patients will pay full rate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Australia is generally seen as having 'free' healthcare. For example a doctors visit or a trip to the emergency room at a hospital generally won't land you with a bill. However an ambulance ride will.This is generally covered by your private health insurance. If not you have to pay and it might be somewhere between $500-800.</p>
<p>However if you are out of your own state and an ambulance is required you don't get charged regardless. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the 17th and 18th centuries insurance companies set up their own &quot;fire brigades&quot; (after the Great Fire of London). Brigades would refuse to put out a fire if the building in question didn't bear the fire mark of the particular company that owned the brigade. It was a pretty lucrative business apparently. So in a way it actually has already happened.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are places in the US where you have to pay an annual fee for fire protection. These are usually rural areas where the fire protection district provides services to areas they can’t collect taxes from. If you don’t pay they will come out and watch your home burn while protecting your neighbors who did pay. </p></div>		</li>
