They fit <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/ce/Kkrieger_screenshot.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> into a smaller space than a single art asset from games like Candy Crush, but loading times can be absolutely horrendous if you have an older system.</p>
<p>EDIT: I should note that the <em>full game download</em> is a <em>smaller filesize</em> (96KB) than the above <em>screenshot</em> (172KB).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its really way of the past when bandwidth is small and precious. there are no reasons to take procedural generation to a higher degree now that processing power/bandwidth/memory is cheap, but time spent on making the file smaller is very expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I played Plants vs Zombies 2 on my phone, I noticed that it downloaded a lot of data from the server before I could play it, but only the first time. I assumed this was because it was downloading only the assets necessary for my specific phone. Does that sound accurate, or do you have a better guess?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that Devs do this to save on package file size. I forget the limits but games/apps over a certain file size will require connection to WiFi to download. Theoretically stopping people downloading your product while on the go. The alternative being allowing a bunch of assets to be downloaded when you fire up the app. Personally it drives me nuts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mobile dev here, and this is exactly right. The main reason for this is ads; if a player clicks an ad to download my game, and can't download it immediately, I've completely lost the download and wasted the ad money.</p>
<p>I also hate it when games give you that long wait though, which is why some games are smart enough to bundle all the assets needed for the unskippable tutorial, then download later assets either during the tutorial, or as necessary.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The problem is especially bad for mobile devices like Android phones or Apple products. For a given platform, they have one program release, and that single program has to support every device and their native resolution, so the vast majority of the content in that program will never be used, and the program doesn't have the ability to dump the graphics it will never use, nor is it desirable in case the hardware changes and the install doesn't. The iPhone version, for example, has graphics support for every iPhone, every tablet, and everything that runs iOS and OSX, since these apps also run native on your laptop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How have they not figured out a way to sync only the assets you need to your device?  Surely there has to be a way to have that main file live on your computer with all the different iPhone/iPad versions, and then sync only what you need to the device.</p>
<p>I will gladly give up the convenience of download the updated app on my phone, syncing to my computer, and then syncing the same app to my iPad.  That is the only benefit to the current system.  All they need is like... a fucking check box that says &quot;download the remaining iPhone or iPad artwork for this app automatically upon sync with iTunes&quot; or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that the technology doesn't exist or that someone hasn't figured it out, but the burden falls on the developer. King would have to maintain and have certified an app for every product, and if you were to sync assets with some server, it would be their server. It's so much more convenient to bundle everything in one. It also gives the developer the ability to (inevitably) abandon the product for greener pastures, so that the app still works but no one has to think about it.</p></div>		</li>
