			<div class="markdown"><p>That is what some studies suggest (the first 9-10 days is cited often).</p>
<p>However, to make it more complicated, I remember a paper showing that after the regulator's warnings that antidepressants (here: SSRI's) can lead to suicidal tendencies, prescriptions decreased. The decreased prescriptions were accompanied by a large spike in suicides. I don't remember whether this was because people on SSRI's were taken off / switched to other antidepressants, or because more people were refused SSRI treatment.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello, student nurse here! The reason SSRI's and other antidepressants may bring about suicidal ideations/behaviours is that when the depressed patient is in the depressive state, they have no motivation for anything. When started on antidepressant medication treatments they start to feel more &quot;energized&quot; and motivated to do things. Sometimes those things will be to commit suicide. This is why as nurses on a mental health floor it is important to assess mental state before and after giving medications. </p>
<p>Edit: just realized that there are many others here that said the same thing already. lol oops</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A large part of suicide is losing hope that it will ever get better.
The individual might feel worse in the initial days, yes, but they are told the anti-depressants will take some time (weeks) to work.
Therefore, I'd assume that more patients would tough out the mild symptoms hoping to feel better eventually than patients would kill themselves over relatively minor side effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not how it works. The antidepressants tend to relieve the &quot;I have no energy/will to do anything&quot; symptom of depression BEFORE the &quot;I want to die&quot; symptom. So that energy burst happens and they are still suicidal so they act on it. That's why they &quot;black label&quot; them and tell you to call if you feel suicidal the first month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I had this explained to me by my therapist is that the first thing a lot of people experience from starting anti-D medication is an increase in motivation. Somewhat counter-intuitively, they may be more likely to act on any suicidal ideations that they have before the ideations themselves start to taper off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's commonly stated, but it's not necessarily true.  Non-depressed people have also shown suicidal thoughts when taking SSRIs, suggesting that it may be the drugs themselves inciting them, not the underlying depression.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, the effects are quite temporary.</p>

<p>Not medical advice or anything.  Truth is, many drug users are just attempting to compensate for some broken chemistry.  </p>
<p>These are all uncertain, but seem to have at least some interesting results.  There's a large minority for which SSRIs don't work, and for them the best thing they could do is try something else.  This may or may not work, but I have a feeling that for them it's worth a shot.</p>
<p>That's why I'm willing to post about it.  </p>
<p>Disclaimer: I don't take drugs, and haven't tried any of those in over a decade, and then I just smoked weed.</p></div>		</li>
