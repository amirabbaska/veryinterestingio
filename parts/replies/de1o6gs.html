			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, but I think the biggest issue is that the RBCs die/decay making the blood toxic. I believe that's why they would sometimes extract the plasma and give us the dead cells. They probably don't recycle the plasma for similar reasons, but also because it's easier to get a totally new blood donation than to grow new cells in a lab for recycling. </p></div>		</li>
