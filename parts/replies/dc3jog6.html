<p>In addition to this, I should mention that the division sexagesimal (meaning 60) division of minutes and seconds isn't actually from the Babylonians. Before decimals were invented by John Napier in the late 1500's/early 1600's, people actually measured everything in fractions of 60.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But why were they measuring things in division sexegesimal in 1500 (i hope that a real word, got it from you)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoops, that was a typo!  I had the word &quot;division&quot; in there twice!</p>
<p>Europe certainly didn't have a continuous tradition of sexagesimal division from Babylonian times -- in fact, this division came from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal#Other_historical_usages" target="_blank">Ptolemy</a>, whose <em>Almagest</em> was the basis of astronomy until even after Copernicus realized that it was all bunk.  The Babylonians had been long dead by the time of Ptolemy (who was a Greco-Roman, born 100 CE, a thousand years after Homer).  Until clocks were commonplace (13th century or so), people had no need to measure fractions of hours, so it's simply implausible that somehow the sexagesimal division of hours carried forward from Babylonian times, which were a <em>really</em> long time ago.</p>
<p>Why was Ptolemy so influential?  Astronomers kept, you know, astronoming, and they made new discoveries that improved the numbers in the <em>Almagest</em>.  Therefore, the numbers were written in the same way that they were written there, and when it had finally come time for all that geocentric bullshit to be supplanted by real orbital mechanics, the observations were still valuable; only the theory was not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP meant it as a technicality. The sexigesimal system using fractional divisions of 60 had been used in mathematics and astronomy since antiquity, most notably in Ptolemy's <em>Almagest</em>, originating with the Babylonians (or perhaps even to the Sumerians). However, the Babylonians didn't use it to directly record minutes and seconds but they're the reason why it was sexigesimal.</p></div>		</li>
