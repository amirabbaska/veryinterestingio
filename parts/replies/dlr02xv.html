			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I'm definitely going to check it out. I just got myself into the idea of better understanding coding and programming, so anything related to fundamentals of that are fodder for me. Thanks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt many people will read your response since it is more than 3 sentences and is about numbers.  However, I have to agree with /r/Valsedesvieuxos.  Your ELI5 response was beautiful.  I feel like intro level (or maybe even above) college math classes should start with this explanation.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a school which says numbers underlie reality instead of just being an interpretation of it, too. It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics#Mathematical_realism" target="_blank">mathematical realism</a>. I don't like how absolute the tone of this answer is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually a proponent of mathematical realism. Pi as the ratio of a circle's circumference of its diameter was discovered not invented. However, numbers and abstraction and counting were invented. The logic that is math is a reality of the world. The language and application of it to simplifying the world so that a mind can comprehend it is not a requirement. You can actually have math(logic) without numbers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the latter half of your answer but disagree with the philosophical assumptions and implications of the first half.  </p>
<p>At one point you say &quot;there is no category of things to be repeated&quot;, and then later you say: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the extent that we are right that one thing is like another thing, abstraction and counting save us a lot of brainpower.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't believe numbers would be a useful tool <em>unless</em> we were right about that, and &quot;to the extent&quot; that we are right is all that matters.  It always comes back to the &quot;extent&quot; that there is an objective reality that we perceive.  Let's suppose the &quot;extent&quot; is very small indeed, limited within the boundaries of our subjective perceptions.  Would it change anything?  Would it matter?  The extent is all that matters.  There is number, because there are categories of things to be repeated.</p></div>		</li>
