			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, type 1 diabetics can be in the normal to thin body type range and still suffer from poor circulation in legs and feet. It is not exclusive to obese people. I have a huge scar on my leg that started as a shaving knick, but became infected and killed off the surrounding skin tissue. I'm always having my feet tested when I go to the doctor as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it has to do with blood clots in the legs. Reduced sensation means you may not feel it if you get one, and if you have a clot it needs to be treated before it starts flowing in the blood as a mass and could obstruct smaller veins and cause serious damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad and I are T1D and he's had multiple amputations from small nicks or cuts because he doesn't get the circulation he needs. I have a fairly rare skin condition called NLD (necrobiosis lepoidica diabeticorum or some crap like that) that causes me to have these reddish spots on my legs and feet. if they get cut or scraped at all they don't usually heal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pardon my hairy legs, but <a href="https://imgur.com/WwmArZY" target="_blank">does it look like this?</a> The color used to be a lot worse, but when I changed insulin and my A1C dropped, it started to fade. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they can, but only slightly. And only if the basement membrane is in tact. Im no expert but that article is looking at repair and regeneration after an injury and when looking at PNS repair and regeneration time frame it's measured in mm per month, so very slow process</p></div>		</li>
