<p>That certainly doesn't sound feasible to me.  Most of the big experiments on entanglement come from groups like Anton Zeilinger's which did the first experiments across the Danube and now between two Canary islands, and Alain Aspect.  However, crucially, those experiments were done with photons, so there is no time dilation regardless.  Doing it with an electron is something I don't think has ever been done since they decohere (lose entanglement by entangling with the environment) incredibly easily.  They interact with anything and they're done.  Doing it with massive particles (i.e. particles with mass) like electrons and specifically taking the time to make sure one electron undergoes some acceleration that is orders of magnitude upon orders of magnitude greater than man has every achieved, is pragmatically a no-go.   I'm not even sure if it's theoretical a go, since how do you &quot;move&quot; an electron anywhere without breaking the entanglement.</p>
<p>Even in experiments like this one, which entangles electrons over 13.6 kms:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7575/full/nature15759.html" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7575/full/nature15759.html</a></p>
<p>it seems like the electrons themselves are stationary within a diamond nanovoid.  And there is not motion, much less relativistic ones.</p>
<p>If you google &quot;measurement in quantum mechanics&quot; you will find many, many, many hits (90,000 for me).  If you google &quot;measurement in quantum field theory&quot;, you find.... 8.  One of which is a crackpot website. Quantum information is hard enough to understand without worrying about effects that pragmatically will never play a role in any realistic set-up anyone's come up with.</p>
<p>My gut says you probably just end up with a phase shift between the two that is not detectable even in principle.  But like I said, it may actually be &quot;known&quot; as it's not at all my field</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're right that it's very hard to measure the tiny effect of time dilation at slower speeds, but it's not impossible. <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2010/09/nist-pair-aluminum-atomic-clocks-reveal-einsteins-relativity-personal-scale" target="_blank">These folks</a> at NIST have observed the effects of time dilation on their atomic clocks due to both a change in gravitational potential (they can see a difference when they move their experiment up by a foot - a <em>foot</em>! and they're hoping to get that down to a centimeter!) and due to relative motion (on the order of a few meters per second! I am sorry for all the exclamation marks, but it's such a beautiful experiment). So you don't even have to reach anything like what we'd normally call relativistic speeds to see the effect of time dilation on a quantum system.</p>
<p>As far as applying that to the sort of entanglement experiment being discussed here...hmm. I'd have to think about it more and look through the literature. It does look like this paper, <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/18/9/093050/meta#njpaa3e89s8" target="_blank">Single electron relativistic clock interferometer</a>, is proposing an experiment along those lines?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I wouldn't say it will never play a role in a realistic set-up, not at all! For example, China has already launched a <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/chinese-satellite-is-one-giant-step-for-the-quantum-internet-1.20329" target="_blank">satellite</a> designed for quantum experiments, and other countries are working on similar projects. They're trying to do things like transmit entangled photon pairs to the ground. And if you can set up a working quantum channel between the ground and the satellite (or between two satellites, for that matter), it's not too hard to imagine an experiment where you use it to entangle some (massive) system on the ground with one on the satellite.</p>
<p>I mean, it's still going to be difficult, but the problems are ones you have to deal with in the pursuit of quantum computing and communication anyways.</p>
<p>So this <em>is</em> something that some people have been thinking about, see for example <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/16/5/053041" target="_blank">Testing the effects of gravity and motion on quantum entanglement in space-based experiments</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0280" target="_blank">Relativistic Quantum Information: developments in Quantum Information in general relativistic scenarios</a>. Unfortunately, it's not a sub-topic I'm familiar with, though one of these days I should really fix that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>QFT fits within the QM framework just fine. There is a wavefunction, it just has amplitudes for field configurations rather than particle positions. Entanglement has the same definition and the same properties, and you can ask exactly the same questions about when the state supposedly collapses. </p>
<p>The short answer is, it appears to be collapsed whenever someone measures it, but it does so without regard to the time of measurement. This is because there isn't even a global clock time in QFT (since it is based on special relativity), or you could say there are many equally valid global clocks that each disagree about whether events even happen at the same time. In other words, in some cases there isn't even an answer to the question of which measurement was done first, so the results cannot depend on it. </p>
<p>TL;DR entanglement doesn't care about time, it looks collapsed when you measure and that's all you can say</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The states almost never get written down in QFT since scattering amplitudes are more useful. But I believe you can get a two particle state by using two electron creation operators on the vacuum state, each with its own momentum and spin direction (one up and one down). Once you have that state you can just write the out-of-phase superposition with the opposite spin version of the same state as usual. </p></div>		</li>
