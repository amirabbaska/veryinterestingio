<p>The ability to do so is in no way unique. The degree to which we do so may be, but there's plenty of examples of non-human animals conceiving and planning for long-term convenience.</p>
<p>As an example, a few years back there were a lot of talking about a certain chimpanze at a zoo that saved up rocks to conveniently have them at arms-reach to throw at visitors.</p>
<p>Essentially, any animal that hides things in ways that require anything more than pure instinct shows evidence of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But many animals aren't lazy though. Some are held up as paragons of industry. This is particularly true of animals that have to store food for winter or build nests or other long term commitments. We are, as far as we know, unique in our ability to understand why, but we're not unique in our ability to long term plan.</p></div>		</li>
