			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a shame your answer has so few points, because the top answer with over 1400 points is just absolutely wrong.  As you say nerve fibers are inhibited with the cold but touch nerves are inhibited much more than pain nerves so you loose the pain inhibition by touch nerves (just giving my own TLDR).  I'm guessing the top post just made up his answer, and has no idea about A-alpha, A-beta, A-delta, and C fibers, how they relate to each other, and the results of nerve conduction tests under conditions like cold temperatures.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I just realized I sort of glossed over part of your comment...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nerve fibres that transmit touch stimuli are less active as they have less insulation (myelination)... pain transmitting neurons are better electrically insulated...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You do have this backwords - touch is transmitted by A-beta fibers, pain is transmitted by A-delta and C fibers.  A-beta fibers are the bigger thicker myelinated ones.  A-delta are the smallest myelinated fibers and C fibers are the smallest fibers and actually have no myelination.  However your conclusion is still correct that cold inhibits touch fibers more than pain fibers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're saying seems to be in slight contradiction with the above comment:</p>
<p>Joepium:
&quot;on the flip side, pain transmitting neurons are better electrically insulated and so are <strong>more capable</strong> of transmitting the painful stimuli.&quot;</p>
<p>dog_armor:
&quot;nerve fibers are inhibited with the cold but touch nerves are inhibited much more than pain nerves&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>how is that in contradiction?</p>
<p>1st: pain neurons are more capable</p>
<p>2nd: touch are inhibited more than pain</p>
<p>there is no contradiction here at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are inhibiting pain, but you are inhibiting another inhibitor of pain even more.</p>
<p>Let's put it in skillpoint style numbers:</p>
<p>Normally, pain fibers transmit at a 5, but touch fibers also transmit at a 5 which puts a -5 on pain, giving pain a net result of 0.</p>
<p>Now in cold weather... pain fibers get a slight reduction to 4, but touch fibers get a big reduction to 2.  So now touch can only put a -2 on pain, giving pain a net of 2 - both are being reduced but the result for pain is actually higher.</p>
<p>Intuitively, I'm sure you've noticed this - when your fingers get really cold, they feel numb to touch and stiff to move due to the inhibition of sensory and motor neurons but sensitive to pain due to this reduced inhibition from those neurons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, the concept would be the same when warming, however I can't say I'm readily familiar the results of nerve conduction studies on nerves warmed above body temperature.  I seem to remember that the effect of warming is negligible, like body temp really is the sweet-spot for maximal speed of nerve conduction but I just want to be clear that I'm not certain on that.</p></div>		</li>
