			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. Not sure how this got to the top but you're mixing concepts from different time periods and throwing misinformation around net neutrality. Let me try to correct some of this.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T was sued under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act because of its market behavior, not because of the tax dollars involved. AT&amp;T had a true monopoly; they were the only company in the country doing what they did after acquiring every regional provider. MCI made their own phone company and provided a service where you could dial a code and then an AT&amp;T number and you could reach an AT&amp;T customer. However, due to the network effect they could not compete with AT&amp;T unless AT&amp;T allowed AT&amp;T customers a way to call MCI customers. AT&amp;T denied MCI's request to create this interoperability, which triggered the Sherman Anti-Trust Act because AT&amp;T was using its market position to obstruct the entrance of new competition into the market place. The Sherman Anti-Trust Act has nothing to say about tax dollars nor eminent domain. It's purely an anti-monopoly rule.</p>
<p>The result of the anti-trust suit was that AT&amp;T was broken up into regional monopolies. A stupid and counterproductive result as we found, because regional monopolies are nearly as bad but not considered monopolies by the Sherman Act. One of the terms of break up, based on the tax dollars premise, was that these new companies needed to provide a service called line sharing whereby any service provider could rent a line from the regional monopoly. This was supposed to create competition at the service layer without incentivizing &quot;redundant&quot; infrastructure build out. When Internet became a big deal lots of small ISPs started paying for line sharing and lots of customers left the main infrastructure providers to get better customer service. The infrastructure never improved, but at least customer service was nicer. Eventually the infrastructure providers convinced the FCC to allow line sharing rate increases and every single ISP that was on a line sharing agreement went out of business in a couple of years.</p>
<p>None of this has anything to do with net neutrality. Net neutrality does not require line sharing cost agreements. Net neutrality has not and will not bring back the line sharing consumers to start their own companies. Net neutrality has no interaction with incentives to apply capital expenditures to infrastructure.</p>
<p>The big infrastructure providers do not hold back on expansion due to net neutrality. Net neutrality does not limit their control vis-a-vis competition from other ISPs. If that were true, small upstart infrastructure providers wouldn't exist. But they do and have been forming and growing for 20 years. The reason you don't see them grow into your hometown is because the regional monopoly is still enforced by law and is not impact by net neutrality.</p>
<p>The fact that you think the FCC broke up Ma Bell even though you work for MCI is baffling. The FCC doesn't enforce anti-trust, the FTC and the justice department do. MCI filed the anti-trust suit that broke up AT&amp;T so they existed before it happened and were doing business.</p>
<p>Your whole explanation about net neutrality is either equally misinformed or deliberate astroturfing. Given how much astroturfing happens in telecom, I'm leaning towards the latter.</p>
<p>Net neutrality is about content. ISPs charge me to access the Internet. Then, they charge Google to access the Internet. Then in the early aughts, they decided they wanted to charge Google for me going to Google. So I paid, Google paid, then they wanted Google to pay again. They couldn't actually do this, so they decided they would BLOCK me from accessing Google unless Google paid them the second time. Net neutrality attempts to prevent this predatory behavior. Infrastructure doesn't even factor into it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Really great post. This part always gets me--in short they want the internet to work like Cable TV does right now. With them owning the bridge, and both sides paying so people can interact. </p>
<p>It's funny because Stark Trek, well before the Internet was fully realized, predicted this was how the internet would turn out. With websites being like channels. Disconcerting thought give how amazing it is right now. </p></div>		</li>

<p>They is no bridge and they already charge both sides.  Google pays someone to connect to the network, you pay someone to connect to the network.  ISPs want to charge us and or Google a second fee depending on the content served.  This is the only part the above poster got wrong.  They are not going to limit the second charge to google, they will eventually charge us as well.  There is no 'bridge' because there is never the same direct route over the internet to the content (i.e. the ISP never &quot;owns&quot; the whole route.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What you're saying is a bit convoluted.  I believe you're referencing this:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCI_Communications#Anti-trust_suits" target="_blank">MCI Antitrust lawsuit v AT&amp;T, 1974</a></p>
<p>MCI was trying to sell long distance service over AT&amp;T lines, and AT&amp;T &quot;cut the cord&quot; because MCI was selling a competing service.  This is exactly what Net Neutrality laws are all about.  I keep seeing people mentioning that &quot;content =/= ISP&quot; but it does.  Warner, Cox, Comcast, Charter...  these are all companies that offer content as well as service.  </p>
<p>They wish to remove Net Neutrality because they don't want people to buy Internet Service without buying their cable TV content, for example viewing Netflix instead of viewing cable TV.  </p>
<p>When I had Xfinity (Comcast) at my last place the agent on the phone outright refused to sell me a package with just internet.  He stated I was required to buy Cable TV as well in a package, or get nothing at all.  Due to zero competition for the speeds I wanted, I was forced to buy Comcast Cable TV service packaged with my internet.</p>
<p>I don't own a TV.</p>
<p>As for the &quot;dial a code&quot; you mentioned, you're referencing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interexchange_carrier" target="_blank">interexchange carier</a> operator numbers.  These codes weren't introduced until 1983, during the final stages of AT&amp;T's monopoly breakup which ended in 1984.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-10-321#History" target="_blank">These 10-10 numbers weren't mass marketed until the mid 1990s,</a> well after the suit was over.</p>

<p>Ok, you've completely lost me here.</p>
<p>Net Neutrality works like this:</p>
<p>• Comcast, a cable TV AND Internet Service Provider, sells Shows (Content) and Service (Internet).</p>
<p>• The end user, (You), wants Netflix, a business that provides Shows (Content) via Comcast's Service (Internet).  Netflix's Content is in direct competition with Comcast's Content.</p>
<p>• Netflix does not have Internet Service.  If Comcast stopped traffic to Netflix, there would be no way to view Netflix.</p>
<p>• The analogy we've been discussing is MCI sold Long Distance, on AT&amp;T's Service.  AT&amp;T tried to cut MCI off, which sparked the anti-trust suit.</p>
<p>• Comcast and all the other ISPs throttle traffic on the backbone all the time, it's just the majority of end users don't know how to tell when it's happening.  On their end they see sites like Netflix won't load, while other sites, like Xfinity On Demand load fine.  The issue here is it's difficult to prove when this is happening, but it does happen.</p>
<p>• Comcast (and other ISPs) will get in legal trouble if they are caught throttling traffic outright for no reason, so to circumvent this they use other means, such as doing &quot;maintenance&quot; on all the exchanges routing traffic from competitors on the backbone.  There will be days where, for some reason, any end user going across a section of Verizon's backbone trying to view a site on Comcast's section will load slow.  Using a VPN to circumvent the section of the backbone has the site loading just fine.  </p>
<p>• Comcast and other Content Providers want to regain control of their Services by forcing end users, (You), to pay more to see Competing Content, (Netflix).</p>
<p>• End users will eventually stop paying for Content from Competitors, and go back to solely watching Content provided by ISPs, effectively driving Content Providers out of business.</p>
<p>It's pretty easy.  Just follow the money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for giving the correction I was hoping for. Also, you actually got net neutrality correct.... Mostly. </p>
<p>The kicker for net neutrality was when Comcast strong-armed Netflix. Netflix was slow to Comcast customers until Netflix paid up. But that differs from your explanation for two main reasons. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Netflix was NOT already paying Comcast. Netflix got data from other Isp's, which they then delivered it to Comcast. What Comcast wanted was what is called a 'peering agreement' which is very standard and required for an effective Internet. That would mean data goes direct to Comcast, without traversing other Isp's first. Netflix already had plenty of these agreements with other Isp's, but they were no cost peering agreements, and Comcast wanted money for theirs. </p>
</li>
<li>Peering agreements are NOT addressed in net neutrality, and the moves comcast made against Netflix could be done to others even with net neutrality. The reason is Comcast didn't technically slow down traffic. They just refused to increase bandwidth on the entry points of their network where Netflix was coming, which jammed entry of Netflix data into Comcast network. Essentially, the data was more than  Comcast could handle and they refused to add capacity. They have no obligation to change that, and net neutrality wouldn't create that obligation.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>This is incorrect.</del> (See my reply below for my correction.) Netflix is NOT a network infrastructure provider, it is a network infrastructure consumer. Peering agreements are between providers, not between providers and consumers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Netflix was NOT already paying Comcast</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, they were. Netflix payed their ISP for internet access. Their ISP had a peering agreement with Comcast which allows those two ISPs to move traffic between their networks. The cost of that peering agreement between the two ISPs on the Comcast side is paid for from the revenues from Comcast customers. The cost of that peering agreement on the side of Netflix's ISP was paid for by that ISP's customers, of which Netflix is included. Netflix paid just like every other customer paid. The fact that Netflix didn't pay every single ISP directly doesn't factor into it explicitly because of peering agreements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Netflix got data from other Isp's, which they then delivered it to Comcast</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is loose language and will get you in trouble in this argument. Netflix did not &quot;get data&quot; from &quot;other ISPs&quot;. Netflix paid for the usage of facilities provided by various ISPs. Those ISPs paid for peering. Peering eventually reaches Comcast. Comcast is made whole by virtue of the peering structure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That would mean data goes direct to Comcast, without traversing other Isp's first. Netflix already had plenty of these agreements with other Isp's, but they were no cost peering agreements, and Comcast wanted money for theirs. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a peering agreement. Peering has the word &quot;peer&quot; in it because when two ISPs, who are peers, enter into one, they agree to allow each other to transit equal amounts of traffic for the other one. Otherwise, the Internet wouldn't work because it wouldn't be interconnected. What Comcast did was state that they would not accommodate the demand of their customers from traffic from other networks that transited Netflix traffic and that if Netflix wanted to give a good service to Comcast customers, they would have to pay Comcast for direct access to the Comcast infrastructure. So now, instead of the way Internet was intended to work, where I could set up a server in New York and you could use my service from Houston, Comcast has effectively said to Netflix that they have to come to Houston and setup shop there and use Comcast as their ISP for the Houston market. That's not a peering agreement. That's a hostage situation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peering agreements are NOT addressed in net neutrality</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Correct.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the moves comcast made against Netflix could be done to others even with net neutrality</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agreed in the short-term. Debatable in the mid-term and long-term. As more over-the-top media services launch, Comcast wouldn't be able to throttle every peer because eventually Comcast wouldn't uphold their end of the transit bargin and others wouldn't peer with them. While Netflix is an outlier, this is true. The more Netflix clones there are that refuse to pay for direct access, the harder this will be without running afoul of net neutrality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason is Comcast didn't technically slow down traffic. They just refused to increase bandwidth on the entry points of their network where Netflix was coming, which jammed entry of Netflix data into Comcast network.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, they selected specific peers to punish based on those peers deciding to transit for Netflix. An enhanced net neutrality might eventually make that obvious ploy illegal, too. After all, the only reason Comcast did it is because they were losing their cable TV customers to Netflix and needed a new source of revenue to cover that attrition. Now that they charge Netflix, Comcast gets to do nothing and still charge rent and harvest cash without adding value!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Essentially, the data was more than Comcast could handle and they refused to add capacity. They have no obligation to change that, and net neutrality wouldn't create that obligation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without talking about obligations, I've said my piece here. Comcast could handle the traffic if they actually invested in infrastructure and charged a fair rate for content-agnostic internet access. Instead, they spend their money on client acquisition, content distribution for the ad revenue, hardcore lobbying, and obstructionism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very few networks are large enough to get free peering with Comcast. Their peering policy is <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/peering/" target="_blank">public</a>. And why would comcast give netflix free peering, if 99% of the network that the traffic traverses is built by Comcast? Imagine a server i in SF, connecting locally to Comcast and sending traffic allover the US - how would that be fair? Why would anybody build networks, if peering would be free for all?</p>

<p>Actually unless the area you are living in is mandating that they can't provide you fiber the only reason they aren't is because it would cost them to much. I don't know about power companies, but the phone and cable companies that have poles up are required to give access to those poles to other companies. They can of course charge a fee, but it has to be a reasonable fee. And they can also be a complete PITA about it, but they do have to provide access.</p>
<p>It often is just to expensive to deal with it unless they have 30+ people wanting hooked up. A petition with the signatures of all your neighbors saying they will sign up for the service might actually convince them to look into it.</p></div>		</li>
