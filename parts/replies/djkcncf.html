			<div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies really are weird. One day (a few months ago) I wasn't feeling like eating anything, so I didn't. I just drank water when I felt thirsty, and I thought &quot;Wonder what would happen if I just don't eat anything&quot; - I went to sleep that day and I wasn't hungry. Woke up next morning - kinda hungry but nothing too much. Went running, biking, etc, came back home - still mildly hungry. Drank some water, went to sleep, and repeated everything for another day.<br />
I had to break the streak cause there was a huge party coming up and I knew I would drink (Never drink alcohol on an empty stomach) so I just started eating fruits and <del>shit</del> stuff until I went back to normal.<br />
At the end, I still wasn't too hungry and I couldn't believe I made it to 75 hours of literally eating nothing, drinking <em>only</em> water.<br />
I wonder in which ways do our bodies differ and what causes what.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most normal, healthy people should be able to fast for effectively up to a week without significant long-term harm. Humans are pretty resilient.</p>
<p>As long as you're staying hydrated and not pushing yourself very hard, it should be no problem.</p>
<p>Where you get into trouble is that you might be sick, or have some underlying medical problem that isn't really triggered by day to day life until you decide to fast like the grandparent comment, things get out of whack, and now you're not thinking straight due to low blood sugar, which means you can't even solve your own problem any more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies are actually pretty good at going for long lengths of time without food. After a while the body shuts down the digestive system and you don't even feel hungry anymore. </p>
<p>Google &quot;Intermittent Fasting&quot; if you want to learn more about it. Lots of people actually do this for detox or weight loss. People in /r/fitness also talk about it frequently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this has to do with how the liver functions in terms of converting energy (but I could be wrong). My husband can go long periods of time without eating and not feel bad. I get serious hypoglycemic reactions (dizziness, fatigue, nausea). I wish I didn't have those reactions, but each person is a little different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can attest to this. I've always kind of understood that you get sick because you're actually hungry and that eating will cure it, but it's surprising how quickly it can come on and take you by surprise. I once hadn't eaten all day because I had been ramping up to eat a huge meal with bread-sticks and wings and yadda yadda before a party that evening where I wanted to have something in my stomach to absorb all the alcohol.</p>
<p>By the time I left my house going to get food prior to the party I suddenly felt flushed, hot, but with cold sweats, it felt like I was about to release bowels from every opening in my body and I felt insanely nauseous. I pulled over and vomitted nothing but yellow grime in a very small amount and it tasted and smelled like nothing but bile and stomach acid. </p>
<p>Immediately afterwards I felt completely fine. Like the blood rushed back into my body and re-energized me and I felt like a million bucks right after. Got my food, and the night went on totally nausea  free.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor nitpick, but it's hypoglycemic. hyperglycemic would be HIGH blood sugar (which is also very bad/possibly fatal and often associated with diabetes)</p>
<p>Basically, blood sugar is scary important to proper human functioning. When it gets out of balance, whether it's hyper or hypo, either way you're going to have a real bad time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Welp, just keep in mind that hyper always means &quot;too much&quot; and hypo means &quot;too little&quot;. Like hyperactive means that someone is too active. </p></div>		</li>
