			<div class="markdown"><p>The mind = posterior pituitary gland.
The oxytocin release is decreased because of the lack of pressure and the reason why breastfeeding is important, the suckling on the nipple causes the post pituitary gland to continue to release oxytocin after birth and for days to come. Oxytocin causes the ejection of milk, the continuous contractions of the uterus to bring it back to what would be it's normal size (aprox 7 cm), and it reinforces the bond between the mother and the child.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh ok this explains why they told me in EMT class that we should try and get the mother to feed after delivery (when appropriate) to help with post-delivery.  Wasn't really sure why/how it helped. Besides not having a screaming newborn in the ambulance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In EMT the breastfeeding will help decrease the uterine bleeding by the contraction of the uterus due to the secretion of Oxytocin (OT). It buys you some time when in transit to a Hospital where they will 'probably' administer some more Pitosin (OT)  IV. </p></div>		</li>
