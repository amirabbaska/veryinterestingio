			<div class="markdown"><p>The guy is joking. OP used the rhyming slang cobblers, which is from &quot;cobblers awls,&quot; which is a shoemaker's tool and rhymes with balls which refers to lies or nonsense or some such. The latter commenter referred to shoes as a lame in-joke.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While the photosynthesizing parts of a plant (the leaves mostly) may accumulate more sugar during the day, I can’t imagine that would have a measurable effect on the fruit. </p>
<p>I could be wrong; I’m no botanist. But I do know that the wine industry is chock full of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodynamic_agriculture" target="_blank">pseudoscientific</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/23/wine-tasting-junk-science-analysis" target="_blank">bullshit</a>, and this nocturnal harvesting claim sounds like hooey to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's my bet too. Even if it has some effect, plenty of winemakers buy into this shit without proper research, so it may do the opposite but it sounds good...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a bunch of hokum. Grapes are berries, not tubers. The plant is incapable of taking things back out of the grape. Once a sugar molecule has been created in the grape, it's simply there. Freshly created sugars are not chemically different from older sugars, sugar doesn't age.</p>
<p>If you shaded the grapes in the day you'd change their flavor, but the idea that picking them at 3am vs 6am is going to make a difference is just nonsense.</p></div>		</li>
