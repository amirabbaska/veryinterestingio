			<div class="markdown"><p>Spiders and their butts are amazing!  It's incredible what a spider like an orb weaver can create.   How they get their struts is mind boggling.  I've seen a strut go from a gutter about 16 feet up, down to a sunflower in the garden.   Another strut from the sunflower way up into a couple places in a tree and then amazing web built over that.  It doesn't seem possible that they could plan and navigate all that out and not tangle their struts.   But I've also seen the different types of webbing that they pull out of their butts (like when wrapping a prey).   Sometimes may find silks all coming out at once and other times a thick single silk strand.   We should try to build a machine modeled after a spiders butt.   I think few truly appreciate the awesomeness of spiders!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_bark_spider" target="_blank">Darwin Spiders</a>, as far as I know, spin the largest known webs. These guys are crazy!</p>
<p>Watching spiders pull out wrapping silk is probably one of the most ridiculous things ever. They can literally pull out sheets of silk out from their spigots. The idea that the silk protein is stored as liquid, and instantly polymerizes into solid when they pull it out still amazes me.</p>
<p>There are so many biotech companies claiming to spin synthetic spider silk, but as far as I know, no one has been able to fully recapitulate the mechanical properties of natural spider silk yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My fav thing about Darwin spiders is the kleptoparasitic relationship they have with the carnivorous flies of Madagascar.  </p>
<p>These spiders are building such big webs over the rivers that they create micro-climates.  They're catching more mayflies per day than they can eat, so another animal has evolved to eat the leftovers straight off the web.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One company, <a href="http://www.kraiglabs.com/" target="_blank">Kraig Biocraft Laboratories</a>, has done well with their recombinant spider silk at about 2GPa strength. They are working with technical textile company <a href="http://www.textileworld.com/textile-world/textile-news/2013/10/kraig-biocraft-warwick-mills-to-codevelop-spider-silk-based-textiles/" target="_blank">Warwick Mills</a> (the same company that developed the <a href="http://www.warwickmills.com/Protective-Fabrics-Mars.aspx" target="_blank">Mars Probe airbags</a> and other protective clothing) to make <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2016/07/19/us-army-eyes-dragon-silk-for-bullet-proof-vests.html" target="_blank">bulletproof vests for the US Army</a>. They will likely be interweaving it with other fabrics like Kevlar to get both the comfortable stretchy toughness and the strong Kevlar to make a comfortable, but effective bulletproof vest.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, historically, they have had issues maintaining quality and consistency in their silks as have practically every other spider silk company. That is why other spider silk companies like <a href="https://www.spiber.jp/en" target="_blank">Spiber</a> and <a href="https://boltthreads.com/" target="_blank">Bolt Threads</a> are aiming for mundane clothing markets, targeting companies like <a href="http://www.spoon-tamago.com/2015/10/20/moon-parka-outerwear-made-from-synthetic-spider-silk/" target="_blank">The North Face</a> and <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/05/11/bolt-threads-patagonia/" target="_blank">Patagonia</a>. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An additional aspect that comes into play is the silk's approach of the <em>defect size limit</em>.  Basically, the thinner the strand, the less probability there is for errors (in crystallinity, vacancies, cross linking, etc.), and the material approaches it's theoretical strength which is usually orders of magnitude greater than observed experimentally in bulk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There actually is a common engineering material that gets its uncommonly high strength and ductility from a delicate mix of amorphous and crystalline phases, much as you described for spider silk. </p>
<p>It's Steel. Mixing ductile Iron with brittle iron Carbide in small grains allows a material that is better than either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good one! Steel is great!</p>
<p>However steel is heavy as heck due to it being a metal. Spider silk is often advertised as being comparable to steel in strength, but much tougher by mass.</p>
<p>Question: Do you know how does steel (or any other metallic material) compare when formed into very thin fibers, in the order of microns?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The term to google is metal whisker strength. The papers I found were paywalled, but I found this plot for iron: </p>

<p>As others have said, when the diameter gets into the micron range, the probability of there being dislocations (and other flaws) goes way down compared to bulk metal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Steel has no amorphous phase, both iron and it's carbide are crystalline. <del>If you could make steel with significant amorphous regions, you could publish that in any journal you wanted.</del> </p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_metal" target="_blank">Apparently someone did it in 2004, though the largest samples they could make were 4 mm in diameter</a></p></div>		</li>
