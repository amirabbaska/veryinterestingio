			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I seem to recall hearing that the mass of the asteroid belt was underwhelming small compared to what people always assume, but Jupiter and Saturn have tons of moons they don't need, perhaps we could borrow a few?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The masses of Venus, Mars, the moon, the asteroid belt, and Jupiter's moons combined would be <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28mass+of+venus+%2B+mass+of+mars+%2B+mass+of+moon+%2B+mass+of+asteroid+belt+%2B+mass+of+jupiter%27s+moons%29%2F%28mass+of+earth%29" target="_blank">1.001 times Earth's mass</a>, just about perfect.</p>
<p>I would hate to figure out the energy requirements to combine all those together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What other planet would we use anyway? Mercury has much less atmosphere and is constantly scoured by the sun. Venus has wayyyy to harsh of an atmosphere. From there, it's just moons (worse than Mars), gas giants (can't land on), and stuff outside the solar system, witch might as well not exist with our current (or near future) tech</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's extremely debatable. Some moons of Jupiter and Saturn may have some form of liquid water under the surface. Some also have a strong atmosphere (like Titan). </p></div>		</li>
