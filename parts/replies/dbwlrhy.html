			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer. I would also like to add that I think the majority of people prefer the taste of HFCS these days, which is why the throwback versions that Pepsi came out with a few years ago don't sell as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah Mountain Dew and Pepsi throwback versions used real cane sugar. I'll admit at first it was odd tasting, but after a bit I actually preferred them. But I feel like I was in the minority because the idea never really took off. You can still find it at most grocery stores.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like marketing is so diluted across all the various platforms, companies have to decide which will grab people's attention most. Seeing as nowadays most people are on some digital platform, companies choose to go the web route, however if you do that then your using targeted ads. As such someone who might be slightly interested in trying the new Pepsi or coke product but really interested in candy or (insert product X) will inevitably only see and remember the targeted ad. People used to watch much more TV and in tv you were much more likely to be persuaded to try something new. The internet (ad targeting) tries to reinforce your preferences, not expose you to new products as much.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know it's a huge market, but many places outside of the North America dont add it, and you couldn't pay me to drink a soda containing it, the food industry is a very disappointing part of visiting North America.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People can be unfairly manipulated.  It's why the term 'false advertising' exists.  And even something as simple as where and how sodas are displayed in grocery stores (and as almost a default option everywhere you can order a drink) can count as manipulating people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in FMCG/CPG and you'd be surprised how many people would notice. Consumers are very price sensitive, and thresholds are well established. </p>
<p>Also, Coke isn't selling to you... They sell to Walmart. There's huge pressure on CPGs to lower costs and increase retailer margins. If Coke added one cent to the cost, they'd have to make it up to Walmart in another way - trade rebates, promotions, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there's a coke for 1.89 and a Pepsi for 1.90, a surprising number of people will go for the coke. Therefore, retailers will eat that one cent loss to make them even, and they won't be happy about that. Remember, you are not a customer of Coca Cola or Pepsi! Their customers are retailers, not consumers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Will they? I've always felt like I'm practically the only person I know who likes both Coke and Pepsi, and even I have a pretty strong preference when buying it in the store (with fountain soda, or even bottled, they're almost equal, but I'm not a big fan of cans of Coke). Most people I know literally only drink one and look all heartbroken when told a restaurant has the wrong one. I can't imagine them buying the other just because it's a few cents cheaper.</p>
<p>(Talking only about Coke and Pepsi <em>specifically</em>, not all of the kinds of soda those brands make.)</p></div>		</li>
