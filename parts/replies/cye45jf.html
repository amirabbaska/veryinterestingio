<p>Osteoporosis is not an indication for a knee replacement. End stage Osteoarthritis is ;)...
The rest of your story checks out. Cartilage has many functions under different circumstances and is formed by a combination of cells, collagen, polysaccharides, water etc. In a joint it gets his nutrients from the synovial fluid. Normally there is a balance in degradetion and regeneration of it. A lot about it is still not known. All this makes it hard to replicate, although researchers are working on stem cell therapy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, an ear is a simple thing.   Not the ear drum of course, but the actual ear they replaced is (idk really) most likely a 3D printed shape-of-an-ear done in materials that bend slightly like it so it comes off in public.     It's not the complex mechanism that cartilage is.    Compare how much you use your knee, and in how many different ways, to how often your ear does anything but stick out your head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a difficult question to answer because it depends on the stage to which avn has progressed.  The Ficat classification scheme is most commonly used to quantify this stage, there's also a newer scheme which is basically a modification of Ficat.  Early stages may be reversible and this is a point of a lot of current research.  Osteoporosis drugs called bisphosphonates have shown some promise but with mixed results in the literature.  Stem cell treatments are also an active area of research.  As mentioned earlier in the thread though, it is extremely difficult (impossible?) to get articular cartilage to grow as it is basically an avascular structure.  Core decompression is a surgical option for earlier stage avn which is basically drilling holes in the bone with the hope of stirring up some vascularity and halting or reversing the necrosis process.  Another option for earlier stages may be vascularized bone grafting, however there's only like one guy in the country that has reported success with this and these results haven't really panned out as reproducible in the literature.  Later stage options are focused more on salvage and include osteotomies where the realign the mechanical structure of the joint in hopes of offloading the affected area and transferring the load to healthier, unaffected joint surface.  Otherwise you're looking at hip replacement which is a challenge in younger individuals as even the best prostheses have a finite life span, and revision (or replacement of replacement) joints are technically more demanding procedures and have higher complication rates.  Avn is a difficult problem to deal with in younger adults, treatment options, and thus &quot;how long will the joint last&quot; mainly hinges on how advanced the disease stage is.</p></div>		</li>
