			<div class="markdown"><p>Ex-RAF Tornado engineer. We had a couple of aircraft in our fleet fitted with SUMS (Structural Usage Monitoring System). Airframe has strain gauges fitted everywhere that recorded stress data to C90 cassettes that were then sent to boffins for analysis. </p>
<p>The rest of the aircraft in the fleet had a G-meter that then used the data from SUMS to calculate actual fatigue life used. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends, the pods are only linked by two relatively small bolts, but if high negative g maneuvers are performed to the point where the pods get ripped off, the wings will lose their structural integrity and become much easier to tear off in subsequent high g maneuvers.</p>
<p>That said, if true high g maneuvers (not negative g) are performed while fully loaded, yes, the wings can get ripped off, and in that event, successful ejection becomes significantly less possible, at least not without severe injury. </p>
<p>That said, there’s a big gap between “over g-ing” the bird and tearing the wings off. As soon as a bird is over g-ed, it gets grounded and must return from any operations if possible at that time, and the point of that is to prevent the possibility of total structural failure which puts the pilot’s (and weapons/EW warfare officer’s (back seat aviator)) life at risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excessive G force can rip control surfaces and structural members off any aircraft. China Airlines Flight 006 is an example of this. The plane ended up rolling over into a dive due to loss of engine power and asymmetric thrust. The plane was severely over stressed pulling out of the dive and ripped the horizontal stabilizer, and bent the wings. If you have time, you should browse the link. I know it’s wikipedia, but it gives a fairly good overview of this incident. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was a cool read indeed.<br />
What decision process happens for a pilot with 15500 hours of flight time to decide to ignore the instrument readouts like that....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We call that operator error. Had the pilot not continued applying inputs that compounded the initial problem, the plane would have stabilized and been fine. That also falls under the idea of “unnatural causes” because the initial issue was caused by the wake of another, much larger jet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly it was also due to the training program that particular pilot had gone through where they encouraged pilots to alternate left and right to deal with turbulence, and also the sensitivity of the controls was greatly increased causing the pilots actions to overstress the parts.</p></div>		</li>
