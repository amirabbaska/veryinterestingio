			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to thank you for posting that video. I saw it a while back and it presents the answers to this question in an easily understandable manner. Don't get me wrong, I love some hard science, but the majority of people don't understand the nuance of how the way sharks swim is directly correlated to their respiration. Vox does a damn fine job of relaying this information to the general populace without dumbing it down or being overly pedantic. Most all of their videos are great. </p>
<p>Sorry for the off-topic reply. Just got excited to see you post a link to that video because I really enjoy Vox's digital pieces as well as their standard reporting. </p></div>		</li>

<p>They got a lot of wounds and scars on their face from collisions.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So these collisions kill the sharks over a period of time? Does it take the one big collision to kill them? Do they sort of lose the will to live in contained areas? Is it because sharks need to move to use their gills and small areas make that difficult/impossible? </p>
<p>I watched the video too and I never got what <em>actually killed</em> the sharks. I've seen sharks crash pretty hard into shark proof cages and they just swim off. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of those things I'm sure. Ramming their head into stuff occasionally is fine but ramming their heads into a wall thousands of times must take its toll... eventually giving them brain damage to the point of them swimming wonky and drowning. Also I think you nailed it with the losing the will to live idea. An apex predator is going to be bored as shit in captivity and wish it was dead if it's locked up long enough. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What does an 8,000 lb shark with a brain the size of a flathead V8 think about?</p>

<p>If they put it inside the building people might rather face it than the window.  Working away, working away, working away...what's that vibratio....whoosh there goes the great white.  Might actually not be very good for productivity.</p></div>		</li>
