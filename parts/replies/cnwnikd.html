			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same concerns. As a computer engineer, I don't think it's a good idea for any government to limit one technology (mobile phones) to use a specific protocol (USB). Technology is advancing faster than anything else, and governments are known to be slow to adapt to change. This is a case where I actually side with the free market idea.</p>
<p>P.s. I think it should be &quot;uUSB&quot; since &quot;u&quot; or the Greek letter mu is used for micro, while &quot;m&quot; is used for mili.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except this doesn't technically limit anything really. Having a standard size doesn't limit a company from making another type of charger, it just says it must at LEAST use X type of charger.</p>
<p>If a company wants it can do what samsung does with phones like the Note 3, it takes microusb fine, but it's actual charger is wider with additional pins.</p>
<p>Company invents new fast charging technology/pins? As long as it can still be charged with a normal micro and has an additional fast charging port it's fine. Etc etc etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Note 3 actually has a micro USB 3 connector. It's one of these: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cable-Matters-SuperSpeed-Micro-B-Black/dp/B00C7SPM4M%3Fpsc%3D1%26SubscriptionId%3DAKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q%26tag%3Dduckduckgo-ffab-uk-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00C7SPM4M" target="_blank">amazon link</a></p>
<p>The connector on the phone side is designed to be compatible with normal micro USB plugs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My thoughts exactly.</p>
<p>As per the mUSB, I think you're right;  using u would make more sense, considering it could be mixed up with mini USB. I will change that right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The EU meant usb  to be the standard for charging, you can still have other ports on your device. Case in point the new galaxy devices have usb3 ports that can still receive power from usb2. It just happens the universal serial bus it great for utilizing almost all connections between your device and another that you could ever need. Probably why it was chosen. There's a new USB standard about the be introduced with nokias upcoming tablet. Incompatible with the old ones. I don't know what the law says about that. But the EU has been known to respond fast to change, sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How would such law address advances in USB technology? Are Europeans just going to be stuck with mUSB forever, or does the law say that when a better product is introduced as a standard companies will be obliged to implement that port into their devices?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two ways. </p>
<p>1.) Manufacturers will be forced to include a USB C to microUSB adapter initially. After all, the point is to reduce waste and make sure old chargers still work, especially during any transition periods.</p>
<p>2.) If USB C picks up momentum, the law can be updated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed to it in 2009, goes into effect 2017, so it will take 8 years to update the law. At which point the new technology is already obsolete.</p>

<p>By your logic, if it takes 10 years to develop the first iPhone, it'll take 10 years to update it as well.
The problem with laws like these is that writing them are complex - you need to take care of edge cases and loop holes. Further updates to use a new cable by the USB consortium will take only a year or two.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That's very short-sighted.
The EU taking action (setting guideline) is primarily why manufacturers switched and stuck to USB. It's self-regulation: these companies don't want some ultra-strict law compelling them to standardize.</p>
<p>Thank the EU for common charging standards; otherwise, companies are more than happy to rip your wallet apart for proprietary charger/cables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This law converted people visiting my house from</p>
<p>&quot;Your phone is dead? Sucks to be you - I only have chargers for <10 phone brands> but not yours.</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>&quot;Your phone's dead? Is it an iPhone5+? If so, you're boned. Otherwise, there's microUSB everywhere and my wife has an iPhone4 charger cable.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't even care what brand your phone or tablet is. It will charge. Heck, I have a Galaxy Tab2 and it's never being charged because I always need to find its stupid damn charger cable, because they didn't bother to make it standard micro-USB. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure that what will happen is that mobile device vendors will be forced to include an adapter that will allow the new standard to connect via micro USB, much as Apple will do with lightning, therefore adding at least a few dollars to the cost of every device sold.</p></div>		</li>
