			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent explanation.</p>
<p>I would also say in the UK we have alot more ISP's to choose from than you guys. I think I would have the choice around 15 in the area I live and where my cousins live in the states they had 1.</p>
<p>Also your guys internet is stupid expensive. They were paying around 60 bucks a month for 10mbs i think, currently i pay Â£25 for 100mbs.</p></div>		</li>

Talktalk, sky, ee etc are resellers of the Open Reach product.</p></div>		</li>
