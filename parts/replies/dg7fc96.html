			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically there's an asymptote at double speed because you only have one lap to make up the average speed. If you had two laps, though, it could <em>theoretically</em> be done?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely it can be done. If you run two additional laps, then you only need run them at 4x the speed of the first lap to double your average. For example, let's say the laps are 100m and you ran the first one in 4 seconds. (My you're fast!)
100m/4s = 25m/s</p>
<p>Now you run two additional laps at 4x that speed, which would be 100m/s. So each lap will take you 1 second to run. So the total time you spent running was 6 seconds.
300m/6s = 50m/s</p>
<p>So you've doubled your average speed.</p>
<p>You can work this out yourself with the v=d/t formula and some basic algebra.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean running one lap slowly and then running an other two after that?</p>
<p>No problem. If you ran the first lap with 6 km/h you could run the 2nd and 3rd with 24 km/h for an average of 12 km/h.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, as other have said.</p>
<p>What you've done by adding the extra lap is push that asymptote out to triple speed.  (Your asymptote will end up being at <all the distance target="_blank">/&lt;the time you've already spent&gt;, for whatever those values are -- which corresponds to instantaneously finishing all of the remaining distance)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the idea is that the speed of the second is determined only after the first lap is complete, not before?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not if the desired average is always going be &quot;double the speed of the first lap&quot; - in this case the required speed of the second lap will always be infinite.</p>
<p>If you've got a <em>fixed</em> average target to aim for, then you'll need to see how the first lap goes before working out what speed (if it's even possible) you need to achieve on the second lap to get that average.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What? The total time is always at least the amount of time you've already spent. If you've averaged ten min per lap on one lap you can't get that to five min per lap by doing a second lap because that would be doing two laps in ten minutes, and your ten minutes is already up and you only did a single lap.</p></div>		</li>
