<p>1 in 16384 sounds like a lot, but it really isn't that unlikely in the grand scheme of things  </p>

<p>True.  Unlikely, but not incredible.  Also note that if it had been 14 girls instead of boys, he would be making the exact same argument, so it's really more like 1 in 8192.</p></div>		</li>

<p>how many families are there on the planet?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without looking up average family size, if every family had 7 members, there'd be 1 billion families. Even if we go with a much larger family size, there are still a lot more than 16,348.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meiotic drive is the general term for the biased allelic transmission. It's certainly possible in humans, the wiki link even has a citation to some tentative evidence for it (Though those loci were not on a sex chromosome). </p>
<p>Not sure where you got the idea that some mice went extinct due to it. We would need to sequence extinct mice genomes to figure that out, and even then it'd be a pretty tenuous conclusion that segregation distorters were the cause.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/l5/evolving_to_extinction/" target="_blank">blog post</a> I got this from and it seems the author was talking about individual breeding populations, rather than entire species. </p>
<p>He also doesn't mention any sources, so I can't vouch for the accuracy of the claim. My apologies if I have been spreading misinformation. </p></div>		</li>
