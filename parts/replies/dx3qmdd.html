<p>Games are engaging by design. All of them. </p>
<p>We are talking about studios of thousands people all over the world investing hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a singular game. A massive entertainment industry, driven by cutting edge technologies, all focused on getting the audience (you, the player) entertained, engaged for as long as possible. Computer games isn't some joke like a mom somewhere thinks. </p>
