			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to all this, the examples OP listed are very slow.   The audience has time to see every moment and nuance of what's occurring.   </p>
<p>Doing a sword slash at a dragon happens in the blink of an eye from antic to slash to recovery.   But having a character slowly look up at someone, in a way that's dangerous, coquettish, bored, fearful, etc. takes many very small individual moments that all need to read and transition clearly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And maybe the engine change. I don't know much about videogame design, but I suspect an engine change can change animation difficulty (especially for soft bodies) quite a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That being said, is there an ideal number out there for creating a super realistic human model for animation? For example &quot; '#' is the minimum number of polygons our models need to look and move like actual humans.&quot; Or is the hope that one day processing power will catch up and everything sculpted will just be ported into environments 1:1?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how closely you need to look at the models in game. However many triangles you use you will always be able to see the straight edges if you zoom in closely enough. So if you were to come up with some theoretical number you'd probably have to make some assumptions about how close the player will look.</p>
<p>Either that or we move away from using triangles and use curves instead. 3D graphics for films uses a lot of curves, but for the foreseeable future games are stuck mostly using polygons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not so sure about that modelling with curves comment. 3D modelling and animation of every kind uses a finite amount of polygons, there's no possible way to create a true curve digitally however some 3d software, particularly in architecture &amp; engineering, doesn't let you model at the polygon level and instead just the overall shape, i.e. i could draw a circle and the software itself would distinguish that it has 3000 edges for example creating that illusion of a true curve </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really about triangle count necessarily, the animation is largely controlled by bones and you don't necessarily have a bone capable of animating in the way you need.  Blend shapes solve this sometimes, but again you'd need specific ones for some of the grandparent's examples.</p>
<p>You don't want to just throw in dozens or hundreds of bones just in case either, since it will become very difficult to work with eventually. </p></div>		</li>
