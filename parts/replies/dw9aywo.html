			<div class="markdown"><p>Its a back of the napkin calculation just to get a feel for the scale. While others say there is no limit to molecular size I disagree. There must be a limit as at a certain point the interconnected mass will be effected by its own gravitational field and collapse into a single lump. At which point we have to consider how a singular mass of that size would behave and if its singular structure could survive under the immense pressures and temperatures it would generate in its centre. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that there's some sort of limit, if it gets too big gravity is going to cause problems, but that's a completely ridiculous upper bound to choose. Have we found any appreciably big interstellar object that is fully cross linked/a single molecule?</p>
<p>Also crystals in the layman sense don't count as molecules. In the non layman sense, they only count as molecules if they're actually molecules, and even then it only counts as a single molecule if it's a single molecule.</p>
<p>I also hate characterizing polymers as single molecules. I know that's common, but it naturally leads to incorrect assumptions. Chain-chain interactions are very, very important important in polymers, and if you consider polymers to be single molecules, there won't be chain-chain interactions at all.</p></div>		</li>
