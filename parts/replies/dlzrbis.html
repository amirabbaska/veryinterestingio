			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation is good, but not really the complete way to look at it.  With the amount of turbulence in the air, you will always get some mixing.  Its not just that the condensation STOPS at that flat level, but also that any part of a cloud that dips below that altitude gets warmed up enough that it gets redissolved back into the air.  Thats why it looks like such a clean break.  </p>
<p>As for billowing up, its simply that youve pushed through the boundary at different rates... The cooling of the mass is slower than the turbulence caused by the updraft  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair enough. It's because warm air rising through a cool layer &quot;billows&quot; rather than just uniformly expands. Warm air is a fluid and so is the cool air that it enters, and so you get turbulence instead of a perfect sphere or expanding cone.</p>
<p>An analogy I used elsewhere in here is when you pour milk into coffee or tea - it billows out in a poofy shape when one fluid penetrates the other. </p>
<p>Clouds work the same, only slower. <a href="http://romps.berkeley.edu/2013/stereo/thermals_small_128.gif" target="_blank">But a good timelapse gif really shows this billowing effect.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Gases and liquids are fluids, but solids CAN also be fluids.</p>
<p>Simplest definition of a fluid I can thinkk of is &quot;A system whose components are capable of being displaced in relation to one another&quot;.</p>
<p>This system/component relation can be at any scale. A massive tub full of ball bearings has the ball bearings exhibit fluid dynamics, same for desert/sand. Liquids/gases are defined at the particle level and are ruled by secondary bonding forces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the condensed vapour has to go somewhere, which is up in a fairly random way, because it's being pushed up by all the stuff condensing below it. Like when you make bubbles with running water for a bubble bath, they're flat below (on the water surface) but the bubbles on top keep getting pushed aside by more bubbles being formed undernearth, so it forms a big poofy pile until you mix them up sideways by stirring the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I explained in my previous comment about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6vel3o/why_are_clouds_all_fluffy_on_top_but_flat_on_the/dm0h3mc/" target="_blank">Cloud Condensation Level (CCL) causing the flat base of the cloud</a>. The reason the cloud has a fluffy top is because the cloud is in a constant state of growing and collapsing while being sustained in a vertical cylinder of air referred to as an air parcel. This air parcel had warm moist air heated to the point that it rose and reached the CCL and a cloud formed. That cloud has a certain height that the current temperature will allow it to climb to (assuming it is not being mechanically or orographically lifted by a surface front or terrain) called the equilibrium level. The equilibrium level (EL), or level of neutral buoyancy (LNB), or limit of convection (LOC), is the height at which a rising parcel of air is at the same temperature as its environment. So as long as that parcel of air is warmer than it's environment and doesn't encounter any caps previously discussed, it will continue to rise. As the air parcel reaches it's zenith and begins to cool it begins to fall. The air parcel will gradually warm up as it falls and will eventually reach the same or similar temperature that caused it to begin to rise in the first place and will start the process over again. As long as the air parcel reaches it's equilibrium level before it reaches a physical &quot;cap&quot; it will generally remain as that &quot;puffy&quot; top because of the uneven and &quot;billowing&quot; nature of this process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I'm a meteorologist and you did a pretty good job of capturing the basic concepts of the answer but are off on some of the minor details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A very cool way of looking at clouds is picturing them as the effect when warm moist air and cold air mix. Add in the fact that warm air rises because it's less dense, and warm sea-level-pressure air can hold more dissolved invisible moisture than cold lower-pressure air, and you have your ingredients to a flat-bottomed cloud.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clouds require two basic ingredients to form: moisture and cloud condensation nuclei (i.e., sand, dust, pollution, and other particulates). The temperature/moisture combination don't actually matter too much as long as there is moisture and the CCN. Secondly, the density of an air parcel comes down partly to it's temperature, as you mentioned, and also it's chemical composition. Dry air is O2 and has an atomic mass of 16 and is heavier than moist air which is H2O with an atomic mass of 10. Warm dry air will still rise vertically in the atmosphere (along the dry adiabatic line) whereas it's moist counterpart, regardless of temperature, will rise along the moist adiabatic line. Air pressure does very little, if anything to control the amount of moisture able to be held in an air parcel. You can have fog at both above and below freezing temperatures. Think of air pressure as having a cotton ball and squeezing it. The overall mass of the cotton ball does not change, but the density does.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What happened there is &quot;fog&quot;, and its cause was warm moist air in the animal's breath holds more water than cold air, and when it cools down it has to surrender that moisture. So a region of warm moist air entered a cold zone and fell below the &quot;dew point&quot;, the point when the moistness it was holding condensed out and formed tiny visible droplets. Lowered air pressure can also helps this condensation effect, which is why you'll see a little tiny cloud form on its wingtips when a jet fighter go fast enough because the air pressure there is really low.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That process looks like fog, but is actually called condensation, because the heated gasses you are breathing out are condensed as they rapidly cool in the cold air and temporarily become a small cloud. I don't fully know what you are referencing as &quot;falling below the dew point&quot;, but that's not possible. The &quot;Dew Point&quot; references the coldest temperature possible to be achieved in an air parcel by evaporating water into it, as well as the temperature an air parcel must be cooled down to in order to become saturated. If the temperature of an air parcel is 10C and the dew point is 10C, then the air parcel is fully saturated at 100% humidity and can not get any cooler. The temperature of an air parcel will never fall below it's dew point (we are not talking about wind chill). The small clouds on the wingtips of fighter jets are sometimes referenced to as wingtip vortices and are formed by the wingtips creating something similar to a small vacuum that rapidly drops the air pressure and causes the temperature of the air parcels rushing to fill that space to rapidly cool. During the rapid cooling process the air particles will reach their dew point and condense into the wingtip vortices, or condense to their dew point below freezing and form ice particles that act as CCN for the wingtip vortices to then form around.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So now let's look at clouds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll just tackle this as a broad subject, because again, you have the basics right but are missing some of the finer details. While the whole atmosphere of planet Earth does generally get cooler the farther from the surface you get, each distinct layer actually varies. Since we are talking about clouds that mostly form near the surface we can look at the Troposphere (atmospheric layer from the surface to around 10,000m) and the Stratosphere (atmospheric layer immediately above the Troposphere from about 10,000m-50,000m). The Troposphere cools with height and the Stratosphere actually warms with height. Pressure is a bit trickier. As you get farther away from the surface of the planet, the effects of gravity will lessen and overall atmospheric pressure will decrease, however in the Troposphere and Stratosphere the rate that the pressure decreases is actually controlled by the sun. Surface pressure centers (high pressure annotated by a blue &quot;H&quot; and low pressure annotated by a red &quot;L&quot;) are actually created by the differential heating of the Earth's surface by incoming solar radiation(heating).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On certain summery days when conditions are right, the level of the &quot;dew point&quot; is at a very flat, even height in the sky because the combination of temperature and reduced pressure is at a not-very-mixed-up consistent attitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you are referring to the Tropopause here, which is the boundary at the top of the Troposphere before you enter the Stratosphere. The height of the Tropopause is dependent on which cell you are in(Polar Cell is from the North Pole to 60N latitude, Ferrel Cell is from 60N latitude to 30N latitude, and the Hadley Cell is from 30N latitude to the Equator; reference this for the southern hemisphere) and whether you are under an area of high pressure or low pressure. If you are under an area of high pressure then the tropopause will be lower, and if you are under an area of low pressure then the tropopause will be higher. </p>
<p>If you weren't talking about that then you might be just talking about when you are under the effects of a stable air mass, which would be Warmer air Over Colder air (think of &quot;stable WOC, unstable COW&quot;). </p>
<p>If you weren't talking about <em>that</em> then you might be talking about inversions, which are defined as: a reversal of the normal decrease of air temperature with altitude, or of water temperature with depth. In layman's terms that means there is an abnormal change in temperature or moisture with height that is blocking the air parcels vertical path. There are three types of inversions: radiation, frontal, and subsidence. Radiation inversions are typically surface based, form at night, the most common type of inversion, and are what cause radiation fog to form. Radiation inversions are caused by the temperature warming with height in the lower few thousand feet of the Troposphere as the Earth's surface reradiates the solar radiation absorbed during the day time. This creates a small moist layer of air trapped underneath a drier and heavier layer of air, which allows fog to form (sometimes). The second inversion type is a frontal inversion, which is caused by a cold air mass undercutting a warmer air mass and lifting it aloft. A vertical drawing of this temperature line would look similar to a lightning bolt and would cool as it rises, warm rapidly, and then cool again. The third type of inversion is a subsidence inversion and develops when a widespread layer of air descends. The layer is compressed and heated by the resulting increase in atmospheric pressure, and as a result the lapse rate (how rapidly an air particle cools as it rises vertically in the atmosphere) of temperature is reduced (air particle will cool more gradually/ slowly as it ascends in the atmosphere). Subsidence inversions are also referred to as &quot;Caps&quot; by meteorologists because they can put a cap on any vertical development of clouds unless they are broken. This would have a similar visual effect of shaking a champagne bottle and popping off the cork.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the sun shines, and warms stuff on the surface. If it's humid, warm moist air starts rising and rising... and breaks THROUGH that consistent dew point layer. The result? It condenses to cloud just above that specific &quot;dew point&quot; layer. And you get a cloud with a flat bottom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, you pretty much nailed the concepts, but are lacking the minutiae of it. The first part of the above quote is pretty much explaining the adiabatic process and how clouds form. However it's not so much as there is a &quot;dew point layer&quot; so much that there is a specific height that the dew point, temperature, and air pressure of the air parcel comes into play. This height is called the Cloud Condensation Level (CCL) and is the exact height at which a critical combination of temperature and air pressure cause water vapor within the rising current to condense into a visible cloud. Since OP's question pertains specifically to Cumulus clouds(Cumulus, Towering Cumulus, and Cumulonimbus), the CCL is visually represented as the flat bottom of the cloud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To extend this, if the updraft is strong enough, moist air keeps shooting up and feeding the cloud's growth until you get highly energetic cloud systems with all sorts of cool stuff like rain, hail, lightning, thunder... and tornadoes (except they can sometimes be not so cool).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you mentioned, these Cumulus clouds can continue to develop into some clouds that cause the exciting stuff to happen. Cumulus clouds have three basic stages: Cumulus, Towering Cumulus, and Cumulonimbus (avoiding Super Cells in this explanation). Cumulus clouds can cause both rain and hail. Towering Cumulus can cause rain, hail and thunder&amp;lightning. Cumulonimbus are assumed to have rain, hail and thunder&amp;lightning and can also cause tornadoes to develop if certain weather criteria are met.</p>
<p>Like I said, you did a great job explaining the basic concepts and I thought I would just help you flush out some of the minutiae of those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, chemical engineer here. You are in turn off on some minor thermodynamic details ;) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dry air is O2 and has an atomic mass of 16 and is heavier than moist air which is H2O with an atomic mass of 10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dry air is only about 20% O2. Most of the rest is N2. </p>
<p><del>Second, the atomic mass does not influence the density of an (ideal) gas. That is, all gasses, (assuming they behave ideally, which obviously is not the case for H2O though) have the same density at a given temperature and pressure.</del></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That process looks like fog, but is actually called condensation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's (physically) the difference? It's a suspension of water droplets in air, doesn't really matter whether you call it fog or condensation. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't fully know what you are referencing as &quot;falling below the dew point&quot;, but that's not possible. The &quot;Dew Point&quot; references the coldest temperature possible to be achieved in an air parcel by evaporating water into it, as well as the temperature an air parcel must be cooled down to in order to become saturated.

<p>You are correct that the dew point is the saturation point, but it is not correct that the temperature cannot get any lower. Of course that's possible. </p>
<p>The dew point can be interpreted as the temperature below which water will condense (dew) from the air/water mixture. So, if an air parcel at dew point gets cooled any further, water will simply condense out. </p>
<p>The coldest temperature that can be achieved by evaporating water is the wet-bulb temperature, which is different from the dew point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. The density of an ideal gas is therefore d = Mn/V = MP/RT, where M is the molar mass, P is the pressure, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature, and is the amount of gas in moles V is the volume. The density of an ideal gas is proportional to the ratio of the pressure to the temperature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My understanding is that the dew point is not enough for water to condense. There also needs to be a nuclei for it to condense around. Basically an impurity of some sort.  </p>
<p>That's why jets leave con-trails sometimes - even though the air is cold enough to condensate, the lack of nuclei prevents condensation. The burnt fuel from the passing jet deposits impurities around which the water can condense. </p>
<p>Can you explain the &quot;wet-bulb&quot; temperature more?  What is this and why?</p></div>		</li>
