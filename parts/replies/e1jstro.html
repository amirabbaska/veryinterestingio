			<div class="markdown"><p>Please do not believe this. There is so much wrong with his explanation. It's not a different verb at all, and it can be disproven easily with negatives. After all, &quot;I'm not,&quot; is an acceptable sentence, right?</p>
<p>Correct:</p>
<ul>
<li>He is.</li>
<li>He is not.</li>
<li>He isn't.</li>
<li>He's not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Incorrect:</p>
<ul>
<li>He's.</li>
</ul>
<p>How can anyone possibly assert that the &quot;is&quot; in <em>He's not</em> is different from the one in <em>He is</em>? They're two sides of the same verb.</p>
<p>The real (and much simpler) answer is that in English, a noun-verb contraction can't exist as a full sentence on its own. As for why? I'm afraid the answer is &quot;just because.&quot; Languages develop arbitrary rules over time. In this case, the rule is more about sound than grammar.</p>

<p>Probably just because the way it sounds. It's very short and could be confused with other words. It is also not very nice to pronounce on it's own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Q:  &quot;Who is sad?&quot;</p>
<p>Acceptable answers: </p>
<p>&quot;I am sad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am.&quot;  (This is not &quot;I exist,&quot; nor an auxiliary verb.) </p>
<p>&quot;I'm sad.&quot;</p>
<p>But not, &quot;I'm.&quot; </p>
<p>Why? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! Linking verbs link to another object but still function as the action. Auxiliary verbs help another verb to function. </p>
<p>In the way i use &quot;I'm&quot; above, it is clearly an auxiliary verb. </p>
<p>However, it is possible for the am in &quot;I'm&quot; to function as a linking verb. Such as in the sentence: &quot;I'm well.&quot; Or &quot;I'm grateful.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
