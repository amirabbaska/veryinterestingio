<p>The 'c' spelling comes from Latin and the 'k' one from Greek.</p>

<p>To expand on that: The Latin word is discus while the Greek word is diskos.</p></div>		</li>

<p>English has had a continental influence for a long time, pretty much since the Norman invasion in 1066.  :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>More to the point, England is part of Europe to begin with so I'm not sure this point stands. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a bit baffled as to the purposes of your comment, so I hope this doesn't come off as impolite; but I don't think influences before the seventeenth century are terribly germane to the divergence of spelling between English in England (and countries that would broadly follow their lead) and English in the United States.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Continental European influence has affected English since its dawning and continues today.  I guess my point was that European influence is a constant in English, and the factors affecting American English are what is new, even if it is now the most widely-spoken single dialect.</p></div>		</li>
