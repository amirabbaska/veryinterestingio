<p>We say &quot;hey doc&quot; to doctors but we don't call them by first name, generally. </p>
<p>We say &quot;professor&quot; rather than just their name, maybe &quot;professor (last name)&quot;. Some adjuncts are ok with &quot;professor (first name)&quot; but my Sociology of Knowledge professor earned her PhD mid-semester and people started calling her &quot;professor (last name)&quot;. </p>
<p>There's no society out there without these designations of status, and it makes sense. Obviously mom has a higher status in one's life than the mailman, no offense to the mailman. </p>

<p>Sweden is an interesting contrast to this. The du-reform that took place during the 1960s and 1970s pretty much abolished the tu-vous distinction (&quot;du&quot; and &quot;ni&quot; respectively) as well as the use of titles when addressing someone. </p>
<p>I would never refer to any of my professors by anything other than their first name. The same for nurses, doctors, teachers, police, etc. Young children might use &quot;fr√∂ken&quot; (which means &quot;miss&quot; but is also used for male staff) in pre-school but that's more to do with the fact that they don't always remember individual names. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really interesting, I addressed all my professors as Dr. LastName initially. If I ended up taking multiple classes with them and we got to know each other Dr. Bergmann became Phil, Dr. Foster became Susan. These where the professors that I respected the most, and those I respected the least were addressed more formally. </p>
<p>I work in a hospital, I never address a physician as Dr. LastName.  What's weird is that how people address physicians doesn't really seem to vary based on the physician, instead it varies based on who is addressing them. Some nurses address physicians by their first name, some physician address them as Dr. LastName. It's kind of interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually reminds me of an article that I read recently enough that made the point that the du-reform is often discussed as changing relationships vertically i.e. that it was a change in the relationship between subordinates and their superiors. But the author points out that it had an effect horizontally as well in the sense that it blurred the distinction between friends, acquaintances and work colleagues, at least language-wise. </p>
<p>I presume that for some physicians referring to their colleagues by their titles is a sort of marker that they have a professional relationship but nothing more than that, something which isn't possible in Sweden because everyone is on first name terms.</p>
<p>I grew up in Ireland so it was a bit of a culture shock for me to learn that titles aren't used at all. I'm not sure how professors are referred to in universities in Ireland (I think it's relatively informal) but at least in school, we only ever used Sir/Miss or Mr./Mrs./Ms. LastName. If I met one of my old teachers today, I wouldn't feel comfortable with calling them anything other than Sir/Miss.</p>
<p>I work part-time in social services and I still react everytime I write a formal letter and start it with nothing more than a &quot;Hi&quot; or a &quot;Hi FirstName&quot; because there's no way of writing &quot;Dear Sir&quot; or &quot;Dear Madam&quot; in Swedish that doesn't sound completely old fashioned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each language is different and cultures within them are different too. English can be accused of being unsusally formal, having abolished its informal pronoun. But I would argue that it's pretty informal. When everyone is a &quot;vous&quot; no one is, if you will. </p>
<p>The use of titles in professions, religion, family, and governments is similarly diverse across cultures. In South America addressing someone by their professional title and surname is quite common. But in Central America calling someone by their title is done sparingly as in North America. </p>
<p>Japanese has the most or at least the best-known social class language structure, but it is present in all languages. There are some people who you would not presume to address casually without their expressed permission. It may not be a neighbor, teacher, or doctor, but it is likely to be a priest, government official, or visiting monarch. </p>
<p>Learning how to address people and screwing it up in embarrassing ways is part of the fun of travel. Vive le difference! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's so interesting! In retrospect we discussed things from a very America - centric perspective. But generally speaking while there are cultural differences, the notion of totemism seems pretty across the board. Flags and patriotism is a more secular example. We discussed religion. The way we change how to talk to someone when we see they have a badge or some other symbol of authority. Calling teachers by their first name, that's a first. If you did that here it would be seen as a sign of disrespect and you'd get a glare of doom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was a first for me too. As I mentioned in a comment below, I grew up in Ireland and we never used anything other than &quot;Sir/Miss&quot; when addressing a teacher directly or &quot;Mr./Mrs./Ms. Whatever&quot; when referring to them. Even being overheard referring to a teacher by their last name alone, without their title, would lead to a reprimand of some kind. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My husband and his family are from Eastern Europe, and they only ever call their parents by their full first names, or by &quot;sir&quot; for the men sometimes. Calling them any form of mom, dad, mother, father, etc. is seen as a disrespect. I have no idea if this is common for Eastern European families, but both his mother's side and his father's side do this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh that's interesting. My bf is Korean and I know that they call mom and dad mom and dad. Also younger siblings call older siblings brother and sister, not by first name, but it's a little fuzzy and depends on how traditional the family is. When there's barely an age difference it doesn't apply. So his very young sister calls him brother but his slightly younger brother just calls him by his name. </p>
<p>My family is from Ukraine/Russia and it's the same as American norms. Mom, dad. If I called my dad by his name I'm pretty sure I'd get an ass whooping. As a teenager I once called my mom by her first name as a way of rebelling and she lost her shit. It was a major red line I crossed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eastern Europe where? In my country, Hungary, it was common for kids to use the formal 'you' with their parents even a generation ago. The title would be in this case a more formal, respectful version of Mother/Father.</p></div>		</li>
