			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it would be good to add that the reason rust flakes off is because Iron Oxide is a larger molecule/crystal than Iron itself and thus pushes away from the rest of the structure, opening up fresh iron and exposing it to the air/moisture, and thus the cycle repeats</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So here's another thing to think about... as far as gold jewelry goes, almost everything is either 14-18K (which means 14/24 or 18/24 gold since 24K is pure gold) and the rest of the alloyed (mixing) metal is not specified. It normally contains a portion of silver, nickel, and copper. Gold jewelry WILL tarnish, but it takes a very, very long time. It is also a different color.</p>
<p>EDIT to add that gold does NOT come in white naturally.  That just means they added a different metal in as an alloy (normally palladium, nickel, or managanese) to make it &quot;white&quot; (normally slightly yellow tinted) and plate it with rhodium, which is a very bright white color.  If you buy a white gold piece of jewelry, be prepared to get it rhodium plated once a year.  If you get it sized somewhere, make sure that the stock (the piece of gold that they add in to make the ring bigger) is actually white gold!  I see too many times were they just size with yellow gold and rhodium plate it, which hides the color, only for it to rub off in the future.</p></div>		</li>
