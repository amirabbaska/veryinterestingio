			<div class="markdown"><p>There have actually been some exciting developments recently in using JAK inhibitors, a class of drugs currently used for rheumatoid arthritis and some cancer treatments, to cure alopecia areata, and they will likely start clinical trials for male pattern baldness soon. A company called Aclaris Therapeutics has a drug in the pipeline I've been keeping an eye on. <a href="http://www.belgraviacentre.com/blog/strong-commitment-made-to-jak-inhibitor-hair-loss-treatment-development/" target="_blank">http://www.belgraviacentre.com/blog/strong-commitment-made-to-jak-inhibitor-hair-loss-treatment-development/</a> </p>
<p>We baldies remain, as always, cautiously optimistic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I don't understand one thing. If we let pieces of fingers grow on other places of your body (to preserve them before an operation), then why can't we place hair follicles from the back of your head (which are more resistent) to the rest of the head?  I mean, if we're able to clone them (or harvest them from other people for a decent price), wouldn't it be technically possible to give people a full head of hair (made of those specific hair follicles)? </p></div>		</li>

<p>They're surgical, painful and usually only barely acceptable cosmetically as they need to take follicles one at a time and move then. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but that's why I was talking about the cloning part. We don't have enough hair on the back to give us an appearance of full hair. Or is cloning still not possible (I am nor a medic or pharmacist)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard that stem cell research on hair therapy will make Male pattern baldnesss a thing of the past. Since hair follicles also contain stem cells, and some researchers predict research on these follicle stem cells may lead to successes in treating baldness through an activation of the stem cells progenitor cells. This therapy is expected to work by activating already existing stem cells on the scalp. Researchers who have been working on stem cell therapy can better explain the predicament.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an iffy thing. There are several stuff that work on mice, such as an Shh (sonic hedgehog) inhibitor (I think it's called tofacitinib?) as well as another one called SAG (don't remember what this stands for). Cyclosporin is another one that has had results. I've only had experience with mice so I don't know how it works in humans. Basically, these all have been able to kickstart hair growth. However, the important thing is in areas with high BMP, an inhibitor of hair growth, it doesn't seem to have much affect. I think alopecia is linked with high BMP levels as well as other inhibitors of growth so while there treatments work, it seems just to kickstary growth where it can already occur. </p></div>		</li>
