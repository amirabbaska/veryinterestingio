			<div class="markdown"><p>My cat came for pats today, rubbed her cheeks on me then threw up on the chair behind my head. Translation: She loves me so much it's disgusting.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the gold :) For all those concerned, no need to be. She's been to the vet recently and she's healthy. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/GtEdw" target="_blank">Here's a photo of her looking confused as to why I'm taking a photo of her</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She may also have eaten too fast, some cats scarf down their kibbles without really chewing, which can upset their stomachs. Mine does this occasionally and likes to hider her vomit in my closet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My cats have rubbing wars on my face.  One cat comes downstairs as soon as I start work in my office and demands cuddlings and rubs on all over my face.  The second comes down at lunch time, I think he doesn't actually love me as much as the first, he's just hungry. Face rubs to cover up first cat.  Last cat doesn't leave the bed until Fiancee comes home from work.  Cuddles demanded, third rub of the day.  I go through a ton of eye glasses cleaner due to there little noses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's what my cat did when I got out of the shower:</p>
<p>I was working for a big PR firm in the early 90s. It was the day I was to meet the CEO of our Fortune 100 client company.  So of course, the night before I picked out my exact power outfit: Red wool suit with black embroidered buttons and giant shoulder pads.</p>
<p>Morning of, I lay everything out and take my shower.  First, as I drying my hair and then as I'm doing my makeup, I kept hearing this &quot;<em>Mlep..mlep..mlep
..mlep..mlep..</em>''</p>
<p>Go back into my room, aaaand mother<strong>**</strong> Klaus the Kat has just eaten a hole through my suit.</p></div>		</li>
