			<div class="markdown"><p>Another good example of this is watering down anise based liquors; as the solution becomes more polar, oils will fall out and make the drink cloudy.  Typically this is done with Ouzo, Pernod, or the famous Absinthe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar, it would probably be a more significant issue with dissolving sugar because sugar is so much larger.  </p>
<p>The polar part of both water and ethanol is around the oxygen atom.  Where water has 2 small hydrogen atoms bonded to the O, ethanol has 1 hydrogen and one large ethane group.  The bigger that group gets (e.g. butane/butanol, isopropane/isopropanol), the less an alcohol will dissolve something like sugar or salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be more technical, the lattice energy of salt is too high for ethanol to dissolve it completely, but water is polar enough to overcome the lattice energy.</p>
<p>Lattice energy is basically the strength of the attraction of the sodium and chlorine ions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't agree with this answer.  In this case, solubility is going to be dictated by sterics more than anything else.</p></div>		</li>
