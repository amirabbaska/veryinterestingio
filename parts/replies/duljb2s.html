			<div class="markdown"><p>Motors with permanent magnets wouldn't work because they'd get stuck, simply. The attracting forces lock it in place and it wouldn't spin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should edit to say motors with <strong>ONLY</strong> permanent magnets, since most electric motors do have permanent magnets inside of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would have permanent magnets in the rotor of a stepper motor. Electromagnets around the stator.
But, as you say, all permanent magnets and it would get stuck. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes energy to establish a magnetic field, and that energy is released as the field is collapsed. </p>
<p>I've seen some motors using &quot;permanent&quot; magnets only, but they are not creating any energy, just using up the potential energy stored in the magnetic fields of the magnets as they are gradually collapsed. </p>
<p>The magnets are demagnetized over time and have to be replaced. This is the source of a lot of &quot;free energy&quot; motors that are touted as &quot;perpetual motion&quot;.  What they really are is elaborate, often relatively ingenious magnet demagnetizers. Lol</p>
<p>They are just using up the potential energy in the magnetic field as it slowly collapses. Its not very much energy for a typical permenant magnet, but it requires some energy to create a magnetic field, and that energy is released as it is collapsed. </p>
<p>Think of it like a wound up spring.</p>
<p>A lot of resources in time and clever thought go into making these motors (its not trivial to get these very low power densities to overcome friction, much less appear to produce useful work) It's too bad that these often obviously talented people don't put their efforts to work solving useful problems instead of failing to understand that they are just harnessing the tiny bit of energy stored in the magnets during manufacture. We should call them &quot;static&quot; magnets instead of &quot;permanent&quot; magnets. :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you're brewing a perpetual motion machine. </p>
<p>Completely impossible by the way. Energy cannot be created from nothing. You need to supply power to the magnets to keep them moving, and the friction (or EM resistance) the process would generate would ensure it wouldn't last.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generators use a [normally permanent] magnet and a coil of wire, when you pass the magnet past the wire you get a charge in the coil.  I don't think you get the same thing in two permanent magnets, but you could get a couple of magnets, and a volt meter and find out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perpetual motion is possible. You just need to figure out how to not lose any energy. Of course you can't make energy out of nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think for any configuration of static magnets, there will be some rotation that is optimal.  And so the system will move until it finds the best angle and then sort of just lock there.</p>
<p>Motors get around this by having at least one set of magnets be dynamic.  Then electricity is used to periodically alter the magnetic field.  So there's never an optimal configuration (it's always changing) and the system never settles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not related at all but years ago YStech decided to move the magnets to the outside of a fan and made the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKofleGNE7g" target="_blank">Tip Magnetic Drive</a> fan.  The result is a center hub that's ~75% smaller, ideally to reduce the dead air in the center of CPU coolers.  They were decent fans, but a bit loud at full speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well im also struggling with his question, does he mean like a free energy device using a perpetual motion then the answer is no. Or does he mean something like a magnetic clutch, a shaft or wheel turned by a non friction clutch powered by a motor</p></div>		</li>
