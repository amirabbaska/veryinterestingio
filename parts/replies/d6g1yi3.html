			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. The recovery of function was an added, unforseen benefit. I'd guess that somehow, the brain translated the VR movements to use the same neural pathways that were used by the subjects pre-spinal injury. This may have reinforced and rehabilitated the pathways enough that they started to, maybe, regrow...  all in all very cool stuff!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly a compelling avenue for follow up studies. Also it's cool enough to make funding likely. This will get studied for sure. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Which leaves me wondering how many amazing things aren't being studied right now due to a lack of wow-factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>V.S. Ramachandran used a mirror box to help ex-stroke patients gain control of their phantom limbs using this principle. It allowed people to relax normally painfully tense phantom limbs, I think House did an episode on it too. There's definitely a lot of really cool stuff up that alley.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bingo. This was my first thought too. VR seems like a natural extension of the neurofeedback loop recreated by Ramachandran's mirror box. Trick the head, trigger the body. </p>
<p>I feel like this phenomenon can be filed under placebo effect, which continues to be an ongoing blindspot in science. Like, I don't even, wtf is going on, this is magic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really interesting thing. So a conjecture could be that if you've got a damaged pathway somewhere, fooling yourself into thinking you can control that body part can actually reinforce the pathway.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_box" target="_blank">mirror box</a> idea that helps people alleviate phantom limb pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the first thing I thought of too. I'm curious if VR could be used like a mirror box to help phantom limb pain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if we could use AR to make patients see their missing limb to alleviate phantom pain, and also maybe mask their robotic limb to look like real limb instead of covering them with latex?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'Learned non-use' is a term I learned about 15yrs ago.  I was paralyzed at age 12 in 1985.  They taught you then to survive ... Now it's about standing and preserving function etc.</p>
<p>Can't wait until they get this tech to a Lycra suit I could wear under normal clothing ... </p></div>		</li>
