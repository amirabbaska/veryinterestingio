			<p>Yup. The recovery of function was an added, unforseen benefit. I'd guess that somehow, the brain translated the VR movements to use the same neural pathways that were used by the subjects pre-spinal injury. This may have reinforced and rehabilitated the pathways enough that they started to, maybe, regrow...  all in all very cool stuff!</p>		</li>

			<p>Just curious, do researchers usually conduct their own &quot;sales pitches&quot; for grants and corporate funding and whatnot? Or do they have someone from their university or laboratory's business side secure them funding?<br><br>I could see a situation where a scientist or engineer could end up having a hell of a time trying to explain the purpose of their proposed advanced research to a bunch of corporate drones.</p>		</li>

			<p>Researcher here.  The answer is: it depends.  There are 3 main types of research funding, in general.  The first is the &quot;gold standard&quot; which are government-funded pure research grants.  These are highly competitive, used to fund pure research that may not ever find a practical application, but is essential for advancing the field.  They are usually applied for at fixed intervals, and each application is assessed by a number of experts in the field who then decide which projects are funded.  The assessment criteria are usually some combination of (a) the track record of the researchers, (b) the relevance of the research to national interests, and (c) the feasibility of the research plan.  From personal experience, there also seems to be a little bit of (d) random chance and personal bias, in there as well.  Researchers will write these applications themselves, possibly with some guidance from others in their institution, and they are moderately technical in nature since the audience are also experts.  Obviously experienced researchers are very good at writing these applications in ways that read well and are more likely to get funding.<br><br>The second main type of funding is also government funded, but are given in collaboration with industry.  Typically you will need a company to contribute some funds or other resources to the project, and the government will contribute a sizeable chunk of cash as well.  These are applied for in a very similar way to pure research grants, but the assessment criteria are a little different, mostly in that the potential industry impact of the research is also considered very important.  Will the research advance the state of the industry in the country?  Will it allow the company to become a world leader in the field? Will it lead to further collaboration in the future?  Of course the other criteria such as the strength of the research team, etc, are still very important.  These types of applications typically have more input from external parties, as they need to be written in a slightly more commercial way, highlighting the social and economic benefits of the research.  Most universities and research centres will have people whose job it is to help write such applications and assess them internally before submission in order to better 'sell' these parts of the research.  Some industry organisations and companies also give out research grants directly in a similar way, however the scope of such projects are usually very focused.  For example, the national agricultural board might want researchers to develop pest control techniques on behalf of all farmers, so this will be put out to a competitive grant.<br><br>The third type of research funding comes directly from industry, and although it's a great source of funding it's often considered &quot;dirty money&quot;, particularly to universities.  This is because it's usually tied to a very specific outcome and doesn't always have much 'pure' research involved.  Commercial interests also often mean that the research can't be published.  Since these grants also aren't competitive in nature they don't have as much worth in furthering the careers of the researchers involved.  The process of getting this type of funding is quite varied, but usually involves developing relationships with industry, working together on smaller projects first to establish credentials and mutual benefit, and then moving towards the large-scale, expensive research later on.  Having been involved in quite a few such projects, the style of &quot;application&quot; is very different.  For a few quite large projects (tens of millions of dollars) there hasn't been any formal application, they were simply discussed in person after years of collaborative work, and then the lawyers sort out the details later.  Others have had a more formal approach, with project proposals going to the executives of the company for assessment and final approval.  Usually you know whether you're getting the money or not well in advance though, because it's done on a more personal level.  All universities will have commercialisation offices that help start and foster the relationships needed to obtain this type of funding, as well as drawing up the necessary agreements, tracking funding, etc.<br><br>tl;dr It depends on the type of grant money.  Some they do almost entirely themselves, others have heavy external involvement.</p>		</li>

			<p>Good list, but I'd add non-profit foundations as a fourth source of grants. I personally know a few researchers who have received money from (for example) the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), The Knights of Columbus, Autism Speaks, and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The scientists who got these type of grants were already somewhat established as researchers. Some of them got grants through an interview after a nomination, others were a more formal grant application process like a government grant. Almost all required some sort of layman's explanation about how the research would directly benefit the funding charity's goal.</p>		</li>

			<p>Perhaps I worded that a little bluntly.  I'm also an engineering researcher, and we certainly get a lot of our money from industry.  The main point I was trying to make is that this money isn't really as &quot;good&quot; as pure research grant money in terms of KPIs and so forth.  For example I was part of a research team that received about $10m in funding from industry over a 5 year period for a fairly major project, but that received very little attention from the university.  However when I recently received a $0.5m competitive government funded grant there were letters from the vice chancellor, special events to celebrate the success, etc, etc.  Industry money doesn't have any stigma as such, it's just not quite as &quot;pure&quot; as competitive grant money.  It's certainly more useful in terms of actual funding, since there are usually less conditions associated with spending it.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; The main point I was trying to make is that this money isn't really as &quot;good&quot; as pure research grant money in terms of KPIs and so forth.<br><br>That is really only true if you look at it from a pure academical standpoint. Yes, industry money is not as important for furthering your university career (although I've seen people spoken of very highly for being able to acquire large sums of it since it usually helps the university in other ways too and isn't just spent on the project itself). If you look at using the „revolving door“ between academia and industry though, it's very relevant. Here in Germany it's actually very unusual for an engineering professor to not have spent a good bit if time in the industry before becoming a professor. They often bring many industry contacts with them at the start of their university career and utilizing them to acquire money for their research is crucial. And if you ever look into getting back into the industry after a stint as a professor (or parallel to it), the money you got from industry contacts is just as good as government money.</p>		</li>

			<p>Here in Australia the ARC (Australian Research Council) and NHMRC (National Health and Medical Research Council) are by far the two biggest sources of government research funding, and these are pretty much equivalent to NIH and NSF in the US.  But each state will also have its own funding schemes, many government departments (EPA, DVA, DHS, etc) will have their own as well, and there is a <em>lot</em> of money floating around in defence for funding of various projects, even some that aren't related directly to the military.<br><br>Learning where the best sources of research funding are is a rather important skill for a researcher to have, and experienced researchers are very, very good at sniffing out potential grant opportunities.</p>		</li>

			<p>At least where I'm from (Canada), researchers have to do their own &quot;sales pitches&quot; for funding. From what I've heard, it's generally the same idea everywhere, though different countries have different models. (Some places require you to have a specific project in mind when you get funding, while you can get general research funding in others.) I once visited a university where they had a whole course on marketing research projects, which taught, among other things, how to choose clever acronyms for projects. <br><br>It would be nice to be able to delegate the funding logistics to someone else, though, I must say. </p>		</li>

			<p>Wow-factor isn't as much of the problem as current profitability is. If the medical industry can make money off of it right now, it will be pushed. If it is going to take getting through substantial red tape (like with marijuana testing) it will be pushed to the side for something more feasible in the near-future.</p>		</li>
