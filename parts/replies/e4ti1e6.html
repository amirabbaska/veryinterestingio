			<div class="markdown"><p>That's definitely a cool idea, but... no, not a chance. Each lens needs to have its optic center in front of your pupil at it's resting gaze. That's why you have two individual lenses. Things like wide visor-like goggles can be made, but it is essentially still treated as two separate lenses (with each prescription ground separately and placed in front of each eye... or just using inserts). If you've ever had glasses made, that's what we're measuring for when you hold that binocular like machine in front of your eyes, or someone holds a small ruler across the bridge of your nose.</p>
<p>The reason it's done this way is because lenses are not optically perfect edge to edge. Those that are close are astonishingly expensive. They have sweet spots, essentially. The farther you get from the center, the more distorted the image becomes. It can also cause the image to shift and distort at different rates for each eye (very few people have the exact same prescription in each eye, especially over the course of their life). If you ever see someone who has what looks like dozens of lines across their lenses, it means that they have two very different prescriptions. This can cause intense double vision as you move even a tiny bit from the center of the lens (such as turning your head). Those lines are a series of prisms that try to accommodate for that effect.</p>
<p>Fun fact (at least to an optician): When we make bifocals or progressives for people, the optic center for the near vision portion is just shifted in 1.5 mm per eye. That's because your eyes converge slightly when you read, since the focal point is much closer.</p></div>		</li>
