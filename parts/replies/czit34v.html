			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice reply - this covers what a lot of the other replies are missing (including mine). One correction though - the tows don't have to be woven into a fabric and they often lose some of their benefits when doing that. When creating a fabric, you compromise some of the properties in each direction to create essentially a bi-directional instead of uni-directional material. While cloth is easier to work with, it loses some of its tensile properties (lower young's modulus and lower ultimate strength).</p>
<p>A lot of the more advanced processes that really utilize the benefits of the composite tend to lay unidirectional tow or tape directly and build laminates based on that. Think Advanced fiber placement (lays down a unidirectional tape from a roll), filament winding (lays down a tow or tape directly onto the tool), or hand layup with unidirectional tapes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely. I've heard black aluminum referred to when a part is designed rather generically and without much optimization. If you construct a 0-90/+-45|sym laminate using cloth, you actually come out with a quasi-isotropic laminate with similar (but slightly better) properties to aluminum. A lot of parts are still made with laminates like this, but it is generally a testiment to the conservative nature of the aerospace industry IMO as it really trades some of the advantages of composites to be on the safer and more predictable side. </p></div>		</li>
