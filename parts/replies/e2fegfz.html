			<div class="markdown"><p>So by &quot;prestressed&quot; you mean that it is laid down with tension applied to it? So when it expands it &quot;fills in&quot; the extra space between mounts? How can they possibly apply the force necessary to counteract this expansion? Seems like it would make the construction process difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was a manager of track maintenance for a US railroad for a while. When they lay new rail, part of the process is a &quot;<a href="https://imgur.com/tvCy9C2" target="_blank">heater car</a>&quot;. This machine rides the rail and is basically a multi headed blow torch to heat the new rail to the &quot;<a href="https://imgur.com/29xPb4F" target="_blank">rail neutral temperature</a>&quot;(SFT). At this point the rail is not yet spiked down to the ties so that it has a chance to grow and expand. After the heater car some other rail cars called &quot;spikers&quot; follow to spike the new rail down. That is how they &quot;pre-stress&quot; the rail. I am skipping some steps, but that is the gist of it. I will look through some old pictures I have to see if I have any of this process, and update with them if I find any.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! When the rail is laid, one end is welded into the adjacent rail. The rail is then cut to exactly the right length so that when it is pretensioned to reach the Stress Free Temperature, it leaves just the right gap to allow it to also be welded to the other adjacent rail. It is critical for the engineer running the job to know the current rail temperature so that they can work out the correct level of stress to apply to the rail.</p>
<p>If the rail happens to be at 27C when it is being laid (fairly rare) then no stressing is required and the rail is simply cut to the right length to fit in the gap available.</p>
<p>To answer another question about how the rail is stressed, I'm not aware of us ever using some kind of external heat in the UK for the stressing process. It really is just a big hydraulic ram that stretches the rail longitudinally. </p></div>		</li>
