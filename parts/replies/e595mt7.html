<p>I also got a bag of chicken jerky at Costco recently, those hardly last ten seconds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try the Himalayan Cheese sticks.  My golden retriever takes about a day.  It's relatively flavorless so it's like chew for 10 minutes, run a lap, chew a bit more, bark at shadow, and then chew some more.</p>
<p>I have noticed though that picky dogs don't like the cheese sticks.  It seriously lacks flavor.  I generally eat everything I feed my dog at least once and the cheese sticks taste like rubber :).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, I just realized you're talking about the Himalayan chews.  I've only seen the &quot;cheese&quot; when it's been the yalk milk chewed that have been heated until they puff up  like these  <a href="https://www.bestbullysticks.com/puffed-himalayan-cheese" target="_blank">https://www.bestbullysticks.com/puffed-himalayan-cheese</a>   And they are also sold as himalayan cheese puffs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's so weird- my dog will pass up pig ears, bully sticks, rawhide, <em>anything</em> for a Himalayan cheese stick. They're the only ones she doesn't get tired of, we basically just buy them in bulk. Luckily she's small so one will last her a few weeks, but still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try bully sticks. Also nylabone is okay depending on the dog. They can flake off but they can pass the flakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tip: if you microwave a Himalayan stick it'll puff up and it's a little easier to chew. We do this after our dog chews the big ones down and we start to worry that he'll swallow the end whole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a fan of bully sticks because they are high in calories. [Here is a link] (<a href="http://www.aaha.org/blog/NewStat/post/2013/01/28/434951/Study-reveals-surprising-misconceptions-about-bully-sticks.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.aaha.org/blog/NewStat/post/2013/01/28/434951/Study-reveals-surprising-misconceptions-about-bully-sticks.aspx</a>) about a study showing the high calorie content of bully sticks. Many people also don't realize that they are dried bull penises, which can freak some people out.</p>
<p>Not too familiar with Himalayan sticks myself. If they are super hard,  then there are concerns.</p></div>		</li>
