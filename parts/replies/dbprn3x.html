			<div class="markdown"><p>This would make a sick movie. Like an ant version of &quot;The Island&quot; where the ants think they get 'chosen' to go down to the new colony, but when the hero ant (who's always been a bit of a dreamer really) goes down, he realizes there's nothing but death there. He then falls in love with one of the ants and rallies a ragtag team of Misfits to work together to get back to the surface, hoping that once the rest of the colony knows about it they'll find a way to rescue everyone. Only, when he does get to the surface, he discovers that the administration was aware of the situation the entire time, and was using it as a form of population control. Him and his team then expose the Queen through an elaborate plan where they get her to confess everything (at some point, it seems like the plan has failed, but that's <em>on purpose</em>!). Movie ends with everyone getting rescued and the hero and the girl ant getting married.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno, it's a code that's incredibly sophisticated in parts, and way too thrifty in other parts. </p>
<p>They  are like super sophisticated little robots in that they are way to literal to the code/prime directive/etc. I mean, every behavior is dictated by how an ant behaves in a colony. Nature never planned for the ant to be taken from the colony, much like you wouldn't expect your factory robot to be taken from the factory. But regardless of where it is, it will, if it can, perform the necessary routines, if not, it just displays an error message and dies.</p>
<p>In essence they dont have routines/subroutines for self maintenance, so when those needs like food aren't being filled by normal work they wont ever break away to meet them. Why would they? An ant lives or dies by its role in the colony, not by its ability to self-sustain. It's questionable how self-maintaining they are. I mean, do they even feel hunger? If they don't have any concept of self-preservation (and they will work when hungry/battered) then it would be all the greatness of a robot workforce but none of the risk of one of them gaining sentience or full autonomy. </p>
<p>Incredibly coordinated in groups and infinitely sophisticated, but minimally adaptable in small numbers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can think of the colony as a whole to be a kind of meta-organism, and the individual ants are its cells. If some of our skin cells get scraped off by accident, it's not surprising that they don't form a new human; they just die. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a study of certain ants that moved occasionally (for food and protection). They were able to study a number of relocations by following the scouting ants. The researchers also set up a number of scenarios that the scouts would check out.</p>
<p>Their conclusion (not definitive, obviously, this is science), was that the scouts had a mental plan of 3 or 4 conditions, and once they found a new place that met these minimal conditions, they would signal the hive.</p>
<p>Ants are fucking awesome.  E.O. Wilson (just kidding, but I', sure he thought that)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think anyone that has played a lot of management games can appreciate the single minded adherence to duty.</p>
<p>If a shortage of food leads to the entire colony abandoning their duties to go try and seek food individually that can mean collapse where maybe it might have only meant a few members starving if everyone had kept to their job.</p>
<p>In fact, given that this is the way that ants work, I think we can assume that in general tending to the needs of the colony first results in a better survival rate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As was with another post that got popular</p>
<p>Why do birds live much longer lives than rats? It's inefficient for a rat to be able to live for 10 years if they're only going to die somehow after a single year.</p>
<p>Birds on the other hand generally live longer because they do not have many predators.</p></div>		</li>
