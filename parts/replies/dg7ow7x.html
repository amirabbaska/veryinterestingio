			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert on the eye no no mean, but that is actually a myth. It does cause eyestrain however. Distance does nothing but test the strength of the optic nerve. Old age is very accountable for poor eyesight as I believe a thicker lens is a good cause of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it (I'm a biologist but not an expert on the eye), after doing prolonged close work, the focusing muscle inside the eye locks up into a state of near focus. Over time this leads to permanent nearsightedness, an abnormal lengthening of the eye.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It really doesn't unless the light intensity is too high.  Too bright of light can hurt them but just trying to focus on something close won't.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why some cases appear to &quot;get better&quot; between the rerouting in the brain and the adaptation of the person the effects can be diminished almost to the point of normalcy.</p></div>		</li>
