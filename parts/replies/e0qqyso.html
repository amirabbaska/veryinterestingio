			<div class="markdown"><p>Mars' best opposition in thousands of years happened in 2003--it came extra close to Earth that year.  Mars was near perihelion of its orbit around the sun, while Earth was near aphelion in its orbit, so they came especially close together.  This year's opposition will be the best since 2003's.</p>
<p>Opposition, as a general thing, is when a planet comes closest to Earth during their orbits around the sun.  Draw the sun on a piece of paper, then a circle around it, then a bigger circle around that.  Make a little dot on the first circle, then, on a line from the sun through the first dot, make another dot on the second circle.  The inner dot is the Earth, the outer dot is Mars, in this case.  All three objects are on a straight line, thus the two dots are closest together at that time.  That is opposition (the moon reaches opposition once a month, when it's full; details differ somewhat from a planet's, which is beyond the scope of this mention).  The planet (or moon) is opposite the sun in the sky from Earth's point of view then, hence the name.  At that time the planet will rise at sunset, be on the overhead meridian at local midnight, and set at sunrise.  Since the planet is closest, it's also biggest and brightest at that time, showing the most detail.  Mars generally takes about 26 months to go from opposition to opposition.</p>
<p>A cool word, one of my favorites: syzygy, pronounced &quot;sih-zih-gee&quot;.   Syzygy is when three astronomical objects form a straight (or nearly so) line in space, such as happens during an opposition.</p>
<p>As for what you should look for in late July--as mentioned, Mars will be at its biggest and brightest then, so it will be the best time to see it.  You'll need a telescope to really see details on the planet, but it will be quite a sight even naked eye--it's already brighter than the brightest star in our sky, and will grow even brighter.  Mars will be in Capricornus at that time.  Check around for the local astronomy club in your area, they'll surely be doing public viewings of Mars around that time.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Jupiter was at opposition on May 8, IIRC, it was and still is in Libra.  Saturn will be at opposition in late June, over the Teapot asterism in Sagittarius.  Local astro clubs will doubtless be showing Saturn, too.  If you go out around 2 or 3 am now, you can see Mars, orange and bright in the southeast, Saturn to its west (somewhat fainter), then the red star Antares in Scorpius (Antares means &quot;rival of Mars&quot;, or &quot;not Mars&quot;, to keep from confusing the two, Ares being the Greek name for Mars, of course), then Jupiter, big, bright and creamy white, in the southwest.</p>
<p>I could say a lot more about all this, but I think I'll leave it as is for now.  Go out and look! :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't find any examples of this online? All I can find about changes to how Mars appears to the naked eye are either due the distance from Earth or growth and shrink of the polar caps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I saw it mentioned somewhere online just a day or so ago, don't remember where.  I'm an amateur astronomer of going on 40 years' experience, I learned it a long time ago.  You really can tell the difference naked eye!  Mars will look orange if good, yellow if dusty.</p>
<p>Also, to clarify my earlier post--due to the planets' elliptical orbits, actual closest approach can happen a few days before or after opposition.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks for the reply. </p>
