<p>We lose taste buds as we age.</p>

<p>Is this why everyone thinks things they used to love aren't as good as they were when they were kids? Even watermelons don't taste as good as they used to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is an important factor, though I'd say not the only one.</p>
<p>Nostalgia plays a factor. Everything is bigger and better as a kid because you're experiencing it for the first time.</p>
<p>Also, in the case of certain fruits (bananas), it's because of different breeds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To add to it:  Children are more sensitive to bitter compounds <strong>because</strong> they have more taste buds. </p>
<p>Edit: I originally tried to add an <em> tag but i could see the tags in the post so I figured it wouldn't work</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they aren't as segregated as that chart depicted.  The bitter taste buds are more concentrated at the back of the tongue, but you can detect bitter on the rest of your tongue too -- just not as intensely.  </p></div>		</li>
