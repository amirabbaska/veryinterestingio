			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and one pathological situation in which you see this is where the fetus is severely brain damaged and therefore unable to process the &quot;cramped&quot; signals.</p>
<p>When this happens, the fetus never initiates the cascade that leads to labor. At that point, one of three things will happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fetus dies, and maternal immune response triggers labor</li>
<li>Fetus dies, and maternal immune response calcifies the fetus, which can then remain inside the uterus for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithopedion" target="_blank">decades</a></li>
<li>Fetus continues to grow until stretch sensors in uterus trigger labor</li>
</ul></div>		</li>
