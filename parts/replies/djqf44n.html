The principle remains the same, though.  The higher the source resolution (either 4k source video or a 4k internal rendering resolution in a game, for instance), the more accurate the sampling will be when it's displayed at the native 1080 resolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>with web video it's also because of the compression. the 1080p video is not perfect, its compressed quite a bit and does lose some information. the 4k video has more information, and therefore better quality than the 'native' 1080p.</p></div>		</li>
