			<div class="markdown"><p>While America was on Israels &quot;side&quot; from 1948, the special relationship did not start until later. Early on, Israel was mostly supported by french (1956 war, etc) until they embargoed Israel in 1967. During the 1967 war, Israel needed a new ally, and America needed a proxy to counter Egypt's soviet relationship, which began the American Israel thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This right here. It's simply not true to say that &quot;everything changed in 1948&quot; and it's annoying OP says it so decisively while being completely wrong. And besides, US support of Israel wasn't a game changer, it was simply one part of the game America was playing in the Middle East and a lot of that had to do with Soviet Russia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And still does</p>
<p>From the 1982 edition of Foreign Affairs - Assad and the Middle East</p>
<p>Nor can one ignore Assad's prime superpower supporter, the Soviet Union. Syria's relationship to the U.S.S.R. is another Middle East complexity that does not easily fit into the clear definitions preferred by Western, and especially by American, observers. Imperial Russia, and even more so the Soviet Union, has consistently attempted to gain a place of influence in the Middle East. The U.S.S.R. recognized the new state of Israel the same day as the United States; the weapons used by Israel in its war of independence came largely from Communist Czechoslovakia.5 During the early Stalinist time, the Soviet Union operated primarily through traditional communist parties in the Middle East. That relationship brought very few results. When the Soviet Union realized that Arab nationalism aroused by the creation of Israel provided more fertile soil, it changed its method and switched sides.</p>
<p>The U.S.S.R. wants several things in the Middle East, above all a recognized place for what it believes to be its legitimate interest in that area lying close to its borders. Hence its resentment about repeated American attempts to exclude it therefrom. Even more concern has arisen in the U.S.S.R. over the American quest for military bases in the region and organization of the Rapid Deployment Force.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1955, and especially after America's rejection of the Aswan Dam in 1956, Egypt's President Gamal Abdel Nasser became the main Soviet &quot;window&quot; in the Middle East, but at the same time both Syria and Iraq were courted and received large military equipment, the principal tool of spreading Soviet influence-building.</p>
<p>Then, after President Sadat ejected the Russians abruptly in 1972 and Iraq attacked Iran in 1980, Syria became the Soviet Union's only viable &quot;window&quot; and thereby attained particular importance in Soviet eyes. The Soviet-Syrian Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed in October 1980, calling for &quot;cooperation in the military field&quot; and mutual consultations on threats to each other's security or violations of peace and security &quot;in the whole world.&quot; As a result, substantial Soviet aid was extended to the Syrian ground forces, as well as the Syrian air defense and air forces. And then, when the latter were wiped out by Israel in June 1982, the Russians embarked in December 1982 on the largest reequipment effort in their history. They not only gave the Syrians an air defense system of unprecedented sophistication, but also furnished ground-launched missiles that now present a serious threat even to American offshore naval power. And, having seen how inept the Syrians had been in June 1982, this time the Soviets are themselves operating this equipment with a force estimated at 8,000 combat Soviet personnel. In the opinion of experts, it will be four to five years before the Syrians will become fully capable of handling the new equipment.</p>
<p>This new degree of Soviet involvement raises serious questions. Thus far the Syrians have proved themselves quite independent of Soviet direction when it suited them. In fact, there is considerable evidence that the Soviet leadership has been quite unhappy over Assad's harsh treatment of Yassir Arafat, but Assad paid no attention to Soviet advice and the Soviets subsided.</p>
<p>For the time being, the Soviets are taking the long view. They enjoy being on the side of a winner and profit from the diminution of America's position as a result of America's expected failure in Lebanon. At the moment, therefore, it is inaccurate to treat Syria as simply a Soviet agent. If anything, the Syrian tail often wags the Soviet dog. But the predominant weight of the U.S.S.R. and its control over Syria's air defense and other missile systems will confront Syria and all Middle Eastern countries, as well as the United States, with a new range of problems and options that will be examined later in this article.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is he completely wrong? Sure he is oversimplifying a massively complex issue but the creation of Israel occurred in 1948 and the existence of a Jewish state in the middle east was a huge change in regional dynamics. I mean the last time a Jewish state existed there was in Roman times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, that was poor wording on my part. /u/seeasea is absolutely right that the special relationship started later. I should have said that everything <em>started</em> to change with the creation of Israel. It certainly wasn't an overnight shift. I also agree that Israel was part of a much larger game, but you're looking at it from a political perspective, and I'm taking a sociological perspective. Israel was a massive part of the shift in the American perception of the Middle East- the whole idea of Orientalism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a great documentary on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2704752/" target="_blank">netflix</a> about the creation of the Israeli air force in the 40s.  They basically had to steal US surplus transport planes and the fighters they had were Polish built Me-109s until the 50s.</p>
<p>There was really no love for Israel in America outside a few volunteers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US did have some early experiences with the Middle East. The decision to send US Navy brigs to aid in the Barbary wars against the Pirates and slavers in the Mediterranean was viewed as the first effort of the US to obtain international recognition as a nation capable of overseas influence. </p>
<p>In addition to this the cotton production in the Southern US which was heavily affected during the US Civil War, lead to the British Empire (then the primary market for American goods) to stimulate growth of cotton production in Egypt. Egyptian cotton remains today a decent material for clothing, but the American producers in addition to losing their cheap labour force (to put it in cold economic terms), lost their share of revenue to Middle Eastern goods entering the market. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pirate scholar here. The Barbay states aren't really the &quot;Middle East,&quot; and in the early nineteenth century they were understood to be a geographically and culturally distinct region from much of what we would today call the Middle East. What are today Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey were seen as less &quot;African&quot; than the Sultinates along the Barbary coast, in part due to their geographic proximity to Greece (and the Greco-Roman traditions, which were inherited from Arab scholars during the Renaissance), but also because of their differing roles in international trade (e.g., the Persian Gulf region was mor heavily influenced by British colonialism due to India, whereas the Barbary states were more influenced by France and Spain). </p>
<p>The Barbary Wars are related heavily to contemporary American anti-terrorism policy, both legally and culturally, but I don't see that relationship as cultural in the way that OP means it to be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the connection to the Middle East and North Africa comes from the way in which several cultural empires held North Africa as a series of client states. Roman,Byzantine, The Islamic &quot;Golden Age&quot; caliphates, and The Ottoman Empire, all held major influence over North Africa, before and after conversion to Islam. </p>
<p>During the Barbary Wars it was no different. The Ottomans were unquestionably waging a proxy war through their lax doctrine regarding piracy. Indeed it was a quick scheme to plunder and train experienced seamen. Whilst not geographically Middle Eastern, North Africa has long since been a part of the greater Islamic sphere of influence, whereas oddly, Indonesia and India never were, despite having a vastly greater Muslim population. As the question largely concerns perceptions of Islamic culture, which by it's own creed is supposed to unify all regional identities with one overbearing spiritual and legal bond, I would still say exposure to the Barbary States applies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>questions for a pirate scholar: to what extent were was the dey or other leadership beholden or accountable to ottoman authority? to what extent was pirate leadership religiously motivated? I know in the story of Jefferson's meeting with the London ambassador from one of the pirate states, he reports that the amabassador claimed religious authority to prey on american ships. was this common thinking in the barbary states? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I completely agree, the Barbary wars were definitely the first instance of US involvement. But for the purposes of this conversation, those experiences were not nearly as significant to American perception of the Middle East as was the post 1948 period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Barbary pirates included Europeans and Westerners, especially Protestants from Holland and Britain who were siding with them against the Catholic French and Spanish -- it was a Catholic French priest who portrayed the Barbary Pirates as proof of &quot;Islam versus West&quot; -- he was actually concerned about Protestants becoming allies with the Muslims, and he blamed it all on the Jews (because according to the Islamophobic thought at the time, Islam was a Jewish conspiracy) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of what you say is incorrect.</p>
<p>Israel is not and never has been &quot;anti-Islamic&quot;.</p>
<p>The US has <em>always</em> been involved with the ME and N Africa.  The Treaty of Tripoli was signed in 1796.  The First Barbary War was started in 1801, the second in 1815. In the 19th century the US had ties with Oman, Muscat (now part of Oman), and Persia (Iran).</p>
<p>Further, the rise in US involvement in the ME did not happen with the creation of Israel.  Hell, Israel leaned primarily on France.  The US became heavily involved with the ME by way of the Anglo-American Petroleum Agreement of 1944.  Even before then, the US had relations with the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>And you're missing out on the main reason the West had a different view of Islamic culture prior to, probably, the 70's and 80's.  People only come into contact with actual people back then.  By that I mean there was much less media, no internet, and a lot less travel.  People who travel are generally more interested in meeting people of other cultures.  Westerners who traveled to Islamic lands were predisposed to have a positive view.  Islamic people who traveled to Western lands were predisposed to be friendly and charming and interesting.  Certainly very few Islamic fundamentalists were visiting London.  I dare say none were going to the US.</p>
<p>I'm really surprised to see someone, in this era, refer to Orientalism and Edward Said as if it had any value.  The concept is grossly flawed and dismissive of Western scholarship, and Said primarily engaged in character assassination of anyone that didn't tow the line in his view of the Arab-Israeli conflict.  </p>
<p>This is a person that insists Hamas is not a terrorist organization.  This is a person that insists Hezbollah is not a terrorist organization.  This is a person who threw stones at Israeli soldiers, lied about it, and was encouraging his son to do the same.  This is a person who typifies the intellectually bankrupt &quot;professor&quot; more interested in converting students to his cause than teaching them find their own causes.  </p>
<p>The very fact that you discount all US interactions with the region prior to the existence of Israels tells the tale.  You've swallowed his poison.  You believe lies about the West because it suits your political perspective.</p>
<p>It's a shame, and he was a shameful person.  I have no doubt that he and his ilk have directly caused the deaths of innocents by encouraging such nonsense.</p></div>		</li>
