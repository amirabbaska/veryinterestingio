If I beat my girlfriend within an inch of her life, I'll probably get 10+ years in prison(I'm black) and dragged by every news station willing to show my face. If I am FAMOUS and RICH and I beat my girlfriend within an inch of her life, I'm Chris Brown. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is ridiculous. Charges should always be brought forth by the state, based exclusively on the result of the police investigation. Victims should be done with the investigation once the police have gotten everything they need from them. Trials should merely be a show-and-tell of evidence gathered. Live testimonies should never exist: you shouldn't be basing an accused's fate on the acting skills of some bloke who claims to have witnessed stuff.</p>
<p>Besides, the thought that private lawyers can be hired in criminal proceedings is preposterous. It literally gives an unfair advantage to wealthy people. It ought to be public defenders for everyone. Private lawyers only make sense in civil trials, where money is all that's in play. Criminal proceedings deal with human lives and dignity, and that shouldn't be for sale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what about when there's actually no question about whatever illegal activities they're there for? Like when whoever the hell does drugs on stage in front of thousands of people. Miley Cyrus maybe? No idea. But yeah. How can any lawyer or judge justify a lesser sentence when it's not only the crime itself, but y'know, maybe setting the example for viewers that not only is it okay to do but you can get away with it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's not my point. I'm using the example of one of these popular for 5 minutes artist doing drugs on stage. It is non-disputable. This illegal action took place in front of thousands of people, and was almost certainly recorded, documented, and probably appeared in the news in some fashion. So why, in most cases, AREN'T they given proper sentencing? What can a lawyer possibly do in this situation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about instances like the &quot;affluenza&quot; case? That seemed to not only be a result of better lawyers, but also simply the virtue of being wealthy. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly true. I was reacting more to the question of whether what was happening was about going outside the letter of the law. You're right, and one of the other posters mentioned, that often there are biases built into the law or the people who enforce the law that favor people who are better off.</p>
<p>The affluenza case is actually an interesting example, because there you had a lawyer coming up with a &quot;clever&quot; argument to exploit the laws understandably complex relationship to people who suffer from mental diseases that might be treatable. An argument a less effective lawyer might not have thought of, or had the resources to pursue (in the form of paying expert witnesses). </p>
<p>Another good example was the rape case from the summer, where the head of the rowing team got off light, in part it seemed because the judge identified with him, since he'd similarly been a captain at his school.  Now, it's not that poor people can't be team captains, but it shows how even the indirect effects of affluence can change outcomes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One theory about the affluenza case what the judge have him probation because he was a minor at the time so when he turned 18 there was a good chance he could get the rest of his sentence reduced, but with 10 years probation when he inevitably fucked up again he'd have to serve the entire sentence. </p></div>		</li>
