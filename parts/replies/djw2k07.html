			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, no. You could have a box of mirrors that would reflect the light and only absorb a fraction of a percent of the light after each bounce. Unfortunately, light travels so fast that even if the mirror was <em>very</em> good and absorbed 0.001% of the light after each bounce, it would still be completely absorbed in microseconds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But would the room get brighter the more reflective the walls get even without changing the light source? Kind of like residence time in a lake or how CO2 causes global warming by simply bouncing the infrared radiation around a bit more?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Such a &quot;room&quot; is an optical cavity, typically consisting of two mirrors that trap the light between them. However, this won't trap the light indefinitely as you can't make a perfectly reflecting mirror. If you keep shining light into it the amount of light will keep building up until the amount that leaks out equals the amount you're shining in. It is possible to make cavities in which the light does hundreds of thousands of round trips before it leaves, so the light intensity inside can be extremely high.</p>
<p>Lasers also operate, in part, on this principle. You have a cavity that traps the light, while it interacts with an amplifying medium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why it get so hot is not due to the light itself, but the lightbulb. Incadescent lights are really an heater that have a defect that create light. Only about 5% of the energy is turned into light, the remaining 95% is directly gone as heat. Leds is 4-5 times more efficient, so still only about 25% in light and 75% in heat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is true of any bulb. Its just that more efficient lights generally produce equal light and use less power.</p>

<p>that 5w LED bulb is 420 lumens which is about 0.61488w of light production.</p>
<p>Even LED bulbs are only about 12% efficient as light sources</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, 100W incadescent produce 95W of heat and 5W of light that turn into 5W heat, ending up with 100W of heat.</p>
<p>A 15W led still produce lots of heat directly, probably still about 10W in direct heat and only 5W in light, which turn to 5W of heat, for a total of 15W of heat.</p>
<p>The heat from the light itself is the same, but the total heat is less with led.</p>
<p>I can tell you that when I switched the kitchen lights for leds one, I noticed a difference in the room temperature... 4x88W (the 100W are rated at 130V, they give 88W at 120V... those liars) vs 4x13W. Very nice in summer, meh in winter (we electrically heat here, the baseboard heater need to heat more now).</p></div>		</li>

<p>He's saying that very little of a light bulb's energy is actually released as light. Most of the energy light bulbs consume is released directly as heat without ever being light.</p>
<p>Yes the light becomes heat energy, but most of the heat released by light bulbs is released directly as heat and not indirectly as light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There would also be other factors in an unventilated studio that would be more responsible for heat. There are the people in the room. Heat from electrical devices. These all add up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually a clever way of saying it. The walls are only energetic enough to re-emit infrared light, so we would feel the 'brighter' as warmer.</p></div>		</li>
