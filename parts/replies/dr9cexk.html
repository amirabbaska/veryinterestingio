			<div class="markdown"><p>It means the rules set to keep ISPs from doing wherever the fuck they want do not exist anymore.
Last spring, Swedes got a tantalizing offer: If they subscribed to Swedenâ€™s biggest telecom provider, Telia Company AB, they could have unlimited access on their mobile phones to Facebook, Spotify, Instagram and other blockbuster apps.
Such deals will definitely gain moment as soon as the Ajit-ation Pie-s down.
After all ISPs have spent some $30M lobbying to get where we are today, they are looking to atleast break even. Also remember Murphy's Law.</p>
<p>So it can mean an economic disaster or nothing much, you'll find out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The catch is, it's great for Spotify, but it's really bad for a new startup trying to compete with Spotify.  Imagine a new app comes out called Yog, which is better than Spotify in every way.  But it doesn't get the same unlimited access deal from the ISP, so nobody wants to switch to it.  Spotify doesn't have to innovate or update at all; they keep their customers simply because they've got a sweet deal with the ISP.  Yog goes out of business.  Innovation stalls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds awesome, which adds to the troublesome nature of it:</p>
<p>If you have such packages, and someone comes up with Spotify/Facebook, but better, who would use the better service when it's not included in the Internet Experience as ISP dictates it?</p>
<p>This means nobody can compete with these services. And without competition, these companies can do pretty much whatever the heck they want, because this move means consumers no longer have option to switch to any competing services(which get killed by moves like this).</p>
<p>In the short term, it's awesome for users, since you get very cheap access to these good services. In the long term, you lose ability to switch to, or create, competition to these services, and all the market forces that previously worked to ensure that these services are good at what they do, are gone. Without net neutrality or equivalent, what are you gonna do about this predictable development into totally closed non-competitive system dominated by a handful of megacorporations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is particularly bad in a country like America. While America is by no means the only country that has its politics influenced greatly by businesses it is one of the worst examples.</p>
<p>With the power they have just given he already notoriously bad American ISPs they now have a new bargaining chip when talking to members of congress etc of 'if you don't vote this way we will ensure that anyone that googles you will only be allowed access to sites that paint you in a negative light'. And it will be perfectly legal.</p>
<p>Knowledge is the most powerful currency and the ISPs now control the way in which current generations access data that informs their knowledge (because lets be honest who goes to a library and finds a book about it anymore). This has massive ramifications in terms of influencing the populous. </p></div>		</li>
