			<div class="markdown"><p>I can expand on the electronic slates. They typically have a timecode generator in them so you can do a timecode jam with all of your cameras and audio recorder. That way any point in time on the recording will be be the exact same time on any other recording. </p>
<p>So say you know the clap on the slate is at 1min, 10sec, frame4. Your audio can be quickly synced using the timecode embedded into the audio recording rather than by viewing waveforms. </p>
<p>Others might know more about it, but that is the basics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes more sense actually. Syncing to exact frames would be more accurate than by waveforms, especially since different audio formats can do weird things and like, idk, last longer than another form.  </p>
<p>Didn't describe that very well... sometimes you might have, say, an mp3 audio format that lasts 1:40 and some other format like aac that's also 1:40, but when you stick them on your timeline, for whatever reason, one will be slightly stretched out longer. Think it has something to do with how some programs handle different formats, and it's an easy fix, but, ya know, having an exact frame sync helps.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks a lot, you're amazing! For someone who is unfamiliar with video editing the other comments are not helpful. How was I supposed to know that video and audio need syncing in professional productions let alone how syncing actually happens? </p>
<p>This was the reply I was looking for and I greatly appreciate you taking time to explain. </p></div>		</li>
