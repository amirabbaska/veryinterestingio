<p>It's just not worth it to make other denominations, because you won't be able to cash them in. Remember when the guy ripped of Ceasar's (I think it was craps) on the bike and got away? The casinos' just changed out all of the high denomination chips right away. You can't even really steal enough to make it worth it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think I saw a thing about him on tv a while back. Didn't the casino folk essentially admit that they couldn't tell which tokens were his and which ones were theirs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, I've never sen a fake chip in my career.  Fake bills we see a couple times a year, but we catch more than we take in.  Counterfeits are painfully obvious most of the time.  You have to remember that casino employees see/feel hundreds of bills a day.  Most counterfeits I've come across I didn't even need to look at the bill because it <em>felt</em> wrong, looking just confirmed it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never encountered a fake chip.  I have encountered people stealing real chips, however.  If it gives you any idea as to how well our internal controls work, I've never seen anyone who stole chips make it to cash them out.  We rarely catch them when they steal; instead, they return to cash out and are arrested on the spot for the multiple crimes they've committed.  It's not the movie Casino, but it'll be embarrassing when three rent-a-cops (I'm under no delusions here, I'm aware that I'm basically Paul Blart...) put you in handcuffs and take you up to a detainment room.  The Nevada Gaming Control Board takes these issues quite seriously, and will happily prosecute the living hell out of anyone attempting to counterfeit a gaming device (chip, dice, cards).<br />
I encounter fake money regularly, we just usually have deputies come out and cite/arrest depending on the amount, and the funny money ends up with the Secret Service.</p></div>		</li>
