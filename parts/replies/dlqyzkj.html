			<div class="markdown"><p>They do, but you're limited on how much 100 QA testers will find in 2 months. 100,000 players will find far rarer bugs than QA ever could. 10,000,000 players will find some very specific and difficult to produce bugs</p>
<p>Testing is done to find gross problems and common issues, some uncommon issues will be missed, and rare issues will definitely be missed</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a hugely understated part of the problem. I can create a bug list a mile long in a matter of days, but it takes much more time and effort (and skill) to reprogram, compile, retest, etc. Many times on a short schedule you take care of big bugs that are functional problems and live with the small ones. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Imagine instead of playing Zelda 64, you walked around the edges of each environment</p>
<p>You would then have to report the bug, as well as the conditions that caused it</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah it's crazy how some people figure out stuff like that. This is still my favorite video along those lines, a guy beating <a href="https://youtu.be/kpk2tdsPh0A" target="_blank">Watch for Rolling Rocks on Mario 64 only using 0.5x A presses</a>. It's a must watch from beginning to end if you're into glitches. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer is that games can use event flags to store where the player is at any moment in the story, like event flag 01 means the player has beaten the first boss 02 for the second and so on and so forth with the last value used being the ending or the credits. </p>
<p>These flags are usually in set places and do not move, if there is an adjacent value in memory for something else (like # of items in slot 99) you just overflow that and it spills into the next spot in memory (where event flags are stored). If that overflowed bit matches the end credit flag the game will begin the credit sequence</p>
<ul>
<li>255 items in slot 99 next to the event flag would be : FF 00</li>
<li>300 items in slot 99 when it's only set to hold 255 looks like: 12 C0    with the event flag being rewritten to value C0 as we can't store 300 in two digit hex</li>
</ul></div>		</li>
