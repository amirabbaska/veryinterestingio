<p>You have so much to live for- flowers you've never smelled, songs yet to be written, countries you haven't yet traveled to, books you haven't read, instruments you've never played, bands you haven't seen live, art you haven't yet created, stories you haven't yet told, people you haven't made smile. You never know just how much you'll be missing. Even if at the time it might seem pointless to wait for such trivial things, it's these things that make life worth living.</p>

<p>Fuck man, these lines brought me to tears. Especially these ones:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>instruments you've never played, bands you haven't seen live, art you haven't yet created, stories you haven't yet told, people you haven't made smile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm someone who has been trying to play the guitar for a few months but just stopped when my university classes started, I've <em>never</em> been on a concert of a band I wanted to see, and I have so many artistic things I'd like to learn. I want to paint, I want to draw, I want to make music and I want to write and tell stories; I want people to enjoy life when I find it so hard to enjoy it myself. And I've done <strong>nothing</strong> to get there.</p>
<p>My therapist has recently suggested me to go to a psychiatrist, I always thought it'd be like cheating and I'd never learn anything but this just... It feels like this was written for me and... I don't know... This has been a hard decision for me to make.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey Internet friend! I was going to reply to the person above you but decided to talk to you instead. I've been battling depression for most of my life and finally decided to go talk to a psychiatrist and get medication about a year ago and man, has it made a difference. Before mediating I felt like I was watching everyone else enjoy their lives and be successful and it just looked so impossible. I thought, &quot;If I could only feel half that well, I'd be ok.&quot; </p>
<p>It took a couple tries to find the right combination of meds that work for me but, Holy shit, I wouldn't go back for the world. I remember the first day where I just kind of started doing chores and getting things done. It was almost surreal. I was like, &quot;So this is what it feels like to be normal? To just be able to want to do things and then just do them and enjoy them?&quot; It brought me to tears. </p>
<p>Anyway, I'm rambling. From one depressed person to another, go talk to a psychiatrist. It really does make a difference. Best of luck out there, friend! It gets better, I promise. It's not easy, in fact most of it sucks, but it does get better. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey! You know the rambling isn't that bad, it kinda feels like the advice you'd get from a friend who is being sincere to you and I really appreciate your sincerity and joyfulness.</p>
<p>And yeah it absolutely gets better, back in school I used to be known as, no joke, 'the kid who never smiled', I was shy as hell, and didn't know how to hold a conversation with someone.</p>
<p>Now I can confidently say I can smile in many situations, I can hold a conversation, speak in public, I have incredible friends, a semi-active social life, and accepted long ago my own shyness and social awkwardness. There are still a lot of things that I can't do, but I've learned it can take <em>years</em> of small steps and that is okay.</p>
<p>So, I suppose this will be the next one. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a bit embarrassed, I'm more ashamed I suppose, but i don't even know how to ask for help. </p>
<p>Iv been to a psychologist before, and he suggested a different way of thinking, and that helped when things were good but when things get bad... I try so hard to think positive, to do right things, to stay active.</p>
<p>Then I have the terrible thoughts.</p>
<p>I make more mistakes.</p>
<p>I sit at home on my computer.</p>
<p>^(For ^^18+ ^^hours)</p>
<p>when I know I would enjoy other things, friends, the guitar, my family, my girlfriend.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to tear myself down I'm just being honest... because I know I'm depressed but I don't know what to do next. I'm scared, lost, and I feel helpless. </p>
<p>I guess what I'm asking for is resources. I've never been suggested that I may need antidepressants, but after this post, I understand what I have is manageable. And I want to be rid of these feelings. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm so glad my story was able to help you! If you, or anyone else in this thread, ever want to talk I'm always here for you. When it comes to art, my philosophy is that it doesn't necessarily matter how many people see it as long as you've created it. With my music, writing, and art, I don't care if it reaches one person or a thousand; I just want to make something that means something. Going to a psychiatrist is a great way to get the ball rolling on your mental health- even if you don't end up getting a prescription, or end up not liking the meds you're on, it's still taking those steps to self care. The way I figure, if you don't have to feel that way, why should you? Is it really cheating to get that leg up into your own recovery? If so, who would you be cheating? Meds aren't necessarily the only answer, or even a permanent choice. Some people can take meds for a few months while they learn the skills they need in therapy, then go off of them once they stabilize. Some people can take them during stressful times of their life, but once things calm down don't have to stick with them forever. Meds are a very individualized experience, and they work differently for everyone. </p>
<p>Edit: In 2013, my favorite band broke up 6 months after I missed my chance to see them live. Tonight, I'm seeing their rhythm guitarist's new band. Don't give up hope, you'll be able to see the artists you like in time. I recommend looking online for upcoming concerts in your city- half the time you don't even realize how many awesome artists are around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your story is very inspiring and struck a cord in my heart. I love how passionately you talk about music and art. I'm a music lover and try my best to travel to see as much music as I can. I've been fighting my inner demons for about 8 years now with the last 7 months being unemployed and I miss seeing music. I'm so glad you got to see a part of your favorite band in a new project!!! Thank you for the hope I got from reading your posts. Much love.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, for both the encouragement and sharing your story. </p>
<p>The reason I've always felt that I'd be cheating is mostly because of my own stubborness. It's kinda like as if I couldn't overcome my own demons by myself and that it doesn't have any merit if I did with meds. I wouldn't have learned anything, I wouldn't get stronger and I wouldn't grow. I'd be going through a cheap shortcut into fake joyfulness from forcing certain neurotransmiters into behaving in specific ways. What if I end up addicted and dependent on them? What if I can't achieve <em>true</em> happiness that comes from me and not from a bunch of pills? I want to prove to myself that I'm capable.</p>
<p>It's as if I was overweight, then instead of learning about nutrition and exercise just took a drug to shed off a bunch of weight. I would have learned nothing, and would probably come back to my previous state in less than a month. Of course, <em>I have nothing agaisnt those who choose to do these kind of things</em>, this is a personal opinion based on <em>me</em>, and I also understand that it is okay to need and ask for help... But this is a feeling that I just can't shake off. Even if I'm currently leaning towards trying out psychiatry thanks to you and the other people who have replied to me.</p>
<p>Talking about art and creating things, I've always felt that if I were to make art, but never show it, it would be practically the same as if I never made it. One of the main reasons I stopped writing (I used to write a lot years ago) because I felt nobody would read anything or simply put, I wasn't good enough. How can I get past that?</p>
<p>Oh and funny thing about concerts, last time I had a band I genuinely wanted to see (Explosions In The Sky) came for the first time to my country (Chile) in 16 years in a small show inside an expensive music festival, so I haven't had much luck with that, lol, but you've honestly have given me a suggestion I've never thought of. I'll look up if there's any concerts in the future.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you so much for sharing your story, thank you for being open for conversation, and thank you for telling me your thoughts. Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not cheating to use the tools at your disposal. Go for it! See the psychiatrist and make the little changes one at a time til you can do those things you always wanted. </p>
<p>It's never too late to do them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It scares me to think that you still have suicidal thoughts despite coming so far. I get excited when I go a day or a week without the thought coming to mind. I was seriously hoping that someday I'll never think about killing myself....but apparently depression is a persistent shadow.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a time when the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away.&quot; </p>
<p>I'll never be the person I used to be...I was always melodramatic, hopeless romantic and an introvert...but my personality, sense of humor and confidence used to actually exist outwardly....now anytime I try to express a similar mindset I end up feeling like an egomaniac instead of confidence.  Instead of saying the first thing that comes to my mind I think about the probable responses to it and what others will think about it..&quot;is what I'm saying witty, is it funny, or am I going to just get another blank stare? Better to just keep my mouth shut.&quot;</p>
<p>Sorry, just had to say some of that. ...I never talk to anyone irl about this stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does vary. I've never actually attempted suicide but the thoughts were there. The medication (citalopram) helps me a lot and helps me to recognize and cope with any symptoms as well. </p>
<p>But the bad thoughts do come back from time to time, usually just briefly. The main difference is now I know they will pass and can deal with them better. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get pissed off at myself when the thought of suicide pops up....it will be completely random, driving my car and all of a sudden &quot;you should just crash into that guard rail.&quot; </p>
<p>Had a good night out with a couple of friends and had some drinks?  &quot;I better finish the night off with thinking about my self worth.&quot; </p>
<p>So it pisses me off that these thoughts come to mind, then I get frustrated with myself and then it's just recycled emotions like &quot;what's wrong with me, why do I have to be like this.&quot; Yadda yadda</p>
<p>One step at a time a guess...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also take Citalopram. I have for the past two years. It feels a lot 'clearer' in my head with the 'brain fog' and I agree that it works well with symptoms. </p>
<p>I used to take Effexor, that stuff is actually terrible. It added to the 'brain fog' it made me feel worse and often deflated my mood and on top I started getting memory problems which hasn't been resolved since I stopped the medication. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent post.  I have a very similar story, and have had a hard time explaining to people the key to that moment when I realized that how I had been taught to live - by my parents, by society, even by my friends - simply wasn't going to work for me.  That searching for gleeful happiness was part of the problem - everything I did to chase it down failed, which made me feel even worse, made me feel that the one thing I was supposed to want was never going to happen for me, and it was my own fault.  I was going to kill myself, but then my best friend killed <em>himself</em>.  I got to see first hand that his family didn't just get over his death after a while, like I had thought my family would.  I experienced how <em>I</em> didn't just move on from his death like I had thought he would when I died.  I couldn't put my Dad through the pain I was feeling.</p>
<p>So instead, for 10 years I lived daily life as much as I had to, but really spent it observing life and re-inventing my understanding of it.   I joined a monastery and studied another 6 years as a layman pupil (didn't live on-site, didn't shave my head).  Those were among the best years of my life, in large part because I wasn't trying to chase my own happiness.  I was working hard and helping people; volunteering to help others, and training constantly to help myself.  Medication was critical to giving me the chance to learn meditation; meditation is what focused me enough to learn how to change myself.</p>
<p>But even that doesn't mean I'm now a bubbly, happy forest bunny, twirling around with flowers in my hair either.  Depression is still there, because that's how my brain chemistry works.  It doesn't rule my life anymore, and I rarely fall into cyclical depressive spirals.  I recognize when those are starting, and don't allow myself to feed them by indulging in self-damaging thoughts, instead observing them and neither trying to suppress them or latching on to them.  I can and would fully experience the negative emotional landscape without any effort if I let myself.  I have to focus to realize and experience the good and happy emotions which do occur.  They just aren't as strong as they are in most people, so it takes practice to notice them when they are present.  After decades of living without experiencing much happiness, it does take practice to retrain yourself how to be happy, or even just how to be not depressed.</p>
<p>One side effect of this being out of practice with happiness I now recognize in many others with long term depression: because I was well practiced in being frustrated with myself, and very out of practice in being happy with myself, I mis-read those cues in other people.  When someone was frustrated with me, I fully realized it, and even unintentionally exaggerated that frustration in my own mind.  When someone was happy with me, I either missed it, or failed to remember it when thinking back later.  My depression had warped my ability to know my importance to family and friends, and made me feel like I was nothing but a burden to them.</p></div>		</li>
