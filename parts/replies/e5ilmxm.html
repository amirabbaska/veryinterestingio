			<div class="markdown"><p>The use of &quot;space&quot; here is not in the sense such as the area outside of Earth's atmosphere, it refers instead simply to a volume of area. Bending space can be difficult to understand but the general idea is that in bent space angles don't work like you would expect. Straight lines aren't straight from outside perspectives, meaning objects can change their paths despite never actually doing so from their perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just an example for clarity:  If you walk in a straight line on Earth, due East, you will eventually come back to where you started.  From your perspective, looking at a compass with only N E S W, this seems odd.  All you did was walk in a straight line.  But a different perspective says that the line was not straight at all - it was a circle.  Because the Earth is a sphere, its surface is curved, and thus &quot;due East&quot; is curved.</p>
<p>&quot;Curved space&quot; is kinda like that.  You can be traveling in what you <em>think</em> is a straight line, but to an outside observer is actually curved.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Space is full of gasses and all kinds of stuff that we can see with different sensors, like X-Ray, Infra Red, Radio, etc.. When you combine all of those together, space actually looks like a huge sea of clouds of many different colors, elements, sounds, signals, and so on. The visible light spectrum is only something like (not exact) .1% of the universe. Then what we can detect is still really small, which is why dark matter and dark energy fills in the other some 90+% gaps. Personally I think it could be multiple things we just don't know how to see/detect, and not just one &quot;dark matter.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you draw a straight line on a piece of paper, then bend that paper, the line appears to bend with it when viewed from the outside, despite still being perfectly straight in the context of the paper itself. It's kind of like that, but way more complicated, because you're dealing with four dimensions (3 space + 1 time) instead of two (x + y).</p>
<p>Space here doesn't refer to &quot;outer space&quot;, it refers to the fabric of space and time itself that contains the entirety of the universe, including outer space, Earth, etc. It's more like a coordinate system. Gravity bends all these coordinate axes (even time) like the paper above, making things move in ways you wouldn't expect them to in a normal &quot;flat&quot; space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem here is that space isnt a fabric. Its literally so empty that there is nothing in it when it is empty, how can you bend nothing? You are imagining space as something you can bend and this is the error. You are imagining space as a subtle object because only objects can be bent, thus the fabric analogy. All objects whether subtle or gross by definition exist in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is difficult to understand how 3D space can be curved.</p>
<p>To explain that what I do is <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3y3aCb0" target="_blank">I reduce the dimension into 2D</a>.</p>
<p>You will see a 2D middle cut of a 3D situation on the top and a top-down 2D projection of the situation on the bottom. It's a surface with a cylinder in the middle to house a golf ball. There is a golf ball on the surface. The weight of the cylinder is 0 at the first situation. So when we hit the ball it rolls straight on that surface.</p>
<p>Now in the 2nd situation the cylinder is heavy and it <del>m</del>bends the surface, so the center of the surface is below zero. When we hit the ball in that situation because the surface is curved on the 3rd dimension ( Z axis ) the ball will go and make a turn on the top-down projection.</p>
<p>However, a person, who only understands 2-dimensional space will be confused. There is no such thing as &quot;weight&quot;, nothing pulls anything down, because &quot;down&quot; is part of the 3-dimensional space. So the 2D person will have no idea why the hell that damn ball is turning and what is pulling that ball to the center of the surface. He does not see the curve, because it only occurs on Z-axis, in the 3D space.</p>
<p>We understand 3D and we know about mass. And we also know that if the object has no mass it will not be pulled towards anything. So we are, obviously, surprised to see that the light is &quot;turning&quot; when a massive object passes across the sky. Why is the light pulled towards that object if the light is weightless?</p>
<p>Because the object is so massive, the space around it is bend in 4th dimension. We can't see that dimension, so it's difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>So, just like a pull of the cylinder creates a sort of a &quot;well&quot; around it in 3D imagine now that a weight of a planet creates a &quot;well&quot; in 4D around it. This well is impossible to see in a 3D projection just like it's impossible to see the 3D well in a 2D top-down projection.</p>
<p>I know it's not 5y.o. friendly at all. Sorry about that.</p></div>		</li>
