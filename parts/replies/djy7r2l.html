<p>If you want to get all technical about it, the reason for this radical change is down to the fact that the sky today is extremely different to how it was thousands of years ago, which makes sense.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's due to the precession of the Earth's axial tilt. It takes about 26,000 years to complete a cycle (IIRC). That means the constellations will appear to shift at a rate of one per 2,200 years. </p>
<p>It's been somewhere around 2,000 years since astrology was made up, so in that time the constellations have shifted by almost a whole month.</p></div>		</li>
