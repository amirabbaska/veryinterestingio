			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. It's hard to know where to start on this comment, which is plain wrong in a number of ways. One thing that is right, though, is that SSRIS's method of action alters the signals between neurons that depends on the neurotransmitter serotonin. </p>
<p>The 'serotonin hypothesis' as it is known has been around for over two decades, and was the main explanation for SSRI's mechanism of action for a long time. It rests on the assumption that serotonin is downregulated in people who suffer symptoms of depression, so that SSRIs work by increasing levels of serotonin in the brain. However, despite millions of dollars and years of research, there has been no empirical evidence to show that serotonin levels in depressed people is lower than in those who are not depressed.</p>
<p>There's lots on the web, but here's a good place to start on the serotonin hypothesis, which is now a source of embarrassment to those who once espoused it:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/charting-the-depths/201007/the-serotonin-theory-depression-is-collapsing" target="_blank">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/charting-the-depths/201007/the-serotonin-theory-depression-is-collapsing</a></p>
<p>In part, researchers have failed to find out the mechanism of action because the neurotransmitter system is so complex. Serotonin function is not just about how much serotonin we have in the brain. It depends on the strength of the signal that is being sent, using serotonin from one neuron to another. In turn this rests on three things: the amount of serotonin released from terminal that is sending the signal, the period of time the serotonin spends in gap between the neurons (the synapse) and the number of receptors on the receiving neuron (its sensitivity). </p>
<p>These three factors are related in a way that promotes homeostatic stability, so that that artificially changing the levels of serotonin produced and reabsorbed (e.g. by by taking SSRIs) will gradually affect the number of receptors in the neuron receiving the signal, and artificially maintaining higher levels of serotonin in the synapse can reduce prediction and release in the neuron sending the signal.</p>
<p>Researchers have found many strange things while trying to find out how SSRIs work. One study found that serotonin function is actually reduced in the first two weeks that they take to start having noticeable effects. Other research has found that SSRIS neither upregulate  nor down regulate serotonin release, but rather regulate it it and provide greater stability. </p>
<p>As was posted below, SSRIS can have strong withdrawal effects precisely because the brain adapts its serotonin function (production, reuptake, receptors) in an attempt to maintain its previous homeostatic state. The drugs, in effect, have altered your normal resting state, and withdrawal period occurs as your body adjusts serotonin system to its original functional state (the same is true for all psychoactive, such as the massive let down following ecstasy and the horrible withdrawal from heroin).</p>
<p>As for side effects vs. efficacy, the latest large scale meta-analysis found that side-effects, in general, outweighed the small, sub-clinical positive effects of SSRIs that were reported in RCTs that compared it to placebo: </p>

<p>As for the effect on people who are not depressed, as has been posted above, most people on SSRIs should probably not be on them, due to massive overdiagnosis. SSRIs have been shown to be most effective in severe Major Depressive Episodes, with diminishing positive effects in cases of less severe depression. Unfortunately, the dependence and withdrawal seem to be the same for all, so be aware of the positive and negatives of these drugs, be informed and ask your MD lots of difficult questions. </p>
<p>Sorry. Time for bed in Australia. If this conversation is still going tomorrow morning, would love to hear more thoughts....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, you'd have to take it regularly for it to work. </p>
<p>One pill of antidepressents wont change your behavior or how you feel. </p>
<p>It takes upwards of 3-4 weeks for the initial effects to kick in and up to 12 for the full effects. </p>
<p>Some SSRIs require at least two stages of dosing to get the effects. </p>
<p>The fun thing about SSRI (this is anecdotal) in my experience they make you feel terrible for the first few weeks you take them. In Fact, it exacerbated my depression or feeling just awful. It goes away after a week or two, and when the medication works its like a light switch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the theory that SSRIs work by restoring serotonin balance has been disproven. Current theories are that it helps rebuild hippocampus which has been damaged. </p></div>		</li>
