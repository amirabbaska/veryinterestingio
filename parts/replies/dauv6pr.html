			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true, I had understood the question to mean electricity consumption, which is around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption#Energy_supply.2C_consumption_and_electricity" target="_blank">6.7*10^19  J</a>, about a quarter of the amount you quoted.  But you are quite right it says energy. </p>
<p>Still I agree the amount is much closer than I had imagined.  Given that reactor efficiency is likely quite low (say 30% maximum) the reactors could produce closer to 20% of the Helium we use.  Although collecting it would be non-trivial, it might not be economically to do so.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's another bigger problem with this. Any type of fusion reactor is probably going to use huge superconducting magnets. Guess what these are cooled with? That's right, liquid helium!</p>
<p>In fact, the new ITER project will have the <a href="https://www.iter.org/newsline/251/1431" target="_blank">largest liquid helium plant</a> ever built.</p>
<p>It's possible that  fusion reactor will probably end up going through more helium than it produces!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the helium be reusable in this case? You'd only need the initial helium and then maybe some top ups for loss to the environment no? </p></div>		</li>
