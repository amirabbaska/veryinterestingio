			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't see any sorts of adornment, tools, or ritual items buried definitively with humans until behaviorally modern humans emerged in Africa. Until then it seems to have been practical, though we can't say for certain.</p>
<p>Many researchers in the field believe that the same change allowing behaviorally modern humans to spread rapidly, also allowed them to begin making artwork, and burying the dead with religious connotations, but some evidence regarding neanderthal artwork has emerged that may challenge that hypothesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just got out of my anthropology class an hour ago and we were talking about exactly this. Some Neanderthals before &quot;modern humans&quot; actually did bury their dead with artifacts. For example, one site was found where an older Neanderthal (about 40 y/o) was buried. His family tucked him into the fetal position, covered him with animal hide, and placed flowers and stone tools in the grave. The only reason we know about the flowers is a high concentration of pollen in the burial site.</p>
<p>More interestingly, it seems that by examining this skeleton we actually discovered a little bit about Neanderthal culture. It was very rare for a Neanderthal to survive to see their grandchildren; most families were two generational simply due to their lifespan. However, the remains of this specimens revealed that he was disabled. He was blind in one eye, and for the last month's of his life was very likely immobile. However, his remains don't suggest that he died from starvation or similar. This leads anthropologists to believe that his family stayed with him and took care of him until he died, even delaying their migration by several months to do so. This shows that Neanderthals had a much greater emotional capacity than we once thought.</p>
<p>The tools, flowers, and even food that was buried with Neanderthals gives us some insight into what they thought about an afterlife. They did not know what happened after death, but they thought that the next world might be similar to this one, and that could be why they prepared the dead with tools and food for their new journey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May I ask what about burying the dead with religious reasoning would have allowed for spreading more rapidly or what it had to do with artwork? My apologies if I misunderstood what you were meaning. I'm always very interested in ancient religions and burials and pick up whatever info I can, when I can. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't it agriculture? People learned to farm and raise livestock instead of hunting packs of animals over large distances or searching for berries that needed to be consumed or would spoil quickly. Therefore they started spending more time in one location. That gave them more time to do things other than just survive. That also made leaving bodies around a bit of a health hazard/gross.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some cultures still bring out the dead at certain times of the year for celebration.  One reason to bury is to prevent predators/scavengers from desecrating the body (eating it).  It might not have been done for closure, as there may not have been the concept of closure (can you ever really forget a loved one?), but more out of respect.  Emotionally motivated for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't hold for all cultures, burial practices of Neolithic Orkney were quite different. It is thought there that corpses were left in the air and the bones were only stored in tombs when nothing else was left after decay and exposure to predators.</p>
<p>Note that we don't know this for sure, from the remains left we can conclude that their burial practices must have been very unusual compared to today's.</p>
<p>Edit: just see /u/meelawsh noted that sky burials also occured in some other cultures in completely different parts of the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most ironic example of Survivor Bias. If the culture didn't do any to honor the dead, they left behind nothing for archeologists to find, so the cultures that we know about the burial rituals of must have honored their dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah. </p>
<p>First, your claim would only be true of prehistoric societies which left literally nothing besides their gravesites and, second, those don't exist. At minimum, we could find stone tools and uncared-for bones and, further, we could find a geographical area where decades or centuries of excavations have found no burials during the range of X years.</p>
<p>The burials are certainly easier for the grad students to process (farmer finds human remains and calls cops, cops find they're old enough to ignore, someone calls the university) but it wouldn't be impossible to hypothesize on antimortuary societies, just impossible to be final on the topic. (Your peers would always snark that some site could be discovered.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just curious, if a culture were not honouring their dead, how would they deal with the body? Leave it lying where it fell? Is any action towards a body 'honouring' it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Frequently positioning in the site is a good indicator.  Humans who just fall over and die in place will do so in a certain way and their bones will lie in a manner which you can tell this happened.</p>
<p>People who were moved, but deposited in a heap somewhere with little care will have some signs they were moved after death but without burial or concern.  </p>
<p>Those who were buried, even without religious significance or special grave/tomb goods, will generally be positioned in a particular way by those burying them, depending on culture.  Arms crossed in a certain way while laid out, or in a crouched position for those buried in that way.  </p>
<p>You will also see actual burials as part of a burial ground.  So, if you find many such individual or paired graves, as opposed to a huge pit with lots of bones, you have evidence of careful burial.</p>
<p>The context of the find does matter, of course, and some natural deaths can mimic burial and vice versa, but especially if you find the bodies amongst other bodies (as opposed to single bodies with no other bones), you can usually figure out what happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many cultures that practiced ritual burial would bury the dead with specific trinkets or perhaps a funerary shroud. Prehistoric bodies have been found buried with tools or the mandibles of other animals or with their bones treated with colored pollen. This of course evolved into burying bodies with items of value like coins or jewels and the like. For bodies found without any specific accouterments, I would defer to the great answer by /u/OhNoTokyo </p></div>		</li>
