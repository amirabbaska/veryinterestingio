			<div class="markdown"><p>The Monty Hall Problem.  </p>
<p>It's a matter of sets being non-intuitive.  </p>
<p>There a goat behind one door. There's cars behind other doors.  You can't afford the taxes and there's no cash option so you want the goat.  </p>
<p>You know what, I might not have that right </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are three doors. Behind one is a Brand New Car! Behind the others are goats.</p>
<p>You pick a door at random, let's call it door A, and the host of the game show reveals that behind door B is a goat, then offers you a choice:</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want to keep door A, or switch to door C?&quot;</p>
<p>Your chances APPEAR to be 50/50, since you're picking between two options, however switching gives you a 2/3 chance of ending up driving away with a Camaro instead of a Burro.</p>
<p>This is the Monty Hall problem, named after the host of the TV Game Show that used this concept</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are presented with 3 doors. Behind 1 of the doors is a price, the other 2 are empty. You get to choose 1 door, but are not yet allowed to open it. Now the game host opens one of the two remaining doors, revealing that it’s empty.
He now offers you to change your decision and take what’s behind the other remaining shut door instead of the one you choose first.
The question is should you accept the offer, stay with your original choice or doesn’t it make a difference either way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point is that the decision only matters because you’re certain that the removed door is a goat door. If the removed door could be the car door, then switching has no impact on probability. That’s what I mean: the certainty of the door removed being similar to the certainty of the marbles not being the red one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep if you do the same trick but nobody reveals the color of their ball until everyone has drawn, it's easier to understand why the probability remains the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And just like the monty hall problem, this can be made much simpler by changing the number of marbles.</p>
<p>Let's say there are two marbles and two people. Does it matter who goes first? First person has a 50% chance of getting the red one. Second person has the other 50%.</p>
