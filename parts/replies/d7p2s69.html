			<p>To add on, a lot of streams and rivers will have areas more or less sheltered from the current. Sometimes rocks or ledges, sometimes vegetation. I'd be surprised if there was a species that was constantly swimming against the current.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, it is. u/DeformedElephant is a bit mis-informed, not all fish constantly swim against the current. Maybe some do, but the only thing I can think of is a salamander species that only lives in a handful of waterfalls and they don't swim as much as grip the rock face.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think we also need to remember that the current is not always as strong on the bottom of the water as it is towards the top. Fish hold behind rocks, in back eddies, below soft riffles, and in the soft pockets of water next to a current (called seams). </p>		</li>

			<p>Also the current near the banks tends to be less than in the middle of the river. That is why steamboats on the Mississippi used to go down river in the middle and hug the banks on the trip back up. </p>		</li>

			<p>Why would the current be stronger on top than on the bottom of the river?<br><br>I just assumed current = water movement from a higher potential energy to lower potential energy (uphill to downhill).</p>		</li>

			<p>Fluid dynamics. There is a very common, almost universally accepted assumption called the no-slip condition, that says that an infinitely thin layer of liquid in direct contact with a solid (river bottom or sides) doesn't move. From there, you can logically conclude that water velocity increases with distance from the bottom or the sides (where the water doesn't move), since the river as a whole is flowing.<br><br>It might not be a very large/wide band of &quot;still&quot; water, but the velocity will certainly be lower near where water meets rocks/land.</p>		</li>

			<p>What I'm picturing, and I'd love to know whether this is a comparable analogy, is setting a brand new deck of cards on the palm of your hand and moving your hand back and forth a little.<br><br>The lower cards move with your hand, with the bottom card sticking to it, but the higher you go the more the cards resist that momentum and appear to stay in the same place.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's pretty much the same. It all comes down to friction. Your skin offers more friction than other cards do, but also the cards lower in the deck exert more friction upon each other due to force of the cards above it.</p>		</li>

			<p>Plumber here! The frictional losses in flow rates in plumbing systems is significant. For example. You have a 15mm (1/2&quot;) pipe at your main connection to the water supply under the pavement (kerb) outside your house, running under the driveway and into the house. The pipe under your kerb is also 15mm in diameter.<br><br>You will improve the flow rates in your house plumbing if you replace the part under your drive with a larger pipe, 32mm for instance. The improved flow rate will solely be down to lower frictional losses in the new larger diameter pipe, despite the fact the pipe supplying your area is smaller.<br><br>The same must apply in rivers.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, definitely true. Small streams have to navigate in between boulders whereas rivers plow right over them. Once rivers flood over their banks, frictional coefficients get really hard to figure out again, though.</p>		</li>

			<p>I struggled with flow velocity and pipe resistance calculations at plumbing college as I'm not very good at maths and that is where all the variables are known (rule of thumb is good enough for domestic plumbing thankfully). I can't fathom trying to work out those kind of things on a river but you can bet there are people who do calculate such things when surveying.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Yes but I would imagine that the uneven surface of the river bottom makes the flow of water in certain areas more difficult. You end up with pockets of water that are hardly moving. <br><br>Think of an extreme example. Imagine a 10 foot well on the river bottom. The water in the bottom of that well would only be lightly affected by the intense flow of the river over top. The only affect gravity would have is to pull the water to the bottom of the well, only further reducing the amount of flow. <br><br>Now take that concept and apply it to a small area in a river that might have a dead tree along the bottom or just a natural pocket in the river bottom due to large rocks or other sedimentary blockage. Prime fish hangout area. </p>		</li>

			<p>This exactly. Fish are almost always conserving energy, which means they find areas where the forces more or less balance out so they can remain in place. A fish at rest in a freshwater river is typically only using slow movement in its pectoral fins and a slight ripple in the caudal fin to remain &quot;still&quot;. An actively hunting fish is different but any fisherman knows how infrequently fish are this active throughout the day. </p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, they do this to conserve energy but it's also a prime location to snatch food that gets disoriented in the eddy that can flow off of the structure (trout and river walleye are notorious for this). Often times the bigger fish will stake this out as their territory and defend it from other fish. In fact, some strikes you get from a big streamer or zonker are more defensive than appetitive. </p>		</li>
