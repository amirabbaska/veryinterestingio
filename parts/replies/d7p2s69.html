			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is. u/DeformedElephant is a bit mis-informed, not all fish constantly swim against the current. Maybe some do, but the only thing I can think of is a salamander species that only lives in a handful of waterfalls and they don't swim as much as grip the rock face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we also need to remember that the current is not always as strong on the bottom of the water as it is towards the top. Fish hold behind rocks, in back eddies, below soft riffles, and in the soft pockets of water next to a current (called seams). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the current near the banks tends to be less than in the middle of the river. That is why steamboats on the Mississippi used to go down river in the middle and hug the banks on the trip back up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would the current be stronger on top than on the bottom of the river?</p>
<p>I just assumed current = water movement from a higher potential energy to lower potential energy (uphill to downhill).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This exactly. Fish are almost always conserving energy, which means they find areas where the forces more or less balance out so they can remain in place. A fish at rest in a freshwater river is typically only using slow movement in its pectoral fins and a slight ripple in the caudal fin to remain &quot;still&quot;. An actively hunting fish is different but any fisherman knows how infrequently fish are this active throughout the day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they do this to conserve energy but it's also a prime location to snatch food that gets disoriented in the eddy that can flow off of the structure (trout and river walleye are notorious for this). Often times the bigger fish will stake this out as their territory and defend it from other fish. In fact, some strikes you get from a big streamer or zonker are more defensive than appetitive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on, a lot of streams and rivers will have areas more or less sheltered from the current. Sometimes rocks or ledges, sometimes vegetation. I'd be surprised if there was a species that was constantly swimming against the current.</p></div>		</li>
