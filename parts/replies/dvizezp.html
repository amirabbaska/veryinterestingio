			<div class="markdown"><p>So if an emergency C-section happens in the middle of labour, when does the body stop labouring? Does the anaesthesia stop the labour? Does it natural stop when the womb is empty? I imagine it would stop before they get stitched, cause I can't imagine doctors stitching up a womb having contractions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia can lessen contractions. General anesthesia can halt labor due to muscle relaxing effects of medicine. If it’s a true emergency than you’re talking a matter of minutes before the baby is out. After the baby is out of the uterus and the placenta has been removed, we start a drug called Pitocin (USA anyways) that actually stimulates contractions forcefully to help shrink the uterus and decrease bleeding. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minutes? My buddy asked the doctors (primary and assisting) how fast they could have the baby out if something went wrong, their response was about 30-45 seconds.</p>
<p>Another buddy of mine's wife HAD complications and had to have an emergency C-Section, the nurse/tech escorted him out of the room, and handed him a bunny suit; by the time he was back in the room (maybe 2 mins at Most), his wife had her insides on the table next to her, and his son was being cleaned up by the nurses off to the side. He says he still has nightmares about seeing it and thinking his wife was dead.</p></div>		</li>
