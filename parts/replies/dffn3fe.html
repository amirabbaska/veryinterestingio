			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhere at the supercluster level, the question what exactly will stay together in the future is still discussed.</p>
<p>Edit: To summarize discussions in child comments: Galaxy groups and clusters are bound. Most things called superclusters are probably unbound, although there are structures called superclusters that are bound, and some authors even use &quot;gravitationally bound&quot; as definition for superclusters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it right here. The galactic superclusters are drifting away from each other, and there's no sign they will ever be able to see each other again. Hundreds of billions of years from now, the night sky will be much darker as we won't be able to witness all the galaxies outside our supercluster.</p>
<p>But within each supercluster, things be colliding and forming into stars all the time still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We keep getting surprised by how big the scale is. Any time we think we've settled on the distances needed to test the red shifting Edwin Hubble first discovered, it seems to not take long before we find a group of galaxies outside that scale where no expansion is observed. </p>
<p>It's very possible we just don't know the actual reason for lots of the redshift we observe, especially since dark energy is so poorly understood. Space may not be expanding the way we think it is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There has to be something holding superclusters together to not allow expansion to pull them apart. So gravity has to have control over at least that magnitude. Either that, or another as-of-yet-undiscovered force is the reason.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, locally the story is different. On smaller scales gravitational attraction can dominate</p>

<p>So... kind of like flinging a cup of water, the water will expand outwards but still clump together in globs and beads on the way?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I like this analogy.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah kinda, instead of gravity the droplets are bound by surface tension. It falls apart on inspection though, as large (dense) droplets would be less stable while larger (denser) globs of matter would be more stable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how accurate it is but I always think of the universe's expansion as though all matter is shrinking at the same rate so there's more space between everything. While it's shrinking, some matter can still get closer together though via gravitationalâ€‹ attraction or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth would be destroyed by the time the Andromeda and Milky Way collide, but inhabitants of a planet able to sustain life would probably be fine. The scales dealt with are so huge that most stars would pass by each other and only interact gravitationally. The biggest threat would be getting thrown out of the galaxy during the collision</p></div>		</li>
