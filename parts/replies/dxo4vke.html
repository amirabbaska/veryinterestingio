			<div class="markdown"><p>Even Uranium fission reactors are so much better than the alternatives. Much less steel, concrete, etc. is needed per TWh than the alternatives. Solar and wind require massive land areas to produce a significant amount of power. Hydro is essentially capped out in the US. Renewables are good and all, but they canâ€™t maintain 100% baseload power for months at a time like Nuclear can. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Another reason a lot of renewables aren't that great in the long term: renewables tend to take up a lot of space, and/or must be located in ecologically sensitive areas. Their presence can significantly disrupt local ecosystems and cause unpredictable ecological chain reactions.</p>
<p>Just because it's &quot;green&quot; doesn't mean it's good. Renewables are <em>better;</em> a great stepping stone away from fossil fuels, but the future is not renewables, it's going to be an advanced form of nuclear fusion, fission, or some similar as yet un-invented technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't disagree about nuclear.  Molten Salt Reactors have a chance to change public opinion on nuclear and possibly let it go mainstream.  Current nuclear tech is overly complex and is an outgrowth of cold war era weapons development, if the original goal was power the Reactors would be completely different now days</p></div>		</li>
