			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you're saying is:</p>
<p>When your house is cold, the hot air from outside is aggressively trying to get in.</p>
<p>But if your house is already warm, hot air from outside is not trying to get in as much.</p>
<p>Right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct in using less power by turning it off but I would suggest a compromise of just setting back the thermostat by 2 to 4 degrees. This will save money but also keep the humidity from fluctuating which depending on the climate could be damaging to the house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, so allowing big temperature fluctuations could encourage condensation cycles? That is an interesting factor, hadn't considered that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the temperature fluctuation that does it.  ACs do more than just cool the air; they also dehumidify it.  So if you live in a humid area, you have to let the AC run periodically to keep the air dry and prevent mold growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once lived in an apartment where I did not have to pay the electric bill... A friend and I had an acoustic and electric guitars respectively kept in the apartment throughout the summer. When we lived elsewhere during the summer time we had to regularly tune the instruments far more often than when the air conditioner was on constantly maintaining about 68 degrees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are more &quot;subtleties&quot; one being how thermally resistant your house insulation is, and also heat load from northern facing windows. But you are quite correct, having your A/C off will save you power. A good contractor will take into account these variables and install an A/C to heat/cool your house in an acceptable amount of time. Source:I'm a Refrigeration engineer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't see how the house being more or less resistive will make any difference to the result. I may be oversimplifying, I'm a normal Mech Eng and HVAC is not my specialty. It seems to me that adding or removing insulation will affect the rate that heat loss/gain will occur, but that the trend will be the same in terms of turn off vs keep on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it will effect how much more efficient it is.  if your house is well insulated your ac may only kick on once or twice to maintain temp compared to many more for a drafty home.</p></div>		</li>
