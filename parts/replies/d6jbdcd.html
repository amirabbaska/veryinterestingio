<p>Just a note that the freeze idea comes from animal research, same as fight and flight. It's a very common response to danger that was, oddly, overlooked when the fight-and-flight system was first proposed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad that you brought the Parasympathetic Nervous System to attention here. I'm somebody who has been hospitalized due to sever anxiety, agoraphobia, depression, etc. The main way that my anxiety has manifested itself is in my stomach and intestines. When it first started, I couldn't sleep due to unexplained stomach pain. The stomach pain grew to be a deterrent for just about everything I did or wanted to do. At this point currently, even after a lot of help and medication, I still struggle everyday with calming my stomach down to eat. It still doesn't let me sleep, and it usually takes about 12+ hours after I wake up before my stomach is willing to accept any kind of food. I hope that more people realize that your mental state really does affect your body quite a bit.</p></div>		</li>
