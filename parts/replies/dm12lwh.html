			<div class="markdown"><p>Unlikely to be rare in the universe, the scale is too big. We suspect life in half a dozen places in our own solar system, if you include microbial life on moons around gas giants, which are extremely common, it should be not rare.</p>
<p>Intelligent life however, yeah likely to be more rare. Especially as intelligence doesn't seem to improve survivability of a species much. At least on our planet there doesn't seem to be a natural progression towards higher intelligence, some of the most successful species that survived for millions of years with little change like sharks, alligators or tortoises are fairly dumb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, we got close to extinction several times in the rather short time we have been around. We are also fairly likely to apply our minds to ways to kill our self, the more knowledge we accumulate(we don't get smarter, we accumulate knowledge) the likelier we are to go extinct by some fringe group starting a nuclear war or creating a artificial super illness that's both extremely infectious and deadly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean we know that literally the next star over has exoplanets and have no way of knowing if they do or don't have life.  Hell, we don't even know if there's other life in our own solar system.  Making any form of statements on probability would be totally meaningless if we can't even assess, yes or no, if literally one additional place than us has life.</p></div>		</li>
