			<div class="markdown"><p>Many jumping spiders are intelligent enough that they are capable of object permanence.</p>
<p>In addition they seem to exhibit learning behavior.  <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/spidernaut.html" target="_blank">A Jumping Spider named Nefertiti the Spidernaut was researched on the ISS to see how she would hunt in a micro-g environment.</a>  It took her some time, but she eventually corrected her hunting method to account for the lack of gravity.</p>
<p>When she came back to Earth she had to relearn how to jump because she had been used to doing so in space.  It blows my mind just how adaptable they are.</p>
<p>Another experiment on the Skylab showed that Weavers can learn how to build webs without gravity as well.</p>
<p>I love spiders.  They're one of the oldest land-based species on Earth.  They outlived the dinosaurs, and they'll probably outlive us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a tarantula hobbiest, I often wonder if this learning ability is only limited to jumping spiders.</p>
<p>Most of my tarantulas have a set routine - and are perfectly content staying in their enclosure, chilling on their perch or pooping in their poop corner (tarantulas are kinda clean freaks, and usually pick a corner / spot to spray their poop - and this is where they always poop)</p>
<p>Then there is the spoiled brat - Betsy. Betsy is the most &quot;social&quot; of all of my tarantulas. She is a Brachypelma smithi (Mexican red knee tarantula) - which is a species known to be very docile. She has seemingly &quot;learned&quot; that her cage has a &quot;top&quot; and if only she could muster up enough strength to lift it up, she could escape. She is often found trying to lift her top. She usually gets far enough that she can move it just enough to make a racket. It is then that I usually end up opening up her top and letting her come out for some free exploration time. She seems to love exploring. She likes to touch and climb on everything. She has never once shown a defensive posture towards me when out exploring. </p>
<p>I think there is a lot more to these creatures than we currently understand. Unfortunately, there seems to be very little scientific motivation / resources devoted to spider / tarantula &quot;behavior&quot;. Fortunately, tarantulas are easy to breed and therefore are a rather large hobby, and it seems a lot of this behavioral data comes from keepers and not biologists / scientists. </p>
<p>I have always been disappointed when visiting zoos that had tarantula exhibits - as they seem to ignore the needs of these amazing creatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I trouble you with millions of questions? I basically adopted a tarantula (was left by the previous teacher) and now have it as a classroom pet...
I don’t know anything about tarantulas! I don’t even know what gender it is (I do know that this is a tricky thing to figure out). Either way I’d love to chat because I feel unprepared to care for it but am willing to learn. </p>
<p>Also Betsy sounds hilarious. I think spidey ( so unoriginal I know) is like Betsy because she has escaped before!! We found the tarantula in a corner a few inches from the classroom door.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is truly fascinating. What blows my mind even further is that this has, IIRC, been mathematically proven to be a property of neural networks in general, which is the base model we use for approximating the functions of a nervous system. Given an objective and constraints, a neural network of basically any size will optimize itself over repeated performances in a given context. Put a spider in space and it will &quot;re-wire&quot; to restructure itself to be better at hunting in space. </p>
<p>One of the huge advances of late, and part of why AI is taking off, is that we're able to train AI faster than &quot;real time.&quot; technically, it's only &quot;real time&quot; for humans, since we're the most common reference point, but the DeepMind AI that beat the world champion in Go was effectively trained for something like hundreds or thousands of years' worth of games, IIRC.  </p>
<p>One of my colleagues is currently looking into make a neural network control system for multicopters (drones) that would &quot;rewire&quot; in real time to adapt to unexpected disturbances like a wind gust or getting hit with a rock. It's still the objective &quot;fly the direction you intend to as efficiently as possible&quot; and constraints &quot;you've got 4 propellers that can spin up to X rpm&quot; &quot;you weigh this much&quot;, etc. that make its purpose and identity. The trick is just getting it to solve that problem fast enough not to crash. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that decentralized nervous system is really fascinating. I found an interesting paper that expanded on this idea. (Link in the bottom.) The main reason that spiders don't have a big brain like we do is because of the high energy cost. That's why predators are usually the ones who develop complex central nervous systems: It is required so that they can survive. For example, in order for a common bird to offset the energy required to fly all around the place, they have to be able to find food as efficiently as possible. The best way to do that is to be able to have a long-term memory storage that allows them to remember exactly when and where food is located at any given day or season.</p>
<p>Spiders, on the other hand, are not able to achieve the minimum amount of energy needed to support a brain, according to Haller's Rule (which states that generally smaller animals have larger brains, which is not always true but generally is applicable). However, as predators they need to be able to achieve complex behavioral patters in order to compete with more highly developed animals.  So some species of spiders, in order to offset the lack of responsive decision-making, found a way to manipulate their environment by making webs. They developed a relationship described by the &quot;mutual manipulability criterion&quot;, which just means that the spider and its web are in a state where each influences the other. If you change the web, the behavior of the spider will change, while if you change the environment of the spider it will change the web accordingly.  The paper calls this &quot;extended cognition&quot;. For example, if you starve a spider, it will alter the tension in the web so that they can respond to even the smallest fly that accidentally lands on the web. A well-fed spider would usually just ignore those. Researchers also found that increasing tension in a particular part of the web will alter the behavior of the spider, thus proving that the spider and web are in a mutually manipulative relationship, and thus the web can act as an extension of the decision-making part of a web-making spider's brain and allow it to make more complex decisions. </p>
<p>This is a short and simplified description of only part of the paper, if you want to learn more I would highly recommend to read it, as the language is not complex and the paper summarizes a lot of research that has been done in the field.</p>
<p>(Also, sadly the internet does not fulfill the requirements of the &quot;mutual manipulability criterion&quot; with any individual human, as even though reading something online can change your ideas, there is no real way for one person to directly alter something that is receiving input from billions of people.) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>tl;dr : Spiders aren't able to develop brains, so they use webs to expand the types of behavior they can express. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It essentially means that instead of having a brain that does all of the thinking and sending out all of the commands to other parts of the body that would be useless without the brain telling them what to do, their entire nervous system is their brain. There is no command center sending out commands to body parts like you see in humans and most animals, instead their entire body is their brain.</p></div>		</li>
