			<div class="markdown"><p>It relates to a concept called the Starling curve. Cardiac output (volume per unit time) is based on two major variables: heart rate and stroke volume. Stroke volume is how much fluid the heart pushes out per beat. </p>
<p>Cardiac output increases proportionately with increasing volume (fancy way to say more fluid in blood vessels) because more volume means a greater stroke volume.</p>
<p>As an aside, this only goes so far as you might expect, and when a person is &quot;volume overloaded&quot; their heart is essentially overfull and conceptually stretched too much to beat effectively. This is one form of heart failure, and a reason why diuretics are prescribed for those folks.</p>
<p>Tl;Dr: more fluid means you have 1. More fluid to pump and thus faster and greater flow and 2. Something similar to the effects of filling a balloon with air very full--it begins to exert more pressure against being filled further. Your heart has a similar effect </p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Sorry, I should have added that cortisol causes fluid retention in a variety of ways as well, such as retaining sodium. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he means increased volume of blood, and the fluid, being the blood. As Cortisol increases the volume of blood in your body, subsequently the veins engorge to accommodate the increased amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Increased blood flow = increased pressure. Since fluid doesn't compress it leaks out of the blood vessel and into the spaces in between the cells. </p>
<p>Then cortisol does something to keep that fluid there. I'm not really sure so if someone can explain that, it would be really cool. </p></div>		</li>
