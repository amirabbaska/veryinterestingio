Especially in TV and movies, where &quot;he's going into shock&quot; is something TV doctors will say without, y'know, taking BP or anything.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The literal definition of shock I was taught was, &quot;cellular hypoxia, dysfunction, and death as a result of inadequate tissue perfusion.&quot;</p>

<p>Shock is a general term meaning a sudden change in some parameter of a system. It is widely used in physics and engineering to refer to mechanical or thermal changes that cause a sudden response in the system. Hence by extension, electrical shock etc..</p></div>		</li>
