			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of off topic but I thought it was interesting. I once had kidney stones and had never experienced that kind of intense, constant pain before. I found myself basically rolling around in bed because my body kept telling me to move to positions that it thought would help. Of course nothing helped but I couldn't stop trying to find that one glorious position that would somehow stop the pain.  That's when I learned the real meaning of Writhing in Pain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omg kidney stones! That was by far the worst pain I had ever been in. Easily 100x worse than any other pain I've experienced. I knew what kidney stones were, but I didn't know what the symptoms were. When the pain first started, I had no idea what was happening. I drove myself to the hospital at close to 100 mph. I thought for sure I was dying. They said it was from dehydration. Weirdly, for some reason, unless it's super hot
out or I'm doing a strenuous activity, I never feel thirsty. I can go all day without feeling the need to drink anything, even during meals. (which btw, no one, including doctors, ever believes me when I tell them about it) Even still, I had the kidney stone about 5 years ago and there hasn't been a day since that I didn't make sure to drink plenty of water. I don't want to go through that ever again. </p></div>		</li>
