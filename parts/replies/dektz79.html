			<div class="markdown"><p>The farmer(s) figure into their costs how much they need to operate their farm this year. For the sake of argument, we'll say it's a moderate farm with a few hundred acres of grain. Between their tractor, fertilizer, water, labor, and other equipment they figure overhead cost at $500,000 dollars.</p>
<p>If a hundred distributors all place orders at the beginning of the season, the farmer might ask each for $6,000 because some will inevitably back out and the costs still have to be covered. If all orders are fulfilled, he would pick up $600,000. But like airplane seats, there will be some no-shows. Instead of overbooking, the prices are adjusted up a bit.</p>
<p>If five distributors ask, the farmer may adjust the end-income to 520,000 once he or she is ready to deliver at the end of the season.</p>
<p>If a single purchaser offers to buy the whole crop, the farmer may only ask for the 500k &quot;upon delivery&quot;.</p>
<p>A similar calculus is used by the manufacturer and by the store. This is why a company like Costco can sell you bulk items at a steep discount, where a deli selling single servings of an item sells at a steep mark-up.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mac and Cheese boxes are not technically non-perishable, but it does have a long shelf life compared to Mac and Cheese on a hot line at the deli counter. The ready-to-eat stuff has to be turned over (inventory sold out or discarded) every 12-72 hours depending on local health code. If you overestimate and have to toss ten pounds, that cost is accounted for in the overall cost to the consumer. If dry boxes don't sell this week, they can stay on the shelf for weeks, even months in some cases, reducing loss. That, too, impacts cost as inventory is not so easily lost (and subsequently, less &quot;cost of loss&quot;) and ends up cheaper for the consumer.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>
<p>Edit: I tried to keep this simple, but perhaps left out some critical details surrounding the economics of modern farming. See comments responding to this one for clarification. Also--200 upvotes? For being only kinda sorta in the ballpark? Thanks, I guess!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To make this more complicated, most commodities are traded through the futures derivatives markets.  This ensures a price point for manufacturers/farmers.  </p>
<p>So Farmer Joe sells a futures option for wheat, at say, $500 a bushel 1 year from now (IDK what the actual price is) and PROMISES to sell the wheat to whomever buys the option.  Someone buys this option and PROMISES to buy those bushels of wheat for $500 a bushel.  Kraft would probably be buying these futures TODAY and they're promising from 1 year, they will buy the contracted bushels for $500 each.</p>
<p>This helps immensely with budgeting.  However, it reduces the 'upside potential' of the farmer.  In other words, if the price of wheat ends up being $550 per bushel at the expiration of the option (when the option gets exercised/used), then Farmer Joe must still sell the wheat to Kraft for $500 a bushel.  </p>
<p>So for Farmer Joe, he knows pretty much how much he will make in the year and can plan accordingly.  He doesn't have to worry about prices going down and making a lot less than he planned to make. </p>
<p>For Kraft, they know how much they will spend on raw ingredients and they are guaranteed to get their wheat.  </p>
<p>Farmer Joe reduces his upside potential (price increase) but also reduces his downside risk (price drop).  Kraft reduces it's upside risk (if prices increase) and reduces their downside potential (if prices dropped).</p>
<p>Stay tuned for next week when we discuss:  GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIARIES...</p>
<p>Yeah I accidentally used subsidiary instead of subsidy. I was trying my best to not misspell subsidiary but forgot I wasnt even using the right word. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually grain is purchased on the open market.  Yes the farmer can buy contracts that he has to fulfill, but most of the time your not selling to a distributor.</p>
<p>Some simplified math, lets assume wheat is selling for $6.00 a bushel (about 60lb)  You farmer was able to average 100 bushel a acre, for a 200 acre farm that is $60,000 dollars worth of wheat.  It cost around $450 a acre to produce wheat so your farmer makes about $15,000 minus storage and transportation cost (say a additional 20 cent a bushel.</p>
<p>The grain is usually stored by a co-op, then delivered to one of the major grain market.  The flour mills then but the grain at market price and grind it into flour.  This is the stage where the previous numbers can be used as it is the flour mills that sell to Kraft and other companies.</p>
<p>Fun fact, for every loaf of bread, the farmer get's around 8 cents for the grain.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pasta is made with flour and eggs, two very cheap materials with a high yield. The manufacturer gets a premium because they're buying the raw materials by the thousands of pounds, so while we get a bag of flour from the store for a few dollars, they're likely getting it for a few cents per pound. If they're getting 5x (made up number) the amount of pasta per pound of flour  their production cost is basically nothing.  </p>
<p>Edit: I've been corrected that dried pasta is just flour and water. Even cheaper. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of fresh pasta is made with eggs, but most of the dried pasta you find (at least in the US) has no eggs.  The stuff you get in a box of mac and cheese certainly does not have eggs.  It's basically flour and water, which are both pretty darn cheap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cheap dried pasta is just flour and water, yes. Some higher-quality pastas also contain eggs, but if you want to cut costs, you probably aren't going to use it in mac 'n' cheese. In any case, the difference in flavour is likely to be swamped by the flavour of the cheese in the dish.</p>

<p>We kill around 25 MILLION chickens every single day. This is why most operations pack them so close together each bird gets about 1 sq ft to live in each.</p>
<p>9 Billion chickens a year, and this is not including the male chicks that get tossed in dumpsters or ground up and trashed in the egg laying industry.</p></div>		</li>
