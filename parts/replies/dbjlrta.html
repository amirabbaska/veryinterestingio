			<div class="markdown"><p>This wasn't the best answer to upvote to the top. It implies that fake news is just another word for clickbait or yellow journalism without mentioning the biggest controversy: the overt fabrications and deceptive use of legitimate-sounding domain names. An example of fake news is when a website called seattletribune.com is claiming that Clinton's chief of staff has been assassinated. Of course there is no Seattle Tribune, but it looks legitimate in a social media feed.</p>
<p>This whole secondary conversation about opinion and clickbait mostly comes from obfuscation from people who feel attacked by the implication that fake news helped one candidate more than another. Really, no matter which side you're on you should be opposed to websites that exist solely to spread objectively false information (not just opinions you might disagree with).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to be overlooking the fact that literally hundreds of fake news sites were set up specifically for the U.S. election, and at least two of the major people behind multi-million dollar fake political news platforms are now part of his cabinet/group of advisors.  </p>
<p>So it's not that it's just getting attention now, it's that it grew significantly with the election and there are people who intentionally pushed this propaganda in exchange for political influence and/or the expectation of being given powerful positions within our government.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Clickbait is a leading headline with a real, true story behind it. &quot;Fake news&quot; is an untrue story that is passed off as real, and designed to be read via sharing on social media.</p></div>		</li>
