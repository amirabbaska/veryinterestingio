			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, I’ll have to check but I’m pretty sure it is for the perception of external temps while assisting with normal membrane functions (keep things out, let things in, basically a gate/wall combo). Our internal temp is usually managed by the hypothalamus, but the actual temperature is a result of metabolic reactions in our cells releasing heat. Think of when you workout, you get hot cause your muscles are burning glucose, but then the hypothalamus tells your body to sweat. When you are cold, the body will also burn more to stay warm (why cold showers/weather cause you to burn more calories). </p></div>		</li>
