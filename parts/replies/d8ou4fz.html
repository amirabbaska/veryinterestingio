			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not a perpetual motion machine. In a vacuum, if you spin an object, like a sphere, it will spin forever. It is not generating unlimited energy. You can throw a ball in space, and it will travel forever if unaltered. Although it will be moving for an infinite amount of time, it is not generating unlimited energy. Constant velocity in a friction-less environment does not require constant input of energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are interpreting it wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In a vacuum</em>, if you spin an object, like a sphere, it will spin forever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a true vacuum, which is impossible, an object encountering no friction will move without losing energy.</p>
<p>Also, I don't think that wiki page is even correct, The source says nothing about &quot;<em>third</em> kind of perpetual motion machine&quot; It is only mentioned when talking about how perpetual motion machines break the <em>third</em> law of thermodynamics and there is no distinction of different 'types' of perpetual motion, nor is there any sources for the first two kinds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, actually it won't. Spinning causes an object to lose a tiny amount of energy over time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But not in a way that breaks time symmetry. The atoms aren't moving, it is just the closest analogue we can understand. It also have rotational energy and angular momentum without actually rotating, at least in any classical sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's a powered system, so thermodynamics ISN'T violated. Energy goes into keeping things cool enough for this to function.</p>
<p>I know that science likes to act as if &quot;cooling and containment doesn't count&quot; when it comes to systems which don't abide by conservation of energy/mass... but energy in = energy in. Even if that energy is used to remove energy or isolate the environment.</p>
<p>I'm all for disrupting the status quo and ushering in a new age of science, but this very clearly isn't perpetual motion. It's a powered system. To use your pendulum example, it's like a pendulum inside a jar which uses power to condition the interior environment of the jar to allow for perpetual swinging of the pendulum. Eventually the jar will run out of power and the pendulum will stop. If a system seems perpetual an observer simply isn't considering the correct context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To a certain point that's true... but even if something is floating around out in space it's subject to very small temperature fluctuations due essentially to collisions with random particles.</p>
<p>Achieving a lack of energy is one thing... maintaining it is another. Our universe just doesn't like the idea of things not changing.</p></div>		</li>
