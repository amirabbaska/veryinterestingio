			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course no chemical bond. (Well, ideally I guess. I'm sure there's some unfortunate series of events where that could happen)</p>
<p>What I mean is, atoms and such are like 99% open space. So when my mass of molecules makes &quot;contact&quot; with the mattress are they physically touching, is there a gap, is there some thin space where a cubic region would have a mixture of me and mattress atoms that happened to be overlapped. </p>
<p>I.e. would a measure of any space show a mixture of me molecules and bed molecules... or would the be a clear divide at that level. If clwar would the clear divide be physically touching the other mass, or would there be a tiny gap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may find this video interesting and informative, though it can be confusing with the advanced concepts it (attempts) to explain: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0TNJrTlbBQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0TNJrTlbBQ</a></p>
<p>From the videos creators:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prof Moriarty and I have discussed the issue of &quot;atoms touching&quot; many times off camera.</p>
<p>We've shared different views on the best definitions and tools used by various online &quot;explainers&quot; over the years.
Clearly it is an issue close to Professor Moriarty's heart because it involves his main area of research.</p>
<p>And I am mindful he is a professional on the topic. I am not.
We jointly decided to make a Sixty Symbols video that reflected our previous discussions, so included more than my usual fill of provocative questions.</p>
<p>And regardless, I see it as my role to be a &quot;devil's advocate&quot; and ensure we challenge our scientists and get the best possible explanations.</p>
<p>I can assure everyone it was done in good spirit and we had a laugh afterwards.</p>

<p>This video has completely made my day!! I was mocked as a young boy for pondering this out loud and am at long last vindicated!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Repulsive forces never allow two objects to touch. You literally never &quot;touch&quot; things as you'd imagine, the atoms in your hand just get arbitrarily close to whatever the object is.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this is it. Atoms don't really have a well-defined radius as electrons are more like a cloud around the nucleus that gets thinner and thinner the further out you go, but never quite disappears. If nuclei are touching, you've got a neutron star and big problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question about this.</p>
<p>If we never touch things, how can we hold them? How can we hold something if the individual atoms repulse each other?</p>
<p>Secondly, why do different things have different textures? If atoms repel each other, and atoms don't have different textures, why does a silk cloth feel different than a wooden table?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its similar to magnets getting close to each Other. The more the same poles are pulled together the more it feels the repell. You are floating on top of the atoms of the mattress. Although very minutely.</p></div>		</li>
