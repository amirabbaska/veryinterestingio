			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect that the note readers in modern checkouts are able to be upgraded in software via a remote connection, whereas most parking machines will require someone to physically go out to them to apply the upgrade, and might even need new mechanical parts to accept the new coins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vending machines take $5's? I've never tried because I was told as a kid in the 90's to never use $5's because the machine will think it's a $1 and not give change.</p>
<p>How true was this back then and today?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always gone by whatever the front of the machine says. I remember most of them in the 90's saying $1's and quarters only, but it's pretty common today for machines to take bills up to $20. It should say on the front of the machine what bills it'll take. The vending machine in the break room where I work will gladly take a $20 bill, then spit out dozens of quarters as change. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is in the UK. Supermarket self checkout machines handle banknotes perfectly happily. They're not vending machines but they're the same principle. We recently changed the Â£5 note from a paper based one to a polymer one that is significantly smaller, but nobody had any trouble using the things.</p></div>		</li>
