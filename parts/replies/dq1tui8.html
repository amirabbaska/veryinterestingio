			<div class="markdown"><p>The commonest cause of poor sense of smell is chronic low grade sinus inflammation (chronic rhinosinusitis), which is often life-long and related to allergy even if there are no overt symptoms of allergy.</p>
<p>There are other (rare) causes of anosmia, so this answer is not comprehensive.</p>
<p>It annoys people more than you would think.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can still taste without smell. In fact, that's all you can do. Sweet, sour, salt, bitter and umami are the five basic tastes, and you don't need your nose to pick up on those. Taste buds in your mouth do that.</p>
<p>What you do miss out on is <em>flavour</em>. That's the result of both taste and smell. For example, you might find it quite difficult to tell two different types of cheese apart, or two different types of wine. They can vary greatly in flavour, but in terms of basic taste they tend to be very similar.</p>
<p>I can tell the difference between sugar and salt. If I'm eating fish, I can tell that it is fish I'm eating, but I couldn't tell you what type of fish it is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And even then, more from the texture than from the taste, no?</p></div>		</li>
