			<div class="markdown"><p>To get an idea of orders of magnitude here, the energy stored in Earth's rotation is on the order of <a href="http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=.5*.4*mass+of+Earth*%28radius+of+earth%29%5E2+*+%281%2Fday%29%5E2" target="_blank">10^27 Joules</a>. By comparison, global electricity production is on the order of 10^19 to 10^20 Joules per year. </p>
<p>That means that we could power humanity for about 10^7 years at current levels before slowing the rotation of the planet to a stop (or to once per month, as would occur with tidal slowing). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately the natural levels of tidal effects means it takes 50 billion years for the Earth to naturally reach equilibrium. We could not get anything close to increasing the effects by even a tiny fraction.</p>
<p>But it is cool to see how much energy there is stored in the rotation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, 5 x 10^10 years from naural causes is much larger than 1 x 10^7 from human causes (or in conjunction with human causes), so even though it would still take a long time, if we derived all of our energy from tidal sources we would be increasing the rate of dissipation of Earth's rotational energy by a factor of 1000. The number 5 x 10^10 minus the number of years it would take to dissapate from solely human sources equals 10^7, showing that it would be negligible compared to human cause</p>
<p>In addition human energy consumption is increasing exponentially, so in a few hundred years if we for some reason converted to entirely tidal power, it could have a significant impact</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight correction.  SI unit of angular velocity is rad/sec.</p>
<p>Moment of Inertia of Earth: 9.69276*10^37  </p>
<p>Angular Velocity = 2π/(24 <em> 60 </em> 60) = 7.27*10^-5</p>
<p>½ <em> 9.69 </em> 10^37 <em> (7.27 </em> 10^-5 )^2 = 2.56 * 10^29  (roughly) </p>
<p>So there's 100x more energy in the rotation of earth than you originally thought. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say &quot;power humanity at current levels&quot; but global power consumption is currently increasing by about 2.8% a year (average over the last ten years).  Extrapolating to an unreasonable degree, in 500 years, global power consumption could potentially be approximately one million times higher than it is right now, meaning that extracting 100% of our energy from tides would make the days get about a minute and a half longer each year.</p>
<p>So, in two or three hundred years we should probably come up with an alternative energy source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really right. Even if you take things to the extreme and assume humans capture 100% of the tidal energy, there would be almost no difference at all. In the natural system, nearly 100% of tidal energy gets absorbed by landmasses already and converted, ultimately, to heat. 100% of electrical energy is converted, ultimately, to heat. (In both cases, a negligible amount is converted to light which escapes the Earth.) The Earth would slow, and the moon's orbit will change in exactly the same way.
The only noticeable difference, even under the fantastical situation in which humans capture all of the tidal energy, would be a reduction in coastal erosion and beach building. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are confusing tidal energy and tidal dissipation. Tidal energy is all gravitational and transfers energy from one body to another (as well as creating the tidal bulge). Tidal dissipation is what generates heat and is why the tidal bulge is not aligned with the line of centres.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, that was my point. Perhaps you've just said it better. The tidal energy transfer initiated by gravitational attraction and transferred through tidal bulges will not change at all. The only difference will be how that energy is dissipated, which has no effect at all on orbital/rotational dynamics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if the tide is coming in, towards the direction of the Earth's rotation, and you capture it, does that not add, rather than subtract, momentum to the rotation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a really good question!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you consider the position of the obstruction relative to the line of centres (this is an imaginary line joining the centre of the Earth to the centre of the Moon). If it is behind the line of centres (that is it is advancing towards the line) then due to the rotation speed it is pushing the tidal flow forwards. This pushes the tidal bulge ahead of where its natural position is (in the line of centres). If the obstruction is ahead of the line of centres (so its now moving away from the line) it is preventing the tidal bulge from flowing back to its natural position and hence is again causing the bulge to lead the line of centres.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So regardless of if you open or close the restriction at any point in time the effect is always the same in that the tidal bulge will be displaced to lead the line of centres. This results in the same effect that we already in general see which is the tidal bulge leading the line of centres causing a slowing of the Earth and increased orbital distance of the Moon.</p></div>		</li>
