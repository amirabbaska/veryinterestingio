			<div class="markdown"><p>All DCT’s use clutch packs, no torque converter at all. And they all creep forward in 1st. You can’t design a clutch system that simply relies on engine revs, that would be a horrendous way to get a car moving (imagine when you touched the gas pedal in drive and the car Still wouldn’t move, while parking for example). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>honda made a DCT with a torque converter, so it's not universally true that all DCTs use clutch packs.</p>
<p>as for inching forward: you are right, they CAN inch forward. but DCTs suffer the same issue as manuals when inching forward: extra clutch wear. i imagine this is why honda made a DCT with a torque converter, to get around that issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honda’s DCT doesn’t exist in cars, only motorcycles where the torque converter doesn’t need to move much weight at all. As far as cars go, all DCT’s don’t have torque converters (what would even be the point of two clutches if you still need a torque converter)  and all DCT’s creep forward in drive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the early 1970s Volkswagen marketed in North America what they promoted as an &quot;Automatic&quot;  they got sued because it was NOT  a true automatic  Instead it simply used a very small torque converter to do nothing more than work the clutch, you still had to manually flip it from one gear to the next.</p>
<p>This resulted in them being label with the oxymoron &quot;Automatic Stickshift&quot; with &quot;Automatic&quot; in block letters and &quot;Stickshift&quot; in Cursive</p>
<p>So the concept iof using a small torque converter to simply operate a clutch and do nothing else</p></div>		</li>
