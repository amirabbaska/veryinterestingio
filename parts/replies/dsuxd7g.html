			<div class="markdown"><p>Do we exactly know why the cytokines have an effect on the nervous system. I've only read the abstract and it says </p>
<blockquote>
<p>These proteins have been suggested as messengers in the communication between the immune system and the nervous system, in which signals travel only short distances. Neuroimmune interactions have been discussed in view of findings that nervous signals are important for the immune response.</p>

<p>They go into more detail later on, but I wasn't clear on if those are still theories or if they are proven.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is well researched that cytokines and chemokines are messengers of the immune response, and the inflammatory response a lot of them produce is essential for defense against infection.</p>
<p>The cytokine family of proteins is large and their functions have a broad range within the immune response as well as outside the immune response such as the within the nervous system, for example with the neuro-immune system with glial cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's likely that the nervous system actually signals back on other parts of the immune system as a larger part of the systemic immune response during an infection.  Maybe even more interesting is that immune cells have receptors for neuromodulatory molecules.</p>

<p>I'm not up to date on the literature, but it likely is a mechanism of both pro- and anti-inflammation i.e. signaling the immune cells but making sure the immune response doesn't get too out of hand.  The inflammatory modulation is likely context dependent and dependent on the organ system.  For instance, promoting anti-inflammatory pathways in the gut to prevent major responses against normal gut bacteria.</p>

<p>Most cell types have similar sets of receptors that bind the same targets as well as unique sets of receptors for more niche signal molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't exactly answer the question, does it? Why do the joints hurt specifically? Your finger tips don't start hurting because of the high amount of nerve endings either, do they ? Is it just because of the edema ? Why are the joints so prone to it? Because of worse drainage ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is less space for inflammation in a joint, between bones. Muscles, veins, and skin can expand easily to give more room. Inflammation in a joint, between bones and cartilage that are not so flexible, will cause more pressure, and (..?) therefore pain.</p>
<p>Edit: (Though [oops!], that is speculation. Sorry, breaking the rules.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pain nerves carry signals pretty much constantly. When you're in pain, this signal has reached a threshold level in the brain to register as pain.</p>
<p>What the parent posted above is that the threshold for pain is lowered, meaning that the regular signal your brain received is now interpreted as pain, rather than being ignored like normal.</p>
<p>Interesting side note: opioid abuse also lowers your threshold for pain, so withdrawals make normal muscle movement painful.</p>
