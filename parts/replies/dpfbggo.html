			<div class="markdown"><p>Or on the older (1970s vintage) high speed trains in the UK. They don't lock the doors, they just put up a polite notice asking you not to flush while a train is in the station.</p>
<p>It's why many stations smell like shit and why tomatoes growing between railway tracks is not an uncommon sight.</p>
<p>It's also apparently a massive health hazard for railway workers. I can't imagine it's very nice being sprayed with shit as a high speed train whizzes past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, I’d imagine parts of them do. They have signs asking people not to flush at stations, which is (mostly) adhered to, thankfully. </p>
<p>A lot of trains on the network are more modern, and I’ve just seen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/10/train-toilets-to-no-longer-empty-on-to-tracks" target="_blank">this</a> which suggests it’s being phased out completely within the next few years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. In some sections they have found tomato plants growing from seeds that have passed through people's system and been deposited on the track when they visited the toilet on an older train... the side of the rails where waste from trains is deposited is known as the &quot;cess&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think the tracks are bad, then consider the shit wake. Once a train that flushes onto the tracks is fast enough it leaves behind a fine fecal mist that engulfs the back of the train, is sucked back in through any openings and covers surfaces inside the train and close to the track outside.</p>
