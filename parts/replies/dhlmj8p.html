			<div class="markdown"><p>Fear/Anxiety is bad on the gut/chest because blood supply is forced to limbs in the &quot;fight/flight&quot; so drained away from the less important things such as digestion. This is why some people who have anxiety are thin. Their HR is higher and they don't eat - when they do their body often dumps food instead of digesting it too though which means u can eat but not gain nutrients from it. Sometimes our digestive system is sped up too. Crazy what our body does </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>mhm. Fun tidbit to add, alot of neurotransmitters are created in your gutty works. Like, 90 something percent of Serotonin (related to mood and sleep cycle) is believed to be synthesized in the digestive track. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To note however is that the serotonin synthesized in the GIT stays in the GIT for the most part and serves a completely different function from the serotonin that's in the CNS (although it's the same molecule the receptors and downstream pathways are different). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oooooo sauce? Our knowledge of this stuff is so shaky, I hadn't heard this before. I remember a few years ago everyone was all like &quot;guys I think we might have overstated serotonin's role in depression, so this whole SSRI thing might be not the greatest.&quot; It's been years since I've kept up with anything, I kinda got really jaded on it when I realized just how little we know and how few studies are actually replicable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Enteric </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The enteric nervous system has been described as a &quot;second brain&quot; for several reasons. The enteric nervous system can operate autonomously. It normally communicates with the central nervous system (CNS) through the parasympathetic (e.g., via the vagus nerve) and sympathetic (e.g., via the prevertebral ganglia) nervous systems. However, vertebrate studies show that when the vagus nerve is severed, the enteric nervous system continues to function.[15]</p></div>		</li>
