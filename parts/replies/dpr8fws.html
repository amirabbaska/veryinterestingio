			<div class="markdown"><p>Just visually, the light array method makes the scene feel surreal or even hyper-real: like a painting that's somehow in motion.  The lack of blur tells our eyes the objects aren't moving, but at the same time we can clearly see that they are.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't you still get motion blur, though?</p>
<p>If you are filming at 24 fps, and you strobe your lighting at 240Hz so you get 10 flashes for each frame you film, your frame is still a composite of those 10 flashes, so if there's movement in a frame it will still get blurred.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah they're wrong.</p>
<p>What the technology does is make the actors move in slow motion, while the lights appear to be moving at normal speed.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with motion blur.</p>
<p>The surreal effect is that it doesn't look like slowed down footage, but normal speed footage with slowed down actors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Five overlapped images per exposure doesn't become motion. It becomes a single blurred exposure. Your explanation is totally nonsensical. </p></div>		</li>
