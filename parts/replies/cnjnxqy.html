			<div class="markdown"><p>At no point had we viral ancestors.  Viri arent life forms per se. They are simply put strands of dna who managed to coat themselves in protein.
You can identify viral dna pretty easily as it encodes most likely for things normally not found in eucaryotes. Additionally there are typical sequences around it. </p></div>		</li>
