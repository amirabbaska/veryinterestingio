			<div class="markdown"><p>Deborah Voigt was fired from covent garden because she was too fat (this is 99% likely the case your group voice instructor was talking about). They couldn't afford to make new costumes to fit her, especially because that particular production had costuming by Gucci or some designer like that. </p>
<p>She underwent DRASTIC weight loss via a gastric band (I'm pretty sure that's what it was, though it could have been another surgery). This was detrimental in 2 ways. </p>
<p>1) The rapid loss of fat didn't allow her to get used to her new body/instrument and make the necessary adjustments. </p>
<p>2) probably more detrimental, to perform the surgery they slice across your abdominal muscles. These are like, 90% of singing and how you support your voice. Healing these takes a lot of time, and the weakened muscles definitely affected her ability to sing. </p>
<p>That being said, I had the privilege of working and singing with her a couple of years ago, and she's still absolutely amazing, both vocally and in her stage presence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah I was wondering if it was her. Thank you so much. Your body's health determines more than anything how you sing. I'm so glad you got to have that experience with her. That's so cool!</p>
<p>I need to take care of my voice better. And my temple. Or I won't be singing anywhere!</p></div>		</li>
