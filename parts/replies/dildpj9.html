			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a sort of complicated question because of how heritability is assessed. The only thing researchers actually measure is variation in phenotypes. The estimates of variance explained by genes, shared environment, and non-shared environment are then backed into statistically by exploiting existing and known differences in genetic relationships (e.g. comparing monozygotic twins who share ~100% of their genotype vs. dizygotic twins who share ~50% of their genotype), and existing and known differences in environments (e.g., siblings raised in the same household vs. siblings raised in different households due to adoption for example). Because genetics are not measured directly (as they are for example in genome-wide association studies), there isn't really a clear analog for &quot;using epigenetics&quot; in this sense because we don't know existing epigenetic relationships between people (e.g., we don't know a priori what proportion of their epigenetics say mono vs. dizygotic twins share).</p>
<p>As such, the estimates in heritability studies are backed into statistically by partitioning the variance in phenotypes into just 3 buckets, that we interpret as genetic, shared environment, and non-shared environment. Because epigenetics can be affected or caused by all three of those factors, any effects they have would be end up in whichever bin caused or influenced specific epigenetic differences. So, heritability studies can't offer any clear answer to this kind of question (at least not yet, or not in any way I am aware of). Presumably if we could estimate something like &quot;epigenetic similarity&quot; between individuals empirically, it seems like heritability estimation methods could be used to answer this question, but I'm not enough of an expert in this area to confirm this with 100% certainty (plus, I don't think we have any idea how to measure global measures of epigenetic similarity, or if this could even be coherently done in principle).</p>
<p>I don't understand your last question about using phylogenetic distance as a proxy for more inclusive heritability mechanisms (or what you mean by &quot;more inclusive heritability mechanisms&quot;). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability" target="_blank">Wikipedia page on heritability</a> is pretty good, so might check and see if you can find the answers you're looking for there (or the page on behavioral genetics).</p></div>		</li>

<p>phylogenetic distance...inclusive heritability </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You answered that very well already. Backing into genetics from phenotype basically takes care of heritability that may be absent from GWAS studies. I, stupidly, assumed that any measured 'genetic contribution' would have to be derived from GWAS or at least a relatively large survey of known SNPs.</p>
<p>My thought on phylogenetic distance, is that if you do get a decent amount of sequenced and phenotyped samples, you should be able to generalize the link between genetics and personality phenotypes into <em>at least</em> broader families. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>global measures of epigenetic similarity
I'm in molecular bio/biochem though not epigenetics specifically. In theory genetic and epigenetic signals could be analyzed similarly - essentially you would get back sequence data with an additional one or more dimensions indicating the presence or absence of some modifications (DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and a few others) on a particular gene/sequence.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But you're right to be skeptical. Only some epigenetic modifications are well understood, but even that can be very useful. The worst problem is that DNA modification/expression is <em>highly</em> tissue dependent - the only real difference between retina cell and heart muscle is gene expression. It has been shown that epigenetic silencing of certain genes can be heritable, but to my knowledge it's still an active area of research how exactly that plays out within a zygote (let alone, one that splits). </p>
<p>I do know of one study (danish or swedish population, I believe) that showed that height was in part effected by food availability two generations ago. That is to say, if grandpa was hungry, the child would grow up disproportionately tall (iirc). For me that was really convincing evidence of some interesting mechanisms of heritability beyond mere genetics. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>but that the environmental component is probably due to peers and random life events, and is not strongly influenced by parenting as most people assume</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot remember the exact study now, but I recall reading something a year or two ago about how children develop accents and ways of pronouncing words where they may be exposed to multiple variants. It seems that children adopt ways of speaking that are inherently the most advantageous to their environment (e.g. the one that has most acceptance in the situations they are exposed to). This makes sense, otherwise children of immigrants would never shed the accents of their parents and/or family.</p>
<p>Given that this is true, I can see how the same system would apply to the adoption of behavioral characteristics as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. You bring up a great example of an area where peers influence development more than parents. It is well-established in psycholinguistics that accents are shaped much much more strongly by peers than parents. This is obvious if you know an immigrant with native-born children. For example if a couple from the UK move to the US and then have children, the children will have American accents not British ones (unless they are surrounded by peers with British accents for some reason).</p>
<p>My graduate advisor passed along an unpublished master's thesis to me that he had supervised, and that argued and offered some evidence for accent being strongly tied to group identification. That is, we naturally use accent as a marker of in-group/out-group (and some of its features may have even evolved for this purpose). </p></div>		</li>
