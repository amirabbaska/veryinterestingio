			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! Would breathing be any different than at sea level? Not necessarily difficult, but like with high altitude, different? Would it be like blood doping where you could run/exercise longer, harder, and faster? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who was born and raised in Denver, I have often found I have a much higher stamina when at sea level. I can run for what feels like forever, and seem to recover much quicker.</p>
<p>Side note: High altitude makes alcohol affect people more strongly, and the reverse is also true. When I would go back to college (at sea level) after a summer reacclimating to being home, I was invincible at drinking contests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, as your comments and some others have pointed out.  Simplifying it down some, it comes to the amount of oxygen that can be absorbed into your lungs.</p>
<p>As you go higher the air is less dense and so there is less atoms of air per lung full.  This means you have to breath more to get the same effect.  The reverse is also true.</p>
<p>The other effect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing#Composition" target="_blank">air composition vs exhaled air</a>  We breath in 20.8% oxygen and breath out about 14.8% oxygen.  If instead you increased the concentration of oxygen by 25%, you have increased your usable oxygen by about 100%.</p>
<p>Again there can be such a thing as too much oxygen, but slight increases would have improved effects.</p>
<p>Seemingly you could adjust the air pressure and gasses concentrations to the minimal amount your body could stand for training.  And then adjust to the max your body could use without being detrimental to give you max performance.  The amounts would vary by person and by how much they trained.  I lack the medical knowledge to suggest more than the concept.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you and great question, I should have mentioned this in the original comment. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_narcosis" target="_blank">Nitrogen narcosis</a> has similar effects to inhaling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide" target="_blank">Nitrous oxide aka laughing gas</a>  It goes from mild drunkenness state to rendering you unconscious.  It would start to become a real concern at -16,000 ft. below sea level but could start to effect some individuals at a much higher altitude.  Even if you did pass out, as long as you were moved back up to a higher altitude you would be fine.   This is starkly different from Oxygen poisoning which can come on fast and will kill.</p></div>		</li>
