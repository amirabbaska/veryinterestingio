			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard the ovulation syncing is a myth, yet I feel I have seen it take place dozens of times. I used to work in a college veterinary hospital, and the students are about 85% women. They do 6-8 month stretches in-clinic working with a specific group of fellow students, and near the end of each stretch they would all complain about synced cycles. As a dude, I have obviously have little experience personally, but I'm pretty sure it's a real phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At this point it's almost an old wives tale. Note that people ascribe all kinds of explanations and powers to all sorts of things with little evidence. </p>
