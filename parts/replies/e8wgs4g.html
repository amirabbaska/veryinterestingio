<p>Dry drowning is a term that has never had an accepted medical definition, and that is currently medically discredited.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-Hawkins_EMN_2017-56" target="_blank">[56]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-57" target="_blank">[57]</a> Following the 2002 World Congress on Drowning in Amsterdam, a consensus definition of drowning was established. Based on this definition, drowning is the &quot;process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid.&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-Drowning_2006-58" target="_blank">[58]</a> This definition resulted in only three legitimate drowning subsets: fatal drowning, non-fatal drowning with illness/injury, and non-fatal drowning without illness/injury.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-59" target="_blank">[59]</a>In response, major medical consensus organizations have adopted this definition worldwide and have officially discouraged any medical or publication use of the term &quot;dry drowning&quot;.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-Hawkins_EMN_2017-56" target="_blank">[56]</a> Such organizations include the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-ILCOR_2003-60" target="_blank">[60]</a>the Wilderness Medical Society,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-61" target="_blank">[61]</a> the American Heart Association,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-62" target="_blank">[62]</a> the Utstein Style system,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-ILCOR_2003-60" target="_blank">[60]</a> the International Lifesaving Federation,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-63" target="_blank">[63]</a> the International Conference on Drowning,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-Drowning_2006-58" target="_blank">[58]</a> Starfish Aquatics Institute,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-64" target="_blank">[64]</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross" target="_blank">American Red Cross</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-65" target="_blank">[65]</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC),<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-66" target="_blank">[66]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-67" target="_blank">[67]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-68" target="_blank">[68]</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-69" target="_blank">[69]</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Emergency_Physicians" target="_blank">American College of Emergency Physicians</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-70" target="_blank">[70]</a></p>
<p>Drowning experts have recognized that the end result pathophysiology of hypoxemia, acidemia, and eventual death is the same whether water entered the lung or not. As this distinction does not change management or prognosis, but causes significant confusion due to alternate definitions and misunderstandings, it is generally established that pathophysiological discussions of &quot;dry&quot; versus &quot;wet&quot; drowning are not relevant to drowning care.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-71" target="_blank">[71]</a></p>
<p>&quot;Dry drowning&quot; is frequently cited in the news with a wide variety of definitions.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-ACEP2017-72" target="_blank">[72]</a> and is often confused with the equally inappropriate and discredited term &quot;secondary drowning&quot; or &quot;delayed drowning&quot;.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-73" target="_blank">[73]</a> Various conditions including spontaneous pneumothorax, chemical pneumonitis, bacterial or viral pneumonia, head injury, asthma, heart attack, and chest trauma have been misattributed to the erroneous terms &quot;delayed drowning&quot;, &quot;secondary drowning&quot;, and &quot;dry drowning&quot;. Currently, there has never been a case identified in the medical literature where a person was observed to be without symptoms and who died hours or days later as a direct result of drowning alone.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning#cite_note-Hawkins_EMN_2017-56" target="_blank">[56]</a></p>

<p>So I'm not real clear what &quot;dry drowning is. Can you explain that another way please? I posted from the Wiki article to show that I DID Google it and failed to understand...not to &quot;show you up.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You start drowning and inhale some water while panicking, and the water goes into your lungs. The lifeguards pull you out, and you’re ok. However, the water is still in your lungs. This damages your lungs, and causes them to not work well. Within a few hours, you start coughing and having trouble breathing. No one around you knows what to do because it’s been hours and the drowning incident is probably forgotten (or they didn’t see/you were too embarrassed to tell). You start to suffocate as your body can’t get enough oxygen and rid itself of CO2, and you end up dying. That’s basically the gist of it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Could you explain  &quot;dry drowning.&quot;  in another way [lease? I understand aspiration. Is it just fluids produced by the lungs in response to being irritated by the water from the aspiration event?</p></div>		</li>
