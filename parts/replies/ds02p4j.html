			<div class="markdown"><p>On the first point you're not providing all the information. Besides the fact that the US provides more in total aid than any other country (though not the highest percentage of budget or GDP), US private giving <strong>far</strong> surpasses that of other countries.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also didn't provide all the information. America's also far larger than a lot of other 1st world nations in terms of population and economy. Per OECD the U.S. was #20 out of 28 DAC members in 2015 in foreign aid given as a percentage of GNI.</p>
<p>I don't think the guy you responded to was trying to make the U.S. sound greedy, though seems like you're trying to slant it the other way by omitting certain information in the manner you're accusing OP of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He certainly didn't provide a balanced picture in his first point --- and I specifically mentioned that the US was not at the top in terms of GDP or budget, perhaps I forgot to mention per capita. If you compare all the EU ($123/person) and the US ($95/person), it's not a huge difference ... and, again, this is not accounting for private giving, which, again, the US leads by an <strong>order of magnitude</strong>. US private giving is literally off the chart in the link above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to all of that, it isn't clear that spending more money is going to help solve the issues mentioned. Homelessness isn't going to be solved by throwing money at the problem, it is more a mental illness issue than anything. Drug problems again aren't an issue of money, you can't stop opiate addicts by pegging them in the face with a wad of cash. The healthcare issues of the US again aren't going to be solved with money as if anything we spend far too much already. And finally &quot;infrastructure problems&quot; aren't due to a lack of funds but rather a lack of investment; the money is there if there was just a will to spend it wisely.</p></div>		</li>
