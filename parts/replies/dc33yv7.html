</blockquote>
<p>This isn't accurate. Acne is caused by increased release of oils from glands in the skin, plus proliferation of a bacterium known as P <em>acnes</em>, plus proliferation of skin cells, plus inflammation driven by the immune system.</p>
<p>Yes, we believe acne is so common during puberty because of an increase in hormones. But unless you want to call puberty itself a hormonal imbalance, it's not an imbalance.</p>
<p>Also, cortisol and adrenaline are not currently known as major contributing factors to acne.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, acne is caused by hormonal imbalances. Hormones such as testosterone and particularly DHT can trigger an overproduction of sebum and irregularities in skin cell proliferation and keratinization. These same hormones are responsible for male-pattern baldness and PCOS in women. Stress, poor sleep, and high-glycemic, low nutrient diets can contribute to these hormone imbalances.</p></div>		</li>
