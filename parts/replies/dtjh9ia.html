			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily.  We have had some success with similar diseases within isolated populations (see Jewish communities and Tay-Sachs rates) but it requires scrupulous record keeping and genetic testing to prevent genetic mixing which allows the carriers to drop out of the line.  </p>
<p>On the other hand you'll see Crigler Najjar Syndrome, the 'blue light children' of the Amish/Mennonites.  The disease is rare to survive into adulthood even with treatment, but the prevalence of the genes is enough to make almost every case in the world come from a 50 mile radius.  </p>
<p>Barring Bene Gesserit style eugenics you'll never rid the world of a genetic disorder as prevalent as sickle cell.  You can select against it, do preventative abortions in those who have it if it displays in utero, but honestly you're kinda hosed without the population deciding of its own volition to isolate carriers to non-carriers and either breed in-vitro or use testing to 'thin lines'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really because sickle cell doesn't really effect birth rate anymore. Someone who has sickle cell will still easily live to 30 and have a few kids on the way. You can also be a carrier for sickle cell, in which case there is a 0% chance that natural selection weeds it out. Natural selection doesn't really change anything that doesn't stop you from having kids. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Noooooot quite. </p>
<p>It's not like Natural Selection says 'OK, done with that! Now everyone with the carrier gene will just die'</p>
<p>Gene carriers can pass the gene onto their offspring without a corresponding decrease in reproduction.</p>
<p>And that's all natural selection is, at its heart. Traits that help an organism outcompete its romantic rivals tend to be passed on. Traits that prevent an organism from romantic competition tend to not get passed on. Traits that do not affect survival/reproduction one way or the other get passed on because there's no pressure to deselect for them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Natural selection selects for sickle cell because sickle cell is a survival trait</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not exactly. There are different selection factors, and none of them are exactly selecting <em>for</em> sickle cell, but instead are selecting against the susceptibility to malaria.</p>
<p>Also, unless something's changed since I was in college, it turns out that most of the supposed characteristics of CF carriers that made it possibly beneficial in some way didn't pan out. In fact, COPD along with a multitude of other illnesses in the past might have been mistaken for CF by paleontologists(?)[whoever studies old diseases], but we didn't have a clinic diagnosis until somewhere around 1930-40, I think. I dunno, it's been a while, but I did do some research work on gene therapy for CF back about a decade ago.</p></div>		</li>
