			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a fantastic comment that seems legit and I agree with - but how does more muscle not help you throw missiles faster? Genuinely curious as intuitively it doesn't make sense to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, for starters, it's worth noting that humans are <em>much</em> better at throwing stuff than chimpanzees or gorillas. Even an 11 year old little league pitcher outclasses them on throwing ability despite being much, much weaker. To get reach and accuracy, you're throwing rocks that are small and light compared to the weight of your arm. To do that well, you need arms that are long (to get leverage), skinny (if they're heavy, they'll be hard to swing really fast) and accurate. You need your ligaments to store energy elastically instead of powering through the movement; you need strong core body and shoulders relative to the weight of your arms, which are mostly providing just leverage. You need <em>enough</em> muscle, but after that huge strong arms don't help at all. Look at top baseball pitchers as an example. For throwing much heavier objects than mere rocks, you need more strength, but still - look at pictures of olympic javelin throwers, which have the best shape humanly possible for throwing things very far - they're extremely fit but their arms still are quite small compared to even an amateur bodybuilder; if more arm muscle would help, they would train until they'd look like olympic shot put guys, but they don't.</p>
<p>Also, compare chimpanzee arms and gorilla arms - chimpanzees throw much better than gorillas despite being much weaker; gorillas can lob a heavy boulder, but a small, fast stone is more damaging and has more reach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on the throwing, I've read somewhere that our shoulders allow us to do overhead accurate throws that other primates can't do without getting injured, and that was a factor of success when our ancestors had beef with Neanderthals</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing worth noting is that throwing and catching requires complex mathematical calculations that humans can do instinctively. It wouldn't be surprising if the human ability to do math is a side effect of humans being able to throw things accurately - evolving to be able to accurately throw things was a huge survival advantage, and then it probably got repurposed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's partially about dimishing returns. You can build as much muscle as possible, which will require tons of calories every day to maintain, but double the muscle mass doesn't equal to doubled spear throwing speed/distance. You might get 20% faster/further of a spear throw.</p>
<p>You are also sort of hard capped by bones (joints), ligaments, and tendons. You can have insane amounts of muscle, but if the force you generate with that muscle breaks or dislocates your shoulder each time, it's sort of worthless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends, big bulky muscles could prevent the optimal technique.</p>
<p>Probably why American quarterbacks are usually muscular but lieth in comparison to defence who will be beefcakes.</p>
<p>Propulsion requires long ropey flexible muscles, not weak but also not bulky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most accurate and relevant answer.  Humans need to workout, because humans have the evolutionary advantage of being able to shed muscle mass to avoid starvation that other animals lack.</p>
<p>We didn't get short-changed.  We got a power that's just not as relevant in a world of plenty as it was in a world of need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just an interesting fact, we actually have lots of &quot;unnecessary&quot; muscle tissue, morbid examle but Holocaust and other work camp survivors had no trouble walking, etc even when you can see the shape of their bones through the skin everywhere on their bodies. Really, we only need a fraction of what we have to move around. (But there is a reason we have this extra muscle, for example we use different muscle fibers in the same muscle so while some fibers rest the others work, increasing our endurance)</p></div>		</li>
