			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. According to my grandparents who were super into tracking family history, I have ancestors who were in the US/Colonies pre-revolution. My ancestry is so diluted after that many generations that there is no point in saying I'm anything other than American.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how I feel too even though I have some Irish family as recently as a great grandmother. Most of my family has been in America for longer than we can track without help though so I feel like I don't really have any heritage. We have no customs or anything tying us to another country really. I always wanted to be Japanese or Swedish or Mexican, anyone with some cool heritage other than &quot;we've been perfecting the hamburger patty in my family for 50 years....&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Traditions have to start somewhere! You can start some family traditions today! And there's no reason you can't pull a bit from other cultures. You want to be Japanese? Read into their culture and use some of it. Some people call it culture stealing but that is what Japanese culture is, if you look at its history. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true of both sides of my family but I have a very very obvious French last name so people are constantly asking 'are you French?'</p>
<p>I used to answer 'No. I'm American.' But that seemed to annoy a lot of people.</p>
<p>Now I typically respond with 'The name is but I'm not.' People seem okay with that one. </p>
<p>It has made me look at Americans obsession with hyphenating their ethnicity.</p>
<p>Even though both sides of my family have been in North America for around 250 years other people still want me be 'French - American' for some reason even if it's meaningless in any practical sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father emigrated to the states with his parents as a teenager. I grew up with the accent in my house, in fact sometimes I do pronounce certain words that people do a double-take at and ask me if I grew up in Boston (I didn't, born and raised in Seattle). Still though, I don't identify as &quot;English-American&quot; because that is not what I am. I was born here which makes me American.
It always baffles me when someone will claim to be Italian, German, Irish etc when their family has been in the US for multiple generations. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's partly a byproduct of /u/TheNaughtyMonkey's second point. The 19th century immigration waves led to heavily segregated immigrant communities, which gave rise to their own specific identities and cultures which evolved over time. There's no relatively well established &quot;English-American&quot; culture for you to identify with the way someone with Italian heritage can identify with Italian-American culture. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I think it has a lot to do with how important that heritage is to the family, which seems to stem in part from the reason for coming to the US and in part from whether the family historically lived in an ethnic community.</p>
<p>My family on my father's side immigrated from Germany shortly before Hitler's rise to power; they didn't live in an ethnic German community, and has reason not to make much of their heritage. They were proud to get citizenship and would have been upset at my father if he'd called himself &quot;German-American&quot;.</p>
<p>Contrast to people who immigrated during the 19th Century economic boom and lived in &quot;Germantown&quot; areas, and they are proud to be &quot;German-American&quot; because the German part of that identity was how they found their safety and community support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Franco-American is very similar.  We're just run-of-the-mill Americans because most of our families emigrated from France to Canada and the States so long ago that there's really not much cultural identity left (except in some cases, such as Cajuns in the south or Quebecois in Canada).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the contrary, much of northern New England is still very cognizant of their French or Québécois origin; some towns in Maine and New Hampshire are still majority Francophone. Manchester and Portland, their largest cities, have sugar shacks and poutine joints just like Montreal. Many left Canada around the early 1900s to work in the region's mills, so about as recently as many Irish- and Italian-Americans. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't get me wrong, we are (I am) very cognizant of our heritage!  My mother-in-law grew up speaking French in Berlin and my grandfather speaking French in Nashua.  I've lived in Manchester or suburbs of Manchester for most of my life.  I just think it's more of a regional culture that came from our heritage than it is identifying with our French heritage.  </p>
<p>I mean that, growing up around Nashua and Manchester as a 4th-generation American, I know plenty of people who aren't of French or French-Canadian heritage who appreciate and enjoy those aspects of Franco-American heritage as just part of the culture of our cities.  I see it differently than being in an Italian-American family and having Italian pride and identifying with Italian culture, I guess?  I'm not sure how to put it but hopefully you understand what I'm saying.</p>
<p>EDIT: thought of a different way of putting it; mainly I think that since it's such an ingrained part of our local culture that we don't normally separate the Franco-American aspects of it from the rest of it, so there is just this overall Franco-American flavor here that everyone accepts and acknowledges without anyone being very vocal about it.  Being on the inside of it my entire life, I guess I didn't consider that from the outside our entire local culture is very Franco-American influenced.  It's always just been an aspect of life to me.</p></div>		</li>
