<p>Red, Blue and Green are &quot;additive&quot; colours, meaning if you mix them perfectly you get white.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The colors aren't additive.</p>
<p>Light is additive.</p>
<p>If you mix red, green, and blue <em>light</em> you get a color which is <em>indistinguishable from white</em> to the human eye.</p>
<p>Pigment is subtractive. Red, green, and blue pigments are subtractive too, they're just not good choices for primary colors for pigments because you can't mix them to produce any other hue.</p>
<p>When dealing with mixing subtractive colors, cyan, magenta, and yellow are the appropriate primary colors.</p></div>		</li>
