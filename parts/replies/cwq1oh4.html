I've been told this is a really bad thing that will further increase Canada's dependency on resources, and I've also heard that this is great and Canada will profit a lot from it. What's the deal then? ELI5 please someone?</p></div>		</li>

<p>To an extent, free trade is about specialization.  The point is for every country to be good at something.  This means that we, as a planet, are good at everything, which makes goods more affordable to consumers, driving up the standard of living.</p>
<p>It does cause some short term problems for people in the industries that Canada's is weak in, as those industries shrink and they have to find new industries to work in but the long term good outweighs the short term problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds pretty good on the surface, but not every country is good at something. Moreover, not every country is good at something important. A country that doesn't produce goods which everyone wants will be left behind in this case. The consumers can only buy these inexpensive goods when they have the income for it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I like this language to describe free trade. It's a good way to frame it, although it does kind of gloss over the fact that if you work in an industry your country is inefficient in, you might be in trouble. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Article 18.2: Objectives</p>
<p>The protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights should
contribute to the promotion of technological innovation and to the transfer and
dissemination of technology, to the mutual advantage of producers and users of
technological knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare,
and to a balance of rights and obligations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) on the basis of the life of a natural person, the term shall be not less than the life of the author and 70 years after the authorâ€™s death; and  </p>
<p>(b)  on a basis other than the life of a natural person, the term shall be:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) not less than 70 years from the end of the calendar year of the first authorized publication of the work, performance or phonogram; or  </p>
<p>(ii) failing such authorized publication within 25 years from the creation of the work, performance or phonogram, not less than 70 years from the end of the calendar year of the creation of the work, performance or phonogram.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>That completely contradicts the objectives. How can increasing copyrights to a psychotically long time <em>promote</em> <em>technological innovation</em> and the <em>dissemination of technology</em>? It specifically avoids both of those things by preventing people from (a) expanding upon previous work that is held in copyright; and (b) prevents the copyrighted technology from being easily distributed (i.e. disseminated). The agreement outright lies about what it does for a very significant part of it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I take this as protecting companies like Disney who have well known mascots or ripping off music, games, and fiction.  Well, that's how I read that section anyway.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you read the definitions section, this includes books, music, and copyrighted programs. Music has long been a subject of dispute, with sampling and making covers, and books are, imo, the sort of thing that should become public domain shortly after the author dies as a benefit to society. Copyrighted programs (and I believe <em>processes</em>, which is a whole other load of bs, although I'm on mobile so I can't check the document right now), on the other hand, are not just games. They can be things that you would create on your own, not copying anybody and not realizing that there's a copyright, because you just needed your program to do something. But suddenly you find out that that process or, essentially, <em>idea</em>, is copyrighted and you have to figure out a different way to do the same thing. Which is just a massive tax on innovation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused why Disney needs a copyright on, e.g., Mickey Mouse. They already have a trademark that can be renewed indefinitely and can be used to prevent other businesses from using the image. What important thing does the copyright bring to the table?</p></div>		</li>
