<p>Or was that just woo?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a real scientific idea, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-electron_universe" target="_blank">one-electron universe</a>, where all (for example) electrons are identical because there's just one electron and it goes back and forth in time (when it goes backwards it looks to us like a positron, the antimatter partner of the electron).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems like it cannot be correct, because we see more matter than antimatter.  This conflicts with the one-electron universe idea, because for an electron over here to also be the electron over there, it must turn around (somewhere in our far future) and appear as a positron, and turn around again (somewhere in our far past) to appear as that other electron.  So, in a one-electron universe, we'd see at most one more electron than positron, but in our universe we see many more electrons than positrons.</p>
<p>Our current explanation for identical particles comes from quantum field theory, where particles are excitations of a universe-pervading quantum field.  So, the reason they're identical is that they're all &quot;lumps&quot; in the same &quot;rug&quot;.</p>
<p>edit to add:  Even in quantum field theory, it is perfectly legitimate to think of a positron as an electron going backwards in time.  It's just the notion that it's &quot;just one particle&quot; zipping back and forth across time that seems untrue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't the one-electron universe basically a highdea from John Weeler to Feynman as kind of a joke? I mean, I'm pretty sure he didn't mean it, he probably just thought it was funny that using Feynman diagrams, he could arrange them such that the universe only needed one electron.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you believe this brings anything interesting in a metaphysical sense to our understanding of the world? What potential inferences people could people make or have made from this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's a bit like reasoning about the wave function of the whole Universe. It's just reductionism and might explain the how the whole Universe will behave but it doesn't say what the things &quot;really are&quot;. Like we are only modelling and describing the inside view of the Universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be correct to say that elemental particles aren't a physical &quot;thing&quot;? Are they merely a construct we've imagined in our minds to describe a phenomena in space/time?</p>
<p>What I'm trying to ask here I suppose: do we know that an elemental particle is a physical &quot;thing&quot; or is it something undefinable that relates to space/time? Are they just energy that influences space/time?</p>
<p>I know people say they are &quot;fields&quot; but what is a field? Isn't a &quot;field&quot; just a generic description?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you go surfing at the beach, do you worry that the waves aren't real?  They're just the way energy moves from place to place across time?  Probably not.  You'd probably be happy to discuss particular waves, to catch particular waves, and you'd not concern yourself with the fact that it's all really the water moving up and down (and not moving along the direction the wave travels!).</p>
<p>In this example, the ocean is the field, and the waves are the excitations (the particles).  Human language wasn't designed and doesn't naturally accommodate the way we've found out the world really is at the bottom (or what we can see of it) :-/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So essentially elemental particles aren't physical things? Or is it rather that our concept of physicality becomes completely useless here? Our &quot;animal brains&quot; can't conceptualize it properly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're getting into philosophy of science territory. Are physical laws real or just formulas and models we make up? Are atoms real? Is software real? Is a phone a real thing real or just a collection of atoms? Is a photon real or just how we visualize energy in motion? Is energy real? It gets to how you define real and thing and other basic concepts.</p>
<p>My own nihilist take on it is that it doesn't matter. Physics and most sciences end up being about making models of the world that give you some predictive power. Is Newtonian physics real now that we know you have to correct for relativity? Sure, it's useful, it gives you good results, etc.</p>
<p>You do have some things that I'd say are physical, like a proton or a neutron, more conceptual like conservation of energy, real but not physical like energy, gravity, etc. Some in between things like magnetic fields, phonons, gluons, etc. Are all these real or models we use? My answer would be yes. </p></div>		</li>

I'm okay with math (engineering background), but I don't really want to get too bogged down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The go-to would be Feynman.  I would point to his messenger lectures (eg. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5RQ3QF9GGI" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5RQ3QF9GGI</a> ) and his QED lectures (starting with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMSgE62S6oo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMSgE62S6oo</a> ).  If you want to read I might recommend Our Mathematical Universe by Max Tegmark or The Beginning of Infinity by David Deutsch.  You have to be careful, because many people who write about quantum mechanics have not thought deeply about it.  I've also read The Theory of Almost Everything by Robert Oerter, which is okay.</p></div>		</li>
