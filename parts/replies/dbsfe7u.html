			<div class="markdown"><p>Ours are built the way they are because of sperm competition and veiled estrus.  Only the female human knows she is ovulating and gets to decide whom to mate with at that time.  Human males have proved to have increased sperm count when their mates are away and when back have a strong sexual urge to copulate immediately and use our shovel shaped glans and longer penis shaft to remove any competitors sperm that may or may not have been deposited while she was away.  It is argued that the better lover or one she was most attracted to and thus had orgasms with further increases the chances of impregnation as the cervix tilts into the vaginal sperm deposit.

<p>Penis size correlates with monogamy, the more monogamous, the smaller the size of the male reproductive set. Thus as we have the largest set by far, we're competing with other males in a polygamous situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up, Natural Selection can't neither promote or remove traits that are not linked to either number of descendants or surviving. A big/short penis that also delivers the same amount of semen and performs fine -and of course has no influence in survival- is NOT the target of the Natural Selection. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it can be the target of sexual selection.</p>
<p>Peacocks are a great example.  A huge tail on the males certainly hinders their ability to survive physically.  But its display helps them procreate.</p>
<p>I imagine that if humans never covered their genitals, and kept their male's penises on display, that there's be plenty of sexual selective pressure applied over the generations.</p>
<p>Look at <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Giovanni_Battista_Moroni_009.jpg/255px-Giovanni_Battista_Moroni_009.jpg" target="_blank">men's codpiece fashion</a> -- it is an attempt to make an externalized display of the penis to attract interested mates.  Or intimidate rivals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this actually isn't true. Here's some dick fun facts:</p>
<p>Penis shape and size is absolutely critical to the evolutionary process.  </p>
<p>Most animals actually have much less size variation than humans - which leads to the interesting question, why does it vary for humans?</p>
<p>I remember a few things from an evolutionary biology class, like the curve of a penis head is actually ideal for removing semen from a vagina.  You can read in between the lines, and figure out why that is important for passing your own genes on.</p>
<p>There were some decent explanations for variations in size for humans, but I can't remember them now.  I vaguely remember the professor talking about promiscuity being related to it - but I also vaguely remember him saying that was just a common &quot;myth&quot; which had no evidence for it (as in its false).  </p>
<p>But a basic understanding of penis shape plus a basic understanding of competition lets you hypothesize that if a certain populations vaginas / penises are generally wider in diameter, a person in that population that has a smaller penis would be less effective at impregnation.  So you have a pressure towards larger penis size within a population. Then why don't we all have 3 foot giant dongs?  Probably the usual downward pressure on anything size related for humans, which is usually caloric scarcity.  </p>
<p>... ok glad this is what I spent 10 minutes on writing out tonight.  Thanks college.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3128753.stm" target="_blank">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3128753.stm</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>New Scientist magazine reports they found the coronal ridge of the penis, found where the glans, or head, meets the shaft, could scoop out more than 90% of the cornstarch mixture with just one thrust.</p>
<p>A phallus with no coronal ridge only managed to remove 35%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They also say they have evidence, from surveys of students, to indicate that sex tends to be more energetic if the women is suspected of cheating, or if the couple has been apart - suggesting a sub-conscious desire on the part of the man to rid his partner of any trace of another's semen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yeah, a man's tool, is <em>actually</em> a tool designed (by selective pressure) to remove competitor's semen, and replace it with his own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, technically, he's right for dick lengths less than or equal to a woman's vaginal depth. Which is probably why the averages for dick and vagina size are close: a smaller dick wouldn't get all the way in, but a dick longer than a partner's vagina wouldn't have an advantage, meaning that the low end of the size range wouldn't be completely pushed out of the gene pool. At least that was how I was taught it. </p></div>		</li>
