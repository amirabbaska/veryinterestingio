			<div class="markdown"><p>Entropy also explains why even though all actions can be reversed in theory, in practice that doesn’t always happen.  For example, if you heat something up, you can cool it down. You can also move an object right, and then move it left back to its original position. But if you burn toast by heating it, you can’t cool it down to fix the burn. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The concept of entropy applies to the distribution of energy in closed systems that have a net total energy. So regardless of what you think you're &quot;reversing&quot; (heating/cooling/repositioning), energy is being spent and the net entropy of the closed system is still increasing overall. </p>
<p>Entropy doesn't care about localized &quot;reverses&quot; (e.g. star birth), it cares about the overall state of the closed system...which is the entire universe. </p>
<p>Oh and also it doesn't seem to apply at the quantum level, because quantum mechanics is just plain weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You touch on a very important point that confuses people first learning about entropy: you CAN have localized decreases in entropy, it’s the overall entropy of the entire system that must increase.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how come Sean Carroll can propose the idea that energy can burst forth from an empty vacuum? I could be describing this poorly, but I remember hearing him talking about it being merely probabilistic that in the universe over time entropy increases, and so time goes forward. But he also states that because it is probabilistic, it is possible that pockets of energy can spontaneously increase within this universe. He then goes on to say that our Big Bang could possibly have been one of these spontaneous events.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What we call 'time' is our perception of change as it occurs.      </p>

<p>This and quantification of change makes us experience some sort of 'flow' as changes happens one after another.     </p>
<p>Time does not exist, therefore neither 'time travel'.</p></div>		</li>
