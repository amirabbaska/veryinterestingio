			<div class="markdown"><p>Animals similar to us mostly grow two sets of teeth.  So we grow two sets of teeth, baby teeth, and adult teeth. </p>
<p>But our wisdom teeth come in late.</p>
<p>Now, what sort of evolutionary advantage does having an extra row of teeth really give you? How our gastrointestinal system is built is far more important to the amount of fiber we have in our diet than a bit of extra chewing surface.  I have no more difficult time eating some lettuce right now than I would if I had a few more teeth really. </p>
<p>The thing is a natural diet is hard on our teeth.  Teeth are built to fall out. Look at photographs of anyone from a culture without exposure to modern foods or dentistry.  Hunter gatherers, foragers, etc.  </p>
<p>Look at the Inuit.  Inuit never developed agriculture as such, but they don't have significantly wider jaws.  On the other hand, they also don't really have the mutation that causes wisdom teeth.</p>
<p>So from the Inuit example, if as protohominids we had more teeth, why is it that we would have got less and then got more, while the Inuit missed the opportunity to get those wisdom teeth back?</p>
<p>Similarly, why is it if we look at pictures of people from isolated cultures that have existed without widespread agriculture they don't have giant perfectly shaped jaws, but are often instead missing teeth?  </p>

<p>The thing is, we are adapted to be mobile, and we are adapted to use high energy food because of that.  We can't sit around like a cow chewing our cud and letting our multiple stomachs do the work.  We were never really able to do that.  We're smart though, and we've always been able to find sources of high energy foods, whether it be fruits, vegetables or meats.  There's never been a time when we've extracted most of our nutrition from fiber.</p>
<p>The thing about high energy foods is that they're high in sugars and carbohydrates. This is really great for the bacteria that live in our mouths, and this causes tooth decay.  Losing teeth has always been part of our life cycle.  Our teeth rot, they fall out.   </p>
<p>There's a mutation that causes us to grow some new teeth in adulthood.  This is an evolutionary advantage for the people who have lost their molars, and it persists.  People with that mutation have higher fecundity than those who have a hard time eating for lack of good teeth. Mothers are more fertile and have more milk. </p>
<p>On the other hand you have the Inuit.  Inuit diet is very different, they have very few fruits and vegetables available at all.  They eat mostly fish and whale and occasionally land animals. Fruits and berries seasonally are good and they have a nice sweet tooth, but its unavailable most of the time.  In their situation, their teeth don't rot the same way, the food is less acidic and less sugary.  Now having the wisdom teeth crowd the mouth is a disadvantage and it stops being expressed. </p>
<p>The reason wisdom teeth are a problem now is more because modern dentistry has caused our teeth to stop falling out. They wouldn't really be crowding a mouth that's lost a few teeth, they were helping.  Now we stop losing teeth.  But ironically there's no evolutionary pressure to stop having wisdom teeth because no prospective mate is going to decide not to have kids because you got your wisdom teeth removed at 20. </p>
<p>But in a situation where diet caused a population to stop losing teeth, like the Inuit, there was that pressure, and they did stop getting them.  But first to stop getting them we had to START getting them somewhere along the line. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have that same advantage.  Time for us to start a eugenics program! </p>
<p>And also, this is exactly the right answer. It's also worth mentioning that our diets have not just undergone rapid change in the last 200,000 years, but again in just the last few decades with the onset of the industrial revolution and the foodstuff that changed as a result of it. So while our post-agricultural ancestors (with their terrible teeth) ate very differently than <strong>their</strong> hunter gatherer ancestors, in many places it wasn't that different since they still had your standard animal products and vegetation, even if it was being raised a little differently. Their meat was still the same meat, for example, that was eaten in the generations prior.  Modern meat is actually quite different:  more fat, lower nutrient density, less vitamin content, etc.  Because our animals are raised and eat 100% differently than <strong>their</strong> ancestors did. And so on.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>African Americans were a dream patient when I was cleaning teeth. It's like working on a 1956 Ford truck, plenty of room under the hood. The opposite would be a 5'1'' Filipino woman. There was... no room for activities. I don't want to sound overly general, I had plenty of white dudes with big jaws as well, but there was a definite difference on average.</p>
<p>Smaller jaws do cause crowding. Many people assume wisdom teeth caused crowding, but jaw size seemed to be the primary factor. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Fucking tiny jaw, had to get 6 baby teeth removed cause they weren't coming out (11 yrs old) turns out they all had full roots. Luckily dentist said they don't think I'm going to get wisdom teeth!</p></div>		</li>
