			<div class="markdown"><p>There is that. But mostly, you have to factor in that depositional processes in ore deposits are incremental, so that when a supercritical mass of fissile material is reached, it will be marginally so, not massively so. And of course, a lot of gangue will be involved which would interfere with any kind of bomb-like behavior.</p>
<p>The best analogue would be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizzle_(nuclear_test\)" target="_blank">nuclear fizzle</a> than a nuclear bomb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is it is incredibly unlikely that a critical mass could ever develop naturally on Earth. Even if some strange phenomenon was segregating fissile U in a particular sediment, it would be occurring on a geologic timescale. i.e. the slowly building sub-critical mass would be consuming itself as fuel at a rate likely faster than the incoming deposits. However, I agree that even if the deposits were coming in at a faster rate than the burn, there would certainly be no detonation...the barely supercritical mass would fizzle at best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>U235 is fissile, or it produces more reaction inducing neutrons than it consumes. U238 is not fissile, it consumes more than it releases. </p>
<p>Natural uranium now contains mostly u238 because u235 decays much faster. </p>
<p>A billion years ago, you would have had enough u235 in natural uranium to make a spontaneous reactor. Now, the uranium must be enriched - a process that alters the ratio of 235 to 238.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only does it have to be very pure (which is naturally occurring, but still needs to be separated from lower-enriched isotopes), but for the sort of detonation OP is probably thinking of, a man-made chain reaction is almost certainly necessary.  If you wanted to be pedantic, there probably is somewhere in the cosmos where these conditions are met, but it's irrelevant to this discussion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, you got it. The problem is maintaining compression. Loosely speaking, criticality is related to volume. During detonation, as the fuel fissions it tends to expand (because it's exploding), which increases the volume and slows the reaction down until it goes subcritical and stops fissioning. In a nuclear weapon, you use a compression shockwave to hold the fuel together for as long as possible, so that you get the maximum amount of the fuel fissioned before it expands too much to sustain the reaction. All this happens on the time scale of nanoseconds.</p>
<p>This compression wave has to be very very precise. Imagine trying to squeeze a water balloon very tightly from all directions. If your force is just a little bit uneven the water will squeeze its way out. Because of the precision required, the type of nuclear detonation seen in a bomb is unlikely to happen in nature.</p>
<p>Side note, I've always been fascinated by the idea of a fission-based life form. I imagine some sort of super creature, like small planet sized that forms around a core of fissioning material and lives off of the heat.</p>
<p>Edit: the same general idea applies to fusion weapons as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's another part of it, bomb fuels are metal phase. Another is the contamination of isotopes that are spontaneous neutron sources means that likely any assembled critical mass would start to detonate prematurely. The criticality of a system isn't affected by the presence of a source, but it's a source of neutrons that <em>starts</em> the detonation. </p>
<p>In a fission bomb the fuel is kept in a subcritical state. The shockwave of the explosion compresses it, which drives up its neutron multiplication (how many neutrons are produced for each neutron injected in a chain reaction) but in the ideal there is no fission yet because there are no neutrons to start the reactions. During compression, right as the multiplication is at its maximum a device called the initiator triggers and injects a bunch of neutrons into the fuel, which then kick off the chain reaction.</p>
<p>The reason bombs need to be so isotopically pure is that other isotopes of uranium and plutonium will spontaneously emit neutrons. So if you're contaminated with those other isotopes it will inject neutrons prematurely while you're still compressing the fuel to its optimal density, meaning that it starts to explode and push itself apart before it can really kick off a real detonation. Because of the way the isotopes form it's basically not possible to get bomb fuel pure enough to avoid this pre-detonation in nature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is a few days later, but would the original isotopic mix of U-235 vs U-238 even allow for a detonation? The sources I've been able to find indicate that the isotopic ratio as formed in supernovae is about 1.65 or so (U235 to U238). That's a very nice and rich source, making it comparatively easy to make natural reactors, but even if you were to have enough metallic Uranium immediately after a supernova, would that be sufficient for an explosion?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think you're thinking in a correct scale frame for the early solar system, though. When you have a collision between two pieces of rock hundreds or thousands kilometres in size, moving at tens kilometres per second, there is a large volume of rock that, for tens of seconds, does not have anywhere to go (unlike the material in an early Kim Jong Un's fizzle). It can only compress, and at first it will compress from all directions. The pressure is far higher than anything conventional explosives can attain, the compression occurs extremely rapidly, and is maintained for a comparatively long time (tens of seconds). </p>
<p>Think of putting your water balloon at the bottom of the ocean, and then hitting the ocean from above with a giant meteorite. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes... but that compression is not acting on isotopically pure fuel (which doesn't really exist in nature) in just the right geometric configuration. I don't think it's literally impossible that it could happen, just so remotely unlikely that it won't happen.</p>
<p>I should add that I'm not talking about a naturally occurring chain reaction, that's certainly possible. Nor just <em>an</em> explosion from sudden natural fission. I'm talking about a full yield explosion, where most of the fuel is burned almost instantaneously. It's not the force required (it's not that much, only a few hundred kg of explosives does the trick) it's the materials and precision.</p></div>		</li>
