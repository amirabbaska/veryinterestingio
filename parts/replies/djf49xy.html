			<div class="markdown"><p>You pose a surprisingly hard-to-answer question. In most of the cases, amorphous solids form because the freezing liquid gets &quot;trapped&quot; in a non-crystalline structure, which often has a structure which is more similar to a liquid than to a crystal, when cooled &quot;too fast&quot; (I'm putting quotes around expressions that are both technical and purposely vague). The substance undergoing such transformation ends up in a phase that is said to be metastable. It means that the phase itself is technically not the most stable phase, but it's stable on the timescale of the experiment (or, some times, for even longer times, as it happens for amorphous ice or amorphous silica, aka window glass)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For example: if you very quickly cool water, then the atoms don't have time to rearrange into a crystalline structure - they freeze in place, as amorphous ice.</p>
<p>The same result can be achieved by saturating water with sugar - that lowers the freezing temperature so far that the solution solidifies into an amorphous structure before freezing properly. The transition is defined when viscosity surpasses a certain level. </p>
<p>That's the strategy some organisms use to survive cold temperatures - there's a frog that basically forms this amorphous glassy state when it gets very cold.</p></div>		</li>

<p>amorphous ice, which is the most plentiful kind of ice(in the universe).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea that amorphous ice is the most plentiful in the universe has been the assumption for a long time, but lately there seems to be a lot of questions whether this is actually true.</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom was that ice is initially crystalline when freezing, but then space weathering (cosmic rays, high-energy particles from the solar wind, etc.) slowly erodes the crystal structure and makes defects, eventually turning it into amorphous ice.</p>
<p>Now if that's true, we should see plenty of amorphous ice in places like the Kuiper Belt, where it's far too cold for ice to melt and refreeze in crystalline form, and space weathering should have long ago turned these ices amorphous...right? Except that when we look at these objects, we still see spectra of crystalline ice. Clearly we're still missing part of the picture here.</p>
<p>On top of that, you've also got what is quite likely a huge amount of very hot, very high-pressure Ice XI trapped in the cores of the giant planets. For Jupiter alone this is likely around 15 - 20 Earth-masses, so there's quite a bit more ice there than the rest of the planets and moons combined, although it's still unclear how that compares to the mass of ice in the Oort cloud (which may or may not be amorphous).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, and what is the difference between the different type of ice ? Does water crystallise more like a metal or like a polymer ? What is the microscopic arrangement of ice ? (Sorry for all these questions)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, a molecule of water is a tetrahedron, which means it has 4 &quot;parts&quot;, the 2 hydrogens, the 1 oxygen, and another molecule of water. Tetrahedrons have, by nature, more than 1 configuration. You might have 2 hydrogens and 1 oxygen on the bottom, and the next molecule on top. Or the next molecule on the bottom, the 2 hydrogen on the bottom, and the oxygen on the top. </p>
<p>You can shuffle around a lot of configurations with this model, which is why there's around 17 different forms. There are even forms of ice that've been <em>perdicted</em> to exist on computer simulations, but haven't been actually found/made in real life. </p></div>		</li>
