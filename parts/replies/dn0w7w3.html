			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a high tolerance to pain... pretty regular but both times I broke my arm for the first 30 mins or so I didn't feel the pain all that much and then it started to hurt like a motherfucker.</p>
<p>For example, the first time I broke my arm, I fell of the bike and I broke both bones connecting the elbow to hand (Radius and Ulna as told by google). And it was a serious injury, both bones snapped off and disconnected completely and were almost protruding through my skin.</p>
<p>I stood up, my knees hurt like hell, and while I saw that something is wrong with my arm, it didn't hurt. I took my bike and cycled around 3km to my home. Got beaten by my mother for making her worry (she doesn't deal with pressure well). Once I arrived home it started to hurt like a motherfucker, and I cried all the time before I was taken to ER, my bones fixed and cast was put on my arm.</p></div>		</li>
