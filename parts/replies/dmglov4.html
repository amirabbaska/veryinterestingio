			<div class="markdown"><p>Those times you mentioned are only if you have a decent sleep schedule, so only if you go to bed around the same time every night / most times and get up at roughly the same time.</p>
<p>Someone who goes to sleep at 3 am every night and wakes up around noon every day will have their melatonin work later.</p>
<p>Additionally, light helps a lot. If you're tired and sleepy due to sleeping too long, turn up the light real bright or sit in the sun for a bit, since light breaks down melatonin. Which is why looking at screens in bed before falling asleep is so bad,and why wake up lights as an alarm are so effective. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Shift workers can have it rough with out a decent &quot;bed time routine&quot;.</p>
<p>Blue light is especially bad if I understand right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a shift worker (work continental shifts) I can confirm that the days I go to sleep about 9am, but sleep until 6pm I am bright eyes and bushy tailed for the 12 hour shift. </p>
<p>But if I sleep today 2pm get up get something to drink, bathroom break ECT then go back to sleep until 6pm I feel like a bag of crap run over for the first 5 hours of my shift. Then wake up fully and a great end of shift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Been doing it for the past 5 years or so. And I've been in various education programs that often required I shift from nights to days to nights to days. The only reason I survived it is because generally I can just sleep when I need to and I don't have issues falling asleep. Otherwise it would have killed me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My sleep has been completely erratic for about a year now. I want to have a normal sleep schedule but I'm generally not tired at all around a 'normal' bed time, regardless of when I woke up in the morning (if I got up in the morning). </p>
<p>I feel like I'm on a 26-30 hour day and my sleep keeps shifting further forward (in a 24 hour day) until it completely cycles around again.  </p>
<p>Do you have any tips for getting back to normal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Choose a time you would realistically like to fall asleep and wake up every day. Take melatonin supplements 30 minutes before you want to fall asleep and use only essential lights (no reddit or other screen time). Set alarm for whatever time you want to be up (ideally 7-8 hours after sleep time) and actually get up and turn lights on, open curtains/blinds if it's light outside. Repeat for 3-5 days with the melatonin supplements and then try the same schedule without the supplements. Hopefully by this time your body will naturally produce melatonin and you will get even better sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never wake up refreshed. I have alpha wave intrusion and I go into R.E.M. sleep right away when I fall asleep - if you're someone consistently tired when you wake up, you should get a sleep study! Restless leg syndrome and sleep apnea can also cause tiredness as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My husband finally got diagnosed with sleep apnea and is having surgery next week because he's a textbook example of someone whose anatomy causes the apnea. (i.e. he isn't overweight, he just has a fucked up septum, uvula, and tonsils.) He went to an ENT who had him do an at-home sleep study for a few nights. They sent him a kit from some lab and he had to wear sensors and ledes overnight for 3 nights and then send the kit back with the data recorded in it. Make sure the lab is in-network if you're in the US because ours wasn't and we had to pay $160 out of pocket for the sleep study. We hit our family out of pocket max for the year because I had twins and that was super expensive, so at least his surgery is 100% covered. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My doctor ordered a sleep study for me, but unfortunately, my insurance wouldn't cover a true study, so they gave me a take home test. It's basically only good for detecting sleep apnea.</p>
<p>Because thats the most likely case for most people, it makes sense, but I'm struggling now to get a regular study approved. My take home found I have very mild apnea, but hardly worth treating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. I went from sleeping on a couch for 3 years, which gave me the worse sleep and back pain of my life. I woke up sometimes every hour until my alarm went off for work. Every single day I was extremely tired and exhausted as soon as I woke up. It was a absolute nightmare. </p>
<p>Now I bought a house and have a temperpedic mattress I only wake up 1 time to pee in the night at most and no more back pain. I wake up feeling decent most mornings even with 6 hours of sleep. I honestly did not know what a difference it made.</p></div>		</li>
