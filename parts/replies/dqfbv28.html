			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting to hear. I visited Japan for the first time a few months ago and while exiting a museum I nodded at the security guard. Just a slight head nod and leaned my shoulders down slightly. Similar greeting given in the USA to acknowledge someone.</p>
<p>But the security guard gave me a full bow from the waist and I was like whoa oops I messed up. But reading this that now that it makes sense. I was Ã  patron and he should bow lower. I thought I had screwed up not bowing as low as he did.</p>
<p>But obviously it all worked out fine. I didn't get kicked out of the museum and the security guard opened the door for me after the exchange.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why in the UK you nod your head upwards when you make eye contact with a stranger (equivalent to asking &quot;Alright?&quot;). You nod down for acknoledgement and friends. It would work in Japan too, as then you aren't bowing to strangers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Upward head nod with eye contact for strangers, it's the same here in the US. I wonder how offended some would get if you did that in Japan. It's like the total opposite of a bow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously? I'm pretty sure that it's the opposite here in Slovenia. Nod down for people you don't know (well) and acknowledgement, and up for friends. The exception is when men are posturing, then it's up as well.</p>
<p>I always assumed it's the &quot;protect the throat&quot; reflex against strangers, &quot;expose the throat&quot; towards friends and also &quot;expose the throat to show you're not scared of them&quot; towards people you're trying to intimidate...</p></div>		</li>
