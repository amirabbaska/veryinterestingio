			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely. That or they have methods of taking in salt water, separating the salt+water and absorbing the water while expelling saltier water.</p>
<p>Salt in large quantities is also lethal to humans, we just can't absorb it very well through our skins, but if you ate tons of it, or sea water, you would die of dehydration as your kidneys can't make urine that is saltier then sea water, so you just accumulate salt as your body tries to get water while expelling excess salts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>just a question, but i'm someone who sweats a lot and sweat out a lot of salt during the day to the point where if i am wearing a dark shirt you will see the white stains that are salt.  But I like to mix in about a teaspoon of salt in my drinking water as i think I need to replenish that salt to stay 'normal' throughout the day.  Is this okay or no?</p></div>		</li>
