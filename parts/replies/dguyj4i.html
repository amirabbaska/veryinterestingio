			<div class="markdown"><p>But i mean it's a very common everyday question to ask someone their occupation, which often will signify to you a ballpark average figure for their salary, so technically shouldn't this question be deemed as rude as outright asking someone their salary?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Social norms don't work on those sort of technicalities. You might be able to infer a lot of things from socially acceptable questions, but those questions are considered removed enough from sensitive or taboo topics where they are acceptable. For example you can ask someone if they are married and if they say yes then you can infer that they are not a virgin. It's not acceptable to walk up to people and ask if they are a virgin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually in the UK is considered quite rude to directly ask someone their job like that. (It's one reason Americans are seen as a bit pushy and brusque.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in London, and I definitely would not say that its considered rude to ask someone their occupation. Phrases like 'so.. what do you do for a living' are almost a custom part of an introductory conversation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's easier to be vague, when asked about your occupation.  A garbageman can claim to work in 'waste management', while a neurosurgeon can claim to work 'in a manual position at a hospital'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just as easy to be vague about your salary.</p>
<p>You could simply reply with 'I earn over 30k' or 'Around 30k'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a more capitalist point of view, the higher wage would equate to amount of wealth generated. So if a person makes less, based on that one isolated criteria, the other person naturally feels like they're better, or vice versa. In my mind, it has become taboo because other criteria play roles in group success so the one capitalist metric would just appear misleading.</p></div>		</li>
