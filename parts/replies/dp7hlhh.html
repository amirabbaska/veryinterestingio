			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt he'd be alive for even a second. That flash of light is a spray of molten metal exploding out due to the force of the water in his body expanding rapidly into a steam cloud (at ~1800x the volume of the water it was made from) Remember that our body is about half water by mass, a little more by volume.</p>
<p>This is a bit like what happens when you <a href="https://youtu.be/NC45vREoEOg?t=169" target="_blank">pour water into an oil fire</a>, but at a <em>way</em> higher temperature and therefore a <em>lot</em> faster &amp; more powerful. Even if the heat doesn't kill him instantly, and his brain manages to retain its temperature enough that the water in it doesn't explode instantly, the sudden pressure of the rest of his body exploding would likely knock him unconscious pretty much instantly.</p>
<p>I expect the flash is partially the remaining parts of his body burning, too.</p>
<p>All in all, probably not the <em>worst</em> way to go...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thought that he would all be complete gone since it take quite a long time for a furnace to cool and  he would be totally consumed by the residual heat by time it did . </p>
<p>Maybe an smaller electric furnace to be able to shut down so fast ? or part of him was thrown free during the explosion ? what ever  nothing but cremated splintered bone there </p>
<p>Still, not on my list of ways to go.</p>
<p>Either ground zero of a nuclear explosion ( gamma radiation ) or Morphine overdose  </p></div>		</li>
