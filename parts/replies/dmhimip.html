			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as an addendum, what /u/Concise_Pirate said is also true: Larger pots hold more moisture.  If a given plant can only uptake <em>x</em> amount of water, any volume of fluid greater than <em>x</em> is wasted.  Given a larger, deeper pot, that water can sit at the bottom, unused.</p>
<p>Though the surface soil of the pot will air out and dry, the lower contents of the pot will remain soggy, progressively growing worse if you're not aware it's fully saturated. </p>
<p>That wasted water, if not properly drained from the pot, can cause mildew and rot, possibly killing the plant.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, I've never heard of someone calling them pups before, I suppose it's an apt descriptor in a way, but they're really more like parthenogenic clones than actual offspring</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if the terminology is used in the trade business, but &quot;pups&quot; and &quot;pupping&quot; are fairly common terms amongst gardeners as far as I'm aware, though I'm sure it's often a matter of regional availability of popular species...certain plants have the term used more often than others. I'm in Florida so some of the most common pupping plants are bromeliads, bananas, spider plants and Crinum.</p>
<p>All the same, you're not wrong, they're absolutely clone offshoots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's a trade term? That must be it then! I'm on the research side of things, so when I read what you were describing, I actually said out loud, 'ah! they meant vegetative propagation!'</p></div>		</li>
