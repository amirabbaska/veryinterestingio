			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfect description. I have the same thing 2-3 times a year as well. I do think this is what OP is talking about.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. It was fun to see another person describe it because it has always been a curiosity for me in my 35-year life, albeit a minor one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly what happens to me. I have a friend who can shake his eyes at will, and my condition seems very different from his (Nystagmus). It happens so rarely that I don't pay it much attention. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.</p>
<p>I get it, our eyes have adapted to do some extraordinary things, but this is involuntary and, in my case and yours, happens only a few times out of the year. I've tried recreating it, with no luck, but I do know a friend who can do it at will.</p>
<p>I was surprised coming into this thread to only find confusing responses that are not answers for what OP is describing.</p>
<p>I'll even settle for a name for the phenomenon like spontaneous optical vibration.</p></div>		</li>
