			<div class="markdown"><p>the sky acts like a wet sweater. sweaters made of different material(air pressure) hold more water. the wool knit Christmas hoodie grandma gave you (high pressure) will always have more water than the Adidas tack suit top. if you scrunch it up (change the temp) rain comes out. but not all of it at once, because only some of the sweater is squished enough to leak. and the only way you even could get all the water out is absolutely crush the entire sweater all at once</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me give it a shot. On mobile, sorry for any formatting or grammar issues.</p>
<p>Ever notice when you have water boiling for dinner in the winter time your windows fog up? This is called condensation. It happens when warm air with water in it touches a cold surface (this is also why a glass full of cold liquid gets wet on the outside during a warm day). The water in the air turns from a gas, back into a liquid.  </p>
<p>Storms work in a similar way. Imagine a warm summer day near a lake. Water is evaporating of the lake ( like the water boiling on the stove) and rising up. Once this air rises high enough, it hits cold air ( like the windows in the kitchen) that is falling down. When there is enough water, this causes condensation in the air ( these are rain drops), this condensation falls to earth as rain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking off the cold drink in glass to explain why rain doesn't all fall at once:</p>
<p>If you pour an ice cold glass of water and set it on a table, water on the outside doesn't immediately appear out of nowhere, it happens slowly. The water slowly builds up and makes the glass &quot;wet&quot; and foggy looking (this is like a cloud in the sky.) Eventually the water builds up and makes a droplet that's heavy enough to run down the side of the glass (that would be rain.) So water is gradually building up around the glass and dripping down continually around the glass (why rain lasts a long time) all the water doesn't build up and just fall off at once leaving a dry glass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When hot wet air gets cold, it makes clouds. When the pressure gets low, the clouds fall down as rain. But they can't get cold or turn to low pressure all at once, so it slowly turns to rain bit by bit.</p></div>		</li>
