			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno which dishpit you worked in but at the Western Sizzlin’ we cleaned the kitchen pots and pans as well as all the buffet trays. So much caked on and burned on food. All blasted away in seconds. Only rarely we had to soak a baking disk, like when someone left an empty cobbler tray on the hot buffet too long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a Western Sizzlin' in high school. It was my first job ever. I was a dishwasher. Man, what a thankless, shitty job that was. </p>
<p>Some of the deep pans had to be seriously scrubbed/scraped, but just about everything else would be fine with a basic pre-rinse and then once through the old Hobart. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Dishwasher anywhere is almost always a thankless shitty job. </p>
<p>I was usually a FOH guy. But wasn't above doing some dishes if Javier had been pulled off for some emergency work. This was an italian/pizza place. Lots of stuck on and burnt on hot cheese and shit. Thankfully, water spray would do most of it, and maybe a hit with steel wool. Then run it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My comments were referring to a modern low-temp auto-chlor style machine. Did you have one of those old-school conveyor systems that grab the rack and move it through slowly? Yeah, they rock, and they get MUCH hotter, but most restaurants aren't really using them anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my frat we had an industrial dishwasher and people got so pissed off that it didn't clean dried on food like their dishwasher at home. It took a lot of explaining to get people to see that the 90 second cycle was not the same as their homes 3 hour cycle and yes, if you were on dishwashing duty, you still needed to clean the dishes with your hands</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes most do but extremely small spaces will sometimes skip adding them to save space. I think the precleaning thing depends on if you've had good dishwashers. I didn't do that when I was younger but I do now. Now I probably will forever just from habit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, most homes have one by now.</p>
<p>I know in my family we clean the plates before they go in the dishwasher, but they're not like 100% clean before they go in. They're like a solid 85% clean. Like they don't have any food on them, but I still wouldn't want to use them until they've gone through the dishwasher for the 100% clean.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure the washer at my parents house can handle a dirty baked on dish with the right detergent and settings, but that would require actually reading the manual that came with it and pressing more than one button to start the dishwasher. </p>
<p>I remember when we got a new dishwasher and it had directions for how you're supposed to put the silverware in the silverware holder thing in the dishwasher. It was like this super complicated order that takes like 10 minutes to put them in that order. I think I did it like once and gave up because no one has time for that lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's extremely common. But not all. It's a luxury, nothing more.</p>
<p>Do I mind washing dishes? When I'm on a roll, no. Issue is, I hate doing it onesy-twosy. Then waiting for them to dry, and coming back later to put it away.</p>
<p>One plate, maybe a fork and a glass. It's barely worth my time. A big as batch, absolutely. Having a dishwasher means I can store them away dirty, then run it, and all I need to do is store them away when clean. If you have the means, and the room, it's a machine which gives you time back. Is it needed, no. </p>
<p>But similarly, you don't <em>need</em> a washer and dryer either. But it saves you time.</p></div>		</li>
