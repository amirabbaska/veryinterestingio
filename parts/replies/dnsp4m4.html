			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there some way that the prescription might look like it's right but is somehow wrong? According to the doctor my eyesight is 20/20 with the glasses and they're the absolute best they can be but I can't seem to see nearly as far as other people.</p>
<p>There's this classroom in my University where I can only see what's on the blackboard if I'm sitting in the first 12 rows, that's when I first noticed it because the classroom has like 40 rows and there's people sitting all the way in the back taking notes like it's nothing and most are sitting in the middle, way beyond my &quot;capabilities.&quot; No way 80% of the people are sitting in  a places where they can't see what's on the blackboard and nobody's complained. It's also very noticeable in airports, where people can usually read flight information off the screens at much greater instances than I can, yet my vision is supposed to be as good as theirs...</p>
<p>Every single time I go to the doctor I tell him about this or another new experience where my vision failed while others' didn't. He tells me my vision is perfect though and gives me this look like I'm lying to him. The room where he does the tests is too small though, so the screen with the letters is not nearly as far as the blackboard would be in the classroom or things in the distance would be IRL. My vision doesn't fail at that relatively short distance, I can see the letters perfectly crisp, but my vision does fail much earlier than others' (both people without and with glasses) when looking at greater distances like those you'd don't in airports for example.</p>
<p>I actually went to both an optometrist <em>and</em> an opthalmologist. Somehow the opthalmologist got it so wrong that the glasses I got were <em>way</em> off in the left eye. I went back to the optometrist with this and he did a way longer test where my left eye came out with a different formula but my vision is still not 100% compared to others. While my left eye improved a lot, I'm pretty sure my right eye got a little worse (which is weird because apparently he didn't change the right eye formula but I <em>swear to God</em> it's worse - I still got the loose right lens from the opthalmologist's test and I can definitely see better with that lens than with the optometrist's right lens even though he triple checked both and they're supposedly the exact same).</p>
<p>At this point IDK what's wrong with my eyes and I'm reluctant to keep trying because everyone seems to look at me like I'm crazy/lying and it's absolutely not a good feeling to not be believed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be the quality of your lenses in the frames.  </p>
<p>Could be you see better with contact lenses.  </p>
<p>Could be dry eyes</p>
<p>Could be you need to look up what 20/20 means. The definition involves distance.  A person can have better than 20/20 vision.  So 20/20 isn't perfect. </p>
<p>You could also be at the best YOU are  going to get with prescription. </p>
<p>Could be the quality of the prescriber of the lenses. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry I cannot know for sure what the problem is without looking at your eyes thoroughly! But considering the fact you've had it tested regularly I doubt this is a pathological problem.</p>
<p>We test at 6m at this is considered &quot;infinity&quot; because any distance further than that is considered to affect the image in a way that is not noticeable to the human eye. That's not to say it is impossible, as vision is a subjective experience. </p>
<p>You very well may be able to detect subtle changes in image quality. We all perceive blur or vision differently, I'm sorry to say that it sounds like we cannot correct your vision anymore with glasses. I would say perhaps trying contact lenses for more crisp vision would be a good idea. The most perfect visual correction we can give are rigid contact lenses, though we usually use soft contact lenses because they are much more comfortable so it's up to you! </p>
<p>And as for the lens seemingly being different whilst still the same &quot;value&quot; of correction, it may be because of the distance the lens is held from your eye. Especially with prescriptions over 4D, simply changing the distance the lens is from your eye can change its power as well. </p>
<p>Hope this helps a little bit! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My eyes are at -1.25 (L) and -1.50 (R) respectively, which is lower than most people I know. Hell, I have a friend that's -7.something and she can see better with her glasses than I can with mine and we got them from the same optometrist, it's crazy!</p>
<p>I didn't know that contacts could be better than actual glasses though so I guess I'll try that, I was always under the impression that glasses were better due to bring bigger and thicker.</p>
<p>I guess I'll have to get over my fear of stuff getting close to my eyes! (Seriously, how do women even apply eyeliner without being super creeped out lol). It also gives me another excuse to get it tested again I guess, maybe this time he'll find what's going on.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the doctors told me that, too! </p>
<p>Then I went to three opticians who had a wave-front aberrometer as auto-refractors and those devices measured that my glasses had a cylinder value that was almost 2 diopter too weak.  But then they did not want to sell me glasses with that prescription, because they compared the old glasses and new prescription in an eye exam and I had the same 20/20 vision with the both values.</p>
<p>Finally I went to an optician who did not measure my old glasses before the eye exam.  He only compared the values after he had finished the eye exam and said the old glasses had a 1.5 diopter too weak cylinder and I  have 20/15 vision with the new ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting! Its a bit comforting to know it has happened to somebody else as well. When I went to the opthalmologist the prescription he gave me actually had a cylinder value (-0.5 with an Axis value of 140) for the right eye but none for the left, and my vision in my right eye did improve a lot even though my left eye went to shit with his prescription.</p>
<p>Then, when I went to the optometrist with that prescription and my left eye complaints he pretty much threw it out and did his own test (actually did it manually this time with a weird pair of glasses instead of using the machine and tried a <em>ton</em> of lenses) he mentioned keeping the right eye the same but the prescription doesn't really show cylinder values, perhaps he never noticed/doesn't test for that (his prescriptions don't even have a space to list cylinder value while the opthalmologist's does).</p>
<p>The optometrist also theorized that maybe my eyes are so sensitive to change that jumps of 0.25 are too much, and maybe my eyes are some weird &quot;in-between&quot; measurement like -1.30 and -1.55 instead of more standard ones like -1.25 and -1.50, at which point he said he can't really help me anymore (although I get the impression he was just trying to give me an excuse for me to leave happily even though I had my right eye being worse complaints).</p>
<p>/u/Readonlygirl mentioned that I might have better luck with contacts so I guess I'll get tested again soon  (to see if anything changes) and get contacts to see if there's any improvement.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your description, I have an Iris and Lens coloboma in my right eye and when I tell people that my brain ignores anything sent from my right eye when my left one is open people think I am crazy. Now I can show them this post and explain how my small child brain learned to just ignore it. </p></div>		</li>
