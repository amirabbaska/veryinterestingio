<p>cool new type of photosynthesis that solves this problem by only doing photosynthesis deep inside the lead with little oxygen</p>

<p>Where can I find out more? And how do I invest?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typo aside (supposed to say leaf), thereâ€™s a large project funded by Bill and Melinda Gates trying to genetically engineer rice, a plant the does the first type of photosynthesis (called C3 photosynthesis) to a plant that does the second type of photosynthesis (called C4 photosynthesis). If successful this would increase the efficiency and yield of rice worldwide (huge deal given the amount of people where it is a staple crop).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thank god the Gates Foundation is continuing to fund that project. I read some backlash on that project as &quot;selling GMOs to Africa&quot; a year ago. </p>
<p>The Foundation recently shut down another GMO project - the only viable solution to reducing a carcinogenic toxin in corn - because of concerns of the public's acceptance of GMO food.</p>
