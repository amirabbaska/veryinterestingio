			<div class="markdown"><p>While you are correct that it is easier to live with particles bombarding the ISS, the picture looks a bit different outside Low Earth Orbit. For, say, an interplanetary trip, radiation is something that almost certainly needs to be dealt with. This is where the potential for an &quot;active&quot; shielding system shines: it weighs a whole lot less (estimated to be around a third of the mass)  than most traditional absorbers to achieve the same effect. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't know more about the ISS's computers. Just radiation for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That part about the larger CPU process size is really interesting. Makes me wonder if something weird like chemical or vacuum tube computers will end up the future backup systems, maybe spread out inside every wall like some kind of enormous motherboard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nah vacuum tubes use too much power and are too easy to damage mechanically. Also space and weight are an issue there. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s easier to just live with the particles bombarding the ship. I read somewhere that the ISS use cpu’s from the 90’s because the 90 nm (or there about?) process can take far more beating from particles going trough the ship, than the modern 14 nm process.</p>

<p>The ISS is within the shielding effect of Earth's magnetic field. People can not live for very long being bombarded with particles in deep space. </p></div>		</li>
