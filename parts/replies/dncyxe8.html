			<div class="markdown"><p>it has to do with how electrons. they orbit the nucleus in layers usually referred to as &quot;shells&quot; with each shell having a certain number of electrons in it.  atoms like having full shells and will essentially share electrons with other atoms to fill them forming a molecule.  for example, oxygen on it's own is down 2 electrons, so it grabs two hydrogen atoms with one electron each to fill it's shell, forming a water molecule.  carbon is unique in that it has four empty places to fill, allowing it to both bond with just about anything and to multiple other atoms at once</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of the unique way the electrons are configured it allows carbon to bond to not only itself but many other atoms in a variety of ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because carbon has 4 free electrons. Each of these electrons can bond with another atom. Including another carbon. Which then adds another 3 choices. I'm definitely not well versed in chemistry but I know some things lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to think about is STP of life as we know it works for life as we know it. There may be a sweet spot for temp/pressure where other molecules would be more stable such as silicon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We pretty much know all the elements that are light enough to have the properties needed for life as we even remotely know it. Any undiscovered elements are superheavy and highly unstable because of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to what we know about science we today (This are always open to change as we discover new things) there are only a handful of elements which we haven't discovered that may be stable.   See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_stability" target="_blank">Island of Stability</a>.   These will all be super-heavy elements and may have properties we are unfamiliar with.  Currently, these elements are entirely theoretical.  To my knowledge, there is no evidence yet for their existence.  Scientists are not even sure if these can be formed naturally; albeit, if they can, we expect their frequency to be exceptionally rare.</p>
<p>But who knows?  Most scientists, myself included, don't find the natural existence of these elements likely, let alone life being formed from these materials; however, we certainly don't have enough evidence to unequivocally say it can't happen, either.</p></div>		</li>
