			<div class="markdown"><p>The original design required integration with other existing government systems like the IRS to determine up-front eligibility of healthcare.gov users.  Those legacy systems were never designed for the request volume from the healthcare.gov site and without upgrading those legacy systems, healthcare.gov was pretty much guaranteed to fail on launch.  After the launch failure, money needed to be spent upgrading the legacy systems.  I'm sure that accounted for a big chunk of the money spent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol you have no idea. The amount of changing requirements and scope creep was insane. Not giving any details away but a large chunk of the site was completely rewritten a few months before launch due to changes in requirements.  </p>
<p>Ps. I was a developer for the project. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read that the vendor in question has a history of going over budget.  It's unfortunate for the public that neither government nor the vendor released any details about changing requirements or scope creep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume no details were ever released to maintain the relationship for continued contracts and work. I agree. It would be a great case study in software development courses if the facts were released. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything you said is spot on, but I will add one more.</p>
<p>5). Overhead. Everything takes 2x or 3x as long when you are dealing with a government agency.  If you'd normally be able to procure hardware in two weeks, assume it will take six weeks to buy the same server if you are working with a government procurement office.</p>
<p>If normally you expect it to take a week to get a signoff on a design, assume it will take a month.</p>
<p>I work as a consultant for state and county government agencies.  I routinely double or triple all estimates for these contracts before they go out.  Sometimes we multiply by 4x or 5x if we know the stakeholders are slow to respond and won't make decisions.</p>
<p>Anything you do in a government context just takes longer and costs more.  I'm sure the healthcare website took an eternity and zillions of man hours.  Most of those hours were billed for just waiting for requirements, or having pointless meetings with people who like to have meetings in lieu of working.</p>
<p>Actually, I'm billing hours waiting right that this very moment while i post on Reddit.</p></div>		</li>
