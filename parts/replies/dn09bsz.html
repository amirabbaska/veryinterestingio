			<div class="markdown"><p>Best answer, right here. The other answers in this thread explain the design of the outlet; this is the only answer that explains why the outlet is designed that way.</p>
<p>Going one step further, if your appliance has a metal chassis that would be dangerous if connected to the live phase, you don't trust the electrician to wire the two similar prongs properly. You add a third wire as a dedicated ground. You connect the metal chassis to that dedicated ground via a unique prong in your plug. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, but this is absolutely wrong. Isolated AC systems, while rare, are not unheard of. The problem with them is while they allow up to one fault, they also mask a wiring fault. The first time an isolated two-wire system touches earth, nothing happens. The second time, bad things happen. </p>
<p>You typically see isolated systems in hospital operating rooms, and other safety critical locations. The wall power goes through an isolation transformer, and is then balanced isolated power in the room. The system is small/compact enough that it can easily be inspected. </p>
<p>Secondly, the distribution system that supplies the transformer that feeds your house is usually isolated. There are three hots on top of the pole, and no neutral. The main distribution system is effectively ungrounded. There are devices to discharge common mode voltages, but it's not just running a wire. </p>
<p>In your house, the neutral wire is going to be at roughly 0v, but you can't assume that. It is a violation of all product safety regulations to connect the neutral to the chassis. If things go wrong, you can easily have a lifted ground, which would expose the user to dangerous voltages.</p>
<p>The main reason why the polarized plug came about was due to the humble table lamp. To save costs, and for the sake of simplicity and reliability, the switch only switches one wire. The polarized plug ensured this was the hot. Also, it ensured that the hot was connected to the contact on the little nub in the bottom of the socket, rather than the sleeve that is easier to touch when you are changing the bulb. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This all makes perfect sense, but do different countries do it differently? Here in Germany, outlets and plugs are symmetrical. Referring to <a href="https://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/" target="_blank">this list</a> we use type F sockets, and as plugs we use type F (which are grounded) and sometimes type C (which are not grounded). Everything is symmetrical.</p></div>		</li>
