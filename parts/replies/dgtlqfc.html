<p>Modern countries though, may still use other means than the primitive stamp on the paper do document that someone has legally entered the country - the passport contains a lot more than that. They can e.g. just scan it and keep a digital record of which passports have legally passed the border control, but in case technology fails it's nice to have the paper and stamp as a backup, even in the 21st century. </p></div>		</li>
