<p>People tend to think of government debt as it if we're their household debt and their own pocketbooks. </p>

<p>At some point, does the debt's size get so big that it does become a bad thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once the debt approaches a certain percentage of the GDP, it depresses the economy. While the exact numbers are a matter of ongoing discussion (see the in-famous paper by Reinhardt and rogoff) this seems to be a well understood effect. Basically interest payments overwhelm public spending, driving a vicious circle of insufficient investments leading to less tax income and so on. </p>
<p>The good thing about public debt (for countries like the US) is that this debt can be treated basically as money by the lenders. It adds liquidity to the markets, due to the security of the investment. So not enough debt is also bad for the economy. </p>
<p>Liquidity is important. The last financial crisis has been described as a &quot;liquidity trap&quot; for a reason. (Technically that's a term from the neo-keynesian models which have actually performed well in that case, for all their faults)</p>
<p>Macro is fun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You have to pay interest on that debt that could have been used for other things. As interest rates rise, the cost to service that debt goes up. Right now the US pays approx. $400 billion a year just to service its debt. </p>
<p>If your debt keeps rising, eventually your entire tax revenues will be consumed by interest payments, leaving nothing for anything else. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Social Security ran a surplus for a very long time (i.e. generated more than will be needed to pay out full benefits).  Three things happened:  </p>
<p>a) income inequality increased, and a much larger portion of all income is now above the $118k cap on taxable Social Security income (i.e. all income over 118k is not taxed for social security).  This meant less overall revenue.</p>
<p>b) programs were put in place to utilize the surplus funds, but were never really funded through an increase in payroll taxes (which is where the revenue comes from).   </p>
<p>c) the social security &quot;account&quot; is a treasury account - which means the money is effectively being held as a combination of various bonds (so technically debt, but as mentioned previously it's sorta kinda not sorta maybe kinda).  Some are market-rate, some are fixed rate, etc.  Using 2008-2009 as an example, it's possible the market-rate bonds make it look like there's a deficit, but it's entirely possible this equals out over time so it's misleading.</p>
<p>So now you have lower revenue, misleading numbers, and programs that utilize a surplus that may or may not exist now that revenue is lower.  This means social security will, eventually, go bankrupt or (as some in congress argue) have to reduce expenditures to extend its life.   This sounds reasonable, right?  </p>
<p>No.  It's not reasonable, because it causes economic issues like requiring people work longer and straining the job market.  What we need to do is acknowledge the income inequality problem, and raise the taxable income limit.  Period.  The end.  That's it.  That's all you have to fucking do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Lannisters never had a 20 trillion dollar debt. That would be 16,584,272,889 and a half gold pieces in our time. Paired with that, we are spending 830 gold coins per minute. (Saying each gold coin weighs an ounce.) Or 1,164,575,962,660 and a half silver coins. Paired with that, we are spending 58,343 silver coins per minute. These numbers are only accurate at the exact second I wrote them, so they have gone up tremendously.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In medieval times, a good cow cost 10 shillings. That's half a pound. Currently, a good cow costs about 2200 pounds. So a good cow now costs 4400 times as much. Divide your number by 4400 to get the number adjusted for medieval inflation.</p>
<p>A bit under 3.8 million gold pieces. Surely this is attainable for the Golden Lions of Westeros.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation, just to clarify: US Treasury notes are issued in denominations of $1000 and pay coupons semi-annually. Only primary dealers are permitted to bid at auction, and they do so on behalf of any number of clients or their own account. The interest rates on Treasury notes and bonds are extremely important in the economy because they are used as the theoretical 'risk-free rate' from which all other interest rates are benchmarked from. </p></div>		</li>
