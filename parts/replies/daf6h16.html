			<div class="markdown"><p>Am a doctor of physical therapy student and can confirm this is appropriate description of the anatomy. Personally I think it's about the focus the brain has in this case. Kind of like radioman said. The brain constantly filters out what is deemed unnecessary information from all of our sensory input. At times we are so focused on the preconceived notion of not having something that we filter out the sensory input of the object in our hand until it is visualized at which time it becomes apparent. At that point you both see and feel the object where previously you did not do either. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neuroscience student myself. If anyone is curious as to why/how the brain might have a particular &quot;preconceived notion&quot; check out something called 'Bayesian decision theory'. It gets into questions like this, but from a quantitative point of view (as opposed to the intuition/English language explanation I gave above). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Psychology student here. Isn't the essence of Bayesian theory that the brain does a bunch of 'assumings' of which it can't know for sure if it's true, but it's most likely true?</p>
<p>For example we can't know for sure at what speed a car is coming at us - the car could approach us very fast but simultaneously shrink in size -&gt; not practically possible but visually posible - but based on earlier experiences with cars, we have a good estimate of what the speed will be (but we can't be 100% sure).  </p>
<p>I could be totally off-point here, so I hope you can confirm this :)</p></div>		</li>
