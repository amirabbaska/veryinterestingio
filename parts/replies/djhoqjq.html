			<div class="markdown"><p>Voluntary smiles and involuntary smiles actually originate from different place. The top of your brain, the frontal lobe, affects your voluntary smile. It projects to the opposite side of your face. Many times during strokes, this pathway is impaired and people end up with a droopy face. </p>
<p>However, when you find something truly funny, another pathway gets activated...it overtakes the original pathway and you do end up smiling. Only the wiring at the top is impaired, not lower down. </p>
<p>This is specifically in regards to smiles. The rest has been explained by others. Cheers! </p>
<p>&quot;It is hypothesized that this dissociation of emotional and volitional facial movement is due to separate origins of corticofacial projections. The nerve tracts affecting voluntary facial movement probably originate from the main motor cortex. Those affecting involuntary movement during emotion probably arise from the caudal cingulate motor cortex, a medial brain region  inputs from the limbic system&quot; - Kappos,2010</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes me wonder about the people who only have fake smiles, no matter the occasion. </p>
<p>That's not to say it IS fake, but I know a couple of people who, even amidst fits of laughter and genuine joy, always have smiles that look fake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People have a lot of near universally instinctive ways of reading faces, but NOT of creating faces. That's why certain people have faces that make them movie stars or rock stars, and why stuff like  the &quot;resting bitch face&quot; myth exists. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That is because a social smile is formed with a different configuration of muscles from the genuine smile of pleasure. A social smile is executed by circuits in the cerebral cortex that are under voluntary control; a smile of pleasure is executed by circuits in the limbic system and other brain systems and is involuntary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally a sound explanation for why I photograph horribly with a put-on smile but much better with a genuine one.</p></div>		</li>
