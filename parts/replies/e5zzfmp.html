			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm 2 kids and pregnant friends everywhere. LPT keep a random gift and prefilled out card somewhere hidden ( I got sone leather bound journals so we can write to the kids as they grow up about all the silly shit they do) and when she's super emotional over something or is upset over something tell her you saw this and thought of the baby. Boom instant good mood. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Memorize these 3 simple, but highly effective lines;
You’re right.
I’m sorry.
It won’t happen again. </p>
<p>The angrier she is, the longer you must pause between them. Don’t add anything, just say the lines.  It’ll be over soon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at McDicks in college, one time on the night shift a dude came through the drive thru with a weird order - two burgers with odd sauce choices, extra fries, a milkshake and two blueberry pies, and he sounded nervous as he asked how long it would take. I cautiously asked &quot;Sir, I apologize, but... is your wife pregnant?&quot; He was a little surprised and said &quot;Yeah&quot;. </p>
<p>&quot;We'll put a rush on it, sir.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not wholly.  AS far as I understand it, her body shifts her dietary preferences to try to prevent her from ingesting things that might harm forming baby.</p>
<p>On the other hand, showing that you can get what she's going to want beforehand means: when she does want them there you are. Where non-fruit guy's babe might be stuck with something that hurts baby, which is bad in evolutionary terms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, but it's also so that the woman gets what she/baby need. When I was pregnant I really craved red meat because I was anemic even with taking iron.</p></div>		</li>
