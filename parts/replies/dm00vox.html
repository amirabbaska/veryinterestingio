			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for taking the time to respond. </p>
<p>I'm curious to know, of all elements essential to Human life, and those that we currently use in technology (you've mentioned lithium, so my mind immediately thinks lithium-ion batteries), have we reached a ceiling with regard to our advancements using elemental properties, or are there currently studies to utilize additional elements in ways we know of but cannot yet create? Further, are there active studies to find ways to utilize elements in unique ways we have not used before?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stable elements themselves only exist in finite varieties, because of how atoms behave in accordance with the limits of the intraatomic forces at play. That's the reason we can assert with high confidence that all the abundant natural elements have been discovered.</p>
<p>To say the same, however, for their almost limitless combinations into various chemicals would be arrogant. It is, in fact, an area of ongoing vigorous research; you're essentially describing the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">materials science.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it somewhat possible for there to be an element that is unobservable? Like a &quot;Dark Matter&quot; based element, or something similar to that or an element that generates gravitational waves, that we cannot see, or detect because they exist outside the spectrum's we're able to test in? </p>
<p>What about an element that exists on a quantum level that is unable to be observed in real time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically not.</p>
<p>With <em>elements</em> we have reached the limits of usability. We basically know all about the stable elements, and we know the relatively long-term unstable elements and their properties, too. The usability of artificial, high proton-number elements is marginal at best, as it is hard to determine even their basic properties (like color, melting point, etc) due to the extreme short lifetimes, sometimes in the microseconds or less.</p>
<p>With <em>molecules</em> on the other hand, the possibilities are endless, but they will always stay within certain boundaries - a molecule cannot exceed the physical limitations of the elements it contains. I.e. while you can make light gas molecules, making a gas molecule lighter than Hydrogen is not possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to what others said regarding material sience:</p>
<p>The properties of elements changed drastically through the way they are arranged for example. We use that to our benefit. For example graphen, the stuff which is in your pencil, consists out of the same element then diamond: Carbon. It is only structured differently and that makes it really hard in one case, and brittle in another case, even though it consists of the very same element. Through rearrangement of the structures of elements you can even change some isolators to conductors. Material scientists use such things to get completely new properties out of materials. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to know some things about particle physics. </p>
<p>I've been thinking about how those particles like UUP are created (it's got a name now, but whatever), and usually you read that they've collided two elements, not heavy but not the lightest either, together and that briefly lead to the existence of one of those heavy elements. </p>
<p>However, stable proton/neutron cores are only stable in very specific forms. This is concept is seen with Tc99 and Tc99m, where Tc99m is less stable than Tc99 because the core is in a less stable configuration. To me it seems like the higher the atom number, the more important the configuration becomes. </p>
<p>So now my question; to be it doesn't seem like shooting two fairly heavy and complex cores at eachother wouldn't result in the most ideal core configuration for a high element. Is it possible that what we have discovered so far are in fact metastable isotopes of heavy elements and that, with other techniques, more stable/longer lasting isotopes can be created? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the superheavy nuclides we've produced so far are proton-rich compared to where you'd expect shell closures to lie. It's possible that there are more stable isotopes of these elements which we simply don't have the means to produce at the moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your answer! I'd like to ask further, we have seen that even the same number of nuclear particles but a different configuration (again; Tc99 and Tc99m as the example) can lead to different levels of stability. Tc99 is more stable element, having a halflife of 211k years, compared to Tc99m, having a halflife of 6 hours. As I've understood (so correct me if I'm wrong), the difference between the two elements is that Tc99m is a less spherical core and therefore more likely to split than Tc99, because the neutrons are less able to hold the core together, so it falls apart more rapidly. </p>
<p>Is this correct (and if not; what is the actual physical difference between Tc99 and Tc99m?), and is it possible that not only have we found exclusively highly protonic cores of heavy elements and therefore most likely not the most stable ones, but also because we've created these elements by colliding relatively heavy elements into eachother, there is a chance that the cases of heavy elements we have created are not the most stable ones, because the collision of two heavy elements does not have the as-spherical-as-can-be core as a result?</p></div>		</li>
