			<div class="markdown"><p>As another 20-year-old with scoliosis, I've found that my back hurts less when I've slept on a mattress that is firm but will conform to my shape. I don't know for sure, but I think my ex had a tempur pedic mattress- whatever it was, it was like heaven on earth. I've slept on the floor before too, and I don't personally recommend it (I tossed/turned the whole night, because there was always some bone pressing in just the wrong way against the floorboards.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The extreme example of a poor mattress would probably be worse for your back than simply sleeping on the floor due to how far the mattress would allow your spine to arch down into the mattress. That being said, I urge you to follow the advice of your doctor as they are familiar with your particular case as there are many factors including but not limited to the degree of the curvature, location of the abnormality, distribution of body fat and degenerative diseases. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about worse, but in my experience best both financially and for quality of life was a cheap memory foam mattress from Amazon. First time I lay down on that my back popped from my tailbone to my skull.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are the downsides to having a really soft squishy comfortable mattress? Wouldn't it bend its shape to give you support?</p>
<p>Is having no support bad? </p></div>		</li>
