			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fascinating to think about. It almost makes me wonder if somehow the human body could retrieve its original &quot;map&quot; so to speak, of what goes where and bring back a fully functional, original body part using stem cells. (Maybe even regaining or recreating that individuals stem cell production and allowing them to become specialized if that doesn't sound <em>too</em> crazy) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha never say never because who knows where science will take us next. But we're definitely a long ways away from that kind of therapy. As far as I can recall, the only therapy involving stem cells that we use is bone marrow transplants. Put simply, bone marrow is responsible for producing red and white blood cells. If your stem cells in your bone marrow has issues, we can blast them with radiation and chemo to kill them all, then just inject you with someone else's bone marrow stem cells and they'll happily take up residence in your bone marrow with very little prodding on our part.</p>
<p>While a lot of research is being done on potential stem cell therapy, there's a lot of hiccups. We can easily induce various kinds of stem cells, but coaxing them to redifferentiate into specific cell types is proving to be tricky even in a test tube, much less in an actual living thing. Even if we can get them to differentiate, the stem cells also like to differentiate into multiple cell types at the same time, which can be problematic. Furthermore, some stem cells form tumors when implanted in animal models, which we definitely don't want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;map&quot; or &quot;template&quot; is actually a good analogy for something that currently interests a lot of tissue engeneers. What they have found is that if you take the extracellular matrix (ECM; the part that more or less holds the cells in place along with provides chemical and mechanical signals) and &quot;seed&quot; them with appropriate stem cells, the matrix will help guide the stem cells into the proper place and differentiate into the correct cells. Similarly, if a tissue is damaged but the ECM remains in tact, much better healing can occur.</p></div>		</li>
