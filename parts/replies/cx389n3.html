			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about everyone else here, but when I am forced to use a number, it is always a 1 at the end of the password.
If I am forced to use a capital, it is always the first letter.
If I am forced to use special characters, it is an exclamation mark at the end.
Seems to me that a 'smart' brute force algorithm could greatly reduce the total potential combinations by incorporating people's non-random tendencies like the ones I outlined above.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All the common substitutions, actually (e -&gt; 3, t -&gt; 7, etc). The rules are mined from hundreds of millions of stolen passwords. They know how to find patterns. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then you're no better off than if those restrictions weren't made, but you also aren't worse off. (Technically you're a bit better off, but if the dictionary attack is just appending 1 to the end or whatever, it's the same. If they need to do both, they have to check Password1! and Password!1 which will double how long it takes on average).</p>
<p>But for the people who end up doing something different (even trival examples, like 1 and ! at the start), they are now not in the rainbow table (or it has just grown in size to include those examples, again slowing it down). </p>
<p>So at worst, nothing changes. At best, people finally stop making terrible fucking passwords. On average, it's slightly more difficult to uncover passwords. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Except now you're stuck trying to remember if your password is: </p>
<ul>
<li>password</li>
<li>Password</li>
<li>P4ssw0rd</li>
<li>password1</li>
<li>Password1</li>
<li>Password1!</li>

<p>etc. </p>
<p>I'd rather have my account hacked than have to reset my damn password every time I need to log in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you want a strong password don't fucking limit me to 12 characters you twats!</p>

<p>Sites who implement this have shitty security in place and aren't doing what they should be. It's like when sites tell you that you can't use special characters in passwords.</p>
<p>It's a big sign they aren't doing something right, and if their internal database were ever exposed, your password will likely be exposed in no time.</p>
<p>If they're implementing proper authentication practices with salt/hashing and timeouts on consecutive retries, they shouldn't care what your password is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is only one possible (and very shaky) reason to limit the password length: to prevent the users from writing their passwords down somewhere, since long passwords are easier to forget.</p>
<p>Other than this reason, there is absolutely <em>no</em> reason to limit the password length. Passwords should be kept hashed and not in plaintext, which means they are eventually transformed into a fixed-length hash value anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the real reason is poor programming.  Limiting password length usually means that the password is stored in plaintext on the destination server, and that the database only allows x characters to be stored in that field.  A password length limit means they aren't hashing the passwords correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For most people are writing down passwords really a problem? - the way I generally see it; having a password written down is less of a security threat that a long(ger) more secure password. </p>
<p>Obviously it depends on what you are trying to secure; but i would have thought in many cases, the online/digital threat is more of a concern than the physical one (obviously it depends on what you are trying to secure, and where you are storing these written down passwords - but for something like Facebook, or something.... eh) </p></div>		</li>
