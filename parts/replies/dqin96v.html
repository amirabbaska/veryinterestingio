			<div class="markdown"><p>Hopping in here to say that many quick lube places will tell you to come back after 3k miles or 3 months or whatever (or their warranty on the service may only last that long).  This is partially because there are a lot of old cars out there that need to come in this often and it's healthier for your car to come early rather than late.</p>
<p>It's mostly because they want your money though.</p>
<p>Every car is different!  Look at your owners manual (they are usually online), and find out how often you <em>actually</em> need an oil change.</p>
<p>You can't even trust your car's oil life computer either.  They sometimes tell you to go in early too.</p>
<p>EDIT: Another tip... check your oil levels regularly!  Low oil levels can contribute to your oil life indicator and other messages.  It's much cheaper to add oil when needed than to change the oil every time you get any sort of oil light/notification going off.</p>
<p>Just give your owners manual a quick skimming.  Your car is probably worth a lot of money (even if it's a clunker, it's saving you from buying a new car for now), so learn how to keep it performing the way you want it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya, I have to go in every 6000km or 6 months to maintain my warranty (new car purchase). But once the warranty is up, I could stretch it out depending on the type of oil I use. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember well, the warranty condition is not really a condition.</p>
<p>What I mean is that you don't need to follow those directions. They use that only in case of maintenance abuse where the engine would break while under warranty. Then they would have to prove that your lack of maintenance is the cause of the break. </p>
<p>But that's if you do some gross negligence, otherwise they can't tell if you waited 2000 more miles before an oil change.</p>
<p>Also, don't go to the car dealer for car maintenance, it's too expensive and unnecessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What car do you drive? I work in dealership and can't think of a model with a 6,000km service interval, so I'm genuinely curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you dont have to go to the dealer. You just have to keep records, to prove you changed oil regularly. Ive seen other &quot;mechanics&quot; on here saying its a myth , go find my long ass explanation comment. If people  wanna go longer than the manufacturer says, is just hurting yourself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My Ford Flex at 5k miles will only be down to around 45-50% oil life at worst according to it's monitor. The manual calls for synthetic-blend 5W-20 every 5k miles for normal driving so I always get it done just shy of 5k, but if I went by the computer I'd probably be able to go twice as long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two things are making the need to top off oil between changes more common even in perfectly running cars.  Engines designed to use lower weight oils to improve fuel economy and the fact the recommended oil change interval is increasing.  At 3k/change if you lose half a quart you don’t ever notice, at 7.5k+ per change you start to notice.  The lower weight oils allow just a bit more to slip past the piston rings.  In any oil a very thin film is left on the cylinder wall and is combusted away, with a thinner oil just a bit more stays behind.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an '05 Honda Civic with 298,500 miles on it. As you state about the owner's manual, I've only ever followed the normal schedule and replace the oil every 10,000 miles since it's about 90% highway driving. Still runs strong (for an '05 Civic). <em>knock on wood</em></p></div>		</li>
