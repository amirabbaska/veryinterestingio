			<div class="markdown"><p>There are rules for handling of digital financial data. Most companies are very bad at it but they hide behind paperwork to pretend they are OK. </p>
<p>When an event becomes public that paperwork is worthless and depending how negligent they were, governments can levy hefty fines.</p>
<p>Unfortunately most companies play Russian roulette when it comes to protecting your data. They do the bare minimum and try to hide when things go wrong.</p>
<p>There are many breaches that go unreported and get settled out of court. </p></div>		</li>
