			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Most of the water you drink is absorbed through membranes in the small and large intestines and the rectum is just the final portion of the large intestines and is still quite absorbent. The effect  wouldn't be that different to drinking the water except that you are drinking with your butt. I confess I don't know how effective the membranes in your genitals would be but rectum water would definitely hydrate you.</p></div>		</li>
