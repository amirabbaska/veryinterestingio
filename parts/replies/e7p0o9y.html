			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Welcome to 24 Hr Fitness. The name's Tony. I'm a personal trainer, health and fitness expert. So I like to do things a little differently than the girls at the counter. For my health plan, instead of 15 minutes on the treadmill, I like to jump out on you at any given time. When you're in the shower, when you're going to the grocery store, just getting home from work...BAM! There I am, coming from around the corner in a gruesome latex mask and a knife in one hand. You never know where I'll be. Get your heart and cardio really going. Does wonders for the adrenaline. So if you could just sign this liability waiver right here we can get you all signed up...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went camping with my friends in college and one friend pulls out some psilocybin mushrooms. I'd never tried them but wasn't averse to the idea, so I ate a dose that had been weighed out. Definitely one of the most profound experiences of my life, and during I saw the evolution of life flash before me. It ended with an intense awareness of all of this vestigial hardware we have from living as a part of nature. </p>
<p>We as humans have this weird duality of rational thought and animal instincts. We lug around this meat suit that is an animal and try to reconcile the both of them in our modern day where we no longer need it. This whole thing was represented with a visual symbol that was so clear in my head of an ape sitting in a neutral position with no eyes. It put a lot of what it means to be alive and living as a human. Granted I was a biology major so that's probably why my brain decided to go down that path but in all was a very positive experience. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If you exercise, especially when stressed, you are putting these systems to their original use, and use up the hormones, sugar etc, and exercise your cardiovascular system and muscles, adrenaline and cortisol levels drop and you are less stressed,  I like to imagine that the endorphin high after exercise is knowing that you escaped that bear!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds good and all but is almost certainly wrong. It isn't about &quot;using up&quot; hormones and sugar. In fact, those hormones aren't &quot;used&quot; by muscles. It is about (mostly), blood flow. When your body is forced closer to its limits, there are &quot;signals&quot; sent to improve the response next time. When you flog your heart for 30 minutes, it screams for oxygen (blood flow). This demand, over time, is met with vascular changes and more efficient muscles (in this case heart). </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We know consistently and excessively flogging your heart/muscles is likely a negative thing (e.g. marathon runners). </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Why does intermittent stress response in the absence of exercise cause harm and not benefit as the exercise would? Nobody knows the answer to this properly. It seems cortisol, in particular, may be one of the major players in terms of harmful stress response over time. However, it is more complex than this and a complete explanation for the effects has yet to be found.</p></div>		</li>
