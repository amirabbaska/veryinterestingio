			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 bottlenecks in making heavy elements.  Early in the process, it was too hot for deuterium to form.  That limited the formation of helium.  Higher elements are made from helium but there are no stable atomic nuclei with atomic numbers 5 or 8 so 2 helium-4 or other combinations of hydrogen and helium could not get past that point. Stars can do it but the process is too slow to work before the big bang cooled below the point of fusion.  All the fusion occurred in about the first 20 minutes.<br />
