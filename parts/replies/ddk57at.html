			<div class="markdown"><p>There is every reason to lose hope there.  Education?  The education is substandard.  Here's some info from another discussion we had on education in the MS Delta:</p>
<p>When school integration was finally forced on the state, white families abandoned the public schools, and that, coupled with the brain drain cited, means that the public schools are left with the poorest and least invested families.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="http://mshistorynow.mdah.state.ms.us/articles/305/the-last-stand-of-massive-resistance-1970" target="_blank">here's an article detailing some of the school desegregation issues that specifically notes the rise of private schools in the MS Delta.</a> What this points out as well, is that even though white families took their children out of public schools, whites still controlled the local school boards, where they had little incentive to improve the schools.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/12/in-southern-towns-segregation-academies-are-still-going-strong/266207/" target="_blank">This article, from 2012, also notes the private school issue in the Delta.</a></p>
<p>Employment?  There are far fewer employers in the area than in the 50s and 60s, when there was an airbase nearby and a number of factories.  The main industry is agriculture, and they also got casinos about 10 years ago (I believe there are two currently operating).  Getting to and from work requires a car or at least some reliable transportation, since there is no public transportation.  </p>
<p>So what employment there is is likely minimum wage farm work, or retail/fast food.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are confusing being poor with being black. And which schools are you talking about? Some of the poorest performers get the MOST money. Detroit, for example; they have one of the worst performing schools in the nation...and it gets more funding than any other school in the nation. And public schools dont lose funding  just because there are no white kids there.</p>

<p>What schools specifically? </p>
<p>Throwing money at this problem doesnt suddenly produce interested and involved students or parents that give a shit.</p></div>		</li>
