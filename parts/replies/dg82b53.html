			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, they were pushing unnecessary fentanyl prescriptions?</p>
<p>The withdrawal on that is worse than heroin and it has one of the highest potentials for overdose in modern medicine. </p>
<p>Completely disgraceful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fentanyl withdrawals are arguably less horrible overall compared to heroin. Withdrawal is related to half-life and potency. So, while fentanyl is insanely potent, it has a super short half-life which means the withdrawal symptoms will be intense, but short-lived.</p>
<p>I'd say that fentanyl withdrawals are comparable to withdrawals from hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Dilaudid withdrawal is the worst I've ever felt for one day, but heroin withdrawal is the worst I've ever felt for several weeks straight.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that made me narrow my eyes a little bit. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equianalgesic#Opioid_equivalency_table" target="_blank">Fentanyl is like 50-100 times more potent than hospital grade heroin.</a> </p>
<p>Again, as former/sober opiate addict all I can think is &quot;that has got to be killing people so much that it's not profitable&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had stage IV cancer at 29 and tumors in my back and chest. I was on a high dose Fentanyl patch for months and a Dilaudid pain pump after my bone marrow transplant. I know this is an extreme situation but those drugs do serve a legit medical purpose. </p>
<p>I don't want these drugs to go off the market. I couldn't even &quot;feel it&quot; when I was on the Fentanyl patch...because I was in severe pain.</p>
<p>I hope abuse does not limit access to these drugs for those that really need them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually what is happening is the stamp bags have a mark on them and when a string of overdoses happens in the area the news posts the name of the bag. This to an addict is a literal advertisement. When the news says &quot;Apple stamp bags&quot; are killing people, an addict thinks &quot;wow those are good lemme find someone with those.&quot; So media outlets are just giving out free ads to the drug dealers. A lot has to be done to stop overdoses but other than AA/NA, no one knows how to deal with it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes and no. As somebody who was a paramedic said on here, fentanyl is perfect for op settings, very quick onset and very short half life. As a result, an anaesthetist can dose up a patient before op, keep them topped up for as long as the surgeon needs, and when op is over the patient can wake up in a short time with no residue. </p>
<p>TL/DR: people don't die from fentanyl overdoses in hospital setting bc they are closely monitored, and drugs are administered by professionals in the field of &quot;knocking people out&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Marijuana is not a miracle cure for pain.  As someone who has suffered from chronic pain for over 20 years, I can't stand the side effects of any form of marijuana or CBD.
It gives me brain fog, makes me feel lazy, and increases the amount of migraines I have.  That being said, my preference is Tylenol 3&amp;4.  I have a clear mind, can do my legal work and have effective pain relief.
Would I suffer from withdrawals if I just stopped it suddenly, most likely.  Do I ever take enough to get high?  Never.
Not all opioids users are abusers.  And opioids can provide very effective pain relief when other methods have failed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is terrible, but unfortunately also true - some parents get diagnoses for their children, and then consume their medications for recreational purposes. Though other parents may just be ignorant and have 100% trust in the physician telling them it's a necessary treatment for their child at that age (which is sad imo for 2-3 year olds).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently my school and a few medical professors tried very hard to get me on that stuff. I'm lucky he refused all those years but now that I'm older I've seen some parents that just don't give a shit and give their kids whatever pills the doctors say they need. It's kinda frightening when you consider that this is happening to an entire generation. </p></div>		</li>
