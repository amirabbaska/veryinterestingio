			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats not really the reason there is a gap between the rich and poor investors though. Most Hedge Funds have restrictions on when you can pull money out, and they have limited client side resources. So they figure (rightly) that having a minimum investment of 250k and requiring clients to have a net worth of 2 million will let them use their client side resources well and prevent people from shuffling money and fucking with the fund too often. Its much less a &quot;we hate poor people&quot; thing. </p></div>		</li>

<p>it seems that the &quot;shuffling money and fucking with the fund&quot; thing would be a possible side benefit of working with accredited investors, but not the reason for the rule.</p>
<p>hedge funds can and do have restrictions on liquidity for that very reason though, so I think you're a little off track there but have the right idea.</p>
<p>I used &quot;poor&quot; and &quot;rich&quot; to make my point easier to understand, but the proper term is &quot;accredited investor&quot;. if you do not fall into this category, securities regulators basically make the choice for you that you cannot invest in some of this stuff. many fund managers would probably LOVE if the accredited investor rules and regulations in general were relaxed, it would just mean more $$ for them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Being &quot;rich&quot; is explicitly the reason hedge funds can do certain things a mutual fund can't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in some ways, yes! the people managing the money can do pretty much whatever the fuck they want, which is why for the most part only &quot;rich people&quot; (accredited investors) are allowed to participate. securities regulators basically say &quot;hey crazy fund manager guy, sure we'll let you do these weird investments and not really report much of what you're doing, but we're only going to let you do it with rich people's money because it's too sketchy for not-rich people and we don't want you taking all their money and gambling on weird shit. but we're ok if you do it with rich people.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
