			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the bit that blows my mind about this too. I've done a tiny bit of programming for autonomous robots, and I wrote a load of code to deal with several decreasingly-likely failure modes, but this is just on another level entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is difficult about that part in particular?  The rover is solar powered, so isn't determining the sunlight levels as simple as reading the amount of power flowing into the batteries?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised to read at NASA's webpage that they want to communicate directly with the rover. Should they not simply let the orbiters talk to it? They are nearer, get better signal, and wouldn't use the extremely valuable DSN resources during the next months. They can send a &quot;Yes, rover is now awake again&quot; as part of their routine communications when (if) they get a response in the coming months, and then NASA can talk to the rover either directly or via the orbiters. </p>
<p>I seem to remember NASA reprogramming the registers to tell the probe that it was now in Mars, because otherwise a bad fault could have it trying to communicate via cable. But that might have been a different probe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mars orbiters would only be overhead for a few minutes very infrequently - once to twice a day.  Earth would be above the horizon for several hours at least 1/3 of each sol.  </p></div>		</li>
