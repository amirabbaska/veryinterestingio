			<div class="markdown"><p>With laptops and cell phones and stuff, the circuitry will simply cut off when the voltage gets too low to protect the battery. Otherwise, everything is meant to run at or above the minimum voltage of the battery and is regulated down even further. Lithium batteries have a similar discharge curve to alkalines. I could go on all day about batteries and battery management circuitry.</p></div>		</li>

<p>ive read about how batteries work trillions of times and i still dont get it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a photographer, I hate using alkaline batteries in a flash.  Firstly, they aren't rechargeable and I'm not sure how easy they are to recycle.</p>
<p>But their performance is terrible, which this curve explains.  The recharge time for the flash gets longer and longer, even when the batteries have plenty of 'juice' left.</p>
<p>NiMH batteries, on the other hand, are rechargeable and they maintain their voltage better, which keeps the flash recycle times faster for longer.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed the opposite.  Alkaline cells have a nominal voltage of 1.5v while NiMH is 1.2v.  It takes forever to charge my flash on NiMH, so much that I bought a pack of 40 cheap AAs from Amazon just for my flash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Complicated chemistry. As you use an alkaline battery you're basically turning the insides into rust as you use it (not normal rust but you get the idea). At a certain point there's enough rust that the reaction drops drastically ; there's not enough surface area anymore for the reaction to work smoothly. </p>
<p>Rechargeable batteries can be de-rusted, so to speak, by adding energy back to the system. Non rechargeable batteries can't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In simple terms, the voltage shown here (~1.4V) is the voltage at which the active material (MnO2) will be reduced. Ideally, you would expect the discharge to happen at a almost fixed potential, until there is no material left to react (i.e., all MnO2 is consumed), and at this point you'll see the sudden drop. </p>
<p>In practice, you have all sorts of of kinetics impairments from internal processes that will 'consume' some of the energy of the battery in order to run (imagine a steam engine using some of the generated energy to circulate the water inside the tubes). This will decrease the available energy (seem here as voltage) for the external processes. </p>
<p>These internal resistances tend to 'accumulate' over time, which is why there is the slope. One very notable and particular case is in the early dry cells (Leclanch√© cells), which had ammonium chloride as the electrolyte (the liquid inside the cell). As you discharge, you'd produce ammonia, which would become a gas. The more gas you generate, the higher the internal resistance of the cell, and more resistive heating would happen. The warmer the battery, the more gas would be released, so these batteries could lose charge really fast. This could be reversed by cooling the battery, which allowed the gas to dissolve back. This is why people used to put old batteries in the fridge to get a little more juice out of them.</p>
<p>There are other processes which can have the same overall effect, but there you go. Sorry for the long post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern batteries like lithium ones are often more advanced and will shut off power before dying completely.</p>
<p>It's actually super bad if your cell phone battery is <em>fully</em> discharged, which is why it doesn't let you do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shutoff has nothing to do with it being lithium.  You can get lithium and lithium ion batteries that are dumb just like alkaline.  Usually either the device has undervoltage protection (like RC planes and drones) or if it's an expensive or proprietary battery it will have the circuit built in. My Phantom drone battery will actually discharge itself after 7 days of being fully charged because it's not good to store lithium ion batteries at 100% charge, but that is a function of the chip beside the battery, not the battery itself.</p>
<p>Just an FYI, not trying to be a smartass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, which is why lithium batteries are so popular in electronics. They maintain a very consistent voltage as they are discharged, so it would be like having a pump connected to the water tank that keeps the water flowing at a consistent rate until the tank runs out of water.</p></div>		</li>
