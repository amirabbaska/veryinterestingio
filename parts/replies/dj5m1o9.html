			<div class="markdown"><p>Valuable life lesson. This works for your car battery too. If your car won't start due to battery, carefully disconnect and clean the leads, then reattach. May save you a headache of calling someone. Of course, later figure out if it was a bad battery/alternator or if it was just a build up of corrosion.</p></div>		</li>
