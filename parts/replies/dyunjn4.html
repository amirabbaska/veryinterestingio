			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to the first point, it has been difficult in the past to target cancerous cells. We have tried to target cells that replicate quickly, aka cancer cells. Unfortunately, that also targets healthy cells that replicate quickly, such as those that contribute to our hair and line parts of our GI tract. This is why treatment such as chemo can be harmful and contributes to the complexity of treatment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. This also explains side effects of most chemo drugs to be hair loss, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is such a better explanation than the top one. Just &quot;there are many forms of cancer&quot; itself is not an explanation, since we don't have a cure for a lot of them.</p>
<p>the fact that it's something going wrong (like 100 genes malfunctioning) and your immune system is part of that malfunction is a big reason. Most of the time our immune system helps the fight, or is the reason we won the fight. With cancer it's the same: the multiple lines of defense has broken down, so the fight is much more difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding that pouring money doesn't guarantee scientific discovery. Discoveries often proceed i a non linear manner. Better funding for cancer research helps in the research, no doubt. But you can't define a fixed target and how much time it'll take to reach that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely - Biology is way, way too complex to be able to answer say &quot;this is the effect I want, how much research do I need to get there?&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
