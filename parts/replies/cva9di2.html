			<div class="markdown"><p>This is largely the answer, but it's also worth mentioning that because the government regulates the drug market (largely for safety and quality reasons) there is a significant time delay in how long it takes for new generic competitors to hit the market. The average time for a new generic drug approval in the US is somewhere around 36 months. In an unregulated market if a company raised prices to an unsustainable level (e.g., 5,000%) you would immediately expect to see new competitors enter the market and drive the price back down. Even if a 10 new generic drug makers decided to enter the market the day the price increase is announced, it would still take 2-3 years before they were approved giving the original price gouger a window to make windfall profits. This is essentially a a regulatory arbitrage play</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, realistically, the only reason another player would care enough to get into the business of making this drug is for PR and the warm and fuzzies.</p>
<p>The quantities are so slow that essentially you really would have to  operate that drug at a loss forever.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Honestly, it's just math.  The downvotes are strong out there.  If the revenue is $1 a dose, even at three doses a day, for an entire year, for all 2000 prescriptions, you are looking at less than $730k a year in revenue.   You can't setup a production line to make potato chips for $730k, let alone a production line to make a million pills, no matter how simple.   It's an economic loser.  Even at $750 a pill, it's still not all that attractive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto your comment, the production of the product is another hurdle to overcome. </p>
<p>A key thing to note on reproducing a product is maintaining consistent quality.  This can be broken done into ensuring that the generic product is 'equally' safe and efficacious with the brand product. The term 'equally' is debateable and deserves another post of its own.  In the case of small molecules such as Tylenol, it can be easily replicated.  Synthetic molecules and chemical created from the ground up from reagents are great for generic as there wouldn't be to high of a R&amp;D cost to discourage competitors.  The recipe is pretty damn well documented. </p>
<p>Biologic products, however, (think proteins [e.g: monoclonal antibodies]) is a different ball game.   If you could look at the simple size differences of a biologic to a small molecule it would be about ~&gt;100,000 to ~200 daltons, respectively. It could be about 500x greater in size meaning structurally, it is a more complex, heterogeneous structure.  On top of that, proteins are largely unstable. They are dynamic, moving, changing easily in accordance with the environment.  High temperatures break it down, pH changes can change bond structures, etc. If a manufacturer wanted to create a generic biologic (more commonly known as a biosimiliar), they will need to replicate a very specific manufacturing process. </p>
<p>R&amp;D and risk for a biosimilar is much higher relative to a small molecule.  This aspect of manufacturing contributes to why manufacturers can't just set up shop overnight and reap that $$$.</p>
<p>Edit: I digressed a bit from the main context--- my apologies. I hope someone still learn something though.
When I think of generic products, I think of the collective body of medicine as a whole and that is largely, but not solely broken down into two types (small molecules &amp; biologics). My explanation doesn't answer OP's question well, but it is one answer on why manufacturers can't just make a cheaper generic in general.  Look at synagis for respiratory synctial virus, a blockbuster drug (meaning it generates ~$billion annually), the price shot up when medical associations narrowed down its targeted patient.  It has been off-patent for some time now.  Fortunately, there is a biosimilar in the pipeline (but that can be attributed to several employees leaving the parent company to form their own company).   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tldr; some drugs are harder to make than others. Money reasons too.</p>
<p>Great answer. I have always wondered about generics. I was mostly curious as to whether generics could piggyback on the drug test trials of the original name brand's research or trials as far as efficacy and safety?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I may be misunderstanding your question, but if not, that is literally <em>exactly</em> what generics do.</p>
<p>Once a drugs patent expires, other companies can manufacture it without needing to do new efficacy and safety testing. All a generic needs to prove is that the drug is bio-equivalent (the body treats it exactly the same way) and that they can manufacture it safely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the US and EU are regulated differently. You're not allowed to just move drugs from one to the other willy-nilly. 30 pills for £30 for a maximum of 2000 patients wouldn't be worth the cost of GSK trying to market them in the US. Undercutting $750/pill might make it worth it though but it will still leave the current company an effective monopoly for a year or so while they get the licensing etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The manufacturer of the pills used in the UK must be certified by the FDA to import drugs into the US. You can fly to the UK and bring back a supply for personal use, which also means you'd need to see a doctor in the UK and get a prescription, but having them shipped is a different story. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That mandatory testing and everything that goes with it is pretty expensive and not worth it for a $1.50 pill. They'd need to jack the price too to make it worth it. Nowhere near the $750 of course but it's not something that can be done quickly or cheaply.  </p>
<p>A better way would be for the doctors to order the drugs as 'specials' on a named patient basis as this is a drug with a low consumer base.</p></div>		</li>
