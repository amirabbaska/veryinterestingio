			<p>yes, if they are that sharp. the motion in your stomach and intestines is likely to put the shards near the organ lining, where a sharp enough edge will cut through.</p>		</li>

			<p>Some would pass through, and some would most likely settle in between the <a href="https://d2gne97vdumgn3.cloudfront.net/api/file/XtCsvEmStWxsC93yzHbS" target="_blank">many microscopic folds of your small intestine</a> and jumble around in a tiny area making tiny cuts for the rest of your life (or until it passes). That could be happening in dozens of spots. <br><br>Your body would likely keep healing since the blood loss would be minor, but it would be super irritating and you would increase your chances of getting colon cancer in that area by a lot (constantly damaging and rebuilding the same cells for years increases the chances of some crazy DNA stuff happening). <br><br>My guess would be it would feel something like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;amp;q=diverticulitis" target="_blank">diverticulitis</a>.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Would the small microscopic pieces cause havoc on a cellular level in your stomach and intestines?<br><br>Sorry, I'm not clear on this. Why would this affect digestion?</p>		</li>

			<p>You wouldn't want incredibly sharp material passing through your digestive system.</p>		</li>

			<p>Posted this further up... You would be shocked how little a scalpel is used in surgery. Making the incision in the skin is all it is used for(mostly). After skin incision electrocautry is what they use to dissect subcutaneous tissue. For most procedures the scalpel is in play for literally 3 seconds.<br><br></p>		</li>
