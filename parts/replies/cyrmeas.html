			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't mean to be rude but how on earth did you get 3 years into any relevant engineering field before being able use radians and understand them. We had to learn them and be tested on full understanding a year before even applying to university.  Crazy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, the definition of pi as 'the number of radians in a straight line' or 'the ratio between a circle's circumference and diameter' is correct and absolutely true, so the way we define pi isn't 'arbitrary' or 'wrong'. in that video, Vihart is arguing that its use is less intuitive or practical than the use of tau. deciding whether you want to use pi, tau, or some other constant like pi/2 or pi/12 is the arbitrary part. you could argue that pi/12 (let's call it mu) is a good one because then you have 24mu in a circle, which divides up very easily into subsections (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6, 1/8, 1/12, 1/24) of the circle without having to use fractions, which some people prefer for aesthetic reasons. tau on the other hand lets you use the fraction of tau as the fraction of the circle you're dealing with. pi, also, comes up in a lot of equations without a factor of 2 (for example, <a href="http://www.thepimanifesto.com/" target="_blank">the area of a circle</a>) and is neater in those instances. so they both have advantages and disadvantages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2π=τ?</p>
<p>Pfft.  That's absurd.  τ looks like a half a π, but it's supposed to be 2*π.  Thus, a contradiction.  QED, mofos!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me be blunt: no one who does actual math cares about tau vs pi. <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=1777" target="_blank">People who care about tau are displayed on the left in this comic.</a></p></div>		</li>
