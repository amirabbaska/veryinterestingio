			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it's a chemical reaction in the semiconductor. It won't repair itself.</p>
<p>Edit: I should add that you can use software tricks to identify the malfunctioning pixels. It won't repair them but it can at least mean your video ignores them or guesses what it would be showing based on what the healthy pixels around it can see. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's likely more of an atomic effect when a high energy neutron emitted from the sun strikes an atomic particle in the pixel's detector, specifically the part that accumulates charge as photons hit the pixel's sensor.   That Neutron impact is like a mortar strike and can cause &quot;latchup&quot; which makes the pixel stick at one value, or fries it completely.   </p>
<p>The phenomenon is called Single Event Latchup (SEL).  In other chips, like CPUs or FPGAs, SEL can affect registers and makes a bit stick permanently at 1 or 0. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dead pixles are almost always permanent, since it's a result of a physical change in the light detecting parts of the camera. </p>
<p>But you can also get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_error#Cosmic_rays_creating_energetic_neutrons_and_protons" target="_blank">soft errors</a>,, which introduce completly random changes. So most spacecraft tend to have a lot of backups and quadruple check every thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it can be compensated for in software to a degree. </p>
<p>Even though software can eliminate the &quot;dead/stuck&quot; pixels from the image and compensate for bias errors from individual pixels, the effective resolution and sensitivity of the camera will be very slightly reduced by each cosmic ray event as individual pixel sensors are rendered inoperative or lose some of their dynamic range.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is generally not what you would consider a chemical reaction.</p>
<p>There are a couple of mechanisms how a sensor can get damaged. Ionizing radiation can displace atoms in a crystal lattice (changing the band structure, mainly by adding new energy levels) and it can directly induce charges in non-conducting regions (changing the energy levels of the band structure nearby). There are also single-event effects - the pixel can read out a wrong value for a single frame, or the pixel can die completely from some discharge inside it (not that dangerous for CCD cameras, but problematic as soon as you have HV).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is changing the chemical structure of the atoms not considered a chemical reaction? Is it because the structure is just ionizing and adding energy so not technically changing the makeup?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that we look at just the atom that got displaced from the array and ignore the rest of the array. We'd just see a single atom get moved. Nothing reacted with anything. Thus this is within the realm of physics and not chemistry, which is applied quantum mechanics and thermodynamics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alexander Gerst said this recently in an interview about his mission: non-critical electronic equipment (e.g. VoIP comms to Earth) is basically off-the-shelf electronic equipment. It is regularly replaced as hard drives and such are bricked by the cosmic radiation. </p>
