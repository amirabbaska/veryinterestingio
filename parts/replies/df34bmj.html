<p>I know the first thing I think when I get shot is &quot;I should lay down and surrender peacefully now that I have 6 holes in me&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that was either a beta version, or a special &quot;USK 16&quot; version (&quot;USK 16&quot; means it can be bought by anyone aged at least 16; Counter Strike is normally given a &quot;USK 18&quot; rating).</p>
<p>There was a huge public discussion about the game some years ago after a couple of school shootings in Germany: in at least one case, it was wrongly reported that the shooter was obsessed with Counter Strike, and some of the tabloids got quite hysterical. The censors' office then investigated (which marked the first time they invited gamers to provide some expert testimony), with a view to possibly &quot;indexing&quot; the game. This would have entailed refusing it a rating, meaning it could not be sold anywhere anyone under 18 had access, and couldn't even be advertised.</p>
<p>In the event, though, the censors concluded that while the game does have high levels of violence, it wasn't enough for it to be &quot;indexed&quot;. They cited the fact that it was at least theoretically possible to achieve the objective without killing anyone; the German censors aren't simply against violence, but are against the portrayal of violence <em>as the only viable solution</em>.</p>
<p>This is understandable when you remember how the (real-life) Nazis encouraged precisely the idea that war and violence were necessary and even desireable. I think that's an overreaction, but modern Germany isn't taking any chances.</p>
<p>But AFAIK, in the full German version of CS, the player models do die when they're supposed to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Being nearly famous is weird, because you keep meeting people who can't quite believe they're talking to you... but you're still a long way off from being able to say, &quot;Don't you know who I am?!&quot;</p></div>		</li>
