			<div class="markdown"><p>So, in many learning and memory studies researchers teach mice to associate fear with a specific box (lighting, flooring, odor, etc.). Similarly, in our experiments the fear is learned without any colored light or lasers (I am assuming you meant light stimulation of brain cells). In rodents, the memory of a fearful experience is definitely among the strongest and most salient because it becomes about survival. In our study, we not only restored fear memories in early AD mice but also restored spatial/environmental memories (in this case the memory was for an object in a specific location within their environment). Based on these findings, we believe that our memory restoration experiment can be applied to fear and happy/neutral memories. </p>
<p>I am honored by your kind and supportive comments. Thank you!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC memories created under fearful or life-threatening conditions create much stronger and lasting connections in the brain than memories created under any other condition. I'm on my mobile right now so I can't exactly link a peer-reviewed study but feel free to fact check me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is 100% true. For this reason, we examined spatial/environmental memories as well as fear memories in early AD mice. We hoped by testing different types of memories our findings would be more generalizable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why didn't you test some sort of reward-based memory? It seems tough to generalize the findings to happy memories without the results.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your research</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't this also related to PTSD and trauma? That the memories in the brain get established so strongly that it starts becoming a serious problem?</p>
<p>Even children can remember traumatic instances, despite being too young to remember.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, fear memories are definitely related to PTSD and trauma responses. In our study, we focused on short- and long-term memories but other groups have used similar behavioral paradigms to study PTSD using animal models.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say that the light shock is a procedural memory (having happened many times) while the birthday one is episodic (linked to a single event)...not OP, but these do seem to be encoded and retrieved in different ways.  Procedural memory, for example, can be a much stronger process.  So much so that cognitive therapists use it to teach new routines (or re-teach old ones) to people with dementia with spaced retrieval techniques (repeating a process again and again over a period of time until it sticks).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point. In our experiments, the shock experience is a one-time learning event, which is why we use this as an episodic memory test. It's worth noting that mice are great at learning a fear memory, however in the case of a spatial memory they require many more training sessions. Regardless, both assays used in our study are types of episodic memory behaviors.</p></div>		</li>
