			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a little bit of trivia, one of the first movies where Pixar seriously looked at subsurface scattering was Ratatouille.  It turns out that food looks best if you model it to include a reflective layer on top consisting of water or grease, and a diffuse layer below.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://graphics.pixar.com/library/AnyoneCanCook/paper.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> is the paper with nice example pictures, but I have a bad connection here and I cannot check.</p>
<p><em>EDIT</em>: yes, it's chapter 2 of that PDF</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want this. I would love to see my house covered in it just because. The possibilities! Imagine covering texture pads, e.g. Sandpaper or Velcro on a wall to feel. Have someone guess what they are before feeling them.</p>
<p>Of course these aren't practical, but they would be <em>so</em> fun. I saw calibration as one practical use, I wonder what else it would be good for?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a very large piano company in the tech department and spent a lot of time with the folks who repair case parts. It is actually black polyester that has been buffed like crazy and then hand polished to fill the scratches.  There is only one layer as you could not effectively hide a scratch if there was a &quot;clear&quot; coat on the black. Wood grain confuses the eye well enough, but fixes are still way easier to find on a wood finish than a black poly.</p>
<p>I was the one who mixed the cobalt into the poly and packed the repair kits for shipping. </p>
<p>Not arguing your science, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually have no idea what they actually use on pianos.  As I said, it's not actually necessary for there to be physically distinct layers of different materials, a single material can have this happen with each depth of the identical material acting like a &quot;different layer&quot;.  A striking example of this would be something like obsidian (i.e. volcanic glass), which when sufficiently thick is both black and has a high amount of specular reflection (when thin it's actually transparent).  Though often in commercial goods this effect is obtained by adding a layer of wax or laquer.  It's interesting to learn that about pianos though.</p></div>		</li>
