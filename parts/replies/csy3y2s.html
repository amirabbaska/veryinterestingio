			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the ethylene that ripens a fruit by breaking down the complex starch into the simple sugars of fructose is still present in the fruit after picking. The fruit still ripens as it would if it were still on the plant. Generally, its just more susceptible to decay because its no longer actively receiving nutrients and water from the source plant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks... I <em>knew</em> some chemist or biologist or something was going to correct my layman's view of this.</p>
<p>But whatever the reason, the fruit is noticeably more decayed than it would be if picked fresh.  And fresh-picked fruit is a rarity for many people, so they've only ever known that fruit+decay taste... someone else commented on their experience of this, and a few others have mentioned that they don't <em>want</em> to know.  Sometimes I wish I didn't know... I liked pineapples before that job.</p></div>		</li>
