			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand why people try to reason with a flat earther.  I would try to encourage the person, cultivate them, use the rest of this crazy stuff they undoubtedly say, for fictional characters.  I've never had the pleasure of meeting a flat earth believer in person, but I did go some mileage out of a guy who fully and sincerely believed that the planet was going to flip on its axis any day now.  He was a riot, because if you let him rant long enough on his &quot;science&quot; he would go into amazing, lengthy, detailed, largely believable stories about this &quot;old fisherman&quot;.<br />
I saw inside the guy's house one time.  He was a hoarder. His house was filled with machine shop tools (a huge lathe, a hydraulic press brake, a horizontal boring mill, a horsehead mill).  There was no entry way to this house large enough to accommodate those things.  Gigantic machines that had to have been moved with a heavy duty forklift.  He offered no explanation, but when he passed away that place was emptied by someone, somehow.</p>
<p>I can't wait to meet a genuine flat earther. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;the average temperature remain the same.&quot; It will always be colder at night and warmer during the day. The average will be somewhere in between of course. But &quot;the same&quot; as what?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regardless of rotational speed (and disregarding heat from friction that might occur as things on the orb moves around), shouldn’t the average temperature remain about the same? Sure, you have shorter/longer days warming the object, but you also have shorter/longer nights cooling it off. Or is there some ELI5:able equation that says differently?</p></div>		</li>
