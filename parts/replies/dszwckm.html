<p>But buying the papacy would be ridiculously difficult to do (imagine the blowback of someone found out in today’s world). Catholicism couldn’t take a scandal that big today. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to also remember that life expectancy is historically stupidly high, and between the collapse of Rome and the Renaissance it took quite a hit. Which is why popes during the Roman Empire tended to reach their late 60's / 70's and in some cases 80's, where as from around 800AD onward you tend to see about a 10 year dip in the average age.</p></div>		</li>
