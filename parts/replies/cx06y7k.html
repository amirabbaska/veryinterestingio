			<div class="markdown"><p>This dryness, among other symptoms (coughing, clogged sinuses, etc) can effect your quality of sleep. It's a good idea to keep some water within reach if you wake up during the night. You won't be quite as uncomfortable when you get up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes indeed. Hydration betters the perception of the cold that you have.</p>
<p>Other factors that affect are the ambient temperature of the room and humidity. Very low humidity(as in places with extreme colds below zero) can produce so much a drying effect that you can have nose bleeds (epistaxis). This can happen in normal people as well as in those with a cold</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a cold right now and a couple nights ago it was awful, my throat was so dry it kept waking me up, but I was so tired I would fall right back to sleep and instead of reaching over for my water I would just <em>dream</em> that I was reaching over for my water, and of course you can't do anything right in dreams so I'd be trying to swallow and it just wasn't working or I was too weak to pick up the glass, ugh!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think another part of it, for me anyway, has to do with laying down immobile for several hours- gives a chance for all those fluids to accumulate in your sinuses and tissues, plus your lungs aren't working as hard to expel mucus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lining in the airways are not dead tissue. They are live tissue and are perfectly capable of expelling mucus in small amounts. But you are right when the amount is large, gravity dependent drainage occurs and they get collected in the dependent areas. This is an situation mostly encountered when the person has pneumonia and the phlegm refuses to come out. So patients are usually places in the head down position (prone) and then their chests are vigorously tapped to dislodge the phlegm and bring it to the mouth </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah...I didn't suggest they were dead tissue. </p>
<p>Honestly we never did much trendelenburg or chest physiotherapy in the hospital.</p></div>		</li>
