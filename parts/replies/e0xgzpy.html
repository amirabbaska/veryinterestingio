			<div class="markdown"><p>I attended an outrageously expensive dinner for my wife's birthday once which was made by a renowned chef.</p>
<p>We were chit-chatting with our server, who said she'd once asked the chef for a copy of a few of his recipes, to which he'd happily supplied her. She'd come back to him after looking at the recipes and seeing a shocking amount of butter, salt and sugar, and asked him if there were any &quot;diet&quot; versions.</p>
<p>The chef had laughed and said something like, &quot;No, there isn't. Now you know our secret.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My FIL gave me some of this the other day. We're ordering chinese, and he goes &quot;Just a special fried rice, it's low in fat.&quot; I then proceeded to explain that's 100&#37; not true, to which he replies, &quot;Well, it's a lot less fat than everything else on the menu.&quot;</p>
<p>He continued to gawk at our food and carry on about how he'd <em>looooove</em> to eat something like that, but he's making healthy choices. As someone who takes fitness pretty seriously, it was pretty grating.  </p>
<p>EDIT: He's also making &quot;healthy choices&quot; as he had major heart surgery last year. Some people can't be taught.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha yeah, really. When I cook for company, I don't change any recipes to make them healthier. I make the full fat, full sugar, full carb versions. If a healthy dish is <em>tasty</em>, it will definitely get a spot at the table. I have some amazing African vegan stew recipes... They're delicious, but they don't have that <em>savoriness</em> that naughty foods have.</p>
<p>There's no such thing as a decadent taste that doesn't come with a ton of calories, people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve had some great success with Umami Bomb seasoning (Adams reserve, I think ... but any msg/umami seasoning should suffice) to up the savory factor without sacrificing “healthiness”.</p>
<p>That alone is not as decadent and conversation stopping as a bunch of sugar and butter, but it goes a long way on both regular dishes for the week as well as those for-the-group dishes. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Pineapple.</p>
<p>1 cup of pineapple has sub 100 calories, and fresh pineapple is better than most candy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You actually can make southern green beans fairly healthy...the real thing that gives them a very different flavor than 'normal' green beans is...being cooked TO DEATH, not until done, like until it's complete mush...2-3 hours in a pressure cooker or about 16 hours in a normal pot...for some reason they are the best if you cook it 8 hours one day, put it in the fridge overnight and cook for 8 hours again the next day...like being cooled back down helps them.</p>
<p>Though yes you put butter in them, but it's not that much per amount...meat fat isn't necessary (if vegetarian) nor butter (we actually use a vegetable-oil based margarine), only real reason to use meat fat is if you wanted the meat flavor (my mom likes putting bacon in it)...if you were making a quart of them, maybe half a stick of margarine and one piece of bacon or so would do pretty well.</p></div>		</li>
