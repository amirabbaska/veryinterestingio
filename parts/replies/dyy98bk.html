			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to chime in and say that last part is called sleep paralysis. Pretty much when you’re sleeping your body goes into a state where you can’t move. </p>
<p>I have also heard that it’s possible to experience sleep paralysis for a short period after waking up which I think I may have experienced  leading to some weird pseudo-dreams as a kid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A sleep specialist explained to me that the loss of muscle tone during deep sleep is (at least partly) to keep you from acting out your dreams.</p>
<p>My wife probably appreciates my sleep paralysis during my ninja dreams.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, basically your eyes are open and you're conscious of your surroundings but your brain and body aren't fully awake yet so you're still paralyzed and you're seeing dream-like hallucinations overlayed over the room you're in. Being paralyzed and seeing things that aren't there freaks people out, so the hallucinations will often become scary as a result of that anxiety. A lot of people think they're supernatural (e.g. people think you can see ghosts while paralyzed) and that makes them even more prone to seeing ghosts and scary things because they're expecting it. but it's pretty much explainable why you see the things that you do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you first wake up, and I mean immediately after getting woken up from sleep, a lot of the time it’s hard to make a fist (due to thing that induces sleep paralysis) for a short time</p></div>		</li>
