<p>Adding to this: You do not know the right phrases, in law (actually in all specilised fields) certain things are expressed in a certain way. You also not know what is important to focus on or not in this context, maybe you talk about something but that is a non-issue from the perspective of a judge while you neglect to speak about something else that might be helping you.</p>
<p>Try to explain to a car mechanic what is broken in your car, if you never have taken a look at the motor: &quot;But Mr. Mechanic, there's this noise, I know for a truth that there, somewhere on the right, is that <em>tzzztzzztzzz</em>-noise! Just look for that, it also makes a bit <em>rttrttrtt</em> and fix it. The car will be done in no time, no big thing, I know it&quot;. That is a layman in a court. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, kinda. In law, people like to say that there are no &quot;magic words&quot; that you have to say just the right way in court or else you won't get what you're seeking. And that's largely true. You don't really need to know &quot;qui tam&quot; if you know that whistleblowers can bring a lawsuit, for example.</p>
<p>Knowing those magic words give you a huge, huge advantage off the court in researching, though. Most lawsuits are won off the court.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That is not what I mean, but in each field there are technical terms that carry a very specific, in this field defined meaning. This is important for very specificly communicate what you actually want to say (to say what you want to say) or to even understand the law (i.e. when you read those terms as layman, you might not get the implications it carries or does not carry). </p>

<p>For example, yes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The worst part are the people who believe in the &quot;magic words&quot; but don't actually know the law behind them - cargo cult law, basically. I'm talking about the freeman on the land types here. You can use the phrases and words like magic words all you want, but they are not, in fact, invocations that you can just sprinkle across a document to bind and compel your enemies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A lot. Assume you attempt to buy a used car but keep using the wrong terms without noticing or not knowing what is important in buying a car or a used car. Do you think you can do just as well as someone who is a professional in the field of cars and used cars? </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>You phrase this with a question. Are you willing to bet your freedom, fortune or your stand in society on the answer being &quot;of course he does&quot;?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it just red tape bullshit an technicalities</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, not really. It is precision regarding what you talk about and what the proper proceeding is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that the other side will take advantage of?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course the other side would do it. They would be stupid not to. But even if it does not, you are at a gross disadvantage. Just think about the &quot;used car thing&quot;, even if the seller is not trying to pull one over you but is honest: you still ask the wrong questions, you ask the right question with the wrong words or might not grasp all relevant meanings and are not asking a lot of things you should ask.</p></div>		</li>
