			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: in theory if we were to very carefully feed infants a tiny drop of bacteria ridden water or even very tiny miligrams of poison and allow their immune system to develop over time... Could we develop their immunity to the point of being able to consume raw meat or poison with no effect?</p>
<p>EDIT: took a break from work and my inbox has blown up with people reminding me about the existence of vaccines. I get it, thank you guys.. it completely slipped my mind. To my credit, I was specifically thinking about this scene from one of the Riddick films where VinD repeatedly exposes himself to venom to become immune and how we might someday create superpeople who could be pricked with anthrax and simply laugh it off, but yes, vaccines! Also, some mentioned homeopathy and rotten meat eating which I was unfamiliar with but TIL something new. Thank you for the explanations!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although people are sometimes described as being 'immune' to poison, the immune system is not involved. A better term to use for resistance that can be built up over time, by exposure to small amounts, to certain types of poison, is 'tolerance'.  Body tissues can 'learn' to function more or less normally in the presence of low doses of some otherwise harmful chemicals (alcohol is a common example). Tolerance cannot be built for some types of poisons like heavy metals, radioactive material, etc.</p>
<p>Immunity from low level exposure to pathogens (disease causing micro-organisms) comes in an entirely different way.  Instead, the immune system becomes 'primed' to recognize the invading organism and immediately attack and eliminate it.</p>
<p>TL;DR: immunity to poison and immunity to germs are not the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in China, we don't drink tap water without heatedâ€¦ because tap water in most areas is not safe enough to drink.
And lot of people are used to drink boiled water, especially hot water. Some Chinese may even get sick from drinking cold water (including filtered or boiled ones)
As for india, I heard of the unclean water issue you mentioned, too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But, you also only see the animals drinking, not hiding in the undergrowth puking their souls out, or dying prematurely from infections and poison. Just because they drink something doesn't mean it's automatically ok for them to do so. If there's nothing better to be had, they'll go for it and hope for the best, not like they can go to the next convenience store and buy a bottle of water instead.</p>

<p>Tell me about it. My one doggo has such a weak stomach just about anything other than clean water and dog food gives her her exogastric reactions. Thigh bone? Kaboom. Couch cushion? Kaboom. Tug Rope? Kaboom. Piece of Bacon? Kaboom. Puddle water? Kaboom. Rawhide chew? Kaboom. 14awg stranded copper? Kaboom. Toy Stuffing? Floof-Kaboom. Sure the list sounds bad, but that's almost a 2 year timespan. She's <em>usually</em> pretty good, but every now and then I find her tucked in a corner eating the latest in fine tupperware cuisine.</p>
<p>I take it back. The dumbass ate an alkaline AA battery one time and shit it out without somehow having any issues. Go figure. Meanwhile, vet says feed her some oats for fiber... that did not work so well either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That last one is more true than people realize.</p>
<p>Nature is not <em>Bambi</em>. Being a wild animal is a painful, uncomfortable, brutal, short existence.</p>
<p>But still people want to set all the zoo animals &quot;free&quot; because they have never lived the reality of being eaten by parasites, or having a predator murder their children.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're close to the truth, but you're missing something. Most people only look at alpha animals with K reproductive strategies. Long lived animals that tend to die nearish their maximum lifespan because very little threatens them. Tigers, Elephants, Whales, etc. For those animals, quality of life in the wild is relatively high. Prey species with r reproductive strategies? Not so much. Rodents for example live brutally short lives filled with constant terror for the most part. It's easy to see why whales are better off in the wild (we can't afford big enough tanks for them), but many other species it becomes either debatable or outright incorrect if we're talking strictly about quality of life.</p>
<p>This is of course compounded by romanticization, but it's definitely an important issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make some very good points. Perhaps we should learn to have different policies that distinguish between the two; rather than trying to generalize all species together.</p>
<p>There is one more thing to consider with K type species tho: that is disease. </p>
<p>A rat with an infection is likely to be caught by a predator as soon as it impedes the animal's ability to avoid predators; a K type species with an infection might be looking at a very long, slow death without any hope of recovering. </p>
<p>Is it better to live in a cage but be protected by the miracle of antibiotics? Or is freedom worth the eventual weeks or months of suffering? The problem is we can't really answer those questions; we are not tigers or whales. We are humans; and therefore any answer we give will be biased towards human values.</p>
<p>But really for the vast majority of anti-zoo-ers this isn't much of an argument. They want the antelopes and the flamingos freed just as much as the tigers and whales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im betting the people that actually <em>do</em> live in a cruel existence would. And besides it's not like all zoos are a cruel industry mindlessly ripping animals out of their habitat for fun. Zoos play a big part in ecological awareness.</p></div>		</li>

<p>On mobile and can't find source but its something like:</p>
<p>Could you imagine having to get up early for your shitty job and then on the way to work you have to deal with getting chased by a tiger and dying horribly. For most animals that's how you die screaming and getting ripped to shreds.</p></div>		</li>
