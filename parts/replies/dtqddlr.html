			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a large complaint about Assassin’s Creed Origins: One layer of the game’s DRM is that it runs inside of a proprietary VM, called VMProtect... Which is running to try and stop the second layer of DRM, Denuvo, from being cracked. Which is trying to stop the third layer of DRM, uPlay, from being cracked. Which is trying to stop the fourth (potential, if you bought it there,) layer of DRM, Steam, from being cracked. </p>
<p>As a result, it eats memory like a fat kid at a cake buffet. We know that Denuvo and VMProtect are both called continuously, (unlike uPlay and Steam, which just do a check-in at launch to see if everything is okay,) so the two of them combined (both running continuous checks,) have proven to be major memory hogs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, current consoles use the same basic architecture (x86) but it's not like you &quot;only&quot; have to emulate specific extras for games to run. They are not just PCs with a flashy front-end that run PC games with a fixed setting. There are a number of reasons why this is not as easy as it appears to be. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>any &quot;custom feature&quot; can be the thing that makes emulating the console an inefficient nightmare. Why is PS2 emulation still a rather hard thing to do even though it is such an old and weak console now? Because of its weird Hardware that basically does everything in the exact opposite way compared to modern PCs. And you can't just do it the &quot;modern PC way&quot; because it instantly starts to break and prevent it from working at all. Exotic extra features on consoles which enable it to do something normal PCs can't do, can easily take the emulation from &quot;hard to do&quot; to &quot;impossible right now&quot;. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because you can't run console games on any PC simply because both use the same basic architecture. Those games are specificly tailored for <strong>only that</strong> hardware. This is done for the sake of optimisation and maximizing performance. But it will also prevent different hardware from running the game just like that. They optimize at the lowest level and games strongly rely on that specific hardware to behave and perform how it is supposed to do. You rarely have comparable stuff like that on PC because games for PC are made with a far more general approach so games work on all PCs. Which means that getting PC games to run on xbone would probably be a lot easier than doing the opposite. It would probably run quite a bit worse than a nativ xbox version but it might run.
So you have to emulate all aspects of the console in order for all console games to work perfectly. Which means you still have to emulate those consoles in mostly the same way as any other console, even if the basic architecture is the same.</p>
</li>
<li>Games not only rely on specific hardware but also on specific custom made <em>software</em>. Which includes APIs only made for used by these consoles. It also includes relying on specific features from the consoles OS. Getting that to work accurately while still getting good performance might also not be a trivial task at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of those things, to some degree at least, are responsible for why we also still don't have a &quot;perfect&quot; xbox (the first one) emulator. It is still a common myth that xbox emulation should be easy to accomplish and people still regularly ask why we don't have great efficient xbox emulators already.
Because people still think that &quot;it is basically just an old PC right? So what's taking so long?&quot; but it sadly is just not how this works.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think we have <em>any</em> perfect emulators, except maybe for some MAME machines (and I even doubt that).  They all resort to software hacks/tricks to emulate various bits of the hardware (particularly audio hardware).</p>
<p>Under the hood, all the popular emulators have specific code to detect what ROM is being run and then optimizing the emulator for that specific title.  So, in a way, they are more software emulators than hardware ones.  I.e., the focus is on making the software behave properly vs. being a &quot;perfect&quot; simulation.</p>
<p>The notable exception is bsnes and Higan, which are focused on cycle-accurate hardware simulation (vs. emulation):</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. It's FAR more complex than &quot;well, they're both x86, right! So how hard can it be!&quot;. There more stuff going on than that. For starters, while the instruction set they're using is in fact x86, there is still some proprietary stuff going on too that needs to be emulated.  </p></div>		</li>
