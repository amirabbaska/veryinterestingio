It's just a number moved from one line to another, but it came from another line. The way banks make money is that they get money cheap, either from low interest loans from other banks or federal banks, or from deposits in savings accounts. The bank is required to keep something like 10% of your account on hand, the rest gets loaned out, and at a much higher interest rate than the pennies they give you for your savings account</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that means that the bank does not have the money. The 10% (I think it is much less actually) means that the bank only has that portion of the money they loan out. So like I said they just create money out of nowhere and we trust that the money they have (the money in people's account that is not owed to the bank) is enough to guarantee that they actually can pay you in &quot;real money&quot;. </p>
<p>To explain further, let's have a bank with zero money. Now if you save $100 to that bank they can now loan out $90 of that money. So what they do is they create a new line on someone elses account that says $90. Now you still have 100 and 90 appeared from nowhere to someone else. Now they can further loan 90% of that to a third person. And they can continue this as long as they have that 10% of the whole as real money that you deposited. So end result is $100 as real money and $900 as virtual money. And we trust that you who originally deposited the $100 and the guy who got the $90 loan do not want the money in cash at the same time. Because then obviously this example bank is in trouble. </p>
<p>So like I said the money only exists inside the bank. And it is not really lending out the money the bank has because they can skip that part. The end result is that they just create virtual money out of nowhere as long as they have the required portion in real money. Also I think that there are countries where the fraction law does not exist and the banks can create as much as they please as long as people trust their ability to provide the real money if required. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you deposit cash, you're loaning to the bank. Its not your money anymore, they owe you that money. It's a technicality, but this is the fundamental rule that all of accounting is based on, that all transactions have to balance, which is why it's called the balance sheet. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Digital money (as in normal bank account money, not cryptocurrencies) exists inside an institution such as a bank. A bank can and does &quot;forge&quot; new money all the time. They are limited by some laws but basically when you take a loan they just write a line on your account. And that money just appears out of nowhere.</p>

<p>I think you're confusing what private banks do with what central banks do.</p></div>		</li>
