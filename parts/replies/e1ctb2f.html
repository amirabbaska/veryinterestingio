			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the theories of how Tylenol works is via the endocannabinoid system. There's a [metabolite of acetaminophen]( <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM404" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM404</a>) that is molecularly similar to the endocannabinoid anandimide. If that theory is correct it makes sense that Tylenol could regulate emotions to some small degree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just so you know …. excessive use of Ibuprofen will also fork up your life. It either causes or aggravates intestinal ulcers. Up to and including perforating said ulcer and causing internal bleeding.</p>
<p>Source: I had an ulcer that was aggravated into bleeding. I damn near died when I didn't even realize I was in danger. I was under orders from my doctor too. I didn't just take a bottle of the stuff on my own. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on your body’s breakdown of the drug, if you take it with food and a lot of other factors. If you notice yourself getting a lot of stomach pain with Advil/ibuprofen and other NSAIDs it’s probably best to talk to your doctor, or try and use Tylenol (in the recommended dosage) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on 2000mg every 2 hours.</p>
<p>Doctor mis-diagnosed an ulcer as a muscle spasm. He had me take 1000mg 4 times per day and call him on Monday if it's not better. On Monday he told me to double the dose and call him Tuesday. On Tuesday he said take it twice as often (every 2 hours) without putting the dosage back at 500 or 1000mg.</p>
<p>A week later, I passed out in the garden several times. My sister drove me to the ER and we found that I had lost a lot of blood. It took two days to verify that I had a bleeding ulcer and get it fixed. They gave me two pints of blood the first day and two more the second. I still had twinges from it for years afterwards.</p>
<p>I will never again take ibuprofen for anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not who you asked but.. </p>
<p>I take 8 ibuprofen a day(1600mg) on days I work which is 13 out of every 14 days. The doctor asks what I take and how much. They offered to give me(we have a clinic thru work that gives free non-narcotic pills) bottles of 800mg. I told them no because I but them 1000 at a time and that's easier than having to order a new bottle every week because they come in 30 pill bottles. </p>
<p>They know I do and have told me multiple times to just take ibuprofen. Perceptions for ibuprofen come in 800mg pills and its usual for the perception to be take once or twice a day as needed for pain. So I don't consider that excessive. I would rather they do something besides tell me to take ibuprofen but being in my late 40 I doubt they ever will unless my pain becomes debilitating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on your lifestyle and your circumstances.</p>
<p>Personally, I drink just about every day, so I'll always reach for ibuprofen before I reach for acetaminophen.</p>
<p>But of course, I live in a country with health care, so if I get afflicted with any condition that causes chronic pain, I can just get it treated rather than having to take hundreds of ibuprofen caplets...............................</p></div>		</li>
