			<div class="markdown"><p>I found that topic always fascinating. There once was a time on Earth with little/no oxygen. The early living organisms didn't use it, it was deadly for them. At some point, algae and bacteria started to produce oxygen, and these organisms died out. Life, at this point, only had one option if it wanted to survive: To adapt to the otherwise toxic oxygen. This is when organisms arose that made use of it.</p>
<p>I always find it fascinating how oxygen is obviously what we need to live, yet it is what destroys cells and other organic matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anaerobic microorganisms are still around, some are able to tolerate oxygen, most that can't obviously went extinct but there are still environments with low oxygen levels that allow these them to survive.</p>
<p>Despite its knack for being toxic, aerobic respiration generates far more energy than anaerobic respiration so it's pretty useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok let me offer a few corrections. Oxygen is very reactive. It's able to react with many elements and molecules which is why it makes it so useful as a chemical. However, oxygen is not the reason things like food go bad. Edibles and organic matter that was once living mostly goes bad because it is decomposed by another organism. There are exceptions of course but in your day to day life that's pretty much always the case. In the case of the sandwich that's been sitting on the kitchen table for a week. All the fuzzy stuff that you see growing on it isn't oxygen breaking it down. It's fungus and bacteria having a feast and breaking the food down. </p>
<p>However, when it comes to pure elements, yes oxygen can react with them. However, not all elements can react with oxygen and the ones that do react don't necessarily react at the same rate. Where rust can form oxygen in a matter of weeks, aluminum oxide can form in less than a second. </p>
<p>Just wanted to inform you since it seemed like your understanding wasn't complete or accurate. Have a good one! &lt;3</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My bad, you're of course correct. Fungus, bacteria etc. is what spoils food and decomposes organic matter.</p></div>		</li>
