			<div class="markdown"><p>The closer rocks aren't moving as fast, and are more numerous. Some are so fast you can't do much, and those punch through. </p>
<p>The sail material is designed to let (slower) micrometeorites hit and vaporize at the front layer, so the kevlar-like back layer can catch it as a splash of vapor and liquid, rather than a hard object. </p>
<p>It does transfer momentum in both cases, over time acting as a friction vector. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest drawback of this would be transport  of material to replenish the created void, absent any transport medium, and absent as well a motive force. In practical terms the interface you are attempting to bridge in relative microgravity is bounded in vacuum. And too consider the Laws of Thermodynamics. It' a big ask of the as yet undeveloped material.</p></div>		</li>
