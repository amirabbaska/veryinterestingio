			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, a man died close to where I live last year from a lightning strike in the ocean. Also, I knew another person who was hit by the same strike and his heart stopped, but we was resuscitated on the beach.

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be more accurate if it said within a few feet of the surface, not piercing the surface.  Seawater is a conductor,  but not nearly ideal like copper or silver,  so the skin effect becomes a pretty macro scale thing.... Very thin if looking at the whole ocean,  but pretty thick if you are swimming in the first few feet of depth. I don't know about killed,  but fish in the first few feet of depth near a strike are definitely severely stunned at least.  I have seen this happen at sea. </p>
<p>Edit: it seems,  based on a little googling,  the estimates of the lethal distance in Salt water from the strike point range from 20 to 100 feet.  I have personally seen lethal effects at more than 20 feet. </p></div>		</li>
