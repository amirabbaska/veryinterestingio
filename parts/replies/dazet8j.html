			<div class="markdown"><p>It´s actually adaptative in natural context, as it focuses your resources into fight or flight responses that would work to eliminate or avoid physical danger. However, in our modern context, the things that threaten us are usually abstract,sometimes out of our control, meaning that the focus of resources becomes a drain as it´s not designed to be active for long periods of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about that. When I have panic attacks, sometimes there is absolutely no trigger. I'll be going about my normal day, and suddenly all I want to do is find a place to hide, the smallest space I can possibly jam myself into, and hyperventilate for no particular reason until I make myself sick. I fail to see how this is evolutionarily helpful in any way.</p>
<p>Yes, it's a fight or flight instinct, but when it's not actually in reaction to anything, it's not helping to form any reasonable survival habits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in some cases, it can be endogenic (inside-generated) , when it has no apparent exogenic (outside) cause. I don´t know about your case, there´s a myriad of reasons that might happen. Might require a change in lifestyle or other issues you don´t realize about yourself, although even that might not be enough. It might also require a change in the way you confront your anxiety. If it harms you, you might want to seek professional help. I would start with psychologists rather than psychiatrists, as the latter tend to give medication too freely. There are nice, useful techniques for managing anxiety, which give a base to learn how to cope with it. It can be a long process, but the quality of life gained makes it worth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be somewhat introverted, but there is probably some social interactions you are comfortable with (old friends, family, strangers without ties...) most people are ambiverted, leaning towards intro or extro. Some degree of interaction is needed, if not rewarding at all, might not be the type of interaction you need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Driving <strong>is</strong> dangerous though. People get into car accidents all the time and sometimes get seriously injured or die. That's a direct result of getting in a car and driving it on the road. It's almost guaranteed to happen when you are moving around at 50 mph in a 4,000lbs metal box. Another vehicle can smash into yours at any moment.
(I have some driving anxiety...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just look at it this way, though: There's really no better time to be driving, safety wise.  Cars today are safer than they have ever been, and your chances of walking away from a fairly major crash are astronomical.  </p>
<p>Also, I have found that taking defensive driving courses help, quite a bit.  Look for a good one in your area. The state police usually run them, and they can help you become a better driver, and feel more confidant behind the wheel. :)</p></div>		</li>
