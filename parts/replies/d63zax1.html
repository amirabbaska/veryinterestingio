			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally.  Thank you.  A shock wave is a natural occurrence and it's not obvious that it should exist.  It's not air molecules bunching up, and there is no way to explain why shock waves exist with rubber balls or skiiers.  It is inherently not intuitive or obvious.  And they are impossible to explain, without first explaining that the speed of sound in a medium (a*) is the rate at which information can travel in that medium.</p>
<p>Air molecules cannot physically get out of the way fast enough, so somehow nature figured out how to convert energy into heat and pressure instantaneously, so that the molecules touching the moving body are below a* and can get out of the way (except in oblique shocks of course).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Got a follow up question. You said the changes are nearly instantaneous... But supposing you somehow found a way to maintain travel at <em>precisely</em> the speed of sound, would the boom be constant?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The boom is constant at or above the speed of sound. That's what I mean by saying it's not a single occurance. It's just that it sounds like a single boom because the sound wave is passing you on the ground. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sonic booms are already constant. We just think of them as being short because anything going fast enough to create one will very quickly pass out of hearing range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then why does it sound like a boom followed by a roar, instead of just a roar suddenly starting? I found videos online of jets breaking the sound barrier as they reached the camera filming, and it still sounded like an initial boom followed by a sustained roar. I'm not trying to be argumentative, just really curious</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do 'communicate'. You only have them not 'communicate' in the pressure regime of molecular flow. Normal air behaves according to bulk or continuous flow. That is where the mean free path of any molecule makes it 'run into' another molecule in less than the distance of the objects confining it. Shock waves ARE high pressure waves. Pressure changes ARE sound. You don't need to say &quot;energy to be released in the form of sound.&quot;  The pressure wave is ALREADY sound.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no, they are not pressure waves. They are pressure discontinuities. The air near a shock wave certainly communicates as normal, but the air across a shock wave does not... again, this is difficult to wrap your head around. It's a discontinuity in the real world. Sound is produced from it, but a shock wave is not a wave in the sense that you're explaining it. It's not puddles in a pond and doesn't follow basic flow rules. Again, shock waves are. not. high pressure waves, They create pressure and sound waves, but the shock wave itself is something different. A shock wave described in its simplest form would be a discontinuous change in pressure/temperature/density. </p></div>		</li>

<p>no, they are not pressure waves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They most certainly are a pressure wave. One that travels faster than the local speed of sound. There are endless graphs of shock waves showing a rise and fall of pressure. The rise can be very high. Why shock waves are often destructive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but the air across a shock wave does not</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Since the air before and after the wave can only move at the speed of sound and the wave is faster, there is not enough time to 'communicate' across the wave front. That does not detract from the shock wave being a pressure wave. The pressure wave is pushed by the energy of the source origin. Why they decay rapidly away fro the source.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>doesn't follow basic flow rules</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does follow wave mechanics. Including things like reflections off of surfaces. An important consideration in explosion effects.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_wave" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_wave</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A blast wave in fluid dynamics is the pressure and flow resulting from the deposition of a large amount of energy in a small very localised volume. The flow field can be approximated as a lead shock wave, followed by a 'self-similar' subsonic flow field. In simpler terms, a blast wave <strong>is an area of pressure expanding supersonically outward</strong> from an explosive core. <strong>It has a leading shock front of compressed gases.</strong> The blast wave is followed by a blast wind of negative pressure, which sucks items back in towards the center. The blast wave is harmful especially when one is very close to the center or at a location of constructive interference. High explosives, which detonate, generate blast waves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit, I found a science paper discussing this, from Princeton University. Please note their discussion of a shock pressure wave moving outward from the source.</p>
