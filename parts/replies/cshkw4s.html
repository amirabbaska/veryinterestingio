<p>I love this estimate. Its like saying &quot;we've narrowed down the object's mass to between a liter of milk and 164 super-carriers.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, when you think of the vastness of the universe, that's pretty good, considering we can actually build and perceive the volume of 164 super carriers.</p>
<hr />
<p>And I know it was just an analogy, the actual difference between 10^50 and 10^60 is not in anyway perceivable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's the formatting on mobile, but I'm seeing 1050kg to 1060kg.
1 tonne?
I'm about 90% sure the universe does not have the same mass as OP's mom, but I might be missing something</p>
<p>EDIT: okay so it's not 1050, but 10(power)50</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To follow up with that... would it be possible for two super-massive objects which are really far away to accelerate each other to the speed of light? And if so, what exactly would be what stops it from going over in this context?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one knows what stops things from going faster than the speed of light. It just seems to be a hard speed limit in the universe. That's how it looks in all our experiments, and in Einstein's relativity theory, which is well-supported by lots of evidence. </p>
<p>But that theory does not explain why light speed is the top speed. It just assumes (postulates) it is true, and then goes from there. The fact that the theory works so well tells that the postulate is probably true, but it doesn't tell us why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure about that. Here's a copy-paste from wiki:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>as v approaches c, and it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate an object with mass to the speed of light. The speed of light is the upper limit for the speeds of objects with positive rest mass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there's just not more energy to put into the system to make it go faster.</p>
<p>But in the case of my question, the energy would already be there as potential energy, I assume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re: the first paragraph</p>
<p>Could you really say that an object with all the mass of the universe had any gravity at all?</p>
<p>Gravity is the measure of the force between <em>two</em> objects with mass, after all. If one object has all the mass, there's no second object with mass to measure with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;uni-object&quot; would still deform spacetime, which is how a gravitational field is characterized under general relativity. But if it has nothing to attract, does that matter? If there are no trees in the forest to fall, does &quot;sound&quot; still mean something (or &quot;forest&quot;)? Seems kind of philosophical.</p>
<p>Anyway, that outcome seems unlikely due to dark energy. There are distant galaxies today traveling away from each other at an apparent relative speed higher than the speed of light from our perspective. They'll literally never see each other again.</p></div>		</li>
