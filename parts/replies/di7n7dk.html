<p>In any case, the costs of making a PS4 don't fluctuate the way that potato chips do, and even then, there's not much room for sales.</p>

<p>Actually the cost of making electronics isn't large, it's mostly NRE which includes the cost to pay your employees to design the device, and then the cost of the the factory to build it (even if outsourced, this doesn't change the fact that you have to play someone else to build it). Electronics are made mostly of sand, relatively easy to find metal, and plastics. The company is usually well into the red until millions of the consoles sell because the high NRE for building new electronics, which is why consoles are placed so high. That said</p>

<p>Over time it gets easier and faster and more automated</p>

<p>For reasons that should be obvious, most electronics are fully automated in assembly from the get go, so this isn't a thing really. The reason for the price decrease later on is because years later, the company is finally making profit and they can afford to make adjustments. </p>
<p>Likewise for video games. It doesn't take any physical materials to make software, so you're really paying for the NRE. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are being too harsh.  Sony suffered from yield problems in their chips for the PS3 at the start and as their efficiency improved they naturally improved their profits.  The Xbox 360 had the RRoD boxing units and costing them tons in repairs until they got the issue sorted.</p>
<p>I certainly agree with you that the paper accounting naturally improves as these things age.  But I do think there are substantive improvements made in their process as they learn by doing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because these consoles use cutting edge tech</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well that's not true. PS4 and X1 use hardware that was at best mid-range in early 2012 while they launched late 2013.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is very well written. I would like to add something that for food prices the prices fluctuate also because of season For Eg the prices of mangoes are high in the off season whereas the prices are low during the seasonâ€‹ and also the prices may vary according to the supplies i.e excessive food items may be offered at lower price at a particular store.  </p></div>		</li>
