<blockquote>
<p>The Oxford English Dictionary records the use of the word &quot;mayonnaise&quot; in English in 1815.[7] The Larousse Gastronomique suggests: &quot;Mayonnaise, in our view, is a popular corruption of moyeunaise, derived from the very old French word moyeu, which means yolk of egg.&quot;[8] The sauce may have been named mayennaise after Charles de Lorraine, duke of Mayenne, because he took the time to finish his meal of chicken with cold sauce before being defeated in the Battle of Arques.</p>

<p>As to why we decided to borrow the French word for Chinese</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We didn't, at least not exactly. The following might interest /u/kthxtyler.</p>
<p>We got the name of the country from Duarte Barbosa, a 16th-century explorer from Portugal. Where he got the word from is not known: either the Persian word for the country &quot;Chīn&quot;, or the name of the Qin Dynasty.</p>
<p>Whatever: 40 years later Barbosa's journal was translated into English, and this gave us the name &quot;China&quot; for the country. And because that name came from Portuguese, we followed the Portguese model for the demonym: &quot;chinês&quot;.</p>
<p>That's why so many demonyms for peoples in the Far East end in &quot;-ese&quot;: the first Europeans to describe them were usually Spanish or Portuguese.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For why some things are -ese and others are -ian, you’ll have to ask the Ancient Romans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two different suffixes with similar, but slightly different, meanings. The suffix &quot;-an&quot; is added to a place name to indicate that somebody comes from that place; the suffix &quot;-ensis&quot; (which is now our &quot;-ese&quot;) was used to denote membership of a family, a tribe or a nation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My hypothesis is that widespread exploration to China and contact with the Chinese came after the Norman takeover in the 1100s while a lot of the -ish nationalities came before (Scottish, Irish, Flemish, etc.). The French influence had already taken root by the time they needed a specific word for “people from China”, so they went with the -ais inspired -ese. Just a guess. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re thinking in the right direction. I wrote my college thesis on Latinate vs Germanic affixes, though I was looking at different linguistic patterns, rather than proper noun creation. I focused on inconsistent affix applications (e.g., why do we audibly pronounce second the “b” in bombard but not in bombing? Did the word or the affix influence our pronunciation? Etc.). It does have some to do with your hypothesis, which is that it can be driven by the timing with which the word entered/phoneme our language in a mainstream sense. The origin of the word (or affix type) also influences eventual pronunciation when combining phonemes. Again, I didn’t look specifically at the question OP asks, but I would guess that the conclusions I drew in my work are at least somewhat applicable here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Exploration of China&quot; makes it sounds like Westerners were trekking through 'undiscovered' land like fucking Lewis and Clark -- contact with China was mostly through <em>trade</em>, not &quot;exploration&quot; (even if Marco Polo did indeed go to China, he was an exception not the rule).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>There's an interesting opposite effect in the Chinese language as well. The major western powers that China first had contact with were given names that sort of connect to something people in China knew about the country, and sort of sound like the name of the country.</del></p>
<p><del>So if you take the names completely literally, America is &quot;beautiful country&quot; Germany is &quot;philosopher country&quot; France is &quot;law country&quot; and England is &quot;hero country&quot; - Most other countries have names that don't have any meaning other than just being as close as you can get to copying the name phonetically with Chinese characters.</del></p>
<p>Edit: Whoops, I'm wrong. Sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. The common names for those countries are just shortened versions of transliterations, and it happens to be that transliterations usually use characters that have good qualities rather than bad. China did not think America particularly beautiful, or at least, it is completely separate from how they arrived at the name. Likewise, they didn't think Germany full of philosophers (also, 德 doesn't mean philosophy; it means virtue). The full transliterations are 亞美利加 (Yǎměilìjiā for &quot;America&quot;) 德意志 (Déyìzhì for &quot;Deutsch&quot;), 法蘭西 (Fǎlánxī for &quot;France&quot;), 英格蘭 (Yīnggélán for &quot;England&quot;). But Chinese is not fond of long words, so they've all been shortened to 美國 &quot;Mei country&quot;, 德國 &quot;De country,&quot; 法國 &quot;Fa country,&quot; 英國 &quot;Ying country,&quot; respectively, with no particular attachment to the meanings of any of the single characters that are really only there to represent a sound.</p>
<p>By the way, these, along with Russia (俄國 from 俄羅斯 Èluósī) and Japan, were the Imperialist powers that carved out pieces of China after the Opium Wars. I guarantee they weren't trying to compliment them by giving them great sounding names.</p></div>		</li>
