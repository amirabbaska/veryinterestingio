			<div class="markdown"><p>Engineers are problem solvers â€“ we apply scientific principles to solve problems in the real world.  I like to think of systems engineers as the engineers that are responsible for bringing together all the disciplines on a team to ensure the the successful realization of the system.  Most people think of systems as airplanes, cars, computers, etc.  But systems could also be a family system, a healthcare system, an educational system, etc.  I have included a formal definition below; however, systems engineering thinking, methods, processes, and tools are used across several industries.
The International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) defines it as an interdisciplinary approach and means to enable the realization of successful systems. It focuses on defining customer needs and required functionality early in the development cycle, documenting requirements, then proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem. Systems Engineering integrates all the disciplines and specialty groups into a team effort forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation. Systems Engineering considers both the business and the technical needs of all customers with the goal of providing a quality product that meets the user needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My previous job was as a systems engineer.  </p>
<p>To answer your first question. Get a degree in a science [computer, electric, mechanical, etc...]  </p>
<p>Like software or electrical engineers, systems engineers go in levels... more experience means more money/higher level.  </p>
<p>There really is no limit on where it can take you as a whole. For any given system, if you devote enough time, you could end up as a program manager, or a director and pretty much steer the ship when it comes to devopement.</p>
<p>Hope this answered some questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I come from the SP telecoms world so it might be a little different in other fields. </p>
<p>Promotion wise there is a lot of routes upwards. I'm in presales design so I focus a lot on profitability, integration, life cycles, retirement and replacement. To promote upwards I can do a specific focus on any of these. </p>
<p>But I'm more of a strategist for my customers. Where are you headed? What is the rest of the industry doing? Why do we want to head there?</p>
<p>How does your and my vision differ and why? Which is profitable... the road map toward it. </p>
<p>I could switch to a post sales implementation role and my title becomes solution architect. I would take the current SE vision and implement and design the subcomponents to fit in and work correctly together. But the SE does this as well on projects just not as in depth as the SA would.</p>
<p>Management and program oversight is also a option. Specialising in specific kinds of designs like security or storage or logistics is a option. Or specific verticals like healthcare, public sector or Enterprise is also an option. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest thing about systems engineering is making sure everything works together. While some focus on designing the processor for a smartphone as an example, the systems engineer makes sure the smartphone works as a whole. For design people, it's the gestalt. </p></div>		</li>
