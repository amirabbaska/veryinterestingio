Give me a battery that charges in 5 minutes and lasts as long as current lithium and I'll never complain again. I'll even trade significantly reduced charging cycles for this.</p>
<p>The Samsung S7, and I imagine other newest-gen phones, now have quick charge. It works amazingly well. I don't see this advertised as much as it should be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd like to point out that we've had &quot;quick charge&quot; (proprietary QCOM name) for almost 4 years now. And multiple manufacturers have their own versions of it. Oddly enough Apple seems to have ignored including such a feature, and the only thing you can do is use an ipad or similar charger to charge your iphone slightly faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The incandescent bulb was pretty great when it was initially made.  Almost nothing has changed in it besides adding planned obsolescence by using finer filaments.  Granted it took a few thousand iterations to get to wound tungsten but once that was made it was the standard for like 100 years.</p></div>		</li>
