			<div class="markdown"><p>That is only true if you have automatic transmission where most have a  hydraulic torque converter convert the engine to the gear box.</p>
<p>On a car with manual transmission  you need to press down the clutch pedal so disengage the engine for the gear box. If you don't do that that the engine will stall when the car stop.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The wheels are connected to the.. axle. </p>
<p>The axle is connected to the.. drive shaft.</p>
<p>Now shake dem drivetrain parts!</p>
<hr />
<p>And that's how you stall the engine on a manual car, hitting the brakes without the clutch, which stop the wheels and because the wheels are part of the drivetrain, they cause the engine to stall the drivetrain stops moving when it's in gear. So the brakes DO stop the engine, just with a few extra steps as opposed to when you shut the engine off.</p>
<p>Also, yes, I know i skipped a bunch of stuff, but without rewriting the entire damn song it would've ruined it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and if you apply the brakes to them they will slow down all parts of the drive train including the engine. You need to use the clutch to disconnected the engine. There is no hydraulic torque converter or any other part that does that automatically. </p>
<p>So if you press the break on a car with manual transmission you will stop the engine unless you press down the clutch at the same time.</p>
<p>So the reson that the car can idle when you are still is because of a hydraulic torque converter or a clutch or some other mechanism that  disconnects it from the wheels.</p></div>		</li>
