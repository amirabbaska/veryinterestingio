			<div class="markdown"><p>Dogs have evolved to live with and pay attention to humans for tens of thousands of years. They're extremely good at figuring out what we want them to do. They know what pointing means, something not even other apes do. Dogs and humans are a very special case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're not even great at recognizing people. Even more so when it comes to different race than ours/races we don't have much immersion in.</p>
<p>Quoting Wikipedia: &quot; A study was made which examined 271 real court cases. In photographic line-ups, 231 witnesses participated in cross-race versus same-race identification. In cross-race lineups, only 45% were correctly identified versus 60% for same-race identifications.&quot; Sure, this particular one isn't about faces we see daily vs random people, but it does have a point that we have trouble recognizing our own species when it comes to race. I wonder how would we do on a test recognizing similar looking animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dogs and cats don't only view their owners/handlers from close quarters though. Virtually any distance greater than 6 feet will give them the view we have of each other, and many dogs and cats will interact with or see their owners from an elevated position on furniture as well.</p></div>		</li>
