			<div class="markdown"><p>No it isn't that. Ive taken a lot of tolerance breaks before. It really just came on suddenly. Ive met a lot of people that have similar experiences after smoking for so long. I pretty much only smoke for a head change now, otherwise it's just usually really annoying and isn't fun anymore. Even when I have a decent tolerance built up. It just affects me differently now. </p></div>		</li>
