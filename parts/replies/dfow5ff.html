			<div class="markdown"><p>Pardon me if I sound stupid, but when do you actually start getting  a &quot;share&quot; of the profits that a company earns? Say I'm a billionaire and I decide to buy so many Nike stocks that I now own 10% of Nike. Will I get 10% of the profits that Nike earns that year? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are called dividends. Not all companies pay dividends though. specifically ones that believe their profits are better spent reinvested in the company to generate more profit later. which will increase stock price. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Others have mentioned dividends, but the other way you get paid for your investment is selling at a higher price. Let's say Nike announces a new shoe brand that's super successful. The value of Nike could maybe go up, by say 5%, and in turn your shares would go up by 5% in value.</p>
<p>Now you have some options. You could hold the shares and theoretically be richer (unrealized gains). Or you could sell your shares for cash and then your gains would be realized. </p>
<p>Edit: spelling</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So aside from dividends the big force that essentially drives the stock prices up...is the perceived likelihood of them going up?</p>
<p>To rephrase, I'll invest in Nike because its stock price increased by 5% because they released a new shoe. </p>
<p>But the only reason its stock price went up after the release....is because other investors predicted that its price would go up and invested...therefore its price went up?</p>
<p>I realize how dumb that sounds but I hope I conveyed at least some part of the question.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No you won't. Board of Nike decides if they want pay dividends this year. If so, they decide what part of income they will distribute among shareholders and you will recieve 10% of that amount. Usually dividends per share are miserable low. eg for Nike it's $0.18 while a share costs ~$55 on market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What bothers me about the stock market is it's strictly dependent on how many people want each stock and has really nothing to do with value of the company. Sure, the value of the company can influence people'sâ€‹ decision to buy the stock, which in turn will drive the price of that stock up, but there is no direct relation to stock price and value of a company.</p>
<p>At least this is my understanding of the stock market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are absolutely right. But that's broadly the same for all products. Prices are set, determined and flexed by the demand for them. </p>
<p>A lot of the time it happens before the product is released though so you don't see it happening. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a bit of hyperbole, I think. Demand plays a significant role in stock valuation, and is driven by many things, including company value. </p>
<p>I think to have such a strict condition for what &quot;direct value determination&quot; of any item is to <em>kind of</em> devalue everything. There's no direct relation to bread price and quality of the bread, when you zoom out far enough. It's true, but it's not really a meaningful thought, you know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't you say demand is the only factor driving a stock price? A company doing extremely well can have its stock price still be low if nobody wants to buy that stock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not entirely correct. In the short term the price of the stock may depend on simple supply and demand. But over a reasonably long period of time (say more than 5 years), the price of a company goes up only if it performs well, I.e. it makes profits and the prospect of future profits are good. And this is the only reason smart people still invest in the stock market. If it were entirely based on speculation, it would be almost like gambling and you can never make money through that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if a company performs well and is expected to perform well for years to come, that still doesn't directly affect the value of their stock. People will still need to want to buy the stock. So, in essence, isn't the underlying determining factor in the decision to buy a stock rely on the belief that other people will want to buy that stock later on, thereby driving the stock value up and earning you a profit?</p></div>		</li>
