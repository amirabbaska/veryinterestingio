<p>The Americans didn’t want a democratically elected Prime Minister over in Iran as he wanted to keep all the oil revenues for the people of Iran. So, the Americans arranged and funded a counter-coup and put the Shah’s son, Reza Shah, back in charge.</p>

<p>Honestly, he didn't want anything more of those oil revenues than what the USA currently does for Alaskan citizens (or Norway, for that matter).  It was butthurt oil executives lobbying corrupt government officials that got this started.  And the effort was started by the British, America just came along for the ride. As allies.  The CIA gets most of the blame.</p></div>		</li>

Thus began the first notable period of Islamic revival of the last hundred years.&quot;</p>
<p>This is the first time I've heard this assertion.  Can you provide a source?</p></div>		</li>
