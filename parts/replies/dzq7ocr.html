			<div class="markdown"><p>The energy cost associated with adding another nucleon to an atom depends on the nuclear interaction, which holds the nuclei together, and the Coulomb interaction trying to push the protons apart. The nuclear force is very short-ranged, and basically is only significant for adjacent nucleons. This means that the energy cost for adding a single nucleon associated with the nuclear force is more or less constant. For the Coulomb interaction, however, all the protons will repel all the other protons, so the energy cost associated with that will depend on the number of pairs of protons, which is Z(Z-1)/2. This gives a quadratic scaling. Since this increases for higher Z, it tends to push nuclei to have low numbers of protons relative to numbers of neutrons.</p>
<p>An example: say we have an atom with 40 protons, and we want to add some protons to it. Each proton, once added, is gonna end up surrounded by other nucleons, and can be surrounded by no more than a dozen, so there's only gonna be a dozen or so nucleons holding it in the nucleus. However, if you go to add a proton, you find it's being repelled by 40 other protons. Well, say you succeed, and now you have an atom with 41 protons, and you want to add another. Again, there's only gonna be dozen or so nucleons holding it inside the nucleus, but now there's 41 protons trying to push it away, so it's even harder to add. At some point, it just becomes impossible to add another proton, and you need to add neutrons instead.</p>
<p>Now, this explanation may raise another question: if it becomes ever more expensive to add protons to a nucleus, why do nuclei have lots of protons at all? Isn't it just better for them to have lots of neutrons since then there's no repulsive force? The solution for this turns out to be asymmetry. Protons and neutrons aren't just sitting there in the nucleus not doing anything - they're in orbits, like the electrons, but these are nuclear orbits, which are much smaller and differently shaped. Like electrons, though, nucleons can't all occupy the same orbit, and must occupy higher and higher energy ones as more are added. Since protons and neutrons are different particles, they have their own sets of orbits to occupy. If you tried to add a bunch of neutrons to a nucleus, you'd end up with loads of neutrons in high energy orbits, and loads of vacant low energy orbits for protons. At some point, it becomes energetically favourable for those neutrons to turn into protons and occupy the low energy orbits. A bit of maths shows that this energy difference is roughly proportional to the difference in the number of protons and neutrons squared, divided by the total number of nucleons, which overall amounts to a linear scaling. This asymmetry term tends to push nuclei to have the same number of protons and neutrons.</p>
<p>So you can't have a nucleus with too many protons, because the Coulomb force goes up quite fast as you add more and more protons, and you can't have too many neutrons, since then the asymmetry term goes up. The asymmetry term tends to push nuclei towards having the same number of protons and neutrons, but the Coulomb terms tends to push it towards having more neutrons, so overall you get more neutrons. Since the Coloumb term increases faster than the asymmetry term as the size of the atom increases, for larger atoms you end up with more and more neutrons relative to protons as the asymmetry term has to work harder to balance out the Coulomb term.</p>
<p>Back to our example from before, just to hopefully make things extra clear. Say we have our atom with 40 protons, and say it has 50 neutrons, so we have an asymmetry of 10 nucleons. We can either add a proton or a neutron. A proton will have the Coulomb force of 40 other protons pushing it away, while a neutron will have no Coulomb interactions, but will increase the asymmetry to 11 nucleons. Say the asymmetry energy is still less than the Coulomb energy, so we end up adding the neutron. Now our atom has 40 protons and 51 neutrons. We try adding another nucleon. Again, a proton has 40 other protons pushing it away, but now the neutron would increase the asymmetry to 12 nucleons. Well, in this case, it's still better to add the neutron. We try again, and find we can add another neutron, taking us to 40 protons and 52 neutrons. The next time we try, however, we have our proton, being repelled by 40 protons, and our neutron, which would increase the asymmetry to 13 nucleons, but this time we find that, since the asymmetry energy has gone up while the Coulomb energy has stayed the same, it's now more favourable to add a proton.</p>
<p>If our atom had been larger, then the Coulomb energy would've grown even more relative to the asymmetry term, and so we'd need an even larger asymmetry to balance it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is partially a geometrical problem.</p>
<p>You can quickly make an experiment in 2 dimensions.</p>
<p>First draw a honeycomb pattern (hexagons touching sides).</p>
<p>Now you need to fill in a number of P's and N's so that they fill up a continuous area, and so that no P's are in cells touching each other.</p>
<p>With 2 P's this requires 2 N's between them.</p>
<p>With 3 P's you suddenly have to use 4 N's to fill the spaces between them.</p>
<p>With 4 P's you have several possible configurations, with the smallest (rhombic) shape requiring 5 N's and the more &quot;round variants requiring 6 N's</p>
<p>Now in reality this is a 3-dimensional problem, but I think the 2D experiment gives you an idea of how it goes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their comment is about the nucleon-nucleon interaction, which looks something like <a href="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/ottytipgwschoolmarch2015lecture3-160304082937/95/physics-astrophysics-simulation-of-gravitational-wave-source-lecture-3-18-638.jpg?cb=1457080312" target="_blank">this</a>. It's a combination of multiple Yukawa potentials, each one multiplied by some factors of spin and isospin operators, etc.</p>
<p>Each Yukawa potential is like a typical 1/r potential, except modulated by an exponential factor. The range of the exponential factor is inversely related to the mass of the &quot;force carrier&quot; particle.</p>
<p>For the electromagnetic force, the force carrier is massless, so the potential is just a 1/r, and the force between point charges is just a 1/r^(2).</p>
<p>But the force carriers for the NN interaction are not massless, so it has a short range.</p></div>		</li>
