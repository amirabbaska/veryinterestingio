<p>The island refers to the tower that's in the center of the deck to the side.  The first floor (deck) of that &quot;tower&quot; (island) is where flight ops is, and they have a literal miniature scale model of the flight deck and little miniature planes that represent real planes on the flight deck.  They move it around like a board game, to make sure they have situational awareness of where all the planes are, and where they need to be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Island: The superstructure on the flight deck.</p>
<p>Nimitz class carriers have 4 catapults. They are steam powered. Catapults on newer Carriers are electromagnetic I believe. Anyway, for the steam power, they draw steam off the nuclear reactor. The steam goes from the secondary loop of the reactor to the cat riser which then feeds the catapults. Part of the job of the reactor operator is to monitor and control the cat risers. If too many planes are launched too quickly, the riser can become depleted. The reactor operator can of course feed the riser as much steam as it needs, but this of course causes an increase in steam demand, which increases reactor power output, which increases fuel depletion. It's all a delicate dance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A U.S. Aircraft Carrier has four catapults.  Two called the &quot;bow cats&quot; and two called the &quot;waist cats&quot;.  The bow cats are two at the very front of the ship, the waist cats are two cats that kinda point off to the the port (left) side of the ship, at about a 20 degree angle.  </p>
<p>All cats can be, and often are, used simultaneously, but..not...like, literally at the same time.  Meaning, you can have all four in operation, but it's a rotating basis.  They will never launch two cats at the exact same time...there will be a 30 second delay or so between launches.  The last thing that a carrier would want would be to deal with two failed cat launches at the same time (two crashed aircraft at once).  </p>
<p>So, you'll have one plan taking off on a cat, and once it takes off, the next plane is right behind ready to get into position to go.  They can line up almost right behind where the first plane is taking off, because a JBD (Jet Blast Deflector) raises up from the deck.  So you can have an FA-18 doing full afterburner right into the JBD, with another jet only 20 or 30 feet behind it, just getting ready for their turn.</p>
<p>So, while the other three cats are each taking their 30 seconds to launch their planes, that first cat will have hooked up the next plane, so it rotates right back around and they can have continual plane launches, staggered by about 30 seconds per plane...with about a 2 minute turnover for each cat.  </p>
<p>If the planes are all ready to go, a U.S. Carrier can get ALOT of planes into the air, very very quickly.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Would there not also be the concern of supplying enough steam pressure to operate all four cats at literally the same time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Early American carriers (before angled decks) deck parked aircraft both fore and aft; they had to move them from one end to the other to accommodate take-off and landings. They achieved bigger air groups by putting more airplanes on the ship than could be fit into just the hanger. </p>
<p>The Yorktown class was actually designed to launch / retrieve aircraft in either direction (with the ship sailing full-astern as necessary), though that was found to be impractical.</p>
<p>The WW2 Brits and the Japanese were not so big on deck parking and they tended to field fewer aircraft per carrier. Considerably fewer in the case of the British.</p>
<p>FWIW, some carriers have sported two-levels of hangars under the flight deck, with the Japanese carrier Kaga said to have had three hangar levels. </p>
