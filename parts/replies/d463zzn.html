			<div class="markdown"><p>More fun facts, because there's no room for error and it's hard to tell amongst all the jolts, when the pilot lands on a carrier they go straight to takeoff pre-AB power. If they hit the wire it'll stop them anyway and they can let off the power. If they missed the wire they need to be at full throttle pre-AB immediately in order to not roll off the deck and go in the drink. </p>
<p>Also, because the catapult shoots you forward so hard, the pilots trim the elevator nose up but keep their hand OFF the joystick (on a hold bar) during takeoff so as to not pull up into a stall immediately after release. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes!<br />
I went to the Midway aircraft carrier museum in San Diego and was expecting a hokey museum thing (lots of mannequins and printed cards). instead I found that all of the guides are people who served on aircraft carriers (the Midway in specific so far as I know) and were happy to take questions and being fairly intelligent and curious I engaged a few at length. it was so nice to have an actual navy pilot explain take off and landing and be open to my stupid questions.<br />
any way, if you are in San Diego and have the least interest in aircraft carriers I highly recommend the Midway thing. yes, there are lots of mannequins and printed cards but the docents are really the best part. I think they are all volunteer too which is crazy.</p></div>		</li>
