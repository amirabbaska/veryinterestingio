			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer for the question. All the other comments have gotten off point into unusual attitudes during flight, not the actual question of when the plane rotates can I see it.</p>
<p>You can definitely see from your seat the plane going from level on the ground to the x degree inital climb attitude. It's pretty drastic especially on longer aircraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for writing this. I was gritting my teeth reading all the other responses. This pilot understands the question. I've noticed it during flights too. It's like your head remains level and can see the plane's change in angle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an airline pilot too so I have to nonrev in the back a lot. I prefer window seats, but I take what I can get. So whenever I'm stuck aisle or middle and don't have the window to look out it's the only thing I notice.</p>
<p>Also jumping into jets it really amazed me realizing how high the nose is on approach. Straight and level with flaps out is actually a pretty high angle of attack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to fly a 19 seat turboprop which has no cockpit door so every seat could see forward and see outside a bit. I had a good amount of pax that would come up to me after the flight who said it was really uncomfortable for them to only see blue out the front and feel the wheels touch down. From 9 rows back it looked very steep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It feels kind of wrong at first since we almost never do it, but it is weirdly liberating. Gives you an appreciation of the size of the plane opposed to being just confined to a tiny room. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Granted I fly a 152 and get a tiny seat in an extra tiny room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously, have the rest of these posters ever been on a plane? You can feel the slope walking up and down the plane. I thought I was going crazy for a second. Do they think the plane just hovers up into the air? </p></div>		</li>
