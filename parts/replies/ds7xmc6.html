			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Why do we need sleep?&quot; is a different but related question to &quot;Why hasn't sleep evolved away?</p>
<p>Being unconscious for several hours a day would seem to be a big risk, so while we know that there are lots of beneficial things that happen while we're sleeping, and more are discovered every day, evolutionary biologists are often curious as to why some of these things haven't evolved to happen during waking hours. </p></div>		</li>
