But colder temps are mostly fair game, things just work slower, and we don't know of things that deal with it because it never gets that cold on earth so nothing evolved to live in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plasma isn't homogenous, it could have an organization within it similar to molecules and atoms in low-temperature space. Like magnetic clusters of different densities and flow rates, acting as &quot;pieces&quot; to form new wholes. It'd just be so different from what we know it'd be hard to recognize, but I don't think it's impossible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could get really crazy and say that any stable structure is compatible with life.  There is a sci-fi book out there called Dragon's Egg (as other posters have mentioned) about life on a neutron star.  The structures formed use the strong force (rather than chemical bonds based on the electromagnetic force) for stable structure.  It's interesting to ponder...</p></div>		</li>
