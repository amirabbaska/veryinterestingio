<p>Cooking pasta is essentially hydrating dried pasta. You can &quot;cook&quot; pasta in room temperature water, it just takes very long.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not totally correct. Hydration is one factor, but the main process that constitutes 'cooking' the pasta is gelatinisation of the starch in the wheat flour.</p>
<p>Gelatinisation is the hydration and bursting of the starch granules; breaking them down and separating out the carbohydrate chains into a structure that is plasticised by the water. This changes the texture, but also makes it much more digestable.</p>
<p>Different starches have different gelatinisation temperatures, but for wheat starch it's about 75 degrees Celsius. This is why you can't cook pasta in cold water; you can only hydrate it.</p>
<p>Source: a big part of my job is to know about cooking starch.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The last part is actually the most important reason why we are cooking food in the first places. Your body cannot digest the starch without cooking it which is why raw potatoes are indigestible for humans. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yes, gelatinisation is greatly facilitated also by high pressures. 1kbar water -&gt; &quot;instant&quot; gelatinization. OTOH, pasta usually has protein (from both eggs and flour), and it tastes better when that protein is denatured. You don't need boiling water for that, though, going just a bit over 40C is enough for the egg protein. Wheat needs 60C+ at room pressures, but from my informal goofing around it seems to taste just as good if you &quot;cook&quot; it at 40C somewhere between 1-2kbar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're welcome! The same process is occurring when you cook rice, and when you use flour (cornflour, or regular wheat flour) to thicken a sauce.</p>
<p>In all cases, a good visual indicator that the starch has been gelatinised is that the pasta/rice/sauce turns from being relatively opaque and matte to being slightly translucent and glossy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This one I can't say for sure, but it might be that the increase in absorption rate increases exponentially with temperature </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Diffusivity actually scales linearly with absolute temperature. The biggest difference is due to better heat transfer in boiling water than in hot, stagnant water due to convection. The ELI5 version of that is just like wind on a cold day makes you colder than no wind at the same temperature, violently boiling water makes pasta hotter than water that is just reaching 100 C but not boiling</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you cook pasta on low power cooking top, then sometimes what happens is that when you add the pasta the water cools down and it stops boiling for a long time. This kinda screws up the timing of the pasta and you need longer time to get it cooked. I havd heard an instruction that in such case you should keep stirring the water as this will provide the convection instead of boiling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Boiling moves more water past the noodles... this does increase heat transfer, but this is not a huge issue... the pasta very quickly reaches the temperature of the surrounding water due to it's high surface area... </p>
<p>Water can absorb a ton of energy between 99 and 101 degrees (c)... The relation of energy input to temperature is pretty linear right up to the point of phase change (boiling) but right at 99.9999 degrees the water will absorb a LOT of energy before changing states and boiling off. </p>
<p>My guess is this extra energy in the boiling-point water results in faster cooking, not the turbidity of the pot. I could be wrong... somebody should science this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water does boil at 100 degrees, not 99.999 or whatever.  Water at 100 degrees has the same thermodynamic temperature as steam at 100 degrees.  The extra energy consumed by the phase change goes into breaking hydrogen bonds in the water and does not increase the rate of heat transfer; only energy that increases the temperature results in an increase in the heat transfer rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Better yet, if you combine multiple liquids with different boiling points and start heating them with, say, a heating mantle set to 500°C, the mixture will not heat beyond the lowest boiling point, until that liquid has evaporated completely!* (with exceptions for azeotropes, which is where multiple liquids evaporate at the same temperature, despite of having a different boiling point)</p>
<p>*this is only the basics behind it; what a 5-year-old would understand. Actual boiling points of mixtures are a bit more complicated. For example, a water-ethanol solution can have a different boiling points depending on their ratios within the mixture. Some redditors may even start boiling as soon as you make an intellectual mistake to the best of your knowledge! amazing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you're dealing with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azeotrope" target="_blank">azeotrope</a>, which might be more common than you think.</p>
<p>EDIT: </p>
<p>In an azeotropic system there exists a ratio of the components at which the vapour composition will be the same as the liquid composition, so boiling it will not change the composition. If you start with a different composition than this perfectly balanced ratio, the composition of the vapour won't be the same as the solution so the ratio will change until you either reach the balanced ratio, or run out of solution.</p>
<p>There is an equivalent phenomena at the freezing point, called eutectic freezing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  Once water reaches the boiling point, you need to add the latent heat of vaporization (around 2260 kJ/kg for water) to convert it to steam, so the temperature will stop rising until it is converted to steam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure it was. I'm betting that I just missed it somehow.</p>
<p>Chemistry was covered at a very high level in middle school (7th grade, I was 12 I think... late birthday). We got deeper in to it as a required course in high school. You could take it in 9th-12th as long as you took it, but it was also a prereq for more advanced things like Physics. I only took the required course for chemistry. I took it in 9th grade. I was more interested in physics and math (I eventually got my BS in Comp Sci).</p>
<p>I very much remember learning states of matter, electron properties, ions, bonds and all that. Experiments with liquid nitrogen, accelerants and winning the bet of whether super glue or teflon wins.</p>
<p>I'm sure the boiling thing was covered but I either just forgot, wasn't paying attention or was absent. </p>
<p>It's not really a multiple day topic. Plus, I was a pretty unmotivated student since I knew what my profession was going to be when I was 11 and it wasn't chemistry. Plus I'm 31 now, so it's possible it went in and fell out sometime in the last 15 or so years. Plus I have a legit memory loss issue from a severe brain injury haha.</p>
<p>Our science ed was pretty good. Chemistry was one of the weaker ones... It was the chem teachers last year and everyone knew it so it got a little lax. </p>
<p>I knew it once I stopped to put A =&gt; B and B =&gt; C therefore A =&gt; C together... It's just one of those things that I never stopped to think about until I saw the phrase &quot;it doesn't get hotter&quot;.</p>
<p>Same as how I remember igneous and metamorphic rocks but I haven't thought about them in so long it'd take a kick for me to remember even basic things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure he or she was told that.  There's a big difference between being told what is going on and understanding what is going on. Knowledge and comprehension are different things, and knowledge without comprehension is going to be dismissed because you don't have any basis for relating it to what you already know.</p>
<p>There's a leap of thought between &quot;water boils at 100 C&quot; and &quot;water won't stay liquid at 100 C&quot;.  It's like the difference between &quot; a logarithm is an exponent&quot; and &quot;a logarithm is the number of whole number digits you need to represent the number in that base&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
