<p>For me medium helicopters would be like the UH-60 Blackhawk or a bit smaller to the S-76d.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So more like an s-92 or aw-101 size? I thought the Blackhawk was bigger than the Huey as well though I don't know numbers off the top of my head. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True I forgot about those though they haven't been produced in 30 years so I'm not sure if I'd say modern design but I'm sure many still fly so I could see the arguement, the new design of the 212 would be the 412 which has a 4 blade rotor</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's examples of all blade configurations in every class! The light, medium and heavy classes are divided (generally) by their max gross weight. I don't know the specific class MGW numbers off hand but can give examples. </p>
<p>Light:
Bell 206 - 2 blades
AS350 - 3 blades
MD500 - 5 blades</p>
<p>Medium:
Bell 204/205/212 - 2 blades
Bell 412 - 4 blades
S76 - 4 blades</p>
<p>Heavy:
Bell 214 - 2 blades
S64 Skycrane - 6 blades
MIL Mi26 - 8 blades</p>
<p>There's a few other bizarre examples such as tandem rotor systems (Chinooks) intermeshing (KMAX) and coaxial (KA32)</p>
<p>Seeing as you're a forest fire fighter my best guess would be you're around a lot of Bell 204's and 205's, very common mediums in forestry and very badass machines!</p>

<p>Bell 214 is a medium helicopter not a heavy, it's basically a civilian version of the Huey.   You can add the CH-53 to this list, it's a 7 blade heavy lift machine (cousin of the Skycrane).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm, 214's in my area always radio in as heavies. But yes, they are a Huey variant with almost 3x the power with the 204/205 being the direct civilian equivalent. </p>
<p>Sounds like you got to work with come pretty cool machines from some of your other responses in here!</p></div>		</li>
