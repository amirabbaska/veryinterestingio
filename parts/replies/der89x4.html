			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the same issue, which apparently is common.  Shower heads don't bother me, but certain patterns of holes in varying lay-outs will make my skin crawl.  Just typing this makes me squirmish.  And the holes don't scare me; they just make me really, really uncomfortable.  </p>
<p>The same also goes for certain things fizzing.  A soda fizzing?  That's fine.  But things that shouldn't fizz can bug the hell out of me.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instinct, conditioning and anxiety.  Instincts mean that we as humans know that beehives, spiderwebs and spotted mushrooms or spotted snakes are probably dangerous.    Conditioning means that these instincts are reinforced.  Movies with scary scenes having spider webs, adults telling us to not go near beehives and maybe a personal experience or two - that sort of thing.  Anxiety (for me at least), increases that fear ten-fold.  </p>
<p>And thus you have trypophobia.  </p>
<p>For some it's less detrimental, but for others it's nerve-wracking.  I believe it's comparable to the fear of heights, darkness, being alone, or being in ocean depths.  I don't have a fear of those, but there are others who do.  The mind is an enigma.</p>
<p>I wonder how many people with trypophobia (trypophobians?) have anxiety though?  Are the conditions correlated?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When i was kid the shower-heard was so high that it made it look as if it was going to fall on me. You can think of the same effect that you have when you are on the ground and looking at a very tall structure, sometimes it looks like it's falling towards you.
I was very young but it was traumatic that i still remember that fear. The shower-head was so large to. Just plain creepy.</p></div>		</li>
