			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not how I fall asleep, but I'm definitely a night owl, happier to be up until 3 than having to wake up at 7... Or even 9am. I have no idea if that's because I was on a band's late night schedule for the first year of life, but I've often wondered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Travelled a lot as kids, mum always drilled into us that travel was boring (trains, cars, planes etc) and we'd be better off sleeping and getting a surprise when we arrived somewhere new (!) so my middle brother and I learned &quot;moving vehicle sleep cue&quot; very quickly. I still have it now at 29. Fall asleep between taxiing and take off on a plane, struggle to stay awake for short train trips home etc.
My youngest brother was a banshee and screamed non stop til he was four and had his tonsils out. He never learned the response and is now an insomniac, poor kiddo. </p></div>		</li>

<p>sleep regression</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sleep regression is thought to occur when a baby who is normally sleeping well begins to wake frequently at night and/or fights/refuses naps. These regressions seem to come out of nowhere and can last indefinitely. There is thought to be a regression around 3/4 months, 9 months, and 18 months</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically when a baby starts developing sleep cycles, they have to learn how to stay asleep and/or put themselves back to sleep when they slightly rouse themselves. </p>
<p>It can also coincide with a shift in sleeping schedules as another poster said. </p>
<p>Then between 6-8 months babies apparently develop object permanence and remember that things exist even if they aren’t in view. This triggers them to realize that you aren’t there when/if they wake up in the night. Cue crying. </p>
<p>That being said, it all hasn’t been bad thus far. Our daughter is ~5.5 months old and our routine got adjusted fairly quickly. It just wasn’t a great couple of weeks for sleeping in May. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All kids are different. There is a VERY wide spectrum of ‘normal’ behavior, and a lot of it is driven by their environment.  A kid who co-sleeps will behave differently than a kid who’s always been put to bed alone. A kid who stays ago home will deal with separation differently than one that’s been in daycare from 12 weeks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This phase for your 1.5 year old is called separation anxiety. They are realizing that you are a separate being from them, and that you won't always be right there. It's a stressful time for many families as routines that may have once been smooth become highly emotional. This happens for nearly all healthy children at a few different times (late infancy, mid toddlerhood, and again in childhood).</p>
<p>It's important to take care of yourself (let yourself shower or eat or enjoy a date night) knowing that your child is <em>safe</em> with another person or in another room, even if they are <em>unhappy</em> about it. This can allow caregivers to be fully with their child when they return and connect positively. Separation anxiety is a difficult phase, but like all of them, it does pass eventually.</p>
<p>There's a great description out there for this transition that children go through separation anxiety a few times as they realize their distance from parents is growing... And eventually parents go through it too when their child grows up and moves out. They might wish their child would stay for dinner just a bit longer, but they say goodbye and are gone. </p></div>		</li>
