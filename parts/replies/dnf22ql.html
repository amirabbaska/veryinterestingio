			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of my googling (very reputable source, I know) showed that fruits <em>do</em> have comparable sugar content, with grapes being ~16% sugar by weight, and Sugarcane being about 12-16%. Stuff like apples and pears are ~10%, but berries are a lot lower. Sugarbeets are the only things that have a really significant difference, going up to 20% sugar under ideal conditions, but beets are also responsible for a lot less of the sugar market than sugarcane (20% from beets, 80% from cane).</p>
<p>Especially early on, why did we only use these two sources (especially when they needed to be imported), when stuff like grapes were easily accessible in Europe long before the sugar trade became a big deal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually I think I there was an obvious explanation in that follow-up question, sugarcane is 10% sugar by weight, but <em>the whole plant is sugarcane</em>. You're not getting sugar solely out of the fruit, which means much more &quot;sugar&quot; can be grown per plant.</p>
<p>Grapes might be 16% sugar by weight, but you don't get comparable amounts of grapes, since most of the &quot;grape plant&quot; is vine and leaves, not fruit. I guess beets are only somewhat competitive because they grow in a different climate, and have <em>significantly</em> higher sugar content than the other options.</p>
<p>*Also apparently we do get sugar out of grapes, its a source of commercial dextrose (glucose).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also grass. It’s dense (a lot of cane per hectare). You can drive along and chew the whole thing up without worrying about picking part of it and leaving the plant behind. And it will grow from nothing to harvestable in a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Again, dextrose has a higher value and is often a secondary product to food or processed (wine/must/juice/etc)'grapes. Follow the economic spinoff and it becomes clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, grape yields are much lower than cane. Especially in places like Brazil, where it's actually feasible to use cane as a source for biofuel. Very few other places in the world approach their productivity, and it's safer to have two options to sell r&amp;d crops than just one. </p>
<p>Second, grapes also make tasty, tasty wine that's more expensive than sugar and the plants take years to mature. Same with pears, apples, and many berries. Time is money, so producers will apply highest yield to their specialized crops. Sugar is definitely not the highest for non-cane/beer applications.</p>
<p>A cane or beet sprout is chucked into a cleared field in a developing country's cheap land of non-grape friendly micro-climate, grown for a season using cheap labour, and then bulk shipped for processing. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You also have to take into consideration that its far more profitable to sell apples and strawberries as food, than to process them into sugar. Nobody really eats much sugar cane.</p></div>		</li>
