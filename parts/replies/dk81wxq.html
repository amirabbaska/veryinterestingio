			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, that study considers the influence of the culture surrounding pregnancy cravings (and PMS cravings) to be a catalyst for people reporting having those cravings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have previously proposed a model that integrates findings regarding the role of contextual and psychosocial factors in craving etiology and provides a conceptual framework for the study of cravings across multiple domains, including food cravings in pregnancy (Figure ​Figure11; Hormes, 2014). The model postulates that craving results from ambivalence or a tension between approach (i.e., the desire to indulge) and avoidance (i.e., efforts to restrict consumption) tendencies toward highly palatable foods. It is assumed that most individuals – and U.S. women in particular – seek to resolve this ambivalence in favor of abstinence, thereby de facto increasing the likelihood that they will crave the avoided food due to an enhanced salience of relevant cues. The model furthermore proposes that certain culturally defined cues signal occasional permission to break restraint, resulting in episodic consumption (and, potentially, overconsumption) of craved foods. It is hypothesized that in the U.S., both the perimenstrum (“PMS”) and pregnancy act as such culturally sanctioned disinhibitors, resulting in the characteristic patterns of increased craving frequency and intensity (and, as a result, consumption) specifically at these times. In other words, contrary to previous models of craving etiology, our model does not consider the perimenstrum and pregnancy a direct cause of cravings, but instead views them as a catalyst or permissive factor, allowing women to acknowledge and give in to otherwise unacceptable desires for highly palatable foods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, because women are told they will get unusual pregnancy cravings, they're more apt to notice cravings in general.  Cravings tend to be for tasty (though often unhealthy) foods, and the culture suggests it's ok for pregnant women to indulge in such cravings.  So, there is a cycle of first abstaining (I guess to try to stay healthy), which just makes you crave the thing more.  Then you indulge or overindulge.  And the cycle repeats.</p></div>		</li>

To me, it doesn't look like the typical cravings are for overly healthy things, though obviously all kinds of cravings do arise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes me feel a little better. Currently 7 months pregnant, had no cravings at all. Doc just shrugged when I asked if that was weird or normal. Good to know that maybe I'm just not making excuses for myself. </p></div>		</li>
