			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically? Sure.  Realistically?  Not a chance.  The whistle itself would have to be made of some sort of supermaterial.  As an example, when water pressure reaches <a href="https://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=2251" target="_blank">150atm, as it would at 1 mile below the ocean, water density is increased by 1%</a>.  To make a note would require a significantly-greater compression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh.  So the way whistles work is similar to the reason that the air pressure fluctuates in a car on the highway with one window open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is - and you've actually hit on a really cool thing about sound.  Sound travels in a wave through a material by squeezing the material in front a little bit and reducing the compression behind it (the terms are compression and rarefaction). Water is compressible, just not much. But it's compressible enough, and also <em>dense enough</em> that there are molecules that can be pushed up against each other.  Gases are not dense, and so are very compressible, but there aren't enough atoms or molecules to push against each other to communicate the sound wave from one area to another.</p>
<p>Sound wave velocity is a function of two pieces of data - density and an elastic property called the bulk modulus.   Specifically, the equation for velocity of sound is c = sqrt (K/density), where K is the bulk modulus of the material.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, does that mean that there is an “ideal” substance that would allow sound waves to travel longer distances than common air? For example, you could theoretically do the two cans and a string telephone, but replace the string with a tube of said substance?</p></div>		</li>
