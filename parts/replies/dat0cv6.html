			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a scene from some kids movie I had back then, I used to wonder why they made it so obvious that in this pile of fruits/melons/whatever it was, one of the items are going to move in this scene because all but one are painted well. I had pretty much figured out the issue by then that something animated takes lots of frames and would be very time consuming to do as well as the still background shot, but why not just make all the fruit in that pile be painted as &quot;badly&quot; as the one that was going to get animated? Then it wouldn't have been as obvious. :/</p></div>		</li>
