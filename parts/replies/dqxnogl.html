Youll'risk developing a vitamin B12 deficiency, which can be very difficul to correctly diagnose (it can be mistaken with some forms of anemia) and can have rather serious consequences if untreated, including damages to the central nervous system.</p>
<p>Ask a doctor if you want help in loosing weight, there are safer options available... Ketogenic diets for example have been proven effective in reducing weight, according to some recently published studies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most important factor for weight loss is finding a diet you can stick to. Lots of people swear by one diet or another but they often don't work for other people.</p>
<p>The keto diet can work for some people. It's unclear whether it works because the person induces ketosis, as very few studies do the difficult tests needed to prove ketosis has been initiated in the trial participants. What's clear is that many starting the keto diet will immediately be cutting calorific intake. This is a major reason when many diets can work, but the keto diet may be particularly effective as many people underestimate their calorific intake from carbs/sugars which are calorie dense.</p>
<p>To sum up, its unclear whether the keto diet works because it induces ketosis, but it can definitely work for people who find it easier to maintain a calorific deficit on the keto diet than other programs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny thing is my bio proffessor was just talking about this today. Apparently the parasites really aren't parrasites at all and prevent autoimmune diseases like chrons and allergies. Still fucking nasty though, kind of hard to not view them as parasites when he showed us a picture of an asshole with pinworms right afterword...</p></div>		</li>
