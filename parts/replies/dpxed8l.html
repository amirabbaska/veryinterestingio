<p>Is this an error or does it really get that warm in the arctic? Can't imagine permafrost being all that perma if it's basically summer up there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Calling Longyearbyen arctic would be a huge understatement as well. The distance you have to travel south to reach Siberia is about to the same distance to the north pole travelling northward. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does. In july and august even the arctic turns green for a little while - to a point. The arctic summer only lasts a few weeks, but it does indeed happen. By the time you get to the taiga that stops completely. Even Antarctica gets a summertime, it's just that 'summer' is such a negligent thing in those places that it's hardly a summer at all.</p></div>		</li>
