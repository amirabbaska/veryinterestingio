<p>Why you can be both blind and dyslexic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What if you are deaf as well?</p>
<p>As it says in the link that &quot;<em>It all comes down to phonetics. For a dyslexic person, reading confusion doesn't necessarily relate to the way a word is seen (or touched), but the way the word sounds.</em>&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this question, and also what about languages where the written script is not phonetic? Hanzi can be &quot;read&quot; by people who speak Chinese and vietnamese etc in their own language, do they read the characters as phonemes or not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an intriguing question. It might illustrate a spectrum between really poor spelling skills and actual dyslexia. What I've learned from deaf people is that a portion of ASL communication is more symbolic than literal. They might spell individual words or use an official, documented gesture. Other words might be a completely figurative gesture that's not coded into the language. It may be the first letter of your name used in a gesture because you're &quot;the letter K who won't shut up&quot;, rather than K-e-v-i-n. One of several famous sign translators at an Eminem concert did this palms-up clawing gesture for some lyric like &quot;nutsack&quot; that was neither seven letters nor the words for &quot;hard-shelled tree seeds&quot;. I can't even imagine how a dyslexic would've done it.</p></div>		</li>
