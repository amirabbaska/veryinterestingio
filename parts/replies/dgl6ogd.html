			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the part that infuriates me. Once I was applying to jobs and colleges as a kid, I was told by my parents to guard that number (memorized it, so the card stayed tucked away in a safe until I moved out) and never ever give it out. </p>
<p>Unless your applying for a job. </p>
<p>Or college. </p>
<p>Or opening a bank account. </p>
<p>Or applying to rent an apartment. </p>
<p>Or going to a doctor's office. </p>
<p>For crying out loud, they asked for it when I was filling out paperwork at the veterinarian's office for my cat. FOR MY GOD DAMN CAT. Why? Left it blank and they said nothing. </p>
<p>I once, and in kid you not, had a professor in college expect me to put my full SSN on a scantron so he could post the grades on a wall without using our names. I told him there was no way in hell that was happening. He said my test might not get graded. I said I'd take it to the department head if it was an issue. This was in 2006. We had blackboard for fucks sake, but he insisted on posting our grades on a cork board in the hallway. He somehow managed to grade my tests and assign them to me without an SSN. Amazing. </p>
<p>But really, we're told that those digits are pretty much a lifeline, but we write it down damn near everywhere to apply for jobs, housing, medical care...and we just trust that the people who have access to those forms won't copy that shit down and ruin our financial lives? </p>
<p>The sad part is, when there's a massive SSN breach (not if, when, because we know our government can't secure a computer system for shit), national ID opponents will use that event to double down on not having a national ID, despite the fact that SSN's SHOULD NOT FUCKING BE USED AS A FORM OF ID. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My stepmom had her identity stolen when a woman with the same name as her stayed at the same hospital at the same time, and when they called her about her bills they said &quot;Are the last four digits of your SSN [last four of my stepmom's]?&quot; She wrote that number down, figured out the rest, and completely fucked over my stepmom's finances and credit score, plus cost her a shit ton of legal fees as she sued the hospital for fucking her over. </p>
<p>SSNs are bullshit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I just exclude it from most forms. </p>
<p>When I apply for a job, they really don't need it until they run a background check or hire you. So it's not on any applications, just in the HR system of places I've actually worked. </p>
<p>College, yes they need it for FAFSA and stuff so yeah I suppose they have it.</p>
<p>Banks obviously need it.</p>
<p>Apartments, I've excluded it and they never seem to have a problem with it. Some of the more corporate places require it to run a credit check, but if you bring in your credit report they will waive it.</p>
<p>Same for doctors, I give my insurance cards and ID, but I don't hand over my SSN.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it seemed a bit strange how everyone talks about how you must keep it confidential at all costs....unless one of these 150,000 different people ask for it.</p>
<p>In Australia, our Tax File Number is only used for financial transactions between a person and the Government. It's pretty limited in who can ask for it.</p>
<p>There are only a few people and places that can ask for your TFN:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ATO</li>
<li>Centrelink</li>
<li>your bank</li>
<li>your employer after you start a job</li>
<li>your super fund</li>
<li>your registered tax agent.</li>
</ul>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, we just end up with having to make up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_point_check" target="_blank">100 points of ID</a>. Which isn't too bad, I suppose... with physical evidence required it's a bit harder for people to fake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for that explanation. I had never understood why people (US citizens) freak out so much about their SSN and I also never understood why they never got around to use national IDs. It would solves the abuse, identity fraud, identity theft. I would also solve the unsubstantiated fear of voter fraud. </p>
<p>It still amazes me that in the US, you don't have to show a piece of identification to vote (correct me if I am wrong) or if you do you can use a wide range of &quot;identification&quot; such as a college ID, a driver license, a gun license. Here in Belgium, you are legally required to carry you ID at all time with you. This is the only document that can attest of who you are and the only document (a passport you also be fine I think), that you can use to vote. By the way, the entire population eligible to vote is <strong>automatically</strong> registered to vote. You dont need to think about it, just show up on voting day and vote.
That is a huge turnout boost (beside Belgian mandatory voting law). </p>
<p>Last thing, we also have a unique identification number called &quot;national register number&quot;, but I don't think it contains a lot of information apart from the normal info on an ID such as name, date of birth, birth place etc. We also have a social security number, which is used, well... for social security purposes and only for that. </p>
<p>I am not bragging about the system we have, or bashing the , but I do think this should be a central point of debate in the US and could possible solve some important problem. </p>
<p>Edit: added last paragraph because I posted to fast</p></div>		</li>

<p>This. I've always advocated for standardizing our ID system so we could use it for more things. It's kinda absurd we're fighting about voter ID and how its discriminatory when other countries use it just fine.</p>
<p>If most people looked into the Voter ID issue the result wouldn't be that IDs are discriminatory but rather the ID system in the US is broken and we should give everyone an ID and push towards a national system.</p></div>		</li>
