<p>Despite being staged in California and Florida, it's a very dark film, where no one is what he seems to be and everything seems to go wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Mulholland Drive</em> is noir-influenced, in that the two protagonists adopt noirish roles and are thwarted by the corrupt &quot;system&quot;*, but it's really not noir. It's Lynch. That's it's own genre, or should be.  </p>
<p>If you mean Mulholland <em>Falls</em>, yeah I'd call it noir. I don't remember it too well though. </p>
<p>*Kind of? But in reality, no. Trying to avoid spoilers I didn't figure out myself until I'd watched it three times. Fucked up movie. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say the protagonists are &quot;corrupt&quot;, but rather they are morally grey, social outcasts with a cynical view. They have a unique posting in society, and the cynical view on the world has grown from them knowing the truth of how the system really works.</p>
<p>They're usually affiliated with law enforcement, but not officially part of it- such as Private Eyes and the likes - though they will often bend the law themselves and use their status of being social outcasts to move around all socialetal circles, be it; the ciminal underworld, Upper echelons or even just the common folk. No side completely rejects them or accepts them, which gives them a fair deal of room to manoeuvre in the world. This coupled with their intelligence and cunning means they are able to talk their way into areas most other law enforcement or criminals couldn't do, often skirting the law in the process themselves.</p>
<p>For the time; drinking, smoking and other vices of the protagonist were seen as amoral- like you said, it corrupts them - but when compared with the rest if the world, which is initially presented as being Black &amp; White morally, these vices just show that the protagonist is human as they will go into  reveal the true underbelly of society through a cynical lens and exposes the much darker truths lurk below. The Protagonist's vices stem from them rejecting the values of the world - they quit the police force because of the corruption/ were driven out for not conforming. That's why they're alone, they refuse to conform with the corrupt system. They drink to forgot the horrors they've seen. They smoke to release stress of knowing about what really goes on behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The Femme Fatale mirrors the protagonist in this regard. They  reject society's expectation of what a women is, and how they should act; they smoke, they drink , they wear revealing clothing and they don't submit to men fully - rather, they use these traits to find common ground with the Protagonist, and will manipulate by seducing them, or else with their cunning to then use them for their end.</p>
<p>The cinematography supports this too, which you touched on briefly but I feel it needs elaboration since it is such a huge, iconic element of the genre. The Chiascuro lighting style which contrasts high key lighting to dark shadows visually shows the morality of the film - the world is presented as black &amp; White, light vs dark - with the Protagonist right in the middle, only being lit from one side, showing that they're morally grey and are scrambling in the dark to uncover the  truth.</p>
<p>This applies to the Femme Fatale too. When first introduced, they're usually entirely back-lit with just their outline showing, blocking the light source. For the protagonist, the Femme Fatale is an enigma at first, an unknown quantity and they're now aware of them, but do not yet know who they are or what their motives are. The Femme Fatale is covering the truth - like how they block the light. The Protagonist is in the dark with the Femme Fatale, like how they're just are a shadow visually, that is distracting from and actively obscuring the truth behind them.</p>
<p>This is just my interpretation, but I see the Protagonist as rejecting the system and trying to fight it - their own vices showing their human side, that they are struggling to stop the rampant corruption of the world. Meanwhile, the Femme Fatale wants to keep the status quo, seeing as they are often part of the sinister plot in Noir Films, and are trying to distract/ corrupt the Protagonist from revealing and exposing the the truth.</p>
<p>Neo-noir continues these trends, but updates then for the modern audience. Gone is the Black &amp; White, but the Chiascuro lighting stays - like with Denis Villeneuve's Sicario, or Ridley Scott's BladeRunner. In fact, the inclusion of colour can further some of moral devides in the narrative - such as the opulent gold yellows of the Tyrell Tower, showing the extreme wealth that contrasts to the blues and greys of the city below that reflects the extreme poverty. </p>
<p>The narrative core of Neo-noir stays the same of a Society in Crisis, but it is the themes of the crisis that have changed. Neo-noir has moved on from Modern Themes of a <em>moral</em> crisis in society (usually some form of greed/lust/ corruption in traditional Noir) to Post-Modern themes such as Blade Runner's existential themes that challenge societal norms, superficially, of what is to be human and on deeper level the class devides in society and the dehumanising of groups to be exploited. Or alternatively the post-modern themes of  <em>'Drive'</em> which challenges society's view on what a protagonist/hero is - which I won't spoil because it's an excellent film</p>
<p>Apologies if any of this is a little incoherent and for any rambling paragraphs, it's late where I am and I'm half asleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think Neo Noir has updated the moral crisis.   You are right that Bladerunner is an existential crisis, but I think it includes a moral crisis as well.   In this case the Replicants are egregiously enslaved.  They may not have minds exactly like humans, but they have enough self awareness, thought and emotion to be conscious subjects instead of ownable objects.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think sometimes the protagonist can even start out optimistic , maybe na√Øve in someway and then in the course of the film or maybe in a twist at the end become disillusioned. </p>
<p>Like the central theme of the film might centered around breaking down these individuals ideas and beliefs. The character may even be unwilling (consciously or unconsciously to address those issues till their forced to do so through the events that transpired during the course of the film. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A feature of the noir and hard-boiled detective fiction, and perhaps not so much movies (I'm much more familiar with radio and novels of the genre) is actually that the heroes are social outcasts because they <strong>do</strong> have strong morals. It's the world itself that is too grey, and it's their conviction and unwillingness to bend that gets them into trouble. They are often private eyes because they left the official police force due to politics and corruption and decided the only way to have morals is to work for themselves. They are also depressed and beaten down (and so turn to drink and other vices) because their morality turns them cynical and they can't fit. This was a core concept of stuff like Chandler's Philip Marlowe, which is archetypal for the genre.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was trying to get at that but couldn't articulate it as concisely as you have! </p>
<p>That seems to be the trend with Noir protagonists, it really makes them the only grounded characters in the narrative who you can trust, which is fitting as they are ones investigating the crime. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great summary of the femme fatale here. Wrote a thesis once that Hollywood portrayed powerful women as ne'er do wells who used their feminine guiles to hold power over men. This produced a more submissive female in the general population because powerful women were bad women in the eyes of the viewers. Prof didn't get it, but gave me a B anyway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add a simple explanation I stole from somewhere which I think fits noir very well: <strong>every noir plot sees the protagonist entering a downwards spiral</strong>. </p>
<p>It does not necessarily mean that they will die, or become unredeemable, or fail in the end (that would be the requirements of <strong>tragedy</strong>, which basically makes the hero inevitably fail to make a point). But every turn of the story is dedicated to making the spiral tighter and steeper, with the character fighting against it or plunging deeper, or alternating between the two. There's no cavalry to arrive triumphantly and make everything right.</p>
<p>If the hero survives the descent (morally, psychologically, physically, socially etc.), he is still shown the extent of the world's failings in a more stark and shocking manner than he was prepared for. He may make good of it still and be content, especially if he/she dies. But the thrill is for the viewer to experience this &quot;revelation&quot; (a word that Apocalypse translates into, incidentally) and shudder, then sigh with relief on returning to normal life.</p>
<p>As others have noted, media can be called &quot;noir&quot; even if it just borrows the look and feel of noir films (closely connected to Expressionist cinema which came earlier): stark, dark, high-contrast, dramatic, foreboding, stylish, edgy, dystopian*. The Matrix definitely approaches noir mostly from the visual side (and connects to a ton of other sources, like anime, instead).</p>
<p>'*' yes, basically the picture of an American city the noir painted was a kind of early dystopia - reflecting real social problems like crime and corruption, but turning them into a sticky nightmare that devours everything, to spook the viewer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know. It may have taken some pages from noir book or share some of its &quot;idea genes&quot;, but it's otherwise an auteur film from the era of New Hollywood - just a film about people with its own style, like Taxi Driver or The Graduate. It's definitely not a genre movie, which noirs generally are. I guess you can classify it as drama, just as Hemingway's or Faulkner is drama.</p>
<p>I'm not saying genre is bad, but with genre you start out aiming to film an X according to formula, and then add your personal touches and inventions on top of it, careful not to break the genre machinery. Working outside genre (i. e. so called auteur cinema), you start out with an idea and a story, then bend the medium and storytelling devices to communicate that idea, maybe using some pieces and elements from different genres.</p>
<p>I strongly suspect Bad Lieutenant is the latter case, even though it may have been pitched to producers and cinemagoers as a hardboiled, hardcore crime action thriller.</p></div>		</li>
