			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems like a very informative response.  Sleep being a profitable adaptation to times of low danger or low stress thanks to the solar cycle, as opposed to the true ideal optimal individual which is alert at all times to danger or changing environmental conditions.  I would be interested to see an analysis of creatures which sleep deeply and therefore at risk, and those which only ever sleep shallowly and therefore reduce their adaptation time to a sudden threat while resting, at the cost of higher level sleep functions.  It's likely the latter do not dream, since they only reach stage 1-2 of sleep; is this a true advantage or do they miss out on possible development due to their lack of &quot;deep sleep&quot; and dreams?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting but there are a couple of problems with it.</p>
<p>The most obvious is that sleep requirement isn't correlated with learning requirement or complexity of tasks.</p>
<p>Think about a cat, for example, they sleep a great deal - mine do anyway. Much more than I do. And yet I can learn far more complex things far more quickly than they can.</p>
<p>It's also interesting that you have labelled sleep as risky. </p>
<p>Obviously being asleep in the middle of a group of wild animals would be very risky but u/tea_and_biology used the opposite argument, namely that sleep is safe. </p>
<p>The fact that various groups have such wildly conflicting ideas suggests that no particular group knows with any more certainty than any other. Of course one group might be right and the others wrong but we have no way to know which is which at the moment.</p>
<p>Fascinating, though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like with cats it can be explained as being adaptive. For a cat, they can get by on napping in the sun for hours and not doing fuckall. But in sleep, they remain highly alert to outside stimuli, like someone approaching or a bug buzzing. They need all that energy stored up so that they can be highly effective when they need to hunt, and so that when they’re not highly alert and active their body can take a second to heal. Also, I’m pulling this out of my ass so someone who knows anything probably knows that I’m full of it.</p>
<p>I think it’s probably more important to understand what form of sleep is adaptive to a particular critter, and then to find trends from there based on function of animal and function of sleep within the environment. We gotta get the data first then do some yung extrapolation from there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think its probably multi-factorial, but the points he mentioned are probably important. If sleep amount scaled up perfectly with intelligence then you would soon have an animal that requires sleep 24 hours a day, which obviously can't survive. Its possible that as sleep demands increase that we evolve ways to become more sleep efficient. I think its worth noting that most of the 'sleeping' that cats do really seems to be napping rather than deep sleeping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All good points. </p>
<p>I had realised that the purpose of sleep might have changed as evolution progressed but I hadn't considered the efficiency with which that purpose was achieved. </p>
<p>I wonder how much human sleep stacks up in terms of efficiency vs duration. </p>
<p>Also interesting about cats and depth of sleep. I suppose I only see my own cats sleeping, which is very artificial since they are well fed and safe. Not a good data element for something like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tea said that animals sleep, at least in part, to stay out of trouble.</p>
<p>To be completely honest, I looked into sleep for a long time while I was at university. I spent a lot of time in the university library and found nothing concrete about what it was for. </p>
<p>In the end I decided that one good reason for humans to sleep was that we can't see well in the dark of the night so we can't do much anyway. It makes sense for us to stay out of trouble and avoid falling down holes or wandering into the territory of dangerous animals that we couldn't see.</p>
<p>Finding a nice safe warm place to spend the night makes sense. If you can't do anything then you might as well sleep. Being awake all that time would be very dull. It makes sense to 'stop time' by sleeping.</p>
<p>Perhaps a period of enforced rest (for some long forgotten ancestor maybe) became useful for some other purpose during evolution and now we can't do without it. </p></div>		</li>
