			<div class="markdown"><p>This post needs more love.  Other posters have focused on the general problem of different parts of the Earth having different mineral makeup, but when it comes to economically important minerals, what typically matters is <strong>solubility</strong>.  For most cases, some fluid (water or magma) dissolved the stuff in question, and then moved to a location where the stuff was no longer soluble, causing the stuff to precipitate out.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why the solubility could change, as /u/horselover_fat identifies: changes in temperature, pressure, presence of other chemical species (H+ ions, oxygen), or simple evaporation.   /u/KarbonKopied singles out sodium chloride as a special unusual case, but IMO it's actually a pretty good example of the general pattern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One process I think you've missed: leaching.  Fluids (hydrothermal or otherwise) can dissolve away all the soluble species, leaving behind the insoluble ones.  Bauxite (aluminum ore) is an example.</p></div>		</li>
