			<div class="markdown"><p>Always nice to make a person smile! :) Dog just woke me up and now quite hungry and craving wings. However, restaurant with favorite wings (Snooty) isn't open for a while, plus, as a rule, I do not eat wings before noon. But, without question, I will be enjoying wings and carrots for lunch (maybe a pint for good measure).</p></div>		</li>
