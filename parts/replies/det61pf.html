			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite a few ant species live parasitically off other species. Usually, there is one &quot;host species&quot; for every slavemaker species, meaning that they will target, scout and raid that species' colonies and abduct as many eggs and/or larvae as they can. They then raise them as their own. The slaves take on the colony odor, help to raise the slavemaker's brood and will even frequently join in additional raids.</p>
<p>Defense strategies against these raids have been shown to be vastly more effective if hosts display little resistance. The parasitic slavemaker possesses a powerful sting and once fighting starts, attackers will eradicate a host colony, leaving little behind. If there is no opposition, however, slavemakers will largely ignore host workers. The hosts will proceed to evacuate as much brood as they can and spread out to find new nests. If a good site is found, more workers are recruited (via footprints and &quot;tandem running&quot;) to bring brood to the new site. This situation can be reproduced in the lab quite well and is a lot of fun to watch :P The species that my colleagues examine are <em>Themnothorax longispinosus</em> (host) and <em>Themnothorax pilagens</em> (slavemaker, also targets <em>Temnothorax ambiguus</em>)</p>
<p>These ants are collected in the US but the analyses are performed here. For reference and interesting reading on rebellions <a href="https://www.uni-mainz.de/presse/15733_ENG_HTML.php" target="_blank">https://www.uni-mainz.de/presse/15733_ENG_HTML.php</a> Y</p>
