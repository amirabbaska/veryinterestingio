			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, by the way, I always wanted to ask, how solid solids really are on the crystal lattice level, like, if there's a missing carbon atom somewhere in the lattice, would some row just shift by one atom, and how fast?</p>
<p>I mean, what you're describing here involves carbon atoms actually swapping places with nitrogen atoms in order for the latter to precipitate on the nitrogen-only defects, how fast does that happen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not an easy question to answer as atomic diffusion rates can vary by something like 10 orders of magnitude.  Substitutional diffusion (i.e. jumping from a crystal lattice site to another crystal lattice site) is understandably slower, all other things being equal, than interstitial diffusion (an impurity atom just sitting in a gap in the lattice and jumping to another gap) for example.  Here's a page with some neat little animations if the many types of diffusion that can occur:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/def_en/kap_3/backbone/guidedtour_r3_2_1.html" target="_blank">https://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/def_en/kap_3/backbone/guidedtour_r3_2_1.html</a></p>
<p>Size of the diffusing atom relative to the lattice constant (average distance between crystal unit cells) is obviously hugely important as well.  For example, the diffusion constant for hydrogen (the smallest atom) to diffuse in iron is like 0.5 mm^2 /s, but the diffusion constant for iron to diffuse in iron is 400 mm^2 /s.  Which is a 1,000x different.</p>
<p>But to throw down a number, some quick googling says that the self-diffusion of aluminum (i.e. aluminum atoms diffusing through an aluminum crystal structure) happens at a time scale of about 0.4 millionths of a second.  Which is to say, I suppose, that an average aluminum atom may make about 2 million jumps a second.  (honestly the source isn't that clear, I'm not sure if that's per atom or unit cell or what).</p>
<p>That may seem crazy fast, but to give some context, an electron in silicon will scatter off of acoustic phonons about  a trillion times a second, so about a million times more often. </p></div>		</li>
