<p>Many jet engine turbine blades use a very unique solidification process that results in a perfect single crystal....and it is extremely strong</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of: they have to have regions of greater order, interspersed with regions of lesser order, in order to disrupt dislocation motion.</p>
<p>The main reason they need single crystals is to reduce the amount of creep deformation at high temperature: grain boundaries allow all sorts of new mechanisms for shape change (notably, Coble creep).</p>
<p>The alloys aren't as strong at room temperature as the same composition of alloy could be with finer crystal structure, but they're what is needed at the crazy high temperatures at which jet engines operate.</p></div>		</li>
