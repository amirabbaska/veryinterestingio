			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, pretty much.</p>
<p>I live in an unincorporated suburb for instance, we fall under the Sheriffs department. </p>
<p>The Sheriff's department will also be the ones that run the county jail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This varies a bit, but the Sherrif's Department is typically responsible for operating the county jail where suspects awaiting trial are taken, and convicts sentenced to 1 year or less serve their sentence. They are responsible for transporting suspects from the jail to the courts, as well as providing security for the court. In addition they are responsible for providing police services for the county. Municipal Police forces are typically created, because residents of the city want faster police response times than the Sherrif's Department, who is responsible for the entire county can provide. How jurisdiction works varies by State. In some States, the Sherrif's Department continues to maintain jurisdiction over the city, but is unlikely to send their deputies there, because there's already a Police Department. In some State's, the Sheriff's Department does not have jurisdiction if a municipality creates a Police Department. In atleast one State(Virginia), municipalities are their own entity all together, and are not inside of a county.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The city next to mine actually doesn’t have its own police, they pay the sherif to be their police. The sherif also handles certain things in the county regardless of where it is. So the sheriff is an officer of the court so they handle evictions, processes and arrest warrants issued by the court regardless of where the person or property is. </p>
<p>One thing not mentioned is some places the highway patrol is the only state police force, and in some places the state police is the high way patrol, some states have both, they don’t really mean a specific thing everywhere and again they do certain thing within the state regardless of jurisdiction like the sherif does within the county, state police do certain things within the state that only they do regardless of where a person or piece of property is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is intriguing for an Australian.</p>
<p>Here Melbourne is a large city and Chiltern a tiny rural town, both in the state of Victoria.</p>
<p>If you beat someone up in either Melbourne or Chiltern, it's Victoria Police that will arrest you.</p>
<p>If you have an unpaid fine in either Melbourne or Chiltern, it's the Sheriffs that will impound your car until you pay them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an Australian I find the whole US emergency service system interesting. </p>
<p>The US has local independent city police forces, The Sheriffs Dept, State Police &amp; Highway Patrol. Their roles and jurisdictions seems to overlap a lot. It has independent city and county Fire Departments. Many of these Fire Departments also run the Ambulance Service. Some places the Ambulance service is completely delivered by private companies. In some counties the Sheriffs Dept runs the Fire Department, who runs the Ambulance.</p>
<p>And that’s just the State and local level. There are too many Federal agencies to count. Jurisdiction must be a nightmare.</p>
<p>In Australia it’s all done on the state level. I’ll use New South Wales as an example. We have the NSW Police, NSW Ambulance and NSW Fire &amp; Rescue. Then there is the Australian Federal Police. Clean and simple.</p>
<p>The US system seems so much more expensive. With everything being so divided and independent you need individual budgets for training, equipment, recruitment, personnel, just everything. The biggest benefit I can see is if I was to get a job in the LAPD, I would be stationed somewhere in LA. I couldn’t be posted in San Francisco. That’s a downside of having a State wide system, you can be posted anywhere.</p>
<p>(For reference, NSW is out 5th largest State. And it’s bigger than Texas.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Licenses for police officers are statewide, so anyone in any of those departments could do any of those jobs. All that great extra divisions really do is formalize rolls that would already be divisions of a larger state agency. So, you'd still have the cops who only work in Kansas city and those who only worked freeways in Kansas, even if you had only a state department. Breaking them up also has some advantages. There are a lot of pluses to having departments that are 50-100 people instead of 2000. You can have more direct management and better communication and accountability. There's really no where near the toe stepping or jurisdictional fights one might think. Roles are actually well defined and everyone sticks to their own business. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's much simpler here. </p>
<p>We do have a mess of a fire system here (Victoria), with the metro-oriented professional MFB, and the rural-oriented 3/4 volunteer CFA (with the CFA having jurisdicition over places that were rural in 1920 but are absolutely part of Melbourne today, like Carrum Downs or Langwarrin).</p>
<p>But otherwise it's pretty simple, except for the demarcation between the SES and the two fire services. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.... and no.  As a police officer, you are a sworn peace officer of the state.  Although your area you patrol is a city, you technically have jurisdiction in the entire state.  You just won't find a LA cop writing a ticket in San Diego because if it goes to court, the cop must show and ain't nobody got time for all that.</p></div>		</li>
