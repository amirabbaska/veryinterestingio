			<div class="markdown"><p>Shopping for clothes has become a chore for me. I'm 6 feet tall and 140 pounds. Shirts are pretty easy to find but when it comes to shorts and pants it's a pain in the ass. I'll find a style I like and ask for the smallest size they have and it's almost always still too big around the waist. I found one store in my hometown that sells a bunch of stuff I like and coincidentally I wear the same size as their mannequins so it makes it easier. I almost need a tailor on speed dial just to have fitting clothes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think fitted clothes tend to use measurements whilst elasticated clothes (shorts, track pants, t-shirts, hoodies, etc) have always had simpler sizing because it's less critical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the women know what size they are in YOUR measuring system! </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I'm a size 8 at Gap? Fuck those people, I'm going over to [blank] where I'm a size 6!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But ma'am, our 8 is the same, I can even prove it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not an 8, I'm a 6!&quot;</p>
<p>I'm guessing this is also why men's XXL are sometimes sold as XL depending on the store? I've known some pretty tall guys who would buy XL's at one store and look like they just stole a kid's shirt, and XL at another that fit fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what kills me. I've been a 36x32 since high school. Have multiple 36x32 pants that fit great. Bought new pants recently. Brooks Brothers? 38x32. Eddie Bauer? 34x32. It's like everyone uses a different measuring tape or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It varies within the same brand, and even styles.</p>
<p>I have two pair of Levi 505s, one 30x32 the other 32x32 and they fit virtually the same only difference is one is dark blue the other black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a size 14 in target shorts. A 6 to an 8 in Lucky Brand jeans, an 8 to a 10 in J crew, and a size 6 in a pair of rag and bone shorts I bought on sale for $5. I am short but not fat. I just have big hips and a big bust but God help me if I can even find a decent pair of jeans that doesn't assume I'm either fat (so it's cut like I should have extra fluff in the legs) or like a 6ft tall Amazon who can somehow fit into a size 8... It's infuriating</p></div>		</li>
