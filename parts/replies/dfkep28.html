			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, quick question, but as a viewer, does skipping over the ads at the beginning of the video have any effect over anything? Like if I watch all the way through, does it count more toward anything as opposed to just skipping it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not 100% on this, so hopefully someone else can help verify, but I'm pretty sure when the ad is skipped it does not count as a &quot;monetizable view&quot;.  You still get something for the text ads, but if you skip it the instant you can I don't think that YouTuber got anything for the pre-roll.  I can ask my Edutuber slack friends about that one though.</p>
<p>Edit: don't worry too much about those skips either way though, as the YouTuber would have only gotten 1/4 of a penny for your view anyways.  If you actually want to help out a YouTuber you like, especially if they are a smaller one, give them a one time donation or Patreon pledge.  If they sell merch and you like it, buy a shirt.  Direct pledges and purchases are infinitely more important than a skipped ad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I forget which podcast I was listening to, I think it was one of Grays podcasts Cortex but if that's wrong someone will correct me. From what I remember they said that the skipable ads get nothing when immediately skipped, but fraction of pennies increases the longer you watch before skipping</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard/read somewhere that if you skip as soon as you can, your view isn't monetisable, but your view stops &quot;increasing in value&quot; after watching 30 seconds of an ad. That's why the longest unskippable ads on youtube are 30s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For example, MatPat from Game Theory says &quot;Sign up for an Audible subsciption and get a free book (or whatever it is). I read <strong>__</strong> (book relating to episode) and I loved it! So if you liked this episode, check out <strong>__</strong>!&quot;</p>
<p>For example, if you get an Audible ad, do you recommend a book? If so, do you read the book? </p>
<p>Also, who comes up with the promo code names? Is it you or the ad company?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't have to recommend a book for your ad slot. However they recommend that you do it if you use the service, because it makes it feel like a bit less of an ad and more like something relevant. </p>
<p>Source: listening to youtubers talk about their ad slots. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't personally gotten an ad from Audible, but I'm pretty sure the YouTuber gets to pick the book, but the company usually does the promo codes.  Some companies have teased YouTubers with silly or jocular promo codes, though I imagine that will just depend on the company's corporate structure.</p>
<p>If I recommended a book, I would read it.  I think most YouTubers who recommend books very audible promos read them.  Some deceptive ones might not if they aren't big readers.</p></div>		</li>
