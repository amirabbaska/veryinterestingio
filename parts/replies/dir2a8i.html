			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my favorite explanation simply because ut dies point out that what we consider races are no more than some superficial traits that are passed down while also making it clear that just because two people look similar doesn't mean they are closely related genetically</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You chose African people to use as the example that one could be more related to a Mongolian than a fellow African, but isn't it only true in the case of Africans? (because they are the mother race) A random Swede will be more closely related to another random Swede than to a random Mongolian.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every member of a clade is more closely related to everyone else within that clade than any of them are to anyone outside of the clade. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You said so yourself here.</p>
<p>It sounds like everyone who claims races are real are right, and everyone in here who says they aren't real are making up a new word so that they can say races aren't real but this totally (not) different concept is real. Claiming races aren't real and clades are is just word games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to understand that race is a biologic term. You can't just define race with your own subjective (e. g. phenotypal) standards. </p>
<p>A scientifically accurate way to acknowledge that people of different world regions have characteristic looks that make them optically distinct from each other would be using the word &quot;ethnicity&quot; instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that. I'm a professional biologist with a PhD working in medical genetics. I am not attempting to make any definitions of my own; I'm commenting on how the words describing human races are commonly used in everyday conversations, because that is how discussions about race are held.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see. I think it would help people to understand that there are no actual &quot;races&quot; if we'd phrase things in a different way. In German, we usually talk about ehtnicity and saying &quot;race&quot; instead would be seen as very weird. But I understand this would be a societal change on a larger scale and you're trying to account for visible differences in people.</p></div>		</li>
