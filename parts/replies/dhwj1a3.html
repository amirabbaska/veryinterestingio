<p>I pulled you, but 99% of the time I'll get a &quot;it can't be expired&quot; or &quot;there is no way it has been expired that long&quot;. If they've already dug out the registration is can literally point to it and end that line of argument.</p>

<p>I got pulled over in another state with my girlfriend's car and the cop said the registration was showing up as expired. She had forgotten to put the registration in the glove box so we couldn't take it out and prove it but the sticker wasn't out of date. </p>
<p>I still can't tell if he was just writing a ticket because I was out of state and it was the end of the month or his system actually showed it was expired. When she went to the BMV in our state they said he was full of shit.</p>
<p>Long story short, have your registration on you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was under the impression that officers are only able to check the registration status of vehicles in their own state, they don't have access to EVERY states database to verify. If that's right and you didn't put the new sticker on, they'd have no way to know your registration was current other than to pull you over and see your paperwork.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The new sticker was on, the paperwork was left at the house. He said &quot;sometimes the BMV sends out bad registrations&quot;. Even though they don't send it until you pay, so it just didn't make sense.</p>
<p>Also there are ways for them to check registrations between states. I've heard from another cop that sometimes they can get a bit weird or sometimes return bad information because they're all slightly different systems, but they can definitely check.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes you are legally required to have your registration in your car. Also take a picture of it and I put my important documents in a certain Google Drive folder. That way I can retrieve it when I need just in case shit goes to hell.</p>
<p>I haven't need it in a pull-over situation, but I have dropped my ID at an airport such that I had to check into a hotel with a PDF of my ID/passport.</p></div>		</li>

<p>get their registration right on the first try.</p>

<p>I can't ever do that whenever I get pulled over. It takes me forever to find the right document. And I never drive under the influence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I don't use drugs, and never drive if I've had anything to drink, but I get nervous as fuck whenever I get pulled over and always end up fumbling through my glovebox for way too long to find my registration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep it in your wallet. I keep my insurance card in mine (because we have registration stickers in my state) and never have to fumble for anything if I get pulled over. Plus, there's no tension on the cops end that you might be grabbing a gun from your glove box. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He means that drunk, high, or even really nervous people will hand you all kinds of things. I've been handed debit cards, birth certificates, mechanics receipts, etc. It's a form of a divided attention test. You ask for two things and your brain is good to think about each of them and figure it out, which a drunk or high person struggles with. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where were you a cop? Back in the day the old NY licenses were super easy to fake, I had many cops check my fake when I was 18 and let me drink. But that was 06 before these hologram IDs became prevalent, so I doubt you could fake one now well enough for a cop to miss it.
(Keep in mind my fake only worked on cops that were patrolling bar areas or places with alcohol. I never tried to pass it off as a vehicle license as that would never work.)</p>
<p>The even older licenses like the NJ ones from the 80s were about as advanced as the current registration cards. Didn't even have a picture. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my friends from Illinois was in the east coast and got his ID checked by a cop. The cop did the bend test and snapped his ID in half, he must have been new and didn't know that some states have very brittle IDs.</p>
<p>It was funny as hell, though and he apologized profusely while we were all laughing hysterically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, that's what made the NY easy to fake; it was meant to be super bendy and flexible, if you could bend the I'd in half and not have it snap it was real, but easy to fake. I don't know if those IDs would still fly though, because anyone under 21 should not have it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Off topic, but do you find your job fulfilling? Do you enjoy it? What was required of you to become an officer? What type of person handles the rigors of the job better than others? A response would be much appreciated, as I've been heavily considering a career in law enforcement. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
