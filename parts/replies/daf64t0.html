			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to further point out that a very large amount of the human population has, up until very recently, been getting married (and procreating) with people based on social factors that have NOTHING to do with physical desirability and EVERYTHING to do with wealth and status. Not to say that they were not <em>also</em> procreating with <em>other</em> people based on appearances (in some cultures, a man having a mistress wasn't even taboo), but it still plays a huge role in our selection process.</p>
<p>Edit: also, while boob size can be significant for the <em>selection</em> process, large boobs don't actually equate to more/better milk production. It's one of those things that we select for that doesn't actually have a bearing on survivability of the children involved, which may actually help explain for the variance (since a woman with smaller boobs is just as likely to have lots of children that survive to have kids of their own as a woman with larger boobs). Kinda reminds me of the elk that died out because the female elk were constantly picking the males with the biggest antlers until the male's antlers were so huge their necks couldn't support the weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd think their musculature would evolve to help with that.</p>
<p>Edit: I would think that within that species there would be a few individuals with stronger than normal musculature whose genetics continued to circulate in that species' genetic pool. Kind of like our Lou Ferrigno. Random mutations wouldn't be required. The Lou Ferrigno offspring would be selected for through natural selection and the dumbass big antler rooster deer would be selected for through sexual selection. The combination of those two genes would happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution doesn't have a goal, it's just the process. Unfortunately, what a species, or even an individual of a species, finds &quot;attractive&quot; in a mate doesn't have to correlate to what is &quot;beneficial&quot; for the species as a whole. The females weren't selecting for neck strength, just antler size. In any population of living things there will be mutations that range from &quot;doesn't really do anything&quot; to &quot;this kills the individual/prevents individual from even developing&quot;. Somewhere in-between you get mutations that aren't immediately detrimental to procreation (meaning that individuals with the mutation can at least survive long enough to procreate once and said mutation doesn't make mating less likely). Sometimes, this mutation ends up being highly beneficial and gradually other systems evolve to support it (since individuals with mutations to support the beneficial mutation may live longer/reproduce more frequently/be more desireable for mating). This isn't a guarantee though, because mutations are pretty random. The mutation for stronger neck muscles to support the large antlers clearly wasn't able to keep up with the antler size, or it wasn't desirable to the deer, or the mutation caused other problems that made them less likely to procreate/survive to procreation.</p>
<p>Also remember that for animals that have antlers, there is a tendency that year after year, the male's antlers will get bigger (while the female's tend to stay the same size after puberty). This meant that the males with these &quot;huge antler genes&quot; probably got quite a few years of mating in before the antlers started being problematic. Over time, the amount of years the elk had before the antlers were just too big got shorter and shorter, until there weren't enough fertile males (young enough to have antlers small enough to survive) to keep the population going. The elk bred themselves to extinction.</p>
<p>It's a good example at how evolution isn't &quot;designing&quot; species for anything. It doesn't make species &quot;stronger&quot;, just more &quot;fit&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Studies have shown that women with a larger breast to waist ratio are significantly more fertile than those with less drastic ratios. Also, large ratio is a direct result of estrogen. So more estrogen, higher fertility. </p>
<p>So there is an evolutionary reason, it's a very strong indicator that the woman will be fertile. But yes, you're right milk production doesn't vary much if at all with breast size. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what <em>part</em> of fertility is it increasing? Do these women produce more eggs? Are they more likely to mate/attract a mate? More likely to bear a child to term (not have stillbirth)? More likely to get pregnant period (separate issue than just producing more eggs)? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So more estrogen, higher fertility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not really, no. Having higher estrogen doesn't automatically mean higher fertility. In fact, having too much estrogen can be very detrimental to fertility, as women with PCOS and endometriosis will point out to you. </p>
<p>Before anyone gets on my case about it: yes, some of these aren't actually &quot;fertility&quot; some of these are &quot;fecundity&quot; issues, but we're in ELI5 here and most people confuse the two. Since /u/captnmiss didn't provide a source to these &quot;studies&quot; I don't know if their studies were actually showing higher fertility or if they were indicating higher fecundity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it isn't breast to waist ration it's hip to waist ratio. You need wide hips to naturally birth healthy sized babies. Also hip to waist ratio is much more in normal ranges (as in unlikely to have a waist larger than your hips unless overweight or otherwise unhealthy in some way such as thyroid problems, also there veryfew who are naturally extreme). Most healthy people fall between the 65-75 ratio range. For women anything around or over 80 put them at high risk for heart disease and other ailmentsAlso in many cultures during certain periods a small bust was seen as desirable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was having a higher hip to waist ratio?Breast fat fluctuates easily with a woman's overall fluctuating body weight, and the hips/thighs/baby cushioning (a store for DHA fat for baby brains) increases easily but is more resistant to decreases in overall body weight fluctuation.  </p>
<p>Yea/no? </p>
<p>Is estrogen as influential with hip fat as it is breast fat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Large breasts could signal fitness in a way similar to a peacock's feathers. Yes, in a way it's a waste of resources to devote all that energy to developing an unnecessary appendage. But the fact that you <em>can</em> devote energy to that unnecessary appendage proves how fit you are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, which is why I brought up the elk example. The attractiveness of large boobs can be hereditary without the large boobs actually being beneficial. Being attracted to something doesn't mean that &quot;thing&quot; has a benefit to the species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of great information here. But none of it answers the question.</p>
<p>You've basically said &quot;it's genetics and hormones which contribute to the size of breasts&quot;. But the same thing can be said of the ears, nose, feet and other body parts. The question is <em>Why can breast size vary by a factor of 4 or 5, where every other body part is relatively the same size on every person?</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He did mention that the sexual selection for breasts is low or nonexistent. Traits that aren't detrimental nor beneficial for fitness can have greater variability. Since there's no selection towards an extreme phenotype, nor towards an average, the bell curve will widen to include extremes more often. Add into that the fact that breast size is pleiotropic (like height, which is fairly varied, but has a degree of selection influencing it), and the fact that most women are not even wearing the correct bra size (you'd have to have a more accurate way of measuring mass or volume of breast tissue), you can end up with large discrepancies. </p>
<p>Hopefully that made some sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This! Specifically if you had size variation in your feet and hands beyond the point where they get in the way or cannot support your weight it can be problematic for you. Small breasts that still function are not a barrier to having babies or daily life. Larger breasts can cause problems but only at extreme sizes which you'll notice is pretty rare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hang on.  I read OP as saying that large and symmetrical breasts indicate good health and good genes, thus increasing fecundity.  Isn't that sexual selection, or am I misunderstanding the term?  Or is sexual selection the fact that there's a lot of sexual dimorphism w/r/t breast size in humans?   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, Austin, I thought of this possible example for men.  Let's start with the idea that for the purpose of this metaphor:
large breasts (f) = social confidence (m)
symmetrical breasts (f) = intelleigence (m)</p>
<p>So, a person might want a man who is smart and confident, right.  Because if a man is confident he puts himself out there socially, so it's easier to see whether he's smart (large breasts make it easier to see if they're symmetrical).  And there are plenty of men who are smart but not socially confident, and plenty of ment who are socially confident, but not smart.  But the guys who are going to get A-list mates are confident and smart.  But men who are EITHER smart or confident do plenty well.  So  you get plenty of guys who are Steven Hawking (smart, but maybe not so outgoing; his family all brought books to the dinner table) or some sports figures, who have normal intellects but are outgoing and lovable.  Plus, in terms of evolutionary genetics, I think reproduction is a lot more winner-take-all for men than for women. </p>
<p>Edit:  I'd love to know why this got downvoted.  It took me ages to think of this example.    Anyone?</p></div>		</li>
