<p>It's not at all clear what the endpoint of Hawking radiation is, and whether there is anything left behind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the point is that <em>if</em> black holes evaporate to nothingness, then at some point they have to weigh less than .02 mg even if it is impossible to create such a small black hole from scratch. Or to put it another way, if black holes can evaporate to nothingness, then looked at via time-reversal, it must also be theoretically possible to <em>create</em> such a small black hole. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Natural laws as we know them still don't work inside the event horizon, even if its smaller. I can't see universe suddenly reinstating <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle" target="_blank">Paulis exclusion principle</a>. Only reason it can break in the first place is because event horizon shrouds the violation.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure it is ok to think of it like this? e.g. that the Pauli's exclusion principle is the natural state of things and that a violation is unnatural and can only exist when obscured. I think nautralism is a mistake insofar as to consider natural laws to be in control outside of our range of observation when they were all deduced by observation to begin with and only really apply to that which we have observed.</p>
<p>Considering the prediction of unstable naked singularities I don't see why the cosmic censorship hypothesis, being exclusive rather than inclusive and being known to currently fail to exclude all significant cases, should be taken as stronger than the solutions suggesting visible black holes.</p></div>		</li>
