			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a decision-making tree for this in various countries.</p>
<p>You start with comparison with similar substances.  This is definitely not perfect.  This can be done with visual inspection, or through computerized modeling called Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships.  Generally, this is coupled with some basic assays like Ames or other in vitro type (there are several).  </p>
<p>If there is a sign that the substance can mutate DNA, then it'll be tested on animals, usually a small number to start.  </p>
<p>In numerous cases, carcinogenicity is tested in conjunction with a chronic toxicity assay with repeated doses, lasting up to 2 years.  These assays used to look only for general pathology throughout the test organisms (and I mean throughout - the list of tissues examined is staggering), but there is special emphasis on looking for neoplasms as well now.  </p>
<p>Sometimes epidemiology comes into play as well.  Very rarely, a substance can make it through all of these tests looking negative and wind up having an association with a particular type of cancer in occupationally exposed persons.  (More frequently, the substance tests positive in animals, and the evidence is incredibly weak in humans ... dioxin is a good example).  </p>
<p>The availability of alternatives is also a factor.  If there is another substance that still accomplishes the purpose but isn't carcinogenic (or doesn't have as much concern), then substitution is desirable.  </p>
<p>Does that answer your question?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One way would be a control study. Get a bunch of mice and split them into two groups. Have one group exposed to the suspected carcinogen and the other remain free of any exposure. </p>
<p>Then after a period of time compare the cancer rates of the two groups. If there is a noticeable increase in cancer rates in the non-control group then it is likely that the suspected carcinogen is the cause. Just a quick disclaimer this is a big simplification of a cancer study. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget (i) that humans can get cancer from things mice can't and vice versa and (ii) that one study proves nothing until others replicate the results</p>
<p>I know you know that but wanted to mention it for others reading your post. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it in a nutshell. I don't know when we (canada) departed from the precautionary principle but I don't think chemicals should be considered innocent until proven guilty. They should be considered unsafe until proven otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that it is not actually possible to prove something safe. Best you can do is say &quot;we've not seen any issues where we looked&quot;. </p>
<p>Conversely, if you prove a chemical unsafe, companies sometime change an inconsequential atom on the molecule, and now you have to prove it is still unsafe, even if it is very very likely.</p>
<p>Regulation chemicals is therefore very tricky business, and this is one of the areas where we can expect shenanigans from the trade agreements. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another issue with the precautionary principle is that people often fail to take into account relative risks. There are most certainly cases where a small risk is worth having. Some would argue that the ban on DDT has done more harm than good, for instance.</p>
<p>Certainly, taken to the extreme, the precautionary principle will lead to many incorrect decisions, since zero-risk cannot be achieved.</p></div>		</li>
