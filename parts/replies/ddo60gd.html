And since the &quot;Three Feet for Safety&quot; law passed here, pretty much any 2 lane road without a bike lane is too narrow to allow that, so the bicycle can take the full lane. Still gotta pull over if there's more than 5 cars waiting behind you though. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I bike to work in the summer, and the issue for cyclists is that momentum can be crucial to getting where you're going, and stopping at a stop sign (especially going uphill) can really make your ride more difficult.  It's also harder to signal to a vehicle while you're pedaling uphill, since you need your hands on the handlebars to keep your balance and trajectory going forward.  So some cyclists figure that they have some leeway, and the larger vehicle should yield to the smaller one anyway.  But you're taking your life into your hands.  </p>
<p>I've had some drivers get very irate with me at a 4 way stop, because I didn't come to a complete stop like they're required to do.  7AM, shaking their fist and yelling through the windshield, when we were both passing by each other and neither was getting cut off.  (Lady, you realize you're in your comfy, climate controlled bubble with a gas pedal, and I'm pedaling uphill... and if I come to a total stop I have to get halfway off my bike and start my climb over again?)</p>
<p>Bicyclists have to be assertive on the road, but at the same time we have to at least <em>try</em> to adhere to the same rules.</p></div>		</li>
