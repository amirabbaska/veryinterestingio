			<div class="markdown"><p>Epigenetics is responsible for development. One of the first things that happens after mammalian fertilization is a near-complete obliteration of histone markers and DNA modifications to prepare the cell for development. </p>
<p>Multigeneration epigenetic adaptation to the environment in mammals has little evidence at the moment. Studies showing detectable phenotypic changes in humans as a result of epigenetic shifts are, generally without exception, poorly powered or inadequately controlling for confounding variables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really understand the first paragraph too well. Could you explain it again?</p>
<p>I understand the second paragraph as: &quot;we don't understand epigenetics between generations yet and the studies that we have seem to have been done poorly&quot;. Is that a fair assessment of what you've said?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Epigenetics is why all of your cells, which have the same genome and DNA, do wildly different things. Nerve cell, skin cell, pancreatic cell, macrophage - they all have the same DNA. Epigenetics is the stable, heritable programming of a cell to use specific pieces of their DNA and not other pieces. It allows cells to be in defined lineages, so skin cells will make more skin cells (that's why stem cells are so cool - they have a lot of plasticity in what they can be, they can turn into lots of stuff).</p>
<p>When an egg is fertilized, all of the epigenetic information in the cell is rapidly wiped out, so that the new zygote can properly develop into a person. It's pretty rapid and thorough, and covers both histone modifications and DNA modifications, complete by the time the zygote turns into a blastocyst. There are few studies showing any epigenetic effect on phenotypic traits, and the ones that do exist are usually pretty weak. The effect of your epigenetics on your kids is extremely weak to nonexistent. It's not that we don't understand it. It's that it's probably not a thing that's very important for passing traits to offspring in mammals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Epigenetics</p>

<p>I'm gathering from this thread that Epigenetics has lead to some sort of pop-science resurgence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism" target="_blank">Lysenkoism.</a> We've observed some heritability of acquired characteristics amidst the overwhelming absence of that behavior, which means we should not assume any given acquired characteristic is now heritable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lysenkoism is far too extreme. Though with CISPR i guess anything is possible. The second video from Scishow gives a good analogy. The DNA is the hardware your cell uses. It does all the hard work. Your epigenome is essentially the Software. It determines how the DNA is read and which parts to read and which not to. Its why all the cells in your body have the same DNA, but go on to create vastly different types of cells. It just turns out, the Epigenome is far more complex than we thought and is far more plastic than we were aware.</p>
<p>However, if the DNA is not there, you cannot change an animal into another, or a plant into a second plant. If they are different species, then there is a good chance their DNA is missing something the other species has, therefore now allowing it change. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good explanation of how many layman view epigentics. But this view is not entirely correct. I've known many people who struggle with trying to conceptualize epigenetics, but usually these are people who don't know a whole lot about biochemistry.</p>
<p>So, basically. You have your DNA, which consists of billions of &quot;bases&quot; that code for 20000-25000 genes. Each of these bases has the potential to be modified - usually they are methylated, which means that the base gets an additional carbon atom. </p>
<p>These changes to the bases, changes to the DNA result in differences between  the gene-expression patterns of different people. This is also why identical-twins might not always be so identical when they get older. </p>
<p>These changes to the DNA are passed to both sperms and egg cells. However, when the egg and sperms combine, a whole bunch of chemical reactions happen that reset all of the changes that were made to DNA in the first place. So now you have a zygote, that gets a fresh slate to make all of its own unique epigenetic modifications.</p>
<p>There has not yet been any evidence that epigenetic modifications are hereditary in humans. However, epigenetic modifications have been found to be hereditary in prokaryotic organisms, such as <em>E. coli</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, the heritable microbiome probably plays a more important role in obesity than epigenetics. That is, the bacteria in your gut contribute heavily to obese phenotypes and overall host-health. So, if mom's microbiome was significantly altered through diet and exercise, that microbiome would be passed off to the child (assuming a vaginal birth). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't a completely ignorant point, but it is misleading. Your gut biome can and does change dramatically throughout your life. I feel like the root of the question has to do with parent lifestyle versus offspring development and this seems like something that's more chance than heredity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is this misleading? We don't really know enough about the gut microbiome to suggest that these changes are meaningful or biologically relevant in terms of function. However, we do that the gut microbiome is heavily responsible for mediating human health and nutrition and autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, and
fibromyalgia are associated with dysfunction in the
microbiome. Disease-causing microbes accumulate over
time, changing gene activity and metabolic processes
and resulting in an abnormal immune response against
substances and tissues normally present in the body.
Autoimmune diseases appear to be passed in families
not by DNA inheritance but by inheriting the familyâ€™s
microbiome. </p>
<p>The gut microbiome also interacts at the gut-brain axis and can mediate a slew of psychological disorders. We know the gut microbiome can single-handedly induce obese phenotypes as evidenced by isogenic gnotobiotic mice being transplanted with microbiomes from monozygotic twins--one who was obese and one who wasn't. The obese microbiome transplant induced obesity while the other did not--even with the same caloric intake of the mice. </p>
<p>So, the microbiome influences health and is heritable. If mom is obese, she will likely pass down her obese microbiome and the kid will be obese. If mom is healthy, her healthy microbiome will be passed down to the child. Yes, the gut microbiome changes slightly over time, but the functional consequences of those changes are not well characterized and I'm not sure that has anything to do with this the OPs questions.  </p></div>		</li>
