			<div class="markdown"><p>exactly. a perfect example is the song &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; by Dire Straits.
there's a throwaway line in the background that goes &quot;I want my...I want my...I want my MTV...&quot; which is sung by Sting, who's not in the band at all, but was lead singer and songwriter of another band called The Police.  </p>
<p>The reason is that the melody is identical to a part of a Police song called &quot;Don't Stand So Close To Me&quot;, but with the title lyrics instead: &quot;don't stand so...don't stand so...don't stand so close to me&quot;</p>
<p>to avoid a lawsuit before the song even came out, Dire Straits got permission from the Police and their publisher to include it, and Sting ended up singing the part, too. really random. </p>
<p>As a songwriter myself i've learned that pretty much every melody has already been taken by somebody before me. I guarantee that your favorite song was ripped off by another song, either on purpose, subconsciously, or accidentally. As Solomon said &quot;There is nothing new under the sun...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a few exemples of this with some Beatles songs :</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI8AOkbfgNE" target="_blank">The Jam - Start!</a> has a bass line that is a straight copy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsFRMTbhOn0" target="_blank">Taxman</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-zkhseKzoY" target="_blank">Texas - Black Eyed Boy</a> has a part that furiously reminds of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJDJs9dumZI" target="_blank">While My Guitar Gently Weeps</a> (best song ever by the Beatles imo)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH-i8IvYIcg" target="_blank">The Offspring - Why don't you get a job ?</a> -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMNAolSPrzA" target="_blank">Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da</a>, this one may be a conscious tribute.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Uc3ZrmhDN4" target="_blank">Sublime - What I Got</a> -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6-pqbAOzg8" target="_blank">Lady Madonna</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAtGOESO7W8" target="_blank">Tears For Fears - Sowing the Seeds of Love</a> -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19sAewJH22I" target="_blank">I am the Walrus</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I'm pretty sure both the Offspring and Sublime songs are intentional, which would be considered an interpolation. A ton of people have done intentional Beatles interpolations, and I think they have to give up a portion of the songwriting credits to be able to do it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any new music you hear today is almost guaranteed to be derived from past experiences. Because of that, I think most copyright laws regarding the instrumental part of music is pretty bull shit. To clarify, I'm ok with asking right and permission to perform or use songs and parts of them, but it's rather shitty that people can't take parts of a song and at least modify it enough to make out noticeably different without getting into legal shit. I understand that involves a lot of subjective elements though. It's just frustrating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would disagree. I do not subscribe to the &quot;everything has been done before&quot; model of the arts. There is always some new way to arrange, interpret or otherwise approach any medium. Music is much like the lottery. A nearly endless number of possible combinations. Yes, there are parameters, but when you start breaking music down in to division of notes, the possibilities are nearly endless. Sure, in a composition, there may be a part that has been done before, but it is a new whole. Much like cooking. Endless possibilities. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it's okay that almost every melody and chord progression has been done, because it's more about the set of melodies, their order, chords you set them to, pitch/timing/volume and very importantly the timbre that sets things apart. It's all about the full song creating something new, not the sum of its parts. About the arrangement, the context things are put in. It's okay to have the same tools as long as you make something new with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For now. Until even the timber can be computer generated instantly by laymen. Soon we'll be able to listen to Kashmir and say, 'yknow I think it would be better if it was digeridoo instead of guitar' and a simple algorithm or AI will automatically replace it. Then, everything will truly already have been done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, because there were a few major news headline about popular mainstream songs (Blurred Lines, Uptown Funk) being sued due to its resemblance with old melody. And I do remember damages being paid as it was ruled to be infringing.</p>
<p>My guess is that the damage was paid so they can continue to sell the music, or if they are happy to completely stop playing the songs then they can walk away?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blurred lines case was actually pretty bogus. The part of the song that was copied was the groove, not actually something that can be copyrighted.  Pharrell and Thicke basically screwed themselves because they admitted they directly copied it, which should actually be legal. If the jury had followed the letter of the law, they shouldn't have been found guilty of copying the song.</p></div>		</li>
