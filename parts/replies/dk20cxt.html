<p>We saw an eye doc when she was a baby for a wandering eye. He gave us patches. She refused to wear them. The doc wasn't too concerned and said she'd grow out of it, with or without the patch. Luckily, the eye stopped wandering and I thought it was behind us. </p>
<p>It came back. She's 6. It's both eyes. When she gets tired or daydreams, the eyes wander. I say, &quot;HEY, FOCUS!&quot; And she straightens them up. She says she isn't aware it is happening (no blurred vision, she can't feel it.) </p>
<p>I was hoping it would stop on its own again. Going to head back to the doctor to have it looked at. Thank you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Intermittent exotropia doesn't always need treatment. If she has developed normal stereo vision, the wandering eye is mostly a cosmetic problem. Which is serious enough, yes, but not sight-threatening. That's why the previous doc wasn't too concerned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming it is just a cosmetic problem, would it be lifelong? Or would it eventually go away on its own? </p>
<p>How could it even be fixed? </p>
<p>... I used to think it was just one eye. But I started paying attention and noticed that both eyes do it (one will be straight. The other wanders). </p></div>		</li>
