			<div class="markdown"><p>It is! And fortunately, it helps us! Many of those 10^46 molecules are going to spend your entire life stuck at the bottom of the ocean, which lowers that number a fair bit. Additionally, the water you drink is all sourced locally - making it much easier for atoms you've previously drank to make their way back to you. </p></div>		</li>

<p>As a geologist, this is a troubling statement. Many &quot;local&quot; water sources are aquifers with ancient water. No amount of surface mixing will get water into that aquifer in a way you will find the same molecule again. Additionally, global and regional weather patterns will move water away from you once the treated wastewater is released into the environment. Now, these details aren't going to do that much to affect the excellent answer to OPs question you gave, but provide important caveats to the nuance you provide here.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Man I love the book The Improbability Principle, it's probably my most read book of all time. Probably because I dream about winning the lottery, like anyone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People are making arguments about the source of drinking water, but wouldn't it be possible that you redrink water that was exhaled through respiration or sweat. I live in a very humid place and tend to drink fairly cold water. Would it be likely that that cold water is absorbing some amount of water that I previously exhaled?. It seems to me like it would, but I don't know much about the subject.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since in reality, they're not mixed perfectly uniformly,  you're even more likely to drink the same molecules twice than the computation above, since it's more likely water you drank previously is nearer to you than farther from you. So the result still holds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting thing is, water molecules exchanges hydrogen atoms with others very quickly, so after a few minutes the most molecules are not themselves any more. </p>
<p>To hope for the same molecule to show up twice, you are relying on that molecule hasn't exchanged hydrogen yet, or has exchanged a few times but has changed back by chance, both of which are pretty close to impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but we could still extend it to those component oxygen and hydrogen atoms. They form oxygen (duh) and sugars, both of which we are actually more likely to consume than some water molecule which made it back to the ocean.</p>
<p>Of course, it's ridiculously unlikely they'll combine back into the same water molecule again, but it must happen some fraction of the time.</p>
<p>Besides, plant respiration only affects a small tiny fraction of water molecules. Even if you count only water that went through a plant, most of it is not broken apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't matter. The equation for two random cups in your life (assuming perfect shuffling) is: </p>
<pre><code>1 - e^(-(water molecules drunk^2)/(2*water molecules on earth))</code></pre>
<p>Two glasses of water have enough molecules to make this 1-e^(-100), which might as well be 1. </p>
<p>Especially if you extend it to tens of thousands of liters in your life, squaring the numerator means it grows large much faster than the rate at which water is added to and removed from the environment.</p></div>		</li>
