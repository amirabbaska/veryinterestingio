<p>Here's a small &quot;overview&quot;.</p>
<p>The way our reality is fabricated is best summed up like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If that hypothesis is true, or at least comes close to being true, it follows that perception is a closed, intrinsic functional state, irrespective of whether we are dreaming, whether we are hallucinating or whether we are perceiving the world in an unclouded state of wakeful consciousness. It follows, in short, that all we ever perceive is the intrinsic products of our brain.” (Collerton et al 2015, 25).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically what it says is that you aren't in contact with the outside world, you are in contact with your brain, which generates a non-stop stream of information. But in the absence of any sensory input, it would still generate that stream and that stream is not depended on sensory data, it is merely MODIFIED by it. But how it is modified and to what degree is entirely dictated by your brain, which does process sensory information but the way it &quot;arrives&quot; in our brain is vastly different from the end product we experience as a sensation.</p>
<p>There is a condition called Charles Bonnet syndrome where blind people report seeing things, in their &quot;mind's eye&quot;. Distinctive describable shapes. This condition has been used to support this theory as it has shown (and other phenomena has shown) that the sensation of vision is possible without eyes, but not without the brain's visual area. So what you experience as vision is entirely a product of the visual area, regardless of what information is transmitted from our eyes, if any at all. But, luckily for us, we need it to be an accurate representation of what information IS sent so that we survive, but it's still entirely an innate product of our brain that is not generated by our senses, merely altered by them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, that makes sense. Makes me want to try an isolation tank even more now. Is also really interesting how you don't need eyes for sight/visions can imagine this probably played a role in some seers visions or some other form of mysticism in the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would love to but it's currently under embargo in the uni repository and beyond that I don't want to share TOO much information about myself on this account.</p>
<p>The topic is the occurrence of geometric visual hallucinations on a type of Near-Eastern Neolithic pottery. The patterns employed seem similar to different patterns described by users of psychedelics and occurring in psychedelic art.</p>
<p>Bressloff and Cowan have offered a model of these geometric hallucinations based on Heinrich Kluver's four form constants and they've found that in various ways, structures in the visual area and the way they process and relay information can give rise to these four form constants and the way they interact to create all kinds of hallucinatory images.</p>
<p>Because of this, we can try and &quot;solve&quot; one of the biggest problems in archaeology: there is no way of ever interpreting an actual &quot;experience&quot; from archaeological data. With these hallucinations, there is, because these patterns are quantifiably related to the actual structure of the human primary visual area. </p>
<p>I argue this in my thesis, half of it is a rundown of how these structures give rise to certain recognizable shapes and patterns and the other half is about the archaeology of the period, the nature of the pottery, etc, followed by a small statistical comparison. </p>
