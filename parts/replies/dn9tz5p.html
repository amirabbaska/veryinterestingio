			<div class="markdown"><p>The scientific community in the former Soviet Union, kept records for the same reason the US does today. The reasons for testing and chemical byproduct analysis haven't changed since the beginning. Only the methods since they can no longer be tested amongst the nations who agreed to the bans for refinement of design or readiness. </p>
<p>The records are pretty thorough, but for obvious reasons, very closely guarded except to key personnel. Otherwise knowing how to modify the reactor to produce certain enrichments wouldn't be possible and any potential yield calculations or specific designs for geometry of the device would be utterly useless since they are based on amount of product at certain enrichment points. </p>
<p>As for North Korea, no, we would have no clue what their chemistry would include without use of the Constant Phoenix aircraft from the USAF or its counterparts from sources like Russia, Japan, China or the IAEA.  However, even without that info, the material can be identified as being not of origin from any known producer of materials. And eliminated via what we know of the surrounding environment detectable in the material makeup even without the chemistry. It just takes longer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, physicist here! (who never got to study bombs, sadly)</p>
<p>I'm wondering, why do you talk about reactors? Is plutonium the most common kind of bomb? Don't they just use HEU, which comes directly from centrifuges? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending upon the design, and I'm getting into details here that would break my clearance if I continued further, HEU and plutonium are both used in separate parts of common designs for the stability of the matrix. While HEU is produced from centrifuge plants, Breeder reactors still exist specifically to produce plutonium and certain fissile products. This part is the most identifiable signature in the devices produced. Plutonium, in spite of precautions taken in containment, manages to leave its mark wherever it goes. Even when being separated in aqueous reactions for disposal. </p>
<p>In thermonuclear design you still have the question of the fusion secondary and how those chemical concentrations are used. The amount of heavy elements that go into weapon making is much more that just a core and explosives package, and each one of those products are produced in specific ways. And sometimes can be balanced to be produced in different parts of the same breeder. </p>
<p>Hope that helps</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, that I know of, actual engineering details of bombs is not publicly available knowledge. So not something you find at a university. On the other side, <em>lots</em> of principles and designes are known, there are even well detailed Wikipedia page. So, a student in nuclear sciences (physicist or engineer) who studies nuclear fission is going to learn quite a bit of bomb designs. However, I specialized in detectors and subnuclear physics, therefore I got to do just one general course of nuclear physics, with like 2 lectures in total regarding the different kinds of reactor designs and nothing on bombs, extremely qualitative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breeder reactors.</p>
<p>The only. Sole reason our nuclear power uses Uranium instead of Thorium is because we get Plutonium for Nukes from the former, rather than 'just' the power from Thorium reactors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So.. if someone took a bomb from a known facility, and added a few grams of what's usually by-products, say in a plastic baggie near the bomb core, then could that actually throw off the analysis after it's been detonated?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could, but given the amount of research and records of expected by-products, anyone would know immediately that &quot;one of these things is not like the others&quot;.</p>
<p>I've answered a lot of these type questions in my career. They are always predictable. If it's something that interests you or scares you, do the research. There are multitudes of resources out there to learn about it. You won't find design other than rudimentary specs, because, well, obvious reasons. </p>
<p>And if you guys are interested in why most of us nuclear engineers and chemists aren't afraid of radioactivity or contaminated places and things, I encourage you to check out a wonderful YouTube channel I stumbled across years ago: Bionerd23</p>
<p>She has balls. With the amount of time she's spent in Pripyat and Chernobyl, it wouldn't surprise me if everyone thought she had grown a pair from the radiation. She does a spectacular job of showing you knowledge is the path to leaving fear behind.</p></div>		</li>
