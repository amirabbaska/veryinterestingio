			<div class="markdown"><p>There are about 10^45 photons leaving the <em>sun</em> every second.</p>
<p>Even if we assumed all of those were violet (they're not) and they were all entering the ocean (they're not), it would take 9.2*10^235 seconds on average, or 10^228 years, for a <em>single</em> photon to make it to the bottom. Which is many, many, many times the expected lifespan of the sun (about 5 billion more years).</p>
<p>10^-278 and 10^-1515 are so incredibly low that they are zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hell, those numbers could be thousands of trillions times larger and still be zero. They could be thousands of trillions times <em>that</em> and still be zero. Then you could do that several more times and they'd <em>still</em> be zero. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, you seem somewhat knowledgeable on the rate at which water absorbs light, so I have a question and a problem for you.</p>
<p>I'm trying to devise a method by which water is converted to its composite gasses using an artificial leaf system like that developed by Daniel Nocera.  The idea is that the system would be under the water to increase the reaction rate, and also so that the gasses would be under pressure when they were formed, being then easily pumped to ambient atmospheric pressure areas where they were needed.</p>
<p>What is the optimum depth for the system to produce hydrogen and oxygen under pressure, while still receiving enough UV light for the system to operate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The optimum depth is the thinnest film of water that you can keep over the incident surface.  Any water is going to scatter photons, so the smaller the thickness of that layer, the more photons are going to make it to your photoactive surface. </p>
<p>My advice would be to not have any liquid water covering the surface at all and use some porous media and capillary forces to bring that water to the photoactive surface.</p>
<p>My second piece of advice is: look through the scientific literature to see if anyone has every tried this before.  Solar energy conversion is HUGE field with thousands of articles being published every year.  I doubt you're the first to think of this type of a set-up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, you don't need to put it under water to have the gasses pressurised - just pressurise the vessel they're in, it'll give you the same effect, and pressurising stuff up to 100s of atmospheres is trivial as far as engineering and financial problems go. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking for something more like at what depth the increase in reaction rate from pressure was offset by loss of photons, but thank you for the information anyways.</p>
<p>If the light loss was too great even at two atmospheres, I'd probably try to find a way to filter the light through the water with mirrors rather than remove the water, unless you know off the top of your head a better way to keep the gasses under pressure as they form?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak to the process you're using, but I can give you a formula to determine how much of the UV light is present. </p>
<p>You will need to evaluate this with an extinction coefficient for every medium that the UV light passes through including water, air, glass, whatever. </p>
<p>I typically will get my kappa (extinction coefficient) values from <a href="http://refractiveindex.info/" target="_blank">http://refractiveindex.info/</a> unless I need to actually have the journal article in hand (e.g. it's for my research). </p>
<p>Look up the kappa value you need at the wavelength in question. So for a wavelength of 200nm (0.2Âµm) <a href="http://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&amp;book=H2O&amp;page=Hale" target="_blank">that page</a> gives the value of kappa to be 1.1e-7 for water.</p>
<p>now calculate k=(4<em>pi</em>kappa)/wavelength and plug it into:</p>
<p>L=L_0 * exp(-kz)</p>
<p>where L is the intensity of light at a depth z in a material with the provided k value. L_0 is the intensity of the light that actually enters the material. Note that the units for z and wavelength must match.  All I was doing in my original answer was putting L=0.01, L_0 = 1 and solving for z.</p>
<p>Also note that in any real world material you're going to have reflections off the surface and you will need to solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations" target="_blank">Fresnel Equations</a> to determine how much energy actually makes it across the boundary.</p></div>		</li>
