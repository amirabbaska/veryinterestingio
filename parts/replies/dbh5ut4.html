			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in theory. Anti matter behaves the same as normal matter does, it just happens to annihilate when it comes into contact with normal matter. The main problem would be getting enough of the antimatter together for a long enough time to make a  planet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In either case how does this not violate &quot;matter can't be created or destroyed,  only transformed&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It does violate it, but that rule isn't completely true. Matter can be created or destroyed (in antimatter annihilation, for example) but it doesn't happen in our everyday lives to any noticeable degree.</p>
<p>And the energy is always conserved. The particles and photons emitted by an annihilation will have the same total energy as the matter and antimatter particles had before.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Technically you'd only need enough for one viable cell, and enough anti-matter &quot;food&quot; to prove that life processes are occurring - if you wanted to prove the point.</p>
<p>It would still take about a quintillion dollars to gather that much antimatter...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some reason that we don't know, matter exists naturally where anti-matter does not - as there isn't any known reason why the big bang would favor matter. You would expect to observe anti-matter galaxies (in near equal proportions to matter galaxies), but the have not been - so far as the observable universe goes. This problem is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry" target="_blank">Baryon asymmetry.</a></p>
<p>It's a very valid assumption, but one that is proving difficult to observe at even the most fundamental level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not in the observable universe. &quot;Empty&quot; space isn't truly a vacuum - there is a thin gas that permeates the entire universe. If there were anti-matter galaxies (or planets, or any sizeable agglomeration of anti-matter) we would detect it. The reason for this is because it annihilates on contact with normal matter; any area with anti-matter would continuously annihilate with the normal matter at the edges. This would leave an obvious radiation signature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The opposite is actually assumed.  Any large body of antimatter would certainly be visible to us as a large gamma source, and we just don't see anything that fits the bill when we look at the night sky.</p></div>		</li>
