			<div class="markdown"><p>Hugo pressure was 935 mb at landfall.  Florence pressure is 930 mb right now (lower is more intense), and forecast to remain strong until landfall.   So if the forecasting holds, this will be as bad or worse than Hugo.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's track is expected to hit NC directly as a category 4. Hugo was a category 4 with 140mph winds. When Florence hits it is expected to have sustained winds of about 139mph. <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?cone#contents" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics\_at1.shtml?cone#contents" target="_blank">https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics\_at1.shtml?cone#contents</a></a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hugo passed through swiftly - in a day or so.  Florence is expected to stall over land for a couple of days before meandering away.  So it's kinda Hugo meets Harvey, a big blow <em>and</em> lots and lots of persistent rain.</p></div>		</li>
