			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there’s no elastin diet but undernutrition is mainly a problem of developing and poorer countries, ones suffering famine or wars. that being said It just comes from overall healthy eating habits like different raw vegetables and fruits, assortment of protein sources (dairy, meats, plants.. not just one) and having enough energy to carry out that process (calories). Eating enough proteins from different sources, vitamins and minerals which are necessary cofactors for enzymes to make elastin: b vitamins, zinc, and vitamin c being the most prominent ones. This once again isn’t the probable issue in developed countries, more the smoking, lack of exercise, and stress. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ironically, the severely undernourished tend to look younger, not older. I'm thinking of rice Farmers in war torn east Asia who are deep into their 30s but still look like they're 12. That doesn't happen when these people get proper nutrition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to study elastin (in the context of arteries and veins) and it was my understanding that you're essentially born with all the elastin precursors (proto-elastin) that you will have in your whole life, and that's another contributor for the degeneration, in this context, of skin and the eventuality 'sagginess' we all can look forward to.</p>
<p>Perhaps this isn't as much of the case in the skin as it was in the vasculature. Obviously there are plenty of things that can alter this but that was the rule of thumb that we had and operated under.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There’s other factors but i need to stop writing eventually so i don’t bore everyone to death. But i hope these helped.</p>
