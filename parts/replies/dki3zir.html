<p>I hadn't considered this.  I mean is a balance scale really that accurate?  I have no idea how they work, but they've always seemed kind of sketchy to me -- the &quot;sliding metal pieces around&quot; thing just seems less precise than a clean digital display spitting out a number to the tenths place, but that doesn't mean it <em>is</em> less precise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going on a bit about how they work:</p>
<p>Image that you had a seesaw with a really fat guy sitting on one end. On the other end, they've made the arm a bit longer and have a child. The child starts near the center as well, so it is forced up into the air by the gravitationally blessed one. The kid starts moving down the lever however, and eventually it is standing several tomes farther away from the hinge in the middle than the other guy is, and the seesaw balances out. </p>
<p>The scale is just another form of this. You are pulling down on a very short lever, with the weights attached to the other end. By moving the weights out, they get more torque and eventually match yours. The numbers on that bar are essentially saying how much weight each mass is equivalent to, and they read it when the lever arm is balanced with your weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I refurbished our rusty old physical scale last year, and I can confirm that it's built pretty durable, so there should be no drift as it gets older.  Also, if you go about refinishing a scale like I did, dont forget that paint weighs something, so don't paint the balancing weights or internal mechanism, or if you do, then recalibrate it afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A STEM graduate degree and a job that involves a fair amount of measuring things have made me trust physical over digital measuring devices in most cases.  It's possible the balance scale at the doctor really <em>is</em> more accurate than the electric display at your house.</p>
<p>The nice thing about physical measuring devices is that you can <em>see</em> the measuring happen.  Eg, you can see how the balance is balancing, you can see the fluid in the thermometer...and if there's a problem, you can see that, too.  You read the measurement directly from the physical thing that's happening.  Digital meters have an extra stage involved.  A sensor reads what happens and tells you what it's reading.  That leads an extra point of failure and drift and has to be calibrated properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And for weighing very small amounts. (I.e. chem lab) physical measurement is much better. With digital you can see that you have put something on there, yet it is still reading zero dammit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The added benefit to balance scales is that they measure mass accurately.</p>
<p>Take one to Mars and 'weigh' yourself. You'll get exactly the same reading you do on Earth, despite gravity being a lot lower.</p>

I know my doctor just uses electronic ones when doing out calls to space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electronic scales do not use springs but rather load cells. The ones used in cheep scales are just that, cheep. When weight is applied to the scale, the load cell is deflected it generates a signal that a circuit board reads. A simple table is used to determine how much weight is being applied based on the strength of the signal. Because the load cells are cheap their tolerance is not accurate thus the signal they produce doesn't always match the stored table in the memory chip on the circuit board and may vary based on temp and other factors.</p></div>		</li>
