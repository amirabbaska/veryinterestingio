<p>When you can look through a telescope at it, the sun ia more than a big ball of fire, shits dynamic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sunspots and flares can cause issues on Earth, yes.</p>
<p>In fact, a massive solar storm is blamed for causing surges in lines around the Midwest in.... 1850s? That caused telegraph wires to spark and spontaneously arc.</p>
<p>I'll try to dig up more in a sec here. </p>
<p>Edit: Google up &quot;Solar Storm of 1859&quot;. Wikipedia has a decent article. Telegraphs were basically &quot;self powered&quot; for awhile and folks saw auroras as bright as dawn all the way to the Caribbean. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the magnetic field disturbances get large enough they can twist and erupt in a solar flare. If its pointed at earth it will cause a geomagnetic storm. Most electronics are pretty well protected these days but they can still cause communication black outs.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just some general info for the public:</p>
<p>Please - PLEASE - ensure that the filters are undamaged. There should be no physical scratches or scruff marks on either side of the filter. Try looking through the filter with a single eye before attaching to your telescope. Once it's on your scope, the magnification - in addition to a <em>damaged</em> filter  - can and <em>will</em> permanently damage your eyes. </p>
<p>That said, filters are a great way to tease out details in various objects. For day time, a typical White Light solar filter can be used which will replicate what you can see with solar eclipse glasses. There are specialized scopes that allow for H-alpha which is a much more detailed image.</p>
<p>Night time filters include OIII or UHC, either of which, with varying degrees, can tease out details for nebulas and other gaseous deep sky objects. Additionally there's a light pollution filter for those within the city and moon filters since viewing a full moon can be <em>very</em> bright and straining on your eyes. </p>
<p>Be safe and clear skies! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, there was a TIFU thread about a guy who put the glasses between the binoculars and his face instead of having the filter between the binoculars and the sun. The binoculars ended up burning a hole in the filter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6v4wp0/tifu_by_melting_a_hole_in_my_solar_eclipse/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6v4wp0/tifu_by_melting_a_hole_in_my_solar_eclipse/</a></p>
<p>I <em>assume</em> the right way to do this would be to have a filter that is large enough to cover the &quot;input&quot; side of whatever you're looking through and make sure it stays firmly attached.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little trick for those that have a telescope, but no filters.</p>
<p>Hold a sheet of paper in front of the eye piece and get a neato projection of the sun on the paper. Very low amplification will do it or you'll burn the paper.</p>
<p>Word for the (un)wise: don't aim the telescope with your eye. Aim with the sheet of paper.</p></div>		</li>

SOHO/EIT has been eclipsed by the much higher quality of <a href="https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/" target="_blank">AIA on NASA's SDO</a> which takes images more frequently, with more filters and at higher resolution.</p></div>		</li>
