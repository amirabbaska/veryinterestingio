			<div class="markdown"><p>The facts here are mostly true but don't really answer the question. For example, all fcc metals have the same packing fraction, but they don't have the same density (compare Al and Pt, for example). And the number of slip systems, while relevant to plastic deformation, doesn't explain why the hardness is different — look at the list <a href="http://www.jewelrynotes.com/the-mohs-scale-of-hardness-for-metals-why-it-is-important/" target="_blank">here</a> and some fcc metals (such as Pb) are softer than Fe (bcc), while others (such as Rh) are harder. And hcp metals, which have fewer slip systems than either fcc or bcc, appear at both the soft end (Zn) and the hard end (Ti) of the scale.</p>
<p>What are the real explanations? Regarding density, there are three factors: The packing fraction (determined by the crystal structure), the atomic weights of the atoms, and, crucially, the <em>size</em> of the atoms. Aluminum atoms have low atomic weight and are rather large, so Al is among the least dense of the metals. Tungsten, on the other hand, is quite dense in spite of its bcc structure (which is not close-packed) because of its high atomic weight and because its atoms are not especially large. There's a nice chart of relative atomic sizes <a href="http://crystalmaker.com/support/tutorials/crystalmaker/atomic-radii/resources/VFI_Atomic_Radii.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>How about hardness? The critical feature here is the shear modulus of the metal. You'll say, and you'll be right, that shear modulus is the resistance to elastic (recoverable) deformation. But the shear modulus is, fundamentally, a measure of how difficult it is to distort atomic bonds. The resistance to dislocation motion is usually expressed in terms of the shear modulus. So metals with a higher shear modulus tend to be harder than metals with a lower modulus.</p>
<p>Well, what determines the modulus? This is directly correlated to the strength of the atomic bonds between the atoms—metals with stronger bonds tend to have higher modulus, and therefore be harder. This is why metals with high melting temperatures (such as W and Ti) tend to be hard, while metals with low melting temperatures (such as lead and zinc) are soft.</p>
<p>Aside: More properly, the modulus is related to the curvature of the potential energy well in a plot of potential energy vs. interatomic spacing. The interatomic spacing in most metals is about the same (around 3 Angstroms) so a deeper well implies greater curvature.</p>
<p>At bottom, of course, both the density and the modulus are reflections of the nature of the interatomic bonds, which are determined by quantum mechanics. And that's where this metallurgist will leave off, and let a solid-state physicist take up the story.</p></div>		</li>

Or is this actually one the reasons why they use an alloy, to get a mix of the property.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So some alloying additions are added to stabilise the preferred structure. Different structures mean different mechanical properties.</p>
<p>For example, Ti6Al4V is a very popular alloy of titanium is aerospace, as it has a good balance of strength to ductility.</p>
<p>This is because Al stabilises one structure (phase), and the vanadium stabilises the other, giving a good mix of properties.</p>
<p>Titanium alloys with only aluminium type stabilisers have excellent corrosion and high temperature creep properties, so would be very good for use in the gas and oil industry. </p>
<p>Titanium alloys with just vanadium type stabilisers are very strong, but also very elastic, so are used for orthodontic applications where stainless steel would have been used previously. (Also Ti has excellent bio-compatibility, however other alloys may be better for different body areas)</p>
<p>They all contain titanium, but depending on the alloying addition, a different structure is achieved at room temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much all correct, though one thing to note is that these days, the biomedical field is moving sharply away from Al/V/Ni etc additions, because they all have nasty biological effects independently. While the spontaneous oxide layer helps mitigate that, there's still a shift to more biocompatible elements like Ta, Nb, and Zr.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alloys generally have a fixed crystal structure throughout their bulk, not patches of different structures (although something like this can happen if the metals phase separate). I'm not sure if that's what you're getting at, though.  </p>
<p>Maybe something closer to answering your question, alloys are often made to get the material property benefits of one component but the structural benefits of the alloy. For example, if you need a magnetic material you can alloy iron with other metals to try to get other desired properties such as machinability. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure about that first statement? I was under the impression that alloys had mixing of crystal structures. Things like NiTinol are an exception because they form a crystal structure that is specific to their combination. I'm pretty sure that nitinol is even considered a separate metal, unlike how alloys are.</p></div>		</li>
