<p>The first task ever given to me was writing software to lock out certain gases from being mixed, known as the forbidden pairs. If certain gases mixed, or if certain gases interacted with atmosphere, you get a deadly explosion. That was fun.</p>

<p>Did you ever have an explosion? And I'd heard chlorine trifluoride was sometimes used for this sort of thing. Did you ever use that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to my knowledge. The code was ran through a simulator at first. Then hooked up to an actual machine, and we'd mix and match flows and verify the software interlocks worked as designed. My history w the company was working there in the 90's, then quitting, then coming back 20 years later, then quitting again last year. I think they had advanced (at least I hope so) to both hardware AND software interlocks...because it would be possible for a tech to accidentally hook up the wrong gases, or mislabel them in software. Were I to redesign this, I'd make sure that there was a sensor that could sniff the gas, and work with the software to correctly label it, then have both hardware and software work together to prevent tragedy.</p>
<p>I wrote that code over 20 years ago, too. There are machines with it still running out there. And yes, chlorine triflouride was used in plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition.</p>
<p>What really gets my goat is the fact that I worked with a doctor who was working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_reactive-ion_etching#Bosch_process" target="_blank">Bosch</a> on a newer process (back then, at least it was new...now known as the Bosch Process). I wrote the software that allowed for deeper etching. This lead the company to a lot of patents, which eventually allowed them to use deep etching to &quot;dice&quot; wafers.</p>
<p>What this means that instead of being limited to what a saw or laser could cut, you could now cut in any shape you wanted....within reason. Instead of squares, you could have octaganal chips, for example. I quit the company, then went back nearly twenty years later. Whenever I brought up the fact that my name should at least be on the patent, I was ignored. IDK even how to approach that today after quitting a second time, if it's even worth it. Maybe I should find a lawyer.</p></div>		</li>
