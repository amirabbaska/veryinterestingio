<p>Well, that's not really accurate. </p>
<p>With a density of 1610 kg/m^3 (quite a bit higher than ice's density of 920 kg/m^(3)), a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/o6wyWgO.jpg" target="_blank">very substantial portion of Enceladus is not ice</a>. It's less like a snowball and more like a rock covered in ice.</p>
<p>A much better comparison would by Tethys - with a density of 985 kg/m^(3), it's much closer to pure ice than Enceladus.</p></div>		</li>
