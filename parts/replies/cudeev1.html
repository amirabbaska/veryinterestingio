			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait ok genuinely interested here: if you don't know you're awake, what defines being awake? Like how can you be awake and not know it? I guess I could see some kind of transitional state where you're drowsy as you slowly wake up, but I always just kinda figured you were awake when you were conscious again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I'm not an expert on it, but it is similar to how sleep stages work I suppose. In your sleep you reach different stages in which your body functions differently and produces different chemicals and such. Being awake is the same situation in which your body is in a different physical &quot;stage&quot;, and you are no longer receiving the benefits that you would have from sleeping. You don't necessarily have to be mentally aware to be considered awake.</p>
<p>I don't know if you've ever had this experience before, but if you've ever had to wake someone up (or Vice Versa) you may have had this happen to you. Some times you can wake them up, and they will coherently respond to you and fall back  to sleep, to later have them complain that you never even tried to wake them up. They were awake, however not long enough to actually mentally recognize it.</p></div>		</li>
