			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a relatively old and simple (relatively speaking) device for achieving fusion called a Polywell.  It's not terribly dissimilar to other ion beams like CRT tube TVs.  </p>

<p>So it's not a crazy idea, and there's a lively community of amateurs that make their own Polywells.  There's lots of info about these (also search Farnsworth Fusor), as well as some who believe this design can be made into a breakeven device.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Navy is still tinkering with it with a shoestring budget, as I recall.</p></div>		</li>
