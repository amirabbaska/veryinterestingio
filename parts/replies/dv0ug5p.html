<p>Be grateful you don't have africanised bees. Those things are rutless. You get stung once, and next thing you know is that the whole hive wants to sting you too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know what you’re talking about, but every time I hear “Africanized bees” it makes me think of the Key and Peele “Black Ice” sketch. Like, “European bees mind their own business producing honey that benefits society. But those darn Africanized bees are naturally more violent. Did you know that in more than 40% of violent stingings the perpetrators were Africanized American bees? I’m not speciesist, but if I see an Africanized bee coming down the street towards me, I cross to the other side.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So here's what we've got:</p>
<p>Native American Bumblebees, that just want to go about their business and rarely sting anyone.  They used to be one of the main pollinators, but are in decline.</p>
<p>European bees, imported because they produce more honey than they can use.  They tend to be farmed, and are placed near commercial crops for pollination.  They tend to be more aggressive than bumblebees, but due to being farmed are more accustomed to humans, and can be smoked into calmness.</p>
<p>Africanized bees, a crossbreed from Brazil that has slowly made its way north.  They are highly territorial, aggressive, and will defend their own to the death. They also tend to have huge swarms.  Due to their colony structure, they can only survive in warmer climates.</p>
<p>All the other bees: a mishmash of bee species, some native to the Americas, some imported.  They don't get studied all that much.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd be interested to know which plants are solely pollinated by bumblebees though. They're the ones really at risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You provide an article that indicates <em>commercial honey bee</em> production has increased (by 3% in a one-year period ) as evidence that <em>all pollinators</em> are doing fine when that does not appear to be the case. That same article states &quot;Environmental groups have expressed alarm over the <strong>90 percent decline during the past two decades in the population of pollinators</strong>, from wild bees to Monarch butterflies.&quot;</p>
<p>So there is definitely still a problem and a 3% increase in one specific area after decades of decrease doesn't mean that the problem has been solved. Keep in mind that honey bees will generally be better off because they are domesticated and human-controlled, but all of those pollinators that are out of our control are still suffering.</p>
<p>To answer OP's question, the reason we aren't seeing shortages of produce is because farmers are taking additional measures in light of the reduction of natural pollinators. These measures include <a href="http://www.deltafarmpress.com/crops/well-traveled-honey-bees-pollinate-many-us-crops" target="_blank">hiring bee keepers to bring their bees onto a farm to pollinate</a> (makes up for a lack of local natural pollinators), or pollinating by hand, which is time-consuming and expensive (also increasingly popular in China where they use more pesticides).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, I brought the article for the graph with bee hive numbers. Hence, why I mentioned those specific numbers in my comment.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That sentence is not present in the article.</p></div>		</li>
