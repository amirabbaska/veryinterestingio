			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, this is one of those questions where the answer could just as easily be &quot;42.&quot; Quantifying &quot;well-educated&quot; is a little hard to do unless you set the parameters for your question.</p>
<p>For example, if you consider literacy vs. being illiterate a huge gap in relative education, then it would be easy to find statistics supporting an argument that &quot;no, more and more people can read so the 'well-educated' gap is closing.&quot;</p>
<p>On the other end if the spectrum, getting a grad degree or PhD is a lot easier (at least in the US) for the poor to achieve as grants and loans are readily available -- especially in the sciences -- to anyone who obtained a bachelor's. </p>
<p>Likewise, if you look at valuable tech skills, like computer programming, you don't <em>need</em> to even incur massive debt or PhDs to be more proficient than most of the population. </p>
<p>However, your question gets a lot harder to answer if you consider whether the rich and poor obtain sufficient <em>high school</em> education to break into college and beyond. On that question, I'd say <em>yes</em> -- at least in the US -- because there's a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/08/property-taxes-and-unequal-schools/497333/" target="_blank">strong correlation between the amounts of money collected by property taxes and the effectiveness of public schools.</a></p>
<p>If you grow up in a poor neighborhood, you are likely to attend a poorly funded school, which will limit your options at college... and beyond. As the wealth gap increases, so too do the communities who fund the schools. And the entire concept of &quot;feeder&quot; private schools for the ivy leagues, don't do any favors for the poor, either.</p>
<p>So, it really depends what you are looking at. Education is getting better on the whole, but the ceiling is much more obvious for poor communities (again, in the US) than for the rich, and there's nothing to suggest that's going to change any time soon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>His graph is on percentage of people receiving higher education, not net education. That indirectly shows that the lower classes are receiving more education than before, since the upper class is a small portion of the population and was already well educated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's materially irrelevant when the graph is about percentages of the overall population. 90% of people over 25 now have a basic level of educational attainment, up from 20% in the 40s. Almost 30% of people in the country have a college degree, up from 5% in the 40s. </p>
<p>What I'm saying is that those are levels of attainment that cannot be brushed off as only going to the upper classes. The upper classes simply do not make up that much of the population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno, the same is true (everyone is doing better than in the 40's) about income disparity but people brush that off all the time. </p>
<p>But I guess education has a hard cap while income seems to be unlimited. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rich get richer while the poor get poorer means that even if both groups get richer, the rich get richer significantly faster than the poor.</p>
<p>While this graph doesn't demonstrate whether the super elite are getting extremely educated, it does show that even the less educated are significantly increasing in education. To have an equivalent change in education level for the super elite academic would require something akin to multiple graduate degrees beyond just a single masters and single doctorate. It would be highly unlikely for anyone to get that kind of education except a few rare specialists like MD PhDs or JD PhDs. Maybe one in a million is getting three degrees and only fictional characters are getting 4 or more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand, global educational attainment rising overall is a quite well-known statistic, and I'm glad it's taking place. </p>
<p>As u/Morbidlyobeatz and u/frogjg2003 point out, I think the interesting question now is if the educational attainment of the under-educated is growing much slower compared to the well-educated. If that would be the case, we might end up with a significant educational divide. </p>
<p>Unless we are already experiencing one, which depends on how &quot;educational divide&quot; is defined.</p></div>		</li>
