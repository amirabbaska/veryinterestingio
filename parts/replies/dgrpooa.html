Things are stored in our brain semantically/contextually, right down to a cellular level. So events that triggered positive emotions before activate the same cellular memory networks also, playing a huge part in you feeling those emotions toward an event that resmbles the events that previously elicited positive emotions</p>
<p>Thats another reason why its environmental and physiological. Its not just because sometimes its environment and sometimes its brain. But they work in tandem. The environment triggers our physiology to produce different responses and we behave to act accordingly and deal with the situation at hand.</p>
<p>Edit: as for the dopamine and cocaine thing. Cocaine actually screws with the presynaptic neuron from reuptaking dopamine. So they just kinda sit in the synapse and can continue triggering the next neuron. The &quot;dendrites becoming exhausted&quot; thing youre referring to, that's desensitization. The recieving neuron (postsynaptic) realizesthat there's a sudden increase in the supply of dopamine so the cell actually intakes/internalizes the recpetors on its dendrites. This is called long-term depression. Its a homeostatic attempt on the postsynaptic neuron's part. This is the whole &quot;we need more cocaine to feel the same kind of high we did before&quot; thing that they always tell us in like high school health classes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This creates so many more questions for me.</p>
<p>I guess, first. This desensitization that is caused, are we talking a temporary thing or permanent. If temporarily, what kind of time frame are we talking?</p>
<p>Also, do alcohol and marijuana cause the same issues?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The technical name is receptor downregulation. Basically the receptor that receives a neurotransmitter starts to move downward because it is over-used in an attempt to maintain &quot;homeostasis&quot; or normal-ness if you will.</p>
<p>This effect is generally reversable to a large extent. However, after receptors are overstimulated for a long time they can permanently burn out and change your mood permanently as with extensive methamphetamine use. This causes what's called anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure with or without drugs/stimuli.</p>
<p>An additional effect that was not mentioned is that some drugs like cocaine and ecstasy (affects serotonin directly, dopamine less so) actually work as neurotransmitter releasing agents. This means they release many times more dopamine than is natural into the synapse all at once and that dopamine is quickly destoyed by what are called monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes. The dopamine takes days to be regenerated. This is the mechanism by which you feel terrible a few hours to a few days after using these drugs even just once. The process further contributes to the down-swing in mood.</p>
<p>The effect is not fully understood and varies between different substences.</p>
<p>I'm unsure to what extent cannabis has these effect on cannabinoid and dopamine receptors, however alcohol has a very well known downregulation effect on multiple types of receptors including NMDA and GABA (the body's &quot;calming messenger&quot;). GABA receptor downregulation is why alcoholics who quit alcohol suddenly become shaky, anxious, and may have seizures, heart attacks, etc. </p>
<p>Tl;Dr: drugs can be very bad.</p>
<p>Edit: technically cocaine isn't a releasing agent, it is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor meaning it blocks the dopamine from returning to its &quot;safe-space&quot; and thus the dopamine remains in the synapse and continues to over-stimulate the receptor until it gets destroyed by MAO. Rip. Also, apologies for any spelling mistakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol (and benzodiazapines like xanax or valium) cause down regulation of the neurotransmitter GABA. The brain produces less due to a continuous elevated supply which leads to addiction and serious withdrawal. </p>
<p>Marijuana works differently AFAIK and doesn't cause any  downregulation, hence why it's not physically addictive. I think the main difference with weed is that it doesn't directly increase the amount of any one neurotransmitter and alters the brain in a different way but hopefully someone more knowledgeable will chip in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really think there is something to that.  The idea of &quot;biorhythms&quot; is too over simplified but not totally off base.  The brain, based on everything I've read, like other biological systems is always trying to stay at a set-point of stability.  If you feel good for a while this is an unsustainable state and must eventually drop off to a more stable one.  Likewise inexplicable feelings of sadness will eventually go away, in a day or two, in most people.  Like you said, sleep seems to do a very important job of restabilizing them (neurochemistry).  I learned a long time ago that if I felt blue for no good reason that I should just get some sleep and I almost always feel much better the next day.</p>
<p>The one thing I don't understand is why defective mental states tend to err on the side of depression.  People who swing abnormally towards &quot;happy&quot; states will do so in the context of bipolar behavior.  People with chronic depression though can stay in it for weeks or longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's just easier for the brain to stay in a depressive state. When you become manic, you have to produce the neurotransmitters that are causing that state. You only have so much capacity to do this before your body can't keep up anymore and you fall out of the manic state. With depression, it's usually the lack of various neurotransmitters. It's obviously easier on the body to make less transmitters than make more, so maybe that's why depressive states tend to last longer than manic states? Just speculation on my part, some one more experienced in this field chime in maybe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first half of what you've describes is a fairly appropriate simplification of bipolar. You over produce the manic neurotransmitters and then you crash into the depressive phase. There two types of bipolar characterized by the presence of hypomania, but that's way more than for an ELI5. </p>
<p>With depression, it's the absence or decrease of dopamine. You just don't have it. You're not adding anything to create the sadness, you're experiencing a lack of something, and your brain, the dendrites are unable to reuptake the dopamine until they get longer periods of rest. In some cases your brain gets used to not producing the dopamine and is unable to reuptake completely, resulting in chronic depression, which is where medication can help the brain rebalance its production of neurotransmitters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes some people better able to handle the ebbs and flows than others? For example, when I feel like I'm down, I'm super sad, and I feel miserable. I know my wife has this sometimes also, because she is human, but she seems to deal with it so much better than I do. She can usually help snap me out of it, but it is a huge chore for her, and I feel guilty because that is like me making her responsible for my shitty mood.</p></div>		</li>
