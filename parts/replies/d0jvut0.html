			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right, with one key symmetry restriction: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole#Gravitational_quadrupole" target="_blank">mass quadrupole moment</a> of the object has to change as it is spinning. For example, a perfectly spherical (and uniform) ball would not emit gravitational waves as it was spinning, but an oblate spheroid (like the Earth) could.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if you don't simplify the object to a continuous mass but see that atoms are a field of point like masses, it should still emit gravitational waves based on the discrete nature correct?</p>
<p>Or are these waves below some energy quantization threshold?</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, in fact this is the exact reason I had to use <em>could</em> rather than <em>would</em> in the last sentence! To take your example, a uniform disk spinning about its geometric axis would not emit gravitational waves, but it would if it was tumbling about the other two axes or any axis in-between.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would emitting gravity waves slow the spin in some way? I would think that disturbing a field in such a way that it is detectable implies an expenditure of energy, thus slowing the spin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it would, but only because it is interacting with all massive bodies from afar, just like anything else. Now, gravitational force is the weakest of all and this effect would be neglectable in pretty much all real life scenarios scenarios (because for it to be noticeable it would have to be very massive and, if it was that massive it would most probably be pretty spherical)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The gravitational waves themselves carry energy, and it would slow even if there was nothing else in the universe. Sort of like how a magnet slows even if it's not interacting with magnetic stuff from afar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, two guys won a nobel prize for finding a binary pulsar and one of the experiments was calculating the period decrease due to orbital decay from loss to gravitational waves over time.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulse%E2%80%93Taylor_binary" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulse%E2%80%93Taylor_binary</a></p>
<p>They drew the line in the 70s based on math and all the data points collected over the years fit the line.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulse%E2%80%93Taylor_binary#/media/File:PSR_B1913%2B16_period_shift_graph.svg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulse%E2%80%93Taylor_binary#/media/File:PSR_B1913%2B16_period_shift_graph.svg</a></p>
<p>I believe their work was one of the things that helped justify the LIGO experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fantastic and fascinating.  So the only way for an object to spin perpetually in empty space is to basically be a sphere, or at least symmetrical along the axis of rotation like a toy top.</p></div>		</li>
