<p>Fixed that for you. Because of it's extremely long half life, the decay of U-238 or U-235 is the &quot;rate limiting step.&quot;  So, the decay rate of each step in the decay series tends to be very nearly equal to the decay rate of the parent uranium. But since most of the decay products have far shorter half lives, only tiny amounts are present given the same rate of decay.</p>

<p>This is, sort of true, purified uranium emits significantly less gamma than natural uranium minerals. The majority of the gamma rays given off by uranium minerals comes from the minor product Tl-206. But most steps in the decay series produce subsequent gammas certain small. percentages of the time</p>
<p>Moreover U-238 and 235 alpha decays do occasionally result in subsequent gamma emissions. Furthermore even purified uranium will contain the (relatively) short lived isotope U-234 which produces significant gamma emissions following it's decay. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not important. While the amounts of the daughter products is small by mass, the amounts are determined by equilibrium in the various decays rates. (Yes, U-234 is another relatively long half life and physical processes can separate and disturb this equilibrium, making the ratio of 234 to 238 important for &quot;age&quot; of soils) In other words, the number of disintegrations per second is constant. For U-238, that's about 300k disintegrations per second per mol of U-238.  Now the U-238 decay is about 4 MeV while the total radio chain is 50 MeV.  The uranium decay is less than 10% of the total decay energy. </p>
<p>In other words, more than 90% of radioactivity comes from something other than the uranium.  Then even that u238 decay is alpha, so it would never reach the photo plate since it was wrapped in paper.  So,</p>
