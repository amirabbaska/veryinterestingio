			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not the distance that's the problem. It is the fact that the sound has to be relayed by one of the headphones due to a limitation in the Bluetooth protocol.</p>
<p>Otherwise we would have the same problem by using different lengths for speaker or headphone cables, which is a non issue. The time difference is just to small to matter. (A 10 cm difference between right and left headphone would lead to a 3.33*10^-10 s delay between channels). EM-waves are crazy fast. </p>
<p>The issue is bandwidth and power. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The position of the phone  is irrelevant.   The signal travels with the speed of light.  Way faster than sound waves.<br />
The problem lies within Bluetooth : it can only connect to one speaker.   This speaker has to relay the information to the other speaker </p></div>		</li>
