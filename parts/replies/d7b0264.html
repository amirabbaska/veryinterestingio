<p>3.4 micrograms. Math checks out. It's common in motorsports to run just enough gas to finish the race for weight advantages. Somehow I don't think this will translate into electric car racing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;little mass&quot; is a bit misleading as the amount of atoms in something is actually gigantic. </p>
<p>For instance a single carbon atom converted to energy is only 1.7925Ã—10^-9 Joules.</p>
<p>You need a lot of atoms to make a lot of energy, it just so happens that we have A LOT of atoms to work with.</p></div>		</li>
