			<div class="markdown"><p>I see! I remember when I was younger, I used to purposefully download songs with censored swear words because I was uncomfortable with them. But now, bring it on. I mean, you can't find metal songs without profanity hahaha. So I got used to it, and now I swear a lot when I'm amongst friends. </p>
<p>Edit: okay yes, I can find metal without profanity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, he's partially right. I mean the fucking think about it is, I can use any damn word I please and not be aggressive. For an example. I mean, shhhit, man. Swearwords are placeholders that convey syntactical complex details. And also interjections. Hearing someone shout &quot;Fuck!&quot; Is associated with something bad. Why kids shouldn't say them. Well. Every language has these words, could be a sort of Voldemort he who shouldn't be named situation. Like saying god or god damn is technically blasphemy, so a lot of it is cultural, and parents don't want their kids being excommunicated. Parents scold their kids for not talking proper. Proper in America is a highly race influenced thing. Honestly, a lot of the taboo comes from racism. Black kids say shhiiiit, white kids who aren't racist (usually) copy African American vernacular English, and then there's the n word dichotomy. Both prohibited and acceptable in different African houses. And socially acceptable by both white and black kids depending on friend group. So, to answer your question, you have to delve deep into old world culture. From America to England to France to Germany to Italy, to North Africa, Egypt, Palestine, Greece kind of maintained its own stuff for being right next to the Roman Empire. If you wanna get deeper than Roman influence. Then you're talking about Latina versus etruscans and then the cultural travel beyond that is barely known by science. One other taboo is the evil eye. I did some research and found it to have a distribution or coincidental presence in almost every country, and it likely predates language imo so there are also taboo actions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do like this theory but I'm wondering if we see them as a profanity purely because of our mums and dads smacking us on the butt when we said shit for the first time......</p>
<p>I feel like the adults make it taboo for the new generations.</p>
<p>Surely if a kid heard the word 'Shit' for the first time, then they ask their mum 'what does shit mean!?' </p>
<p>And the mum just says 'oh that's just a slang word for poop, it also means frustration and it can also be a reaction to either a pleasant surprise or a nasty surprise'</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure the kid won't be offended by the word shit.</p></div>		</li>
