			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI, the sexual tension may not be related to testosterone: when they ended up studying the psychological response to testosterone they found it increased cooperation and satisfaction in interpersonal relationships and a bunch of other counterintuitive stuff.  </p>
<p>While it's an important androgen, there's a lot more that have been found that actually do cause &quot;roid rage&quot; that have long names I can't remember. And they still might not be the culprit to a lot of the psychological response, and it all could be caused by androgen withdrawal.</p>
<p>Will update this post after breakfast if I can find what I was reading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Potentially. You can't pinpoint an emotion to one particular hormone. Of course that is simplistic as we are complex organisms and there is a complex interplay of hormone balances, peaks and troughs which mediate our emotions. Testosterone most likely is involved in sexual arousal and tension, I have yet to see any evidence that suggests otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're thinking of trenbolone, maybe halotestin. They don't cause roid rage per se, but are well known to increase aggression (which is good in the gym but not good if you're a jackass who can't control his temper at home). There are others that have similar effects, but those are likely what you're thinking of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honest question.</p>
<p>I've heard hugging people makes us release oxytocine.</p>
<p>If I hug someone who is in labour and who loves me very much, I can provoke a uterine contraction?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Similar to the way having sex releases hormones that can speed up labour. I'm not sure a hug would have as much as an effect as intercourse but it's possible it could cause a contraction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of research that shows no increase in testosterone when one abstains from sex and masturbation for a period of time (which rises sexual tension A LOT), then how can you conclude that testosterone is the cause of sexual tension when having or not having sex and masturbating has almost no influence on testosterone levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's a fair point. Oxytocin and prolactin just after orgasm (in men. not sure about women) makes sense, but yeah testosterone doesn't build up over time spend not having sex.</p>
<p>Although there was a study that found a spike one week after abstinence begins, leading to the great 1 week Reddit nofap of 2013</p></div>		</li>
