			<div class="markdown"><p>But the germ cell DNA is derived from the somatic cell DNA. I don't mean to argue that there is a correlation, but I don't see how this implies a lack of one.</p>
<p>Edit: oh, unless it's about individual sperms' abilities to swim relative to each other and not about the sperms altogether swimming well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the somatic DNA has an effect on the motility of sperm. But i think the point is in individual sperm cells how the dna they receive during spermatogenesis might change their fitness</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>my argument was, that the definite 23 one chromatic chromosome information of the definite sperm has no correlation to the mobility or structure.<br />
Somatic and Germ are connected, totally true. The differentiation takes place in about the 3rd week of pregnancy. from then on the DNA in the sperm is not touched by the body and it becomes a germ cell.</p>
<p>but in the instance of spermatogenisis the germ cell DNA is not taken into account. You could have the code for chocolate cookie cake in an sperm (or the Stemcell for Sperm production the Spermatogonia) and the body would still pack you with some acrosome, mitochondria and a tail. Why? because the packaging of the Germcell DNA is not correlated to its own inhereted information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is transcription happening in sperm cells but to what extent they may interfere with their motility is still disputed. So the DNA might in fact have an influence on the 'fitness' of a sperm cell.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not too related with the thread but how does ejaculation affect DNA structure/sperm quality/mobility of sperms? The new ones your body makes would have somewhat different DNA structure than the one you ejaculated? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a process called &quot;Capacitation&quot; where the female genital produces a signal which is needed for the sperm to penetrated the zona pelicula (the outter shell of the oocyte).<br />
Lab test have shown, that if you only put oocyte and sperm together no fertilization can take place. If you add in contrast the substance (sorry forgot the name) from the female genital tract, the zona pelicula becomes penetratable for the sperm.<br />
The sperm in the end is not flat. it is covered in hundres of little enzymes, so these need proper adjustment for further penetrations.</p></div>		</li>
