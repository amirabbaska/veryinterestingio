			<div class="markdown"><p>Really, it's surprising how unorganized terrorist cells are. It wouldn't be difficult to organize shit in a way that doesn't cause early undue attention or leave much of a trail, if one at all, if you really wanted to.</p>
<p>You know how easy it would be to go solo and blow up a train or a bus? It would be just as easy to attack a community center in an area with a large concentration of people or to drop explosives in a large railcenter/subway. I'm not complaining, but terrorists are stupid as hell and extremely inefficient at that whole terror thing they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're assuming that they don't want attention. Terrorists also have different objectives and at the moment ISIS is not that interested in carrying out bombings or attacks on foreign soil.</p>
<p>I also think you're oversimplifying things, performing an attack is the least complicated thing, planning and getting the raw materials required without suspicion is a bigger challenge.</p></div>		</li>
