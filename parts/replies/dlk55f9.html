<p>I disagree with this.  Some animals are hard to find.  If you can consistently find a certain species, you can keep up with it faster than it evolves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't mean that it's impossible to keep track of, say, a family of rats in a lab.</p>
<p>I mean that across the globe, life continues to evolve in dark corners hidden from human observation. Even if we took a snapshot of Earth as it is and froze it in time, it would take us several lifetimes -- or eternities -- to examine every minor insect, arthropod, fungus, bacterium, insect, etc., to say nothing of the seas.</p>
<p>This is not meant to be a disparaging comment against biologists working too slowly. It's an observation that speciation is so far an after-the-fact, descriptive cataloguing effort, not an attempt at predictively and preemptively projecting potential DNA changes over time in order to flesh out a potential tree of life prior to encountering individuals in the wild. We're always playing catchup because we're limited by our methodology: observe and compare, versus, say, simulated speciation via random permutations. </p>
<p>To use a flawed analogy, consider colors: There is a limited subset of named colors, varying by culture -- for example, most cultures have words for white, black, and red, with green and yellow and then blue coming after that (or something to that effect). This is the observe-and-compare approach that we currently have with speciation. Then advancements in physics and electronics have allowed us to better understand color reproduction, and in a few decades we were able to move towards electronic displays of 16, 256, and eventually 16.7 million individually distinguishable colors that are described using their component levels of red, green, and blue primary colors. That's just an subset of the actual spectrum, though, which itself has both useful names based on its relevance and usefulness to the human experience (visual, infrared, x-ray), etc. vs arbitrary wavelengths and frequencies.</p>
<p>What I'm arguing is that genetics (at least my layman's understanding of them) are subject to a similar &quot;continuum&quot; (or rather, maybe more like a web) of potential species, only some of which are viable in the real world, fewer of which would ever be birthed, fewer of which would live past gestation, fewer of which would survive more than a few hours, fewer of which would occur near human habitation, fewer of which would ever be seen by a human, fewer of which would by chance happen upon a scientist, fewer of which would be encountered by the right kind of scientist who's able to properly prioritize and distinguish that particular lifeform from another using an old, incomplete dichotomous key.</p>
<p>That's not to say the Linnean taxonomy is useless, just that it's incomplete -- and necessarily so -- because its intended methodology is a &quot;work backwards from what you see&quot; approach, whereas now we have the capacity to measure differences between any two organisms in a fundamentally different, more quantifiable, way -- though arguably less useful in everyday contexts. At some point it's simply far more useful to call a cat a cat and a dog a dog, rather than tagging them based on DNA.</p></div>		</li>
