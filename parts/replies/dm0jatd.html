			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but muscles pull at the tendons which then pull at the bones and also the forces between bones leave tell-tale signs of ligament stress. These tell-tale signs come in the form of a pit or bony protuberance (tuberosity). Using information about estimated mass of the organism and comparitive anatomy, a relatively accurate musculoskeletal model can be made. </p>
<p>Cartilage does not leave impressions between joints, but typically covers the rounded portions of joints to cut down on friction. Blood vessels in dinosaur joints leave impressions in the bone and suggest the size of the cartilage it fed based on the extent of the network. Humans don't have the same blood supply to our cartilaginous zones, so the cartilage will not grow back. </p>
<p>At least this is what I believe happens, in conjunction with this article: <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/09/100930171418.htm" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/09/100930171418.htm</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can look at modern day birds to get a good idea about what they may have looked like, since they are very closely related. Since birds don't have cartilaginous ears or noses, we can probably assume dinosaurs didn't either.</p></div>		</li>
