			<div class="markdown"><p>So, just to clarify, they drill a hole perpendicular to the bone?  After that I'm sorta lost.  Can you please explain it like I'm five?  I don't really understand all the medical terms that people are using like reaming and supracondylar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they drill down the length of the bone. To &quot;ream&quot;  is to clear a hole. Similar to reaming a gun barrel. They don't ream it bigger than the width of the rod. The rod is then driven (read: hammered) into the length of the one while they are aligning the two lengths of broken bone together. </p>
<p>I know this because of the nail in my tibia and the procedure being described to me after it was done. </p>
<p>Edit: also forgot, they hold it more tightly in place with self tapping screws. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So they drill a hole in one end of the bone and put/hammer the rod in through there and it slides up the full length of the bone?  If that's the case, then do they drill the hole at the knee end of the bone?</p></div>		</li>
