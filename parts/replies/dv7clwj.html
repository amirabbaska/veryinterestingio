			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. </p>
<p>To clarify this, this applies to drugs that exist as <em>prodrugs</em>, that is, drugs that have to be metabolised in the body to become pharmacologically active. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify even further, drinking grapefruit juice before taking a prodrug that requires CYP3A4 to become metabolically active will actually lower the effects of the drug since CYP3A4 is inhibited and cannot convert the inactive prodrug into the active metabolite. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Since we can suppose that the active drug and prodrug mostly share the same way thus enzymes of metabolism it will result in lower levels of active drug. I mean it wonâ€™t matter to the enzymes what form of the drug they are metabolizing, they just do it in their time and kinetic. </p>
<p>Still one has to compare chemical/physical properties of the prodrug vs active drug in terms of distribution in the body etc.. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slow release mechanism tablets (or modified release tablets) are mostly governed by gastric emptying times and pH. Enzymes may play a role but not really a big factor in tablet disintegration and dissolution mechanics.</p></div>		</li>
