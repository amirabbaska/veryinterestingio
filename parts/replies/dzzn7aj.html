			<div class="markdown"><p>But...if you were to look at the world, say, 2000 years ago, you'd find much more development in warm areas.</p>
<p>Also, many early civilizations in warm areas had to do significant planning to manage water resources.  You had in Egypt, for example, management of crops and irrigation ditches to take advantage of the Nile flooding.  And infrastructure in warmer regions was often greater than that in colder regions: for example the Roman road network around the mild climate of the Mediterranean exceeded infrastructure produced by northern European tribes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point, but a few things to consider:</p>
<p>1) the Northern European tribes were newcomers onto the scene. Many were nomadic tribes that had arrived to that area as Rome was being built or already built</p>
<p>2) the Mediterranean climate is mild, but its still not the tropics. They wouldn't have had to deal with one of the biggest restrictive factories: tropical diseases.</p>
<p>3) The northern and even central parts of Italy are still multi-seasonal. Meaning that there was not year-round food growth in places like modern Tuscany up to modern Piedmont. They still experienced a dormant season and would have had to plan accordingly. </p>
<p>But these are minor factors. This is likely the cause:</p>
<p>Warmer climates, with their year-round food growth, made the existence of monolithic empires possible. To have a great population, one must be able to feed a great population. The northern climates prohibited this kind of empire building. Smaller, fragmented, tribal units became more commonplace. After the fall of Rome, Europe never really saw a truly unifying empirical force. The Holy Roman Empire, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and Napoleon's France were all close, but not quite up to the level of what the Aztecs, Muslims, Ottomans, or Mongols, or Chinese had in terms of land and populations. </p>
<p>Because the peoples in northern climates were clustered in relatively smaller states, there was more regional infighting. The Muslim empires spent more time conquering outsiders in far off lands, whilst Europeans spent time fighting each other. It was an offensive vs. Defensive dichotomy. For small nations - which were often surrounded on all sides by potential enemies and invaders - to survive, they had to innovate. </p>
<p>Empires tend to eventually stagnate. Get complacent. Which is evidenced in the fact that most empires collapse internally before ever being conquered by external forces. Rome, Byzantium, many Muslim empires - they all eroded from within before any adversary conquered them at their peek of power. So while the world's great warm-weather empires collapsed because of rot and complacency, the smaller European nations were in a constant struggle of survival. There was no time to rest on one's laurels. Innovation was necessary to survive. And competition was high. Your neighbors were always advancing in military strategy, weaponry, technology, science, medicine, etc. This eventually led to many of the world's great discoveries and advancements, and explains why relatively small, backwater, cold-climate nations and peoples in Europe were able to eventually dominate much of the world. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you don't even have to go back that far, the theory is obviously wrong</p>
<p>rome is in a warm climate, so are greece, china and japan, the ottoman empire, india, mesoamerica are all in warm climates</p>
<p>the entire premise is wrong: there are very few cultures that developed at high latitudes. europe was born around the mediterranean sea and that's pretty warm and then spread around, northern europe was the backwater one for most of history </p>
<p>the idea that warm climates don't require infrastructure is ridicolous: you still have to save up food for floods and droughts and wars</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Calling it the hot vs cold theory was incorrect, but he's not entirely wrong. Rather than look at temperature, one should look for the presence of climatic seasons, or similar cyclic phenomenon. It's also not really about infrastructure, but the need to plan ahead and adapt to the environment.</p>
<p>For egypt, their &quot;seasons&quot; would be the state of the Nile river. In Asia it would be about rain-periods. In northern Europe it's winter.</p>
<p>There are regions where no significant cyclic &quot;seasons&quot; exist, like large parts of Africa where there's hunting all year round, and there are no clearly defined rain-periods like in Asia. The theory suggests that this results in a lot less (if any at all) need to adapt to the environment. And that a need to adapt to cyclic change promote a certain mindset centered around long-term planning.</p>
<p>Whether or not the theory is correct I'm gonna leave unsaid, but it's not as unlikely as it first sounded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure where you’re getting Japan as a warm climate from. It has a temperate climate similar to North America. Extreme south portions, such as Okinawa, are semi tropical. That being said, Okinawa was not part of Japan until recently. The Mediterranean is also not tropical. It’s still experience seasons and more importantly, food growing periods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the definition of a 'just-so' story. Vitruvius Pollio, a Roman engineer and an inspiration for Leonardo da Vinci, had the exact opposite take, which made sense from his vantage point in the first century BCE:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Further, it is owing to the rarity of the atmosphere that southern nations, with their keen intelligence due to the heat, are very free and swift in the devising of schemes, while northern nations, being enveloped in a dense atmosphere, and chilled by moisture from the obstructing air, have but a sluggish intelligence. That this is so, we may see from the case of snakes. Their movements are most active in hot weather, when they have got rid of the chill due to moisture, whereas at the winter solstice, and in winter weather, they are chilled by the change of temperature, and rendered torpid and motionless. It is therefore no wonder that man's intelligence is made keener by warm air and duller by cold.</p>
