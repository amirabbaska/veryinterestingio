			<div class="markdown"><p>The question is what would they annihilate into? Photons are massless and so they need to be at fairly high energy to actually produce a massive particle like an electron. But this can happen, though I believe it's not through any direct photon-photon-matter-matter type of coupling.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Nothing special: it's some sort of reaction. One example would be the inverse beta decay:
Proton+antielectron neutrino -&gt; neutron + positron (=antielectron)
This particular reaction can be used to detect antineutrinos, as the positrons and electrons of surrounding matter will annihilate and create a pair of coincident photons that can be detected</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's got to do with the form of a coupling I think. Let me restrict the thinking to just &quot;direct&quot; annihilation where there's a term in our theory that explicitly allows it to happen.</p>
<p>Terms that make a particle, say an electron field I'll represent as e, interact with a photon for example, have a form like (e+ A e) where these three things are being multiplied and A represents the photon. The e+ is not necessarily a positron but more generally is a kind of conjugate of the electron e (I'm just putting together some notation for convenience). How we interpret this is dependent on some specifics of a scenario. e+ can represent an electron coming into a point and A and e can represent am electron and photon coming out of the same point. Hence this represents an electron just radiating a photon as in this picture here <a href="https://www.quantumdiaries.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/qed_eGammaVertex1.png" target="_blank">https://www.quantumdiaries.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/qed_eGammaVertex1.png</a></p>
<p>But the thing about Feynman diagrams is that the time and space axes in the bottom corner of the picture can be switched to give a new interpretation of the term. If we do this and make time go downward in that picture, the way we interpret e+ now is as an antiparticle; it looks like an electron going &quot;the wrong way&quot; according to our notation. This now is an electron and positron combining to give a photon -- annihilation! So in this case the annihilation is just a consequence of the fact that electrons and positrons are able to produce photons, since the form of the term that allows this is not sensitive to how we set our space and time axis as long as we interpret things correctly.</p>
<p>While I may have skirted all the details of such a calculation in part due to the limitations of writing on mobile, I believe the schematics of this are correct.</p></div>		</li>
