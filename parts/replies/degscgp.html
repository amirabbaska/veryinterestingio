			<div class="markdown"><p>personal experience only, but a long bout of sleeplessness does make me kinda crazy. memory problems, like forgetting what happened today, and the utterly weird &quot;time fugue&quot; - memories becoming &quot;reality&quot;, but all distorted and disjointed. time shrinks and expands in strange ways. kids, don't do insomnia. drugs are more fun, and probably less dangerous.  </p></div>		</li>
