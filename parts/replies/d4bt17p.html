			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, the bribery part is pretty stunning. There's no other word for it. Scent profiles are checked by guards when foragers return. This is the actual passage of food.</p>
<p>I found one of my girls on the ground the other day just short of a hive, looking a little lost and tired - she was barely able to hold onto a piece of grass. I picked her up (bees will almost instinctively hop onto your finger if given the chance) and put her at the front door of the nearby hive.</p>
<p>A guard bee scrambled over to her within one second. I thought I was going to watch the guard wrestle her to the ground. I've seen this happen before many times. Often it happens when a drone tries to get back into the hive after getting the boot, which happens during times of low resources. Bees are brutal and will put other bees outside to die if they decide it's necessary.</p>
<p>Instead, lo and behold, that sluggish, battered worker stuck out her probiscis and passed something to the guard. Guard walked off as fast as she'd approached. The bee I saved then sort of slumped inside the hive. Hard (impossible) to say if she was an outsider trying to get in or a forager returning, but she definitely fed a guard and I watched it happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome story! It's hard to imagine bees in a context without worrying about being stung, so its very interesting to hear about.</p>
<p>I especially wonder why they hop onto fingers, and would like to know how you &quot;put it down&quot; if it was clinging to you at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A robbing situation is also pretty interesting to watch. The robbing bees will attempt a fast entry into the hive, often intercepted on the way in by a guard bee. When there is full blown robbing going on, you'll see pairs or triples of bees grappled onto each other struggling and rolling around like gang members in fight. Additional robbers can be seen streaking into the hive entrance, not bothering to land, but instead flying in and penetrating the crowd inside. It is for this reason, during robbing season people tend to put gates on their hives. Bees cant flight straight in or out. They have to go through a narrow gap or make a couple 90 degree turns. This prevents the &quot;fly right in scenario&quot;, forcing them to crawl up and allowing guards time to respond. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's impressive. It's nice to sometimes sit back and look at the little thinks in life that we miss. In the case of bees, it's actually hard to realise that they have an extensive social order or hierarchy in place. We miss so much! Love to read about it all. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Do they have little drawbridges and portcullis?  Because that would be adorable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So just like how at vehicle checkpoints they will put barricades and make cars zig-zag through so they cannot speed through the checkpoint. </p>
<p>And BEES of all things are using the same method.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The coolest fact I remember learning about bees is that they have some who, on hot days, will stand at the entrance and flap their wings to help regulate the temperature and humidity in the hive to produce honey quicker. Also they will face the other direction and do this to help other bees find the hive in case they are lost by releasing a scent/pheromone.</p>
<p>In short, bees are pretty awesome and so complex in their organization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is askscience but this is a literal thread killer.  So expansive yet specific, in easy to digest terms, I'm really impressed.  I sub to askscience for the learning, I rarely have something to add.  </p>
<p>This is everything people like me want in an answer.  Real science presented in a way that a laymen can get it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm writing a fiction book involving beekeeping at the moment, so it's on my mind.</p></div>		</li>
