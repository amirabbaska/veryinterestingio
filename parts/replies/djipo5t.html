			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate when my cookies go skiing. So gross! </p>
<p>But honestly most processed foods contain super disgusting sounding ingredients. Those ingredients are actually not terrible for you but the rest of the food being super unhealthy for you as they tend to cover up their preservation chemicals with an over abundance of good tasting but also fattening ingredients. Hence the obesity epidemic.        </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem lies in the thinking that processed foods are meant to be healthy for you.  They never were, certainly not baked goods.  </p>
<p>It's not the preservation chemicals or the color additives, it's the abundance they are consumed.  You can eat one processed, prepackaged item a week, and you'll be fine.  Even per day, and you'll probably be OK if you get around a lot.  It's when people become sedentary in their lifestyle, and they begin consuming these prepacked goods more often than the good stuff like fruits and veg.  </p></div>		</li>
