			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this apply in a global economy? Why wouldn't increasing the supply of gold not simply decrease the value of all gold as a commodity globally? If anything when Germany lost it's gold while on the gold standard it led to financial disaster in the interwar period. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand abandoning the gold standard was becoming necessary for modern economies at this point and the financial situation in interwar Germany was more down to resistance to the Ruhr occupation and the government's printing of money to pay the striking workers in the Ruhr causing hyperinflation (obviously this is grossly oversimplified and could be wrong - just what I remember).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would, but in this case, Spain was most likely not sharing or selling the Silver with anyone else, they were minting coins (these coins are the famous piratey &quot;pieces of eight&quot;, fun fact) and/or using it as currency in a more direct fashion, creating sort of a more localized effect.</p>
<p>Economies were way less global in those times in general, due to mercantilism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course in this case (and with Musa) they were importing their own currency.  If I get money from Japan, I'm getting Yen, not dollars.  But the spanish dollar was actually <em>made</em> of silver.  By importing silver (really much more silver than gold) and minting it into coin they were directly increasing their own money supply.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, although in those days it would be fairly accurate to say that any money or prexipus metals in the country would be the countries money since it was all relatively interchangable even if there were exchange rates due to differing weights and purities.</p>
<p>I guess the fundamental difference is that a second countries money is still backed by that other country so wouldnt have the same pressure to collapse a countries currency in relation to external countries even if it could still cause internal issues in significant amounts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During WWII, Germany forged thousands of English bank notes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Bernhard" target="_blank">Operation Bernhard</a>, originally in an attempt to ruin the English economy. They used Jewish printers and engravers from concentration camps and the notes were so good, Britain had to redesign some notes. The printers did, however, introduce some special features so that they could help the allies identify the counterfeits.</p>

<p>It's amazing how good some of the German counterfeit notes were, especially since they were arguably made under harsh wartime conditions by not-professional counterfeiters and using a different supply of linen/paper. </p>
<p>For example, on this counterfeit Ten Pound note you can see the same unique texture of the embedded hairs as in an authentic British note (which were made using linen from specialized Scottish yarn very unique to the British Isles):</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The value of a currency unit is based on countless interactions between countless individual market actors. A quantifiable total of money doesn’t really affect some dude’s decision to convert 10 hours of labor into a trampoline. The currency is just a portable and storable method of trampolines (or substitute any other good or service). </p>
<p>Now to make it even crazier, physical currency in the US is a small fraction of the money that exists. New currency is mostly created by banks loaning money to individuals and banks who then loan out money to other individuals and banks. The Federal Reserve regulates this system, and it honestly blows my mind. </p></div>		</li>

<p>They don't even regulate that system, they regulate the interest rates banks charge each other and it all cascades from there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless they never use it, it should have the same effect - since there's more money going around, it becomes easier to get, which makes it less valuable/easier for businesses to charge higher prices and still get paid, which results in inflation.</p>
<p>Basically, if more of any item becomes available, it loses value, as it is now easier to get. Money isn't an exception to this rule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would become obvious fairly quickly, and it's not like nations would accept abnormally large appearances/purchases from smaller countries that might try this. Most countries publish currency reserves as well, so they keep track of these things. And as soon as the country was caught it would lead to international condemnation, tanking of credit rating, actions by if not suspension from IMF programs, etc. etc. etc.</p></div>		</li>
