			<div class="markdown"><p>The labor participation rate fell by about 7 points from 2008-2016, and has since stabilized at 62.8% +/- 0.2%.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why the labor force participation rate hasn't recovered.  The biggest is that folks over about 55 probably had very poor prospects in getting a new job after multiple years of unemployment.  (Especially since unemployment insurance was extended to a very long duration during the peak of the crisis -- which carried many folks along until Social Security age, at which point jumping back in the labor pool probably felt pointless)</p>
<p>Another reason was actually the big push to bring people from different economic and ethnic backgrounds into college (thereby delaying their entry into the labor force).  That isn't a new trend, but it grew significantly during the Obama administration, which coincides with the labor participation rate falling.</p>
<p>There was also a significant expansion of welfare programs after the crisis, which may have caused some who were living on a part-time minimum-wage paycheck to choose to stop working.</p></div>		</li>
