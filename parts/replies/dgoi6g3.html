			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of points add up to an answer.  The moon has been there a really long time, about as long as Earth.  There are lots of small objects around that are still big enough to make a crater on the moon and there were WAY more billions of years ago.  It's true that it's much more likely for them to blow up in our atmosphere than blow up on the moon in the same way that it's more likely to lose the lottery than win, but if you try thousands or millions of times a year for billions of years, you're going to get a lot of lucky shots!</p>
<p>Also, I'm not sure if it's important (not an expert) but the moon wasn't always locked to us.  When baby pre-Earth smashed into big thing and made actual Earth and actual moon, we were both spinning fast.  Earth and moon started slowing each other's spins (because reasons to do with gravity) ever since.  Because Earth is big, we slowed moon's spin to zero compared to us pretty quickly, but it was still a fair amount of time for all sides of the moon to 'see' the rest of the sky and take some hits </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what /u/BraveHQ said, the earth isn't really shielding the moon.</p>
<p>Part of this is the misconception of the sizes of the earth/moon and their distance between eachother.</p>
<p>Take this picture which shows their sizes/distances proportionally:</p>

<p>Now imagine the infinite variety of lines that can hit the moon on the half that is facing the earth while still being plenty away from the earth, and you can see it isn't much of a shield.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the dark spots on the moon facing us are called Maria (singular: mare). These are volcanic in nature. </p>
<p>There are some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon#/media/File:Moon_names.svg" target="_blank">craters</a> we can see by eye. From the Moon's perspective the Earth blocks around 2% of the sky. To see this: extend your fist all the way out, with your thumb up. Your thumbnail blocks 2%. Look around, see how much your thumbnail doesn't block.</p></div>		</li>
