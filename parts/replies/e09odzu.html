			<div class="markdown"><p>The first chain of answers is also horrible incorrect. High pressure and low pressure can refer to two related but different things. First is elevation, the higher your elevation the less air there is above you so the pressure is less so water boils at a lower temperature at higher altitudes. The second is that meteorological pressure refers to the water content in the atmosphere. Nitrogen (N2) has a molecular mass of 28 g/mol while water has a molecular mass of 18 g/mol. So when humidity is high, the column of air above you weighs less as well.</p></div>		</li>
