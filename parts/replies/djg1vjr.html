<p>On the side note, seasoned military personnels are able to stand at ease for long periods of time because they are actually swaying back and forth very slowly in micro-movements to contract their muscles and relieve the tingling and numb sensation you get when you keep standing for long periods of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also one of the things they drill into your head is to not lock your knees while standing at attention, a habit for some that is pretty hard to break, which inevitably leads to fainting when they forget and lock their knees anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They made fun of the guy that locked his knees and fainted during a band picture day in high school for  years after. They tell you over and over not to lock knees, during the process. But it didn't occur to him that was what he was doing. The picture actually captures the moment before he passed out and he was stark white, it looked like someone did a bad photo shop. :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happened to me too my freshman year of HS.
Stupid band directors had us standing at attention in full NM summer wearing out wool uniforms. </p>
<p>I remember trying to flex my legs without breaking the crease in my pants, then a swirl of colors and I woke up needing to pee REALLY bad and was annoyed that my IV stand wouldn't go thru the bathroom door.</p>
<p>I fell face-first onto concrete, split my chin open, got s concussion and burst all the blood vessels I my left eye. </p>
<p>Stayed in the hospital for three days while they checked a small blood clot in my brain, then started HS with 4 stitches in my chin and a blood-red evil eye. </p>
<p>THANKS Mr. Henry and Mr. Dennis!</p></div>		</li>

<p>You really don't want to do it with a drum or a sousaphone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw two guys fall out 4 days ago. They were standing at rest for a while. First guy was so knocked out he needed a stretcher. Second guy, to his credit, passed out, got back up, and then promptly fell down again. Heat and humidity don't help. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was the ring bearer at my uncle's wedding when I was about twelve. I remember my dad telling me to not lock my knees, and my reaction was to think, &quot;wtf dad what do you know?&quot; Needless to say, I was confused when I started seeing spots in my vision, heard a ringing in my ears, and then waking up to my grandpa splashing water in my face in the bathroom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Toe wiggling, shifting weight slightly to heels or ball of the feet, shifting from side to side imperceptivity... all good techniques to stand in one place for long periods of time without appearing to move. Most importantly is the tried and true method of not locking your knees, which also allows you to sort of microsquat if that makes sense. That and self-loathing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it might be important to differentiate between at ease and at attention. At ease has a lot more leeway with what you can do. It's position with feet shoulder width apart and hands behind back. And it's infinitely more pleasant than attention. The position of attention is the one I think you're talking about the micro movements in. It's all about micro movements not locking your knees or you'll pass out.</p>
<p>Source: hours wasted at position of attention for dumb formations and awards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually they don't keep you locked at attention for too long... unless someone has fucked up. Brief periods of attention followed by parade or at ease, then some more attention. But even at attention the toe wiggle keeps the blood flowing. </p></div>		</li>
