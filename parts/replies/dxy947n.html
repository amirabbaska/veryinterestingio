			<div class="markdown"><p>Shaking off that feeling of having a foggy brain is going to be weeks rather than days. But it doesn't really work like I suspect you are imagining. There isn't really a way to catch-up. When you sleep the different phases do different things for your cognitive ability and emotional state. </p>
<p>Think of it like this: solving a problem whilst sleep deprived will be harder, as will maintaining knowledge retention. Come back to the same problem when not sleep deprived and it will be easier solve and easier to remember. but the key thing is you will have to address the problem again, the results of the last attempt will not just improve because you slept well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I gotcha. I definitely am sleep deprived due to not enough hours in the day.  I've slowly noticed over the past year my memory isn't as sharp, and I think not  getting as much sleep as I could in college is the primary reason. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about people who break up their sleep into 2 or 3 shorter chunks instead of one long chunk? I thought the brain can 'learn' that it needs to initiate REM sooner to get enough out of these shorter cycles? The caveat being that it needs to be on a routine with the same timing and duration for several weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a fascinating section on this in Matthew Walker's book. I would hate to paraphrase him incorrectly, but basically there is a rhythm to your sleep phases and when your body wants them to occur. You can't initiate them in the way you suggest. So for example, over an eight hour cycle those phases will want to occur at specific times for particular individual. If you are not asleep when you body wants those phases they do not adjust to some sort of offset -- you simply miss out on them and the benefit. </p>
<p>This is why, for example, someone may feel awful the next morning having slept eight hours from 12-8am. Their natural phases want them to sleep 10-6, so they have missed a crucial chunk of any given phase. In this example they would lose NREM sleep which happens earlier in the phase as compared to REM sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My body wants me to sleep from 2-3am to 10-11. Hours of 6-9am is my best sleep zone. Unfortunately I have to work at 8am which requires trying to sleep by 11ish. </p>
<p>I never feel rested unless its the weekend or I take time off and get to go to bed at 2-3am and sleep til late morning. Sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep is actually a very fascinating thing that many living creature do. The fact that it makes the animal so vulnerable, so inefficient, yet it stuck around for millions of years of evolution suggests it ranks pretty damn high on biological importance, almost like mitochondria. If it fails, you pretty much die eventually. Yet, despite how essential it is, we still have no real clue as to why we all need it, or why hasn't evolution gotten rid of it!</p></div>		</li>
