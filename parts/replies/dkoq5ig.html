			<div class="markdown"><p>So the liquid in your veins and arteries is a mixture of things. Blood, in this case referring specifically to red blood cells, have proteins on them called antigens (2 types, A, or B).  Plasma is the liquid-y stuff that the cells float in. There are also proteins in plasma called antibodies (Anti-A or Anti-B), which function similarly to white blood cells in that they are responsible for finding antigens that are harmful and stopping them, generally by sticking to them and clotting. Which antibodies and antigens you have determines what blood type (specifically A, B, AB, or O). Type O have no antigens on their blood cells, therefore anyone can have type O red blood cells injected in them without causing issues. BUT, they have both types of antibodies in their plasma. In comparison, AB people have both types of antigens on their cells, but no antibodies in their plasma. This means that any blood cells injected into this person will not react. However, no AB blood cells can be injected into anyone who is not AB. Plasma, on the other hand, is basically the opposite. Because AB plasma has no antibodies, it is universal, like O blood cells. O plasma has both types of antibodies, and can receive any plasma, but putting O plasma into another person who is not O will kill them. So any time you see movies where they stick a tube from one person into another, like in Mad Max: Fury Road, unless they are the exact same blood type, they will die. Hospitals almost never do transfusions like this, because of the possible consequences. They give blood cells in saline so they are in a liquid as blood cells are solids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually O- is no longer a universal donor. They've recently found out that there are more factors associated with the Rh factor (+/-) than previously thought. O- will still be listed after because they can't take any other blood, but they won't use O- for like AB+ if they can avoid it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's always been ideal to have the same blood type when receiving blood, but O- is still used as a last resort, for emergencies, <em>or</em> if blood type is unknown. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hospitals running out of blood is not a problem in First World countries, because they constantly keep large amounts of donations banked and constantly replenish the supply. Even major traumatic events like 9/11 or the Orlando mass shooting have not caused blood shortages. At worst, surgeons may need to delay cosmetic surgeries to preserve the blood supply, but this is rare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to have this to wrong way round.  The more common blood-types (O-type) can be <em>given</em> to anyone, but can only <em>receive</em> from the same blood type.  Whereas AB can <em>recieve</em> from anyone, but only <em>give</em> to other ABs.  <a href="http://www.redcrossblood.org/learn-about-blood/blood-types.html" target="_blank">Handy chart here</a></p></div>		</li>
