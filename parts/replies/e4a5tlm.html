<p>&quot;There clearly is a frame where the CMB is at rest, and so this is, in some sense, the rest frame of the Universe. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But one of them can be picked out explicitly as the one with no CMB dipole pattern on the sky. And that's the absolute (expanding) rest frame!&quot;</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>&quot;Our local motion (which makes us move relative to the &quot;CMB frame&quot; and hence gives us a dipole to observe) is caused by nearby clusters and superclusters of galaxies pulling us around. It's true that over cosmological timescales these objects are also moving. And so if we wanted to keep ourselves always in the dipole-free frame we'd have to make small adjustments to our velocity as we moved and got pulled around by different objects. But these changes would be on roughly billion year timescales. And so to get into the frame with no CMB dipole basically just requires the following 3 steps: (1) observe today's dipole; (2) move towards the coldest direction at just the right speed to cancel the dipole; and (3) maintain basically that same velocity forever.&quot;</p>
<p>I wonder by how much does &quot;Our local motion&quot; affects our observed direction of the CMB frequency shift ??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>160.4 Ghz is the CMB frequency, (as stated by the UBC) and the local expansion of the universe is 67.15 Â± 1.2 (km/s)/Mpc roughly... SO as far as I know, all you would need to do is take the doppler shift of the expansion and normalize(?) it against the CMB. But I am BY FAR not an astronomer, and more of a hobbyist in the field. </p></div>		</li>
