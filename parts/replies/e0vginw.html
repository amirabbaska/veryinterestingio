			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very good question, there is some debate over this as well.  It depends from person to person, but the average person should be able to chew gum, drink green tea or black coffee without actually causing a significant rise in insulin levels.  However, that is just insulin and there are other cases where even small amounts of calories can affect the body.</p>
<p>In general though, you should be able to consume water, green tea (unsweetened), black coffee, and chew gum as part of an extended fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any particular reason you single out (unsweetened) <em>green</em> tea, rather than (unsweetened) tea in general? I find it hard to imagine that e.g. the oxidation process for black tea somehow makes some calories available for human digestion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Obviously it can be very helpful in suppressing your appetite, but I actually have no idea how it affects your metabolism or the processing of insulin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends - some people are very strict and say that anything except water breaks a fast. Some people say black coffee or tea with no calories is fine - others say those cause an insulin response in your body which limits the benefits of fasting. It depends on your goals I suppose. If improving insulin resistance, autophagy, etc are your goals, sticking to water is best. If calorie restriction is your goal, those things are fine, esp if they allow you to continue longer without eating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that coffee and tea start the metabolic processes because they still have chemical compounds that need to be broken down by the body. Dr. Rhonda Patrick has a lot of really informative info on her podcasts about fasting, autophagy, etc!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive been fasting 22 hours a day for a few months now, and have come to some personal conclusions over the whole subject, so ive been doing <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/YAGpXPd" target="_blank">this</a> for about 20 minutes now over your comment. I gotta say, yep, youre 100% correct. Very well put :)</p>
<p>Just to add my 2c, i personally think fasting is the most effective thing a person can do to improve their health and extend their life. The benefits are just mind blowing, i kinda get why whole religions developed around similar behaviours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well humans also have a cephalic response that can be triggered by sight, smell, thought, or taste of food. Just seeing an ad for food can trigger an insulin response, although insulin levels usually go back to normal within 10 minutes. </p>
<p>Insulin is there to regulate glucose levels in the blood. If what you just eaten have not raised your blood glucose levels then the body will quickly realize the insulin is not needed and go back to whatever it was doing before. </p>
<p>&quot;Fasting&quot; has a lot of attached meaning and you probably need to look in your religious book of choice to find out what counts as breaking your fast, but as far as your body is concerned 10-30 grams of simple carbs would probably throw your body out of ketosis </p></div>		</li>

<p>They state that it should be normal to fast for 2-4 days and eat large meals on a periodic basis</p>

<p>As a layman, this seems strange to me. I can see often gaps between meat. But we are pretty much the ultimate omnivores, my understanding was that was a great boon because no matter where we went, there was almost always going to be something edible for us, and we could simply keep moving so we would never deplete an area. If anything, the idea of grazing a bit throughout the day seems to be much better supported as a natural diet. But as you said, we also evolved to be extremely adaptable in that regard, and just because a certain diet may have been our presumed default, doesn't mean it's the healthiest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>meat is hard to catch. every animal fails a hunt several times before actually catching anything. humans were better at hunting, but it still meant meat was not as common a prize as all the plants the surrounded early humans. not to mention meat had to be eaten quickly, and shared with the whole pack/tribe. </p>
<p>humans also scared off most animals. which is why paleolithic humans were nomadic. the herd animals would leave and humans would follow them. i don't know if there is an average for how often paleolithic humans got meat, but the common claim i see was once a week</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also seems strange because our bodies operate on circadian rhythms which govern our hormones and appetite. We get hungry on a daily schedule, not just when running out of food, which would suggest a regular eating time is historically/biologically normal.</p>
<p>Regarding the meat thing, it's clearly the case that hunter gatherer societies got most of their calories from animals. There just aren't enough calories in wild berries and wild leaves to fuel a human every day, although they're a good supplement. Perhaps they just killed big enough animals to tide them over for a week until the next big kill... meal prepping.</p>
<p>Small animals like lizards and bugs are also more plentiful and could provide a daily source of snacks.</p></div>		</li>
