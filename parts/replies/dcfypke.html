			<div class="markdown"><p>My cookies always seem to sink regardless of temperature. Would this be because they're more dense, thus having fewer air pockets to help support them?</p>
<p>Honestly I don't remember ever seeing a cookie float in milk, how much air do you need in a cookie to actually make it float?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. I've noticed that if you leave the cool cookie pieces floating for long enough they will sink once they get soggy enough. The hot cookies get so soggy so quickly that they sink immediately, but it takes a while for the colder cookies to do so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But why is there less void space when it's cooler? I'm guessing because the steam has the left cookie and it has 'set?'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the space is already full of relatively cool air.</p>
<p>When it contacts the cold milk, it does not contract as much, and does not create as much void space for the milk to fill.   </p>
<p>Presumably eventually the milk could soak in and displace the air, then even cold cookies would sink, but it would take longer than a fresh hot cookie, as observed.</p></div>		</li>
