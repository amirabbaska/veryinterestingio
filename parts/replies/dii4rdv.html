			<div class="markdown"><p>Murder is a pretty stupid argument for but I didn't know. The amount of information saying murder is illegal and prevalent that it is common sense. Other laws which aren't on TV 24/7 or the major plot line of every criminal novel is really what op is talking about. Eg all the old redundant laws. Proving ignorance could be as simple as asking the jury did you know about this law ? If it's a general law for everyone. Or asking a professional in that department if it is the prosecution  of something like tax evasion of a accountant. You bring in 3 three, 1 for the defence 2 for the prosecution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tax evasion is one of the few times where precedent actually exists for ignorance being a defense.</p>
<p>For example, if you didn't know you had to file for a Sales and Use Tax certificate for your business, you can claim ignorance and &quot;get away with&quot; paying the owed back taxes. </p></div>		</li>
