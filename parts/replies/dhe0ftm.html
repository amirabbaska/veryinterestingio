<p>As a Free Software advocate, I like to point out from time to time that while GNU/Linux still has a relatively small market share, software originally written for GNU/Linux systems powers virtually all of the browsers people use on a regular basis: Chrome, Safari, Android's browser, and iOS's browser all descend from KHTML. The only other brower that matters, Firefox, wasn't GNU/Linux specifically, but was Free Software since </p>

<p>You left out Internet Explorer? Because it doesn't matter?? isn't it still the most used browser?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think most of the industry has accepted open standards, at least where the Internet is concerned.  So, I don't think the browsers are warring the way they used to.  We don't see them introducing a lot of proprietary markup, for instance.</p>
<p>On the other hand, &quot;most of the industry&quot; isn't the same as &quot;all of the industry.&quot;  We're still fighting for open standards for multimedia, and against DRM.  Control is still an issue.</p>

<p>I left it out because I was expounding on the previous statement, &quot;virtually all of the browsers people use descend from KHTML.&quot;  </p>
<p>And, no, IE isn't the most used browser.  IE and Edge, combined, make up less than 10% of usage share in most surveys.  Those numbers are slightly better if you count only browsers in desktop OSes, but it's still less than half of Chrome's use.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your bias is showing. While that's great you support FOSS software, &quot;the only other browser that matters&quot; is actually IE. Hell, Edge almost has the same market share as Firefox on desktop.</p></div>		</li>
