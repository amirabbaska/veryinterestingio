<p>Our whole experience of life is associative. If you break the associations you solidified from youth and form new ones, the world changes (quite literally). Without your body, you don't exist, so if your body perceives something -- it's basically real. It just so happens that education and social conditioning tends to drive similar (but not the same) associations, and thus we get &quot;reality&quot;. We're living alongside one another in parallel universes in a sense. I think there's ways to reconcile this with reality, and if you lose your grounding -- well, mental illness.</p></div>		</li>
