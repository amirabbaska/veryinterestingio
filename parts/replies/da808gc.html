<p>Also most developed countries lack the death penalty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My opinion is that the death penalty is fundamentally incompatible with a country that values the life of an innocent more than the punishment of the guilty.</p>
<p>America is one of the countries that would rather a system that never convicts an innocent, at the expense of letting some guilty go free; as opposed to a system where the guilty rarely go free at the cost of occasionally punishing innocents.</p>
<p>This kind of mindset renders the death penalty economically ineffective at best, and morally unconscionable at worst.</p></div>		</li>
