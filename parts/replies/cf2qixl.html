			<div class="markdown"><p>OK... here's a question for you then - I reformatted my old hard drive from 2007 a few months ago. This should have just restored it to basically new, right? I've got it set up to strictly just be an internet vehicle for my tv. The only thing installed on it now beyond the original system software is chrome. But when I stream stuff it's slow and choppy... and I remember I used to stream stuff all the time on that computer before and had zero issues.</p>
<p>Is it just that 2007 computers don't stream 2014 content well? Or could there be something else going on?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are too many factors for me to give a definite answer.  What files are you streaming, from where to where?  It may be, for example, that your ISP is doing some kind of throttling/QoS.  It may be that there's more wireless interference in your house than there was a few years ago, and that's making your connection to the Internet worse.  It may be that the source of the content (e.g. Netflix) has changed their encoding profile to something that requires more processing power.</p>
<p>In short, yes, it could be the content, or there could be something else going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The computer I purchased in 2011 doesn't have a problem streaming anything (e.g. a tv show from nbc.com) so I don't think it's the wireless or the ISP throttling. But perhaps it could be the encoding thing. It's not a huge issue, I just always found it weird. Thanks for replying!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reformatting a hard drive does not make it new.</p>
<p>All it does is gets rid of the software that was making your system seem slow.</p>
<p>Hardware is mechanical and a hard drive especially has moving parts. These things wear down. Your hard drive is 7 years old. While I have a hard drive from 1997 that still works, it is much slower than it was in 1997 (and this is not just psychological)</p>
<p>If you know more about cars than computers, then would a car with 40000 miles be slower than the same car with 0 miles?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>excellent point. I kind of figured that was probably a large part of it, but kept reading that reformatting should speed it up. It works <em>okay</em>. It's fine for streaming music and stuff. Just wish it was better with the video</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything is pretty true.</p>
<p>I usually recommend something like this to most people.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Defragment your hard drive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Downloads CCleaner and run it.</p>
</li>
<li>See how it runs now.</li>
</ol>
<p>In most cases, a re install of windows fixes everything. Backup your files, install windows, hop over to <a href="http://ninite.com/" target="_blank">ninite</a> to get your standard programs, and everything should be fine. I recommend a fresh instal of windows every 2 years to any computer. You would be amazed how much stuff clogs up that you don't need.</p></div>		</li>
