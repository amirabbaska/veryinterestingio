			<div class="markdown"><p>Another critique of his theory is that autistic people do not necessarily lack empathy. In fact, many autistic people feel an overwhelming amount of empathy but are unable to express it in a way that neurotypical people would recognize. This is referred to as the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2518049/#__ffn_sectitle" target="_blank">Intense World theory</a> which I can corroborate with my own personal experience as an autistic woman.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a difference between a lay person's understanding of the word Empathy and the term used by psychologists. </p>
<p>Empathy used by psychologists is not an emotional concern for others, it is the reflective and instinctual ability to understand emotion, beliefs and different preservatives of other people, to be interested in inner workings of other people's minds.</p>
<p>Autistic people are more interested in systems then people. Autistic people follow a ridged rule based moral code of conduct, they are thus far less likely to break the law and often impose rules on others.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are actually two different types of mental activity called &quot;empathy&quot;, usually divided into affective (emotional) empathy and cognitive (rational) empathy.  Affective empathy is feeling what other people feel -- see a sad person, feel sad; see a joyous person, feel joy. Affective empathy is what causes emotional contagion, to a large extent. Cognitive empathy is using the thinking part of the brain to comprehend what other people are feeling, sometimes called &quot;perspective taking.&quot; Some psychopaths have excellent cognitive empathy and are able to manipulate other people's feelings with great skill, but since they lack affective empathy, they don't actually worry about hurting other people because they don't feel any empathic pain when they do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say this in considerably less depth. The hypothesis does have vocal critics, but it's worth pointing out that it also has few strong supporters so far. Basically it's just one's guy's pet theory that's pretty compelling as an explanation, but neither well supported nor decisively refuted... yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main disagreement is simply that there isn't a lot of evidence for the theory, and most of it comes from Baron-Cohen's research. It's his pet theory (he's an author in every post the above poster cited but one), based on his interpretation of what autism is, and that interpretation is less and less likely as we gather more evidence. The extreme male brain theory was fairly popular in the late 90s/early 2000s, but you don't see it around much anymore; almost everyone agrees sex and gender have an impact on autism, but the simple view that autism is &quot;extreme maleness&quot; seems dubious.</p>
<p>Firstly, problems with identifying evidence for the theory: females are probably underdiagnosed with autism compared to males with similar cognitive makeup, and definitely present symptoms differently (Kopp et al., 2011 is probably the best here, also Dworzynski et al., 2012, Holtmann et al., 2007, Head et al., 2014 and like a bunch of others.) Generally, for a girl to be diagnosed with autism, she must exhibit serious behavioral problems and difficulties fitting in with normal life, while boys are more frequently diagnosed as autistic but &quot;high-functioning,&quot; or having Asberger's. When using a standard diagnostic test for autism, like the Childhood Autism Spectrum test above or the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire used in (Ehlers et al., 1999), you get much more equal ratios of girls to boys with autism, so it looks like the lack of girls diagnosed with autism is less due to biology directly than because they have different coping strategies and/or are perceived differently by adults. Baron-Cohen generally doesn't use the typical tests for autism, but a test he designed himself, measuring autistic tendency as an Autism Spectrum Quotient. This is definitely still being debated (see <a href="https://spectrumnews.org/news/autism-characteristics-differ-by-gender-studies-find/" target="_blank">here</a>, or Goldman 2013 for rough summaries) but there's growing evidence that the disparity OP is asking about isn't as great as we once thought.</p>
<p>There's also evidence that the relationship between autism and gender is more complicated than the &quot;extreme male&quot; theory suggests. While girls with autism may have increased testosterone, there's some evidence autistic boys have decreased testosterone (Bejerot et al., 2012), and the aspects of the brain that indicate autism are different for different genders; female autistic brains do differ from standard in some of the same regions that are affected by gender, but male autistic brains don't (Lai et al., 2013). Males with autism aren't &quot;more male&quot; in any measurable way, so the testosterone exposure theory is pretty weak; it seems more likely that there's a secondary characteristic we haven't identified that may be unlocked by testosterone, but is only one piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>Frankly, for this poster to dismiss critics of the extreme male brain theory as ideologically motivated non-scientists is irresponsible, or at best ignorant. It's hardly mainstream science, TED talks aside, and if they claim to have not read any criticism of the theory in academic journals, they haven't read any academic journals focusing on autism research since the early 2000s. There is almost certainly some connection between biological sex and autism, but it is certainly not as simple as &quot;more male = more autistic&quot;, and probably not even as simple as &quot;male = more likely to be autistic.&quot; The scientific community has pretty much accepted that many old methods of detecting autism were male-biased, and samples of autistic males and females compared in earlier studies were not really comparable. To paint Simon Baron-Cohen as reasonable science and his critics as unwilling SJWs would get you... very strange looks in academic circles.</p>

<p>In brief, the 4–5:1 male bias may be partly due to the underrecognition  of  females  (particularly higher-functioning), ascertainment bias, and issues of diagnostic instruments. &quot;<em>Nevertheless, even studies that better account for
these issues still show a 2–5:1 male predominance, which has
important etiological and developmental implications.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The observed gender ratio is indeed real.  I have not found a paper (?) that claims a 1:1 ratio between males and females.</p>
<p>Also, here's an interesting paper recently published by Baron-Cohen and colleagues that measured the hormone content of amniotic fluid collected from the Danish Historic Birth Cohort between 1996-99 (n=19677) and appears to confirm the hormone theory of autism...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These results provide the first direct evidence of elevated fetal steroidogenic activity in autism. Such elevations may be important as epigenetic fetal programming mechanisms and may interact with other important pathophysiological factors in autism.</p>

<p>I notice that US research favours multiple threshold model of autism, that genetics and epigenetics protected females from developing autism, they have to be exposed to more risk factors and genetics errors before they end up on the spectrum. Simon Barron-Cohen's theories appear to be more popular in Europe than the US.</p>
