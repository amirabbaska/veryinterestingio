			<div class="markdown"><p>You're implying that &quot;manic&quot; states coincide with happiness (being the opposite of depression and all). I would say a manic state is closer to &quot;energetic&quot;, which would be the opposite of the lethargy depression causes.</p>
<p>But emotionally? It's called &quot;manic <em>depression</em>&quot; for a reason. The people who suffer are often still sad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypomanic states can, in fact, coincide with happiness, or at least a version of it. Euphoria is a symptom of a hypomanic state, and I can tell you from first hand experience, it's fantastic from the standpoint of how it feels. Energetic yes, but also optimistic, upbeat, ready to take on the world, and <em>happy.</em> </p>
<p>But you're also right that euphoria is not the only hypomanic symptom. Some of the others like recklessness, anxiety, and fear suck. And full blown mania is even worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was called manic depression not because the mania was depressive but because it cycled between manic and depressive periods. It is now referred to as bipolar disorder. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with the &quot;upbeat, ready to take on the world&quot; is that then you set these amazing goals and believe you will make them. Crashes are always accompanied by the thought/&quot;realization&quot; that you can't do any of it, and never will. Then the depression starts.</p>
<p>I don't know the difference between when I'm happy and when I'm manic anymore. I don't know if I'm ever actually legitimately happy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amen! It's frustrating when I try to explain to someone that I'm depressed but not sad in the slightest. I usually tell them &quot;I'm chemically depressed.&quot; I rarely become manic, but when I do it's frustrating as hell. I guess the difference can be best illustrated in how I react to having so many things to do that I don't even know where to start.....</p>
<p>If I am depressed, I will read or play on the internet, telling myself &quot;I'll start working at the turn of the hour.&quot; That hour passes without me noticing or else I'm in the middle of a great chapter, so I tell myself to wait for the next half hour or hour. Somehow, I never actually get around to starting. Then I feel guilty about having never started and things just get worse.</p>
<p>If I'm manic, I become extremely detail-oriented. I plan out the perfect order so I can multi-task and get everything done at once, but then I become so involved in the tiny details of one part of one task that I spend hours on it and never get any of the other stuff done. That's OK though, because I won't be able to sleep for days. In the end, regardless of whether I'm depressed or manic, everything will get done in about the same amount of time. In neither case am I necessarily happy or sad.... just hyperactive or inactive. In both cases, I have a tendency to be very dramatic and expect others to play into my drama. Sometimes that includes just not responding to calls/messages and then getting pissed when my friends don't miss me as much as I think they should. I didn't realize when I was younger how fucking crazy that is, but I've learned to be more rational about those insane feelings and not make others pay for them.</p>
<p>I'm much better off when I'm evened out and can just do things at a normal human's pace and without making the whole world about me. The problem is that if I take medicine to make sure I'm always evened out, that actually <em>does</em> take my emotions away. I no longer feel very happy or sad. I don't really like the things I'm doing, but I do them anyway like a robot completing meaningless tasks. I'm an extrovert, so I usually get my energy from hanging out with others and doing activities outside my apartment. When I take meds, I basically fall into myself. I don't need others, and there is rarely a good reason for me to leave the house other than work.</p>
<p>I decided about 8 years ago that I'm better off without medication. I just have to be really careful about assessing my feelings before I bring others into them. I ask myself &quot;Is it fair for me to feel [    ], or is it just the chemicals?&quot; If it's just the chemicals, I swallow it down and try not to make others pay for it. I've also learned that maintaining a proper sleep schedule can help even me out. When I sleep too much I tend to become depressed and <em>need</em> to sleep. When I sleep too little, I tend to become manic and have difficulty sleeping at all. If my sleep is regulated, I can usually stay normal for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>I'm far happier this way, and I haven't been suicidal once since dropping the meds. I don't recommend it for others unless they talk to their therapist first, though. Apparently, I'm not a usual case. I'm also not a medical professional so bipolar friends out there shouldn't listen to me over their advice of their actual doctor. I'm just telling my story so those who aren't bipolar can understand what it's like, at least for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who was recently diagnosed on the bipolar spectrum this hits way too close to home. I'm 28 and I've been medicated since I was 15. I've tried the whole toolbox of antidepressants, anxiety meds, and ADD meds. My most recent psychiatrist was the first one to explain to me that bipolar is on a spectrum with depression and I don't exhibit the extreme mania. On the flip side, the wrong antidepressant can cause me to become suicidal.</p>
<p>I started taking a mood stabilizer for the first time recently. I'm not sure if it's helping yet, but I'm cautiously hopeful. </p>
<p>I do the same thing with friends and it's very irrational. It's left me with almost no friends because I can be very petty and judgmental about how people react to me or don't check in. I've dropped a lot of friends out of my life for small things and I'll hold a grudge just as strong as my Italian ancestors did. </p>
<p>I do the same thing with relationships. I've only had one LTR and it was incredibly unstable because both of us have mental health issues. It was the happiest and most anger filled two and a half years of my life. She was the human version of a feral animal. Super rough around the edges, shamelessly ate out of the garbage, and we'd forage for food in the woods when walking or hitch hiking across the country. Her niece even called her Aunty Feral. She peed standing up and collected bones we found to incorporate into her wardrobe. She wore a muskrat skull around her neck and fucked like a primal madman. Tattoos of naked women on her arms and back. </p>
<p>We were in limbo towards the end and then she got brainwashed into becoming a catholic nun shut off from the rest of society. That fucked me up for a long time and I'll never be able to wrap my head around her complete and polarized 180. </p>
<p>For whatever reason I'm attracted to women with mental health issues. It's not a fetish and I'm not attracted to them <em>because</em> they have mental health issues, it just happens naturally. When I was on OKCupid, all the 90%+ matches I connected with would reveal they suffered from mental illness. It happens in the real world as well. Crazy attracts crazy I guess. I thrive off instability. </p>
<p>I'm naturally a detail oriented person. Depression causes me to lose all motivation, and the manic episodes make me unsustainably hyper focused and caught up in details so I don't get much done. It's two sides of a stagnation coin. </p>
<p>I'm an introvert that tends to mimic the energy of others. I feed off their energy because I don't produce much on my own. It's nice while it's happening but I still need a solid amount of alone time to recharge. Recently I'm in a situation where I don't have any local friends and I think I'm becoming too comfortable with spending all my time alone. I've withdrawn into my self as far as I can go, but for the time being I'm content with that. Besides, relying on other people for energy and happiness isn't healthy either. I'm learning to enjoy things on my own. </p>
<p>I'm glad you were able to come off meds and found a way to live in a healthy balance. I've tried going off them a few times and it always results in a garbage fire. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm about to graduate and start my first job as a real therapist in a few months, so I'm always interested in hearing what has worked for people. From what I know, you hit the nail on the head with sleep regulation for bipolar disorder. I'm so glad that you're found some balance and insight as to what works for you. For others out there, what I take from your story is not that dropping meds was the helpful thing necessarily, but that you formed good skills with regulating your own sleep and checking in on your emotions, enough so that no medication is needed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypomania, a mild form of mania common with bipolar II patients is bliss. You feel great, need little sleep, get all the shit done. The problem is it is not sustainable, you burn out after a short time and what usually follows is a long period of depression. </p></div>		</li>

<p>in some country in south america, people tend to be happier than anywhere in the world. they have a strong culture of family, friends, and human relations. the suicide rate is one of the lowest in the world, they are very resilient. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bipolar is another term for manic depression for one. And two, being manic is not happy... its like anxiety. Think about it like you just drank a fuckton of coffee and you are bouncing off the walls. You might feel up but its an out of control kind of up. You might have a hard time sleeping or concentrating too kind of like adhd, and its physically exhausting. You also have a huge problem with impulse control. Like... you wake up one morning and feel like jumping in the car and going to Arizona. So you do. You don't give it thought... you just do. And that can sound all yolo or carpe diem and shit but it can be a serious problem when it comes to gambling or other addictions including shopping, where the stores and adverts are designed to get you to impulse buy to begin with. It can also be very difficult dealing with impulse control of emotions... which can in extreme cases... lead to crimes of passion.
So... no.... it ain't happy.... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get hypomanic and this is exactly how I experience it. I feel like I've drank a pot of coffee. I'm super energized and can get really focused (I used to do web design on the side and could do a months worth of work in one week because I'd stay up all night coding and be crazy productive). But I'd also just decided I wanted to drive across the country on a whim because I felt like going to the ocean, so I would just pack up my bags and start driving just to spend one day at the beach and then drive all the way home. I once drive from Michigan to Washington DC on a Friday night after work just because. And it's hard for people around you to recognize that as an issue because it's like a movie - like you said all YOLO, but like not sleeping and driving for three days is NOT a good idea. </p>
<p>I also become highly annoying - I'm pretty talkative anyways, but when I'm hypomanic I can't stop and I cut people off all the time because I am having so many thoughts and they are all interrupting themselves and I need to get them out because I feel like my head is going to explode. Also, the shopping... so much shopping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, from some tales of what mania can do that I've heard, it sounds worse than depression. My ex's mom had it, and sometimes I'd help her navigate the situation. What was once a caring mother, at one moment when off her meds, proceeded to tell her 8 year old son she would be better off without him, as then she could go out and stuff, broke bottles in the house and even threw feces. I mean, it's an extreme case, but mania is so much more sad to me (to see someone being manic), because they lose so much inhibitions that they become capable of doing stuff that isn't really them, to hurt loved ones in ways they really didn't want to, and that they will later regret when mania drops off. From an outside perspective, to their person who is not themselves in the moment of mania (including the individual once the manic moment wanes), it seems like a pretty horrible/sad state.</p></div>		</li>
