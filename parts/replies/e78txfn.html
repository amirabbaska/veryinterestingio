			<div class="markdown"><p>Small, light diesel engines are a relatively modern improvement.  They used to be too heavy and large to get good speed or fuel mileage in a small car.  Diesel technology has come a long way in a relatively short amount of time.  Also for some reason the US still prefers gasoline engines for cars, so you don't see a lot of diesel passenger vehicles here, but in other countries they are becoming very common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diesel cars are getting banned in major cities now in Europe. They release less greenhouse gasses, but more local particle pollution that tank local air quality high traffic areas.</p>
<p>So focus is shifting to electric rater than better filtering for diesel. The whole emission cheating scandal didn't help matters.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If anyone wants to dig a bit further, wasn't diesel supposed to be the replacement for gasoline?  Diesel was supposed to be the cheap future, was it not?  Fewer moving parts, less wiring, easier refining, and all that other stuff that was supposed to make it the cheaper option....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If i’m correct diesel was supposed to replace gasoline for safety purposes. Diesel will only ignite under pressure, gasoline evaporates in normal conditione and the gas is highly flammable. Especially in submarines you don’t want to be submerged in a metal chamber with a gasoline engine thats leaking fuel everywhere. If the engine was leaking diesel instead of gasoline it would be much less of a deadtrap.</p></div>		</li>
