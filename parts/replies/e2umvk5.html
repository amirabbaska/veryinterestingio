			<div class="markdown"><p>How does it start spinning though? The gas is ionized, right? So is it a field that causes it to spin? What makes that field? </p>
<p>Or is it air resistance causing friction as the particle moves through space? What caused the particle to move then? Gravity? </p>
<p>What separates the particles from one another in the first place? Why aren't they already right next to each other?</p>
<p>So many questions!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something something conservation of angular momentum.</p>
<p>I'm not qualified to answer your questions man. I'm out of my depth here. Someone with a degree get in here and help us out for Christ's sake.</p>
<p>My BSc was in E-Business. I ain't no bachelor of science. Our educational system is a lie! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with conservation of angular momentum. Throughout formation and the life of a star and accompanying solar system, the total angular moment of the entire system remains effectively constant (it changes only when something is flung out or captured). The angular momentum of a system is highly unlikely to be anything close to zero and so more material will be orbiting one way over the other. Material orbiting in opposite directions would collide more frequently, negating each other's angular momentum and fall inwards, while material orbiting in the same direction would remain orbiting even after the collision. Over time, collisions eliminate all the material orbiting in the unfavoured direction, leaving all the remaining objects in orbit all travelling in the same direction.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your answer! I understand from the video why things would orbit in the same direction but not why they would rotate the same way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the early stages, planet formation is similar to star formation. The only major difference is because the gravitationally bound material that will make up the planet is also orbiting the star, total angular momentum of the planetary system is biased towards one direction in the center of mass reference frame. In short, the direction a planet rotates is largely determined by the direction it orbits.</p></div>		</li>
