<p>I think STEM research funding will remain at least somewhat stable for the next couple of years. Before Obama’s term expired, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act, which set aside a certain amount of funding for mandatory budget spending. That means that at least part of the NIH budget won’t be subject to the budget fights we’ve had over the last several years. More importantly, the act passed with broad bipartisan support. Unlike some other federal agencies, both Democrats and Republicans strongly support NIH.</p></div>		</li>
