<p>This is a laser interferometer looking at a beer can with a rubber band around the middle. The differing path lengths are caused by small deformations in the surface of the can, and this allows us to observe the strain on the can. By counting the light and dark bands, we can actually measure amounts of deformation as small as the wavelength of the light.* </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because non-coherent light cannot generate interference.</p>
<p>EDIT: I believe that answer was very circular, so I will explain why.</p>
<p>Laser emits light by spontaneous emission, which means that the electrons in their atoms are excited and then decay to a metastable state(this is the state where the electrons sit at a higher energy level than usual but still stable, so to say). They stay in this state until ONE electron drops to a lower energy level and emits a photon. This photon will cause the other metastable electrons to also drop energy levels and emit photons. Since they all drop from the very same state to the very same lower state, they all emit a photon with the same wavelength and we have coherent light.</p>
<p>Interference pretty much only occurs between waves of the very same wavelength. <a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.physicsabout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/destructive-interference.png" target="_blank">See this as needing a copy of the same wave with the exact same properties, but mirrored, to interact with one another and destroy each other</a>, <strong>or</strong> <a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.physicsabout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/constructive.png" target="_blank">an exact copy to interact and combine with one another.</a>. If their wavelength/waveform/etc. is not the same(they aren't coherent), they won't be able to do this. They just aren't compatible with one another and won't interact at all.</p>
<p>Coherent light comes from <strong>Stimulated Emission</strong>, which comes from lasers(it's part of the acronym). </p>
<p>The other kind of emission is <strong>Spontaneous Emission</strong>, where you pretty much just throw energy into the atoms and they change orbitals and release photons as they see fit. It's much less orderly than stimulated emission, so you get a bunch of waves that might be close to each other in wavelength, but they are not the very same and their directions/phase difference is all over the place(not a constant difference through time). This makes them incapable of interacting with one another, which means interference cannot happen.</p>
<p>Fluorescence is a form of spontaneous emission, so light generated through fluorescence will be incapable of interference in itself.  </p></div>		</li>
