<p>Unrelated factoid: The subways of New York used 25 Hz not that long ago; maybe they still do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IIRC, they primarily operate on DC, and have done so for a long time. The last users of 25Hz power were the lift motors in elevators. The last 25Hz power plant was shut down only within the last 20 years, as maintaining two distinct power grids was expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Let's say we could start again and not have the costs of switching to a different standard, would the difference in resistivity of 50 hz (because of the skin effect) be big enough to choose it over 60 hz ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not. While I don't have hard numbers to back this up, but it's probably a wash because 60hz allows you to use slightly smaller transformers. Also, high voltage DC transmission systems are becoming more common. Lastly the skin effect is actually harnessed in big transmission wires. The core of the cable is made with relatively cheap steel for strength, and clad in aluminium for conductivity. This allows the lines to span much longer distances between pylons than would be possible with pure copper or aluminium </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most household transformers first convert AC to DC, convert that to high-frequency AC, transform that down to low voltages, and then convert AC to DC again. They don't care about the grid frequency. Transformers in the grid can be a bit smaller with 60 Hz.</p>
<p>But I agree with /u/firemogle: If we would start from scratch now, a DC grid would be more convenient. We have power electronics that can do the necessary conversions efficiently.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is becoming more common but it's still very rare, and will remain very rare. DC is only used to connect 2 grids that are not connected with AC connections or to cover massive distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If done again we would probably use high voltage DC and skip all the issues involved with AC.</p>
<p>AC was really needed to step voltages up and down for transmission using transformers. Modern components can do this with DC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely. HVDC circuit breakers only exist in theory and are very complicated and expensive. Transformers are only part of the problem. AC circuit breakers quench faults by taking advantage of the 0 point in AC. This doesn’t exist in DC. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>No not at all. You have more losses with DC at the same current: 50 or 60 times a second the current is 0, so no losses.</del> AC has more losses because of the skin effect.</p>
<p>However losses occur with amps, not with volts. So to cover long distances you need to step up the voltage, which is difficult with DC, but easy with AC.</p>
<p>To counter this you need a massive voltage, which makes it unsafer.</p>
<p>And then the other drawback of DC emerges: safety. You can't put a breaker in between. At high currents the breaker would 'stick', you'd need a lot of mechanical force to open the breaker. With AC it's easier because 50 or 60 times a second there is no current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High voltage substations use what’s called bus pipe to conduct electricity.It’s basically a large hollow aluminum pipe, at higher voltages skin effect is unavoidable. In most installations outside of residential stranded wire is used over solid because it helps combat skin effect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stranded wire doesn't do anything about skin effect since skin effect applies to the entire conductor, not each individual strand (unless each wire is insulated and they're weaved to have equal distance in the center of the bundle - this is called Litz wire). Skin depth at 60 Hz is also about 8 mm - so it doesn't even really become relevant until you get to a point where solid wire is impractical. </p>
<p>Stranded wire is typically chosen over solid because it's flexible. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The flicker of fluorescent lighting is more visible at 50 Hz, although this was probably not a consideration when the frequency standards were developed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the main consideration when frequency standards were developed. Supplies for motor often tended to run slower, and supplies for lighting often faster. The 50-60 Hz range was chosen pretty much exclusively as the end that wouldn't show flickering in incadescent and arc lamps. </p></div>		</li>
