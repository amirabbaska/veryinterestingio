<p>Given the amount of cloud storage available to consumers, I'd like to believe the U.S. government has an equal if not greater amount (I'm looking at  <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/06/130612-nsa-utah-data-center-storage-zettabyte-snowden/" target="_blank">you NSA</a>. </p>
<p>What if instead of spying on people and keeping that data we used some of that space for police footage? Where does dashcam footage go? SD Cards are also small and can be secured in devices. What if every shift a new SD Card was put in the recorder?  I think the cost argument is a societal cop out.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) Spying is always necessary and important. It is one of the most important parts of governmental operations.</p>
<p>2) The issue is data management. Storing and logging vast amounts of data is an enormous pain in the ass. Storing and logging vast amounts of data by 13,000 law enforcement agencies is a logistical nightmare. Storing and logging vast amounts of data on remote servers by 13,000 different agencies, possibly allowing the footage to be seen by the public without proper authorization?</p>
<p>3) Dashcams mostly only record when the sirens are on - they're often linked to siren operations, so as to avoid storing a bunch of crap. And non-evidentiary videos are often wiped relatively quickly, because people shriek like sirens about how TEH POLICE ARE RECORDING EVERYTHING WE DO!!!!111oneoneoneeleventy</p>
<p>Remember: people are broken in the head. You will often see <em>the same people</em> complain both about the police recording too much stuff <em>and</em> the police not recording enough stuff.</p>
<p>Some of them are people who just want to be angry, some of them are criminals who hate the police for obvious reasons, some of them work for Russia (but I repeat myself), and some of them just don't think.</p>
<p>Retention policies vary immensely from place to place. In Washington State, a lot of recordings are retained for 90 days, then destroyed.</p>
<p>4) Yes, SD cards can be removed. Then someone forgets to put in a new SD card and nothing gets recorded and morons on the internet shriek about how it is some sort of conspiracy. Moreover, it doesn't actually solve the problem; beyond uploads taking some time (especially if you're uploading to remote servers) which means time at the end of every shift doing that (which means <em>more</em> time not doing police work), you now have to figure out what you're doing with those SD cards.</p>
<p>5) No, cost is not a &quot;societal cop-out&quot;. People don't want to pay higher taxes, especially for services that do very little to benefit them. The value of recording millions of hours of police camera video every day is pretty close to zero, while the cost is quite large (billions of dollars). We have other, better things to spend our money on.</p>
<p>How much additional tax money are you, <em>personally</em>, willing to pay for this?</p></div>		</li>
