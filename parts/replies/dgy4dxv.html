			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, now I'm curious as to what type of poisons this would concur to, as to them expiring and if there are some you could purposely expire to make them stronger instead of purchasing a more expensive, stronger poison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With regards to a lot of things, the &quot;expiry&quot; on the label usually means that the contents can no longer be guaranteed to be what's written on the label. So for a chemical, it means the chemical will have broken down into some <em>other</em> chemical - which may or may not be more or less poisonous. </p>
<p>It's not just chemicals and poisons. A lot of alcohol has expiry dates on it because after that date, the alcohol content can no longer be guaranteed - that's how you end up with expiry dates on things that have spent months (or years) brewing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm interesting. It would be cool if a scientist took multiple poisons, measured the level of they're affects, let them expire, and see if any of them become stronger in affect.</p></div>		</li>
