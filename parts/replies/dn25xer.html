			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggy back on this. </p>
<p>That is called differential calculus. It has to do with the rate of change and slopes. The inverse processes is called integral calculus. </p>
<p>When you integrate a function you are looking for the area between the curve and the x axis. </p>
<p>Let's look at this in simpler terms </p>
<p>If I am given the acceleration of an object and  I want to know how fast it goes I would simply multiply it by time. </p>
<p>Interestingly enough this is the same value of the area under the curve. </p>
<p>Let's think about finding the distance traveled using the constant acceleration. </p>
<p>The graph looks like a<em>t or a straight line going up. If you wanted to see how fast it was going from start to some middle time you can see that it forms a triangle. You try to find the area under it with height being a</em>t and the base being the x axis of t the distance becomes 1/2at^2</p>
<p>This is the same thing as calculating the integral twice of a constant number. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be thinking of differential equations. Differential calc is usually the first class and involves deriving the slope of a curve. I.e., f(x) = x^2 , f'(x) = 2x</p>
<p>Diff EQ was much harder and I don't want to talk about it as it may trigger PTSD. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Differential calculus is easy and the concept of integral of calculus is easy. But if you have to do some of the more complex integrals by hand without using a table (or the internet), it can be a big pain in the ass</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree -- Trig substitution is such a pain. You end up making so many different variables ( x = sin theta, square them and use pythagorean identities...) it spins out into several pages-of-working. And that's fairly simple in the scheme of things... :(</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, teach yourself algebra when you're 11 and 12. That worked out real well. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was terrible at calculus. Having gotten older, I understand the concepts fairly well. I missed something somewhere in algebra and it's kinda haunted me since. I'm in my mid 30's and can do pretty much everything in trig still because I really understood it at basic level. Trig was so intuitive to me. The concreteness of trig versus the abstractness of algebra and therefore calculus has been a problem with me and higher math. It sucks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there is any acceleration (not 0) there is always a need to use calculus instead of traditional algebra. However here is the cool part: what if you used traditional algebra on a curve but at different points? You would get different slopes at different points right? So now what you do is keep decreasing the distance between these points and finding the slopes at each point. This is the first step in understanding exactly how calculus works. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your velocity is changing in a linear fashion,it's all good - that's a constant acceleration. </p>
<p>Anyway, if you have some wonky acceleration, that's usually when you would whip out Matlab and stop doing anything symbolically. A derivative for a data set is no more difficult than doing a bunch of subtractions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can break a difficult calculus problem into a series of easy algebra problems. That's how a numerical derivative or integration works. You just pick two points on the curve that are close enough for your tolerance and then find the slope as if it was a straight line instead of a curve. There are various ways of doing it faster, or more accurately with less operations, but that's the basic idea.  </p></div>		</li>
