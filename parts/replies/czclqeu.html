			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer, and everyone says it's because they're cheaply made. True for some, but not all. The <a href="http://joyofblending.com/vitamix-speed-measured/" target="_blank">Vitamix motor and blade assembly approaches 30,000 RPM</a> and the blendtec is similar. The sound isn't just from the motor but the blade tips hitting air at a pretty high speed. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Video tear down and analysis of the blender. It's a long one ~30 minutes, but if you have the time it's quite good. The guy is both very informative and hilarious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bought it for the performance over longevity. It easily outperforms any lesser blender, even the half decent Waring pro blender I had before it. If it lasts the 10 years while it's under warranty, I'm happy with that. The &quot;they don't make it like they used to!&quot; $150 appliance of that your parents or grandparents bought in 1965 is actually, adjusted for inflation, <a href="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=150.00&amp;year1=1965&amp;year2=2015" target="_blank">$1128 today</a>. So yea, I don't expect a $350 blendtec to be &quot;industrial grade&quot;. Even if material costs alone were 25% today what they were back then (the opposite is probably true, especially for motor windings), there's no possible way it could be built as sturdy as people think. </p>
<p>The problem is we all got used to seeing $20 shitblenders at walmart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh fuck I've been watching AvE for a couple years now and the guy is hilarious. Pretty sure he's either from Quebec or somewhere in the very northern US because he got drunk a few times and the french accent comes on THICK.</p>
<p>Really smart guy though and gives absolutely hilarious commentary with his tear downs and builds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have some electrically driven vacuum pumps in my lab that spin at 1500 Hz or 90 000 rpm. They're completely silent of course (they're in a vacuum), but they howl with a sound that cuts through you like a knife if the vacuum breaks while they're still running.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OerUxgOQ7UE" target="_blank">here</a> an example of some crazy dude starting one up in open air. That's the sound of pure horror right there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you're right, they do sound like air raid sirens. I guess the sound's apropriate because if yuo hear that when you're not supposed to (they hum a little bit when starting up or shutting down, even in vacuum) it usually means that something's royally fucked up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without protection, yes. He only does it for a very short moment so it never reaches above 50 RPM and thus there's no danger. In addition I know the exact type of pump he's using and the electronics tightly monitors the rpm rise, internal temperature and power draw. If anything is wrong with those parameters the pump will shut down to prevent damage. However, old models that do not have those protections will quickly overheat. It's much worse if a running pump suddenly goes from vacuum to atmospheric pressure though. If that happens too often to older models it carries the risk that the bearings explode and the blades get torn off which has interesting results for a pump running at 1500 rpm. More recent models use advanced magnetic balancing techniques to minimize vibration so they can handle it to some extent, but they still wear out and seize up very quickly if you do that too often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3,500rpm 3-phase induction motors are extremely common in industrial applications. These can be very quiet depending on what they are attached to. If you powered one up on a work bench it would emit nothing but a hum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he mixed up the wheel and motor rpms. If you Google &quot;Tesla rpms&quot;, most cite a theoretical limit of 16,000 rpm and around 6000-8000rpms in practice on the motor, but the wheels turn around 600rpm.</p>
<p>Everything I found seemed to be secondary sources, so I'm not sure where those numbers are actually coming from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It says on tesla website that the max rpm is 14 000. Which makes sense because normal cars are around 7 000 and up. </p></div>		</li>
