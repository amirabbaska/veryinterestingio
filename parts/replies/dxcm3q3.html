<p>Whistler waves are distinctive radio frequency noise produced by lightning, and seem more or less the same wherever you go. This makes it easy to find lightning</p>

<p>We have <a href="https://i.imgur.com/IySu47v.jpg" target="_blank">actual photos of lightning on Jupiter</a>, as well, as seen from above the clouds. </p>
<p>If you compare top and bottom of each of the 3 locations, you can see various individual pixels lit up, indicating lightning flashes. If you do some math about how bright those flashes are, you find that lightning on Jupiter is hundreds of times more energetic than lightning on Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is that it might help us better understand our own weather. Almost every model of earth's weather was created using earth's previous weather as a guideline. That's really informative, as long as future weather keeps looking like the old weather. However, once you start going outside the normal bounds of earth weather (like in climate change), you start to run out of predictive power: the models can't predict what they don't know about. Studying non-earth weather lets us see a whole different set of starting conditions that might help us improve our own understanding of unexpected weather.</p>
<p>Tldr: studying other planets gives us a better understanding of how all weather happens everywhere, which might let us predict our weather more accurately. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So here's the thing: Earth's weather is way more difficult to model than any other planet in our Solar System (and any other planet we currently know of in other solar systems, as well).</p>
<p>Why? For starters, Earth has atmosphere, and clouds, and land, and oceans, and ice caps...and they all interact in really non-linear ways. This makes any predictive forecast really sensitive to tiny immeasurable initial changes, making it almost impossible to figure out what the weather will be in a week.</p>
<p>Now compare that to Jupiter: there's atmosphere and clouds. The result is that if you know where the Great Red Spot was last week and you know where it is today, you can predict very accurately where it will be 6 months from now.</p>
<p>On top of that, you've also got the issue of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossby_radius_of_deformation" target="_blank">deformation radius</a> - the typical length scale of a wave or a vortex in the atmosphere. On Jupiter, the circumference of the planet is much, much bigger than its deformation radius, so atmospheric waves and vortices act pretty independently. On Earth, that's not the case - you can only cram in a few vortices around the globe, and they all interfere with each other. </p>
<p>My old advisor use to make this analogy as follows: imagine each vortex is a prima ballerina, and there are 6 of them turning pirouettes and spinning on the stage - it's elegant, beautiful, and captivating, like fine clockwork. That's Jupiter. Now stick those same ballerinas in an elevator and ask them to perform - there's limbs flailing, everyone's tripping over each other, etc. That's Earth.</p>
<p>The result is that by studying weather on other planets, we can often observe complex phenomenon in a simplified form, giving us deeper insight into how these systems actually work. The lessons learned have widespread use, and not just in climate science; for example, I've seen theorems about jet stability - originally formulated for use with Jupiter - being used to study plasma containment inside tokamak fusion reactors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, but there's a difference of scale here. The GRS is larger than Earth. There are hurricane-like formations that are the size of Earth. Predicting even something so large would be nearly impossible, and trying to model anything smaller <em>is</em> impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Listening to NPR I heard a women use a great analogy. That if we treat earth like a patient, you can see what is going on. But you maybe dont know why it is like this or where exactly its headed. You can make educated guesses on things but if you look to other patients (planets) you see all the different stages of things different reactions different circunstances blah nlah. Im bad at explaining but im sure you get the gist. It is pretty cool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone wondering what a perpetual storm is; it's an &quot;endless&quot; storm. Usually a location in which the conditions for a storm are almost always present and where storms are almost more frequent than not.  There is a place on on Earth where these conditions exist; Catatumbo, Venezuela where lightning has been recorded striking up to 28 times a minute. On average storms rage for 10 hour at a time 260 nights of the year </p></div>		</li>
