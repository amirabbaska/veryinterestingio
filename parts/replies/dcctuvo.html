<p>Please pardon the barrage of questions, but I have to ask... What, physiologically, makes this anticipation of a loud sound possible? Does it require that a person consciously observes or expects a noise? Or does this have more to do with the physics of sound? (Or is it both...) Also, is this basically what happens when I experience hyperacusis?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The primary &quot;anticipation of sound&quot; that your ear is preparing for is actually the sound of your own voice. It is essentially the only sound that comes from that side of your ears, and it is incredibly loud due to proximity to the ear and all its inner workings. Your brain can obviously anticipate when you are going to begin speaking, and it then tenses this muscle. </p>
<p>As far as outside sounds, your brain can anticipate sound getting louder, like in music. It cannot, however, anticipate sudden things such as gunshots or explosions. This is why you are more likely to have more damage with sudden very loud sounds. The &quot;hammer&quot; is not restricted and ends up banging very loud and hard which breaks of the hairs in your ear important for distinguishing different tones. </p></div>		</li>

<p>WoW! :D I can do that voluntary, any time, non stop!</p>
<p>I always wondered what that was! I can even control the intensity, make it sound like a loud nonstop thunder. And left and/or right ear.  </p>
<p>As a child I found it strange that other could not hear it :)</p>
<p>I'm 35 now and only now learn what it is!
Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
