			<div class="markdown"><p>If a frequentist views all probabilities as 0 or 1, then haven't they defeated the purpose of using probabilities in the first place? It seems like the Bayesian notion of probability being the 'degree of uncertainty' about a particular outcome is baked into the very definition of 'probability' itself. </p>
<p>Is there any useful way to think about probability from a frequentist perspective if it's all just 0's and 1's?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The frequentist perspective is that probability is the limit as the number of trials goes to infinity of the number of times a particular outcome happens, but any particular trial will have a definite outcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm afraid that this is a strawman, and worse, has nothing to do with how the actual computations would look like, and nothing with the actual differences.</p>
<p>If you tried to do the frequentist approach properly instead, you'd say that we should consider a large enough number of such experiments, and then consider the probability of finding the deck sorted. And you'll get the right result.</p>
<p>The actual differences are what the commenters above said, the interpretation of p-values etc.</p></div>		</li>
