			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The 'speed of light' is just the speed at which massless particles/waves travel. We only call it the speed of <em>light</em> because light was the first thing we discovered that travels at this speed, and is still the most familiar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Particles believed to be massless include the gluon and photon, and presumably the graviton. All of these travel at the speed of light in vacuum. The gluon is wonky since it cannot exist outside massive particles called hadrons, so you'll never actually observe a free gluon traveling in vacuum.</p>
<p>It is also possible but unlikely on grounds of &quot;it would be too goddamn weird&quot; that one and only one of the three neutrinos is massless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question, boo downvoters!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Electromagnetism, the strong force and gravity all travel at the speed of light. Electromagnetism &amp; strong force because their 'carrier' particles (the photon and the gluon) are massless. Gravity because general relativity says so (and the proposed graviton would have zero mass, but is not confirmed to exist).
The weak force, on the other hand, is mediated by massive particles (the neutral Z and charged W bosons). So the weak force actually propagates slower than the speed of light. There is no fixed speed, though, it depends on the energy of the interaction, essentially.</p>

<p>Here's the reddit link where I found the discussion and exact question where more explanation of this quote is debated: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/33wx4k/if_electromagnetism_has_a_speed_of_c_do_other/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/33wx4k/if_electromagnetism_has_a_speed_of_c_do_other/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>c Has become the norm, although other terms was previously used before it became the accepted term (like V). </p>
<p>In everyday parlance especially, &quot;speed of light&quot; is almost always used. Although it's important to remember that it doesn't just describe the speed at which light is travelling. But the speed which light happens to travel at. emphasis: the speed of waves in a vacuum.</p>
<p>If that makes any sense, I'm starting to ramble...

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that gravitational waves don't travel through an empty space, they travel through space itself. For gravitational waves to change velocity and thus to refract and reflect there should be different kinds of space with different &quot;space densities&quot;... (?)</p>
<p>I don't know I'm just rambling now. Interesting concept though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So... We measure space with distance. Don't perspective and frame of reference affect relative distance between objects in motion? Also, I'm kind of curious as to why gravity is treated differently compared to other forms of attraction. Isn't magnetism, like gravity, only observed through its effects? No background in science/physics, so sorry if any of this is wrong</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if they travel through space itself then what happens when gravitational waves interact with a gravity well? Wouldn't that be akin to traveling through a denser medium? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have only been a few experimental observations of gravitational waves, so there isn't going to be experimental observations of that. </p>
<p>I'm not sure if anybody has investigated this theoretically. General relativity is super hard, so there's a question if it could even be tractably modeled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think interaction with a massive medium could in principle affect the propagation speed of a gravitational wave. Gravitational waves can excite mechanical movement in matter, which in turn re-emits gravitational waves (similar to what happens when light travels through a dielectric medium). The problem is just that gravitational waves couple so weakly to any matter that this effect is utterly negligible.</p></div>		</li>
