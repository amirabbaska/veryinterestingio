			<div class="markdown"><p>Mutation occurs so quickly in nature that no more than five individuals of any strain of viruses should be expected to be genetically identical at any time. Immune recognition is based on antigen content, which is a great deal simpler than genetics, so even fairly different genetics can produce indistinguishable antigen patterns. We're not exactly sure how genetic diversity relates to antigen diversity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Damn. But if we were, wouldn't we be able to estimate cool things like how long a certain number of people would need to be isolated in order for the entire population to eradicate the virus completely and stuff like that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are so many different types of viruses out there. Making broad generalizations about viral genomes is just not accurate.</p>
<p>Many viruses have extremely stable genomes, where we can expect almost all of the viral particles in an organism to be completely identical. One example of a very genomically stable virus is the bluetongue viruses <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2459303" target="_blank">(source)</a>.  Some other viruses, like HIV, purposefully have mechanisms in place specifically for altering their genomes with every replication cycle, which means there is an extremely high mutation rate. An example of a virus somewhere in the middle is influenza, which mutates gradually throughout large host populations, but the viruses within an individual host will likely be identical.</p>
<p>Basically what I'm trying to say is, it's complicated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that's not exactly a good metric simply given the way our immune responses work. There is keying <em>not-this</em> and also keying on <em>this</em> or <em>this</em> or <em>this</em> etc.</p>
<p>What defines a unique virus seems to be destined for a semantics game.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So you are covered in billions of bacteria but it's OK they are all total bros. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Don't forget that viruses are generally very specific in which cells that they can use to replicate. Viruses that can infect human cells/cells with human DNA are fundamentally very different from viruses that infect E. Coli, for example.</p>
<p>More specifically, the vast majority of these viruses you're exposed to couldn't infect human cells even without an immune system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like he was doing biopanning which is a tactic where you use a phage solution with random end peptide groups. Some will have an affinity for a specific substrate. There's a long process by which you can amplify the phages that have this affinity and then use them to grow specific crystal structures from the substrate precursor.</p>
<p>This is a dramatic oversimplification of the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This likely would not work as planned; there are many very helpful bacteria, and accidentally killing them could cause harmful bacteria to gain a large foothold in an environment (this is the ideology behind probiotics as well; help good bacteria so that they can compete with harmful bacteria).</p>
<p>Even if you kill -all- bacteria, then you just end up with deadly fungi, which are also competing in that same space.</p>
<p>Overall, this just would not be an effective or ecologically sane way to approach large-scale treatment applications.</p></div>		</li>
