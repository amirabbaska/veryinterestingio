			<p>I'm not sure if OP meant unique viruses, if there be such a thing, but that's what I thought OP was asking. By unique I suppose I mean, having a different enough genome that the human immune system recognizes it as a different threat.</p>		</li>

			<p>Mutation occurs so quickly in nature that no more than five individuals of any strain of viruses should be expected to be genetically identical at any time. Immune recognition is based on antigen content, which is a great deal simpler than genetics, so even fairly different genetics can produce indistinguishable antigen patterns. We're not exactly sure how genetic diversity relates to antigen diversity.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; We're not exactly sure how genetic diversity relates to antigen diversity.<br><br>Damn. But if we were, wouldn't we be able to estimate cool things like how long a certain number of people would need to be isolated in order for the entire population to eradicate the virus completely and stuff like that?</p>		</li>

			<p>That would probably work for certain viruses, ones with more stable genomes, and ones that only infect humans. But if the virus is like Influenza and has an extremely variable genome, or if the virus infects other reservoirs, then I can't really see the eradication of the disease happening.<br><br>It probably also wouldn't be effective against retroviruses because they integrate directly into the host genome.</p>		</li>

			<p>The problem is often that viruses can often survive in animals (reservoir hosts) or the environment (usually ponds or the sea), making eradication nearly impossible. <br><br>That said, read up about the carpenter that visited the Faroe Islands and brought measles if you want an example of exactly what you described!</p>		</li>

			<p>There are so many different types of viruses out there. Making broad generalizations about viral genomes is just not accurate.<br><br>Many viruses have extremely stable genomes, where we can expect almost all of the viral particles in an organism to be completely identical. One example of a very genomically stable virus is the bluetongue viruses <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2459303" target="_blank">(source)</a>.  Some other viruses, like HIV, purposefully have mechanisms in place specifically for altering their genomes with every replication cycle, which means there is an extremely high mutation rate. An example of a virus somewhere in the middle is influenza, which mutates gradually throughout large host populations, but the viruses within an individual host will likely be identical.<br><br>Basically what I'm trying to say is, it's complicated. <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Very true. I need to get better at selecting sources. The information above is from an excerpt of a larger paper on zoonotic viruses, which are generally less stable by their very nature. I'm still trying to find the title page so I can credit it.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, that's not exactly a good metric simply given the way our immune responses work. There is keying <em>not-this</em> and also keying on <em>this</em> or <em>this</em> or <em>this</em> etc.<br><br>What defines a unique virus seems to be destined for a semantics game.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's not just your own immune system that is doing the winning, the bacteria that cover and fill your body are very happy with their current symbiotic living arrangements and will frequently hunt and kill down foreign invaders. <br><br>So you are covered in billions of bacteria but it's OK they are all total bros. </p>		</li>

			<p>I might be wrong but I'm pretty sure we can't engineer a virus to kill bacteria and not reproduce - the only reason it goes into a bacteria is to reproduce. Even if we could it would be useless because the bacteria would simply outpace it by reproducing and you'd never have enough of the virus to actually get rid of the bacteria, unless it was reproducing.<br><br>It's not a question of its end versus our end, it's a question of the mechanics of the interactions.. we can do some pretty cool stuff but it's all ultimately based in manipulating biological processes to our advantage, not dictating exactly how they happen. We are not gods.</p>		</li>

			<p>To my admittedly limited recollection from biology, viruses kill bacteria by invading them, then &quot;re-coding&quot; the bacteria to produce hella more virus copies. The copying process continues till the bacteria explodes, releasing the copies.<br><br>Changing a virus so that it doesnt reproduce would mean it no longer kills bacteria.</p>		</li>

			<p>The reason <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterile_insect_technique" target="_blank">the mosquito thing</a> works is because mosquitos require a male and a female organism to produce their next generation, and it happens to be possible to create a large amount of male mosquitos with damaged genes that still mate with wild, non-engineered, female mosquitos during their reproductive cycle. If the engineered males outnumber the natural males, this has the effect of causing the next generation of mosquitos in the wild to be significantly diminished, possibly to the point of population collapse.<br><br>Viruses don't work that way. They reproduce asexually by taking over the cellular machinery of their host organism. If we change the genome of one individual viral particle to be infertile, it won't reproduce, and it also won't affect any of the other viruses out there in the world because their asexual reproduction means that our experiment doesn't matter to their reproductive success in the slightest.</p>		</li>

			<p>Sounds like he was doing biopanning which is a tactic where you use a phage solution with random end peptide groups. Some will have an affinity for a specific substrate. There's a long process by which you can amplify the phages that have this affinity and then use them to grow specific crystal structures from the substrate precursor.<br><br>This is a dramatic oversimplification of the process.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Bacteriophages are species specific, meaning a phage that attacks cholera would not attack E. coli.  And some bacteria are resistant, so you couldn't kill them all. And many of the things in water that make us sick are viruses or spores like giardia.  <br><br>So bacteriophages wouldn't be good for sanitizing water.  Chlorine, ozone, uv and sand filters are cheaper and more reliable.  </p>		</li>

			<p>This likely would not work as planned; there are many very helpful bacteria, and accidentally killing them could cause harmful bacteria to gain a large foothold in an environment (this is the ideology behind probiotics as well; help good bacteria so that they can compete with harmful bacteria).<br><br><br>Even if you kill -all- bacteria, then you just end up with deadly fungi, which are also competing in that same space.<br><br><br>Overall, this just would not be an effective or ecologically sane way to approach large-scale treatment applications.</p>		</li>
