			<div class="markdown"><p>You're missing the important caveat that that binding energy <em>is</em> mass. That's what E=mc^2 means. Sure none of the nucleons themselves are destroyed in the conversion, but a single atom of uranium has ever so slightly more mass than its constituent decay products due directly to that binding energy, and that excess mass is what is directly converted to energy which is utilized during fission.</p>
<p>It sounds trivial to say binding energy is converted to other energy, but because energy and mass are one and the same, a particle with more binding energy does have more actual mass than one without, even if all the normal &quot;massive&quot; particles are conserved in the transition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Energy and mass are NOT one and the same. Mass has energy. Energy is a property of mass and the system its in. The mass-energy equivalence is just a formula used to calculate the very useful property of how much energy a particle system contains. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well okay, maybe one and the same was a bit too generous, but the difference between the two is more akin to kinetic energy vs thermal energy, rather than mass vs all other energy. Mass is but one manifestation of the abstract concept that is &quot;energy&quot;, of which there are many forms. Photons are an easy example of why energy is not simply a property of mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it's not. Combustion just transforms the intermolecular bond energy into heat and light. All the mass is accounted for in the products: carbon dioxide and water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, /u/SingleWordRebut is right - although we take mass conservation to be an approximation during essentially all chemical reactions, the energy that's released <em>does</em> have mass associated with it, and always did.  So there is a tiny mass deficit in the products.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is not really a conversion going on because the energy was present before as well.</p>
<p>And what does &quot;100%&quot; mean? A proton/antiproton annihilation typically produces a few pions, after some decays you end up with a few photons, 0-2 electrons, 0-2 positrons and a couple of neutrinos. Is that 100%? You still have some particles with mass around.</p></div>		</li>
