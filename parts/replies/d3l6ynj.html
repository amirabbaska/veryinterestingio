			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually makes sense as practically that's right, I don't want acid burns tbh. It's always interesting that others will interpret or explain the reasons behind something differently. One of the many reasons I love this sub. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, also, acid + water = heat. You don't want a bunch of hot acid splashing at you when it boils. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but this is by far not the actual reason!!! the actual reason is the extreme amount of heat which can be generated from diluting concentrated of even pure acids! it wont splash because you add it to fast, but it will splash because the first drop of water you add in instantaneously starts boiling resulting in you getting splashed not only with highly concentrated acid but with very hot highly concentrated acid!!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kinda funny. I work with concentrated, dangerous acids on an almost daily basis, and this rhyme and reasoning for it I heard in highschool is literally my main safety measure for it. There are a few others, but that's the main one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not really completely right. Certainly it's part of it, but there is a chemical reaction between the acid and water (when a base is added to an acid, or here when water, a relative base, is added to acid) that can cause a violent reaction. When acid is added to water, the reaction is less exothermic and doesn't react as violently. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Well the name of the Sub is &quot;explain like I'm five&quot;. It's pretty common in highschools and other entry level courses to explain something in a technically incorrect, but simpler, way to get the practical application across. For example all those electron pairs you drew out in HS chemistry aren't at all what the atomic picture looks like, but it's an accessible visualization to conceptualize bonding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was trying to sugar coat the fact that was he said was completely wrong because you're not concerned about splashing being caused by fluid transfer, but rather, you're concerned about a heavily exothermic reaction that causes violent eruption/effervescence. I decided against giving intense detail about the hydration reaction because it's ELI5, but rather just said there is a very violent reaction when a base is added first. </p>
<p>Let's break apart his answer, &quot;adding one liquid to another can cause it to splash,&quot; what if you poured one solution into another solution in a manner than did not cause splashing? With that answer, you might assume that it would be safe to do; however, it still wouldn't be safe to because that hydration reaction is still going to occur. Certainly you could tame it by icing the receiving vessel or using an addition funnel, but that reaction is still occurring. </p>
<p>We &quot;always add acid&quot; because the reaction is less violent than if we add base first. Even when I took high school chemistry, I was taught about the reaction. In college, I was given the same explanation. When I taught organic chemistry and general chemistry during my Ph.D., this was the explanation I gave students. Certainly we teach simplified rationales because it helps orient a student (such as basic bonding rather than MO theory), but this is a practical rule that should not be explained with a half-assed answer.</p></div>		</li>
