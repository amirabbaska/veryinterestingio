			<div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of complaints about the system but it would be fairly easy to fix if one were to look at airlines: your flight ticket is in your name and you cannot change that name no matter what unless you purchase a ticket that specifically allows that (which is often not available at all and if you can manage to purchase it it's expensive). returns are only possible to the original seller and come with pre-defined fees (i.e. 20% of ticket value). </p>
<p>it seems to me this would cut the whole scalping market at least in half, leaving only the really determined and connected to do their naughty ways. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This idea would cause huge lines at the event as ticket takers examined ID's. Plus most people buy two tickets not necessarily knowing who'll they'll take because you buy so far in advance. </p></div>		</li>

When your on the teams website and you click to get tickets it directs you to the ticket exchange not ticket master. It's so annoying to get the ticket master not resale you have to surf over to the website.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder how this isn't fraud against the band. The artists typically get a cut of ticket sales. If the venue sells tickets to a resale company and gets a kickback, doesn't that screw the artist out of the higher priced tickets?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's way more complicated than that. </p>
<p>For most major shows, the <strong>promoter</strong> is the one in control:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are buying the act, who demand a guarantee ($$$) to show up.</li>
<li>They are renting the venue/production elements required to put on that show according to specs provided by the artist, venues, and any laws or codes. Also any paid advertising or marketing initiatives. </li>
<li>The promoter sells tickets to the event in order to generate revenues to cover points 1 and 2 with enough leeway to have profit left at the end, making it a worthwhile business. </li>
</ol>
<p>Promoters take on the risk, which is why the trend is to have mega-huge corporate promoters (Live Nation, AEG, Feld INC) who can absorb losses if a tour flops, instead of a local show runner losing his shirt. </p>
<p>The &quot;face&quot; value of the tickets is usually agreed on by the artist, and 100% of that goes toward the show gross, all of the &quot;fees&quot; go to the other partners. Facility fee goes to the venue, and service fee goes to the ticketing provider (sometimes split with the venue also)</p>
<p>Some promoters will take some of the ticket inventory (which they control) and allocate it to certain programs or promotions which will generate fees payable directly to the promoter and not others. VIP packages are a very popular example, and another is thing like StubHub or Live Nation's platinum ticketing. </p>
<p>In the end, everyone is trying to squeeze whatever revenues they can out of an event to be able to generate profits in an industry where the margins are very narrow, and totally dependant on the whim of the concert-going public</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explains ticket prices very well, but I have a question. Why do I have to pay a convenience fee regardless of where I get the tickets from? I understand that printing at home is a huge convenience to me, and I don't mind paying a few extra dollars. But, I'm paying the same fee by getting up, putting clothes on, driving to the box office, standing in line, and buying the tickets. Why does the convenience fee exist if I've been inconvenienced in every way to get the tickets? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should also be mentioned that the trend in mega promoters exists because a band can schedule a whole tour with one organization and one set of management and have some continuity in their tour experience. </p>
<p>One of the downsides to touring is that you have no idea what kind of situation you are going to walk to. It could be amazing, or a total shitshow and you have almost no control. You also have to negotiate
20 contracts with 20 promoters with no guarantee they won't flake or screw up their commitments. </p>
<p>A big company can impose standards and take care of all the paperwork so you just go in, see the brown m&amp;m's in every greenroom, play your show and go to your hotel. No shade, no fighting for money, no fucked up facilities... I understand why touring above a certain level went corporate, because underground touring is a shitshow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes except for the fact that the only car manufacturer who actually sells cars is Tesla. The others just supply dealers. </p>
<p>And for the record, that too is retarded. As if cars weren't expensive enough we're just adding an unnecessary middle man who takes a cut of the price and tries his best to push all kinds of unnecessary extras on you. </p></div>		</li>
