			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in Amsterdam I took the Heniken brewery tour. At the end of the tour they give you free samples. The beer tasted great, not at all the way I remembered it. At that point I thought Heniken was my favorite beer. I got back to the states, buy a 6 pack, and after drinking one I was done. That shit is skunky as hell. I just wonder why it taste so different in holland</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heineken used to skunk on delivery to the US.  The US market associated the skunked Heineken with being a premium beer.  Heineken eventually fixed the skunking problem, but the US market didn't like the taste.  Fresh Heineken is how it's supposed to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, and this is especially true for craft brews and homebrews, which might still have active yeast cultures. </p>
<p>In that case, yeast autolysis is possible and that tastes absolutely disgusting, but it's a completely different phenomenon than skunking. Autolysis has a burnt rubber flavor, while skunking is suitably named. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does a keg go skunky if you don't drink it all the first night then? I've tried lots of different things, untapping and turning it upside down when we were done, etc. The only luck I've ever had at keeping it good for days was when I built a CO2 system using a paintball canister. When I did this, I could keep a keg fresh and delicious for at least a whole weekend. A buddy told me that's because a hand pump uses regular air, and some compounds in the beer oxidize, causing the beer to get skunky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using an air pump introduces unfiltered air and oxygen into a sealed environment that's fairly rich in nutrients and digestable sugars.</p>
<p>My hunch is that while it's not skunking specifically, you're starting to see some forms of biological contamination. There are a variety of bacteria that can impart distinctive flavors to beer, and some varieties actually do that on purpose (i.e. lambics)</p>
<p>Oxidization is a possibility, but I think the bacterial growth is probably more likely.</p>
<p>Air pumps are fine for parties where you don't want to derp with air tanks and regulators and just want to drink some beer, but if you're going to be storing it, you really should use a CO2 tank (or nitrogen, if the beer style calls for it). That will keep the level of carbonation consistent and minimize contamination risks. They can be rented too, but you'll have to check with a beverage distributor or gas supplier. Most beer stores don't carry them, and if you get kegs regularly, it's worth buying your own. They're not too expensive, and will last forever if they're taken care of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's 100% oxidation, if you're introducing bacterial contamination via a hand pump like that it'll take longer than a day to manifest. In addition it'll likely taste sour not skunky.</p>
<p>The reason most draft systems use beer gas or co2/nitrogen is because neither will impact the flavor of the beer, oxygen will cause flavors to oxidise giving it a papery taste.</p>
