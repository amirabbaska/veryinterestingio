			<div class="markdown"><p>When I get really upset I get FREEZING cold. Like, my fingernails turn blue and I'm so cold I feel nauseous and can't stop shivering. I once turned the shower on all the way hot and stood there for ten minutes but I couldn't warm up. It wasn't until I could calm down that I started to warm up again. This happens every once in a while, but only when I'm really really upset. I don't understand why this happens </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dang it. It's so weird and really uncomfortable. I'll be in an 80 degree room under blankets and I physically feel freezing cold and my lips and nails are blue. I'll just have to keep working on calming myself when it happens. </p></div>		</li>
