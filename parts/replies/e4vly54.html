			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens if the anchor hooks on to a huge rock or something and they are not able to bring the anchor back up? Does that ever happen?   Let's say it dragged across the sea bed and inconveniently got hooked between 2 huge rocks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anchors are rarely ever &quot;stuck&quot;, even on a rocky bottom. And yes, cutting the anchor is a last resort. They are very expensive, especially on ships.</p>
<p>To answer the OP, noone anchor in open ocean. Far too deep. Swim calls are held on them &quot;flat ass calm&quot; days and its done by going dead ship. With little wind,  there is no leeway on the ship, and bodies and ships will drift at the same rate if the only force on them is current.</p>
<p>PS, i miss swim calls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aldo worth pointing out that the anchor in the emoji is wrong even for than type. The cross bars should be perpendicular to the flukes (the hooks) so that when the anchor is being dragged they make it too so that the hooks dig in. If they were in line as per the emoji the anchor would just lie flat on the seabed and slide along it.</p></div>		</li>
