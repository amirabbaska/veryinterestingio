			<div class="markdown"><p>Jumping in here as I'm currently pregnant with donor eggs. The rough cost now is a standard $20-25,000 depending on clinic and their protocols. It doesn't go by eggs retrieved (because you have to pay up front and there's no way to know. Sometimes they may get 10, another time they may get 50). I know at my clinic the anonymous donor &quot;pocketed&quot; $4,000 of it and the rest went to covering the stimulation meds, monitoring, and retrieval/fertilization process. Science blows my mind, but I am eternally grateful for the advances!</p>
<p>It also gives me so much hope to hear your experience of your donor egg baby grown up. I'm slightly worried about that lost biological connection, but the longer the pregnancy goes the closer I feel.</p></div>		</li>
