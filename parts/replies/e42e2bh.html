			<div class="markdown"><p>Paralytic venom (generally neurotoxin) is often still lethal, since it commonly causes respiratory depression and suffocation.</p>
<p>Animals that paralyze prey without otherwise harming it include arthropods like wasps, who leave the target perfectly intact, then lay eggs in/on it, but do not eat it directly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neurotoxins the true nightmare fuel. </p>
<p>First comes the inability to move quickly.
Then labored breathing, followed by...
No moving, pain still registers
Then no breathing, still alive until you pass out.</p>
<p>The worst part is that there are worse toxins out there than <em>just neurotoxin</em>.  Like the animals and snakes that use hemotoxins as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our dog was chasing a ball when she landed on a Copperhead. She got the ball and ran off to play! I couldn't understand why the snake didn't strike her. Turns out it was busy trying to regurgitate a large toad it had just swallowed, which it succeeded in doing. So my dog was lucky, and the uninjured toad was lucky, too, as it got to live another day. The snake was set free in a swampy area away from our home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some snakes are simple “overpowerers” which do not construct or envenom. They grab the pray, sometimes wrap semi tight to hold them and then just swallow while it’s still alive. This includes garter snakes and non venomous freshwater snakes (at least in the norththeast US)</p>
<p>Edit: that is incorrect apparently garters do have a mild venom that may paralyze</p></div>		</li>
