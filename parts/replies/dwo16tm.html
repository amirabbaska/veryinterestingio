			<div class="markdown"><p>In my physics lab last week we used monochrometers, which allow only a narrow range of wavelengths of light through a filter. So you shine white light and get red or green or blue. When you adjust it beyond the range of human vision it gets dimmer until you can't see it. It's a fairly sharp transition.</p></div>		</li>
