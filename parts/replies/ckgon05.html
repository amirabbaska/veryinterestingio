			<div class="markdown"><p>This means that Zincolns and copper pennies have a difference in mass of slightly more or less(there are of course variances in mintage and wear) than half a gram.  During the penny's history, the coin has gotten smaller on multiple occasions(most of which were long before the 1900s).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I noticed most of the replies to this question are concerning the weight of the different years of pennies, but I think what's more relevant is how much more brittle the newer (higher zinc / less copper) pennies are.  For instance the older ones were pliable enough to be bent and make a nice make-do shim for a loose battery cable end on your car.  The newer ones (after sometime in the 1980's or so) will reward you with two 1/2 Â¢ pieces for your trouble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: if accounting for the squishing of all pennies, but not their accumulated momentum as they move downwards, the entire stack would be squished by 25%. Further, the momentum from the pennies falling would squish even more, and the pennies will have virtually no air resistance.</p>
<p>Longer: They would be squished even lower than predicted. Assuming the tower can be held together, the squishing would cause all the pennies to move downward, thus giving them momentum.</p>
<p>Using rough estimates from the parent comment, and rounding the normal penny height to .060&quot; (making this easier, because a squished penny is then half as thick as a normal penny), then each penny in the stack is squished to somewhere between half it's height and normal height. We can safely assume that the basic squishing force and effect steadily decreases from the bottom to the top. So, a penny in the middle will be squished to 75% of normal thickness.</p>
<p>In the end, this averages out to reducing the total height of the stack by 25%.</p>
<p>Interestingly, because the stack is consistent, the pennies will have almost no air resistance as they fall (though they will face &quot;I dont want to be squished&quot; resistance from the lower pennies, which might be equal to the speed of sound in the penny, as a rough guess). So, the momentum could be a VERY big component and squish the stack considerably more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. When I'm not busy I'll use calculus to approximate a more accurate answer compensating for gravity. </p>
<p>Edit: Using calculus I get a a answer only nominally larger (0.1%) than OPs. The uncertainty in other variables (density, etc) likely affects the results more than gravity does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It would be a tricky calculation to do accurately because pennies would be squished by various amounts. Pennies above a certain threshold wouldn't be crushed at all. Metallic objects only begin to deform once pressure crosses its elastic threshold, and the person didn't do a test to determine what that threshold is for pennies. Once you cross that threshold, the amount of deformation would be fairly proportional with the pressure applied.</p>
<p>Given that he found deformation with a pressure of 22,000 psi and the target pressure is 170,000 psi, then the great majority of the tower of pennies would be deformed (so the total tower height would be significantly less than 14 miles).</p>
<p>Another complication is the surface area would increase as the pennies are deformed. To reach the target psi, you would need even more pennies than he previously calculated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of corrections:</p>
<p>1: All objects deform to some degree under any loading. (No threshold for deformation)</p>
<p>2: The linear response occurs initially </p>
<p>3: After the load threshold is reached a nonlinear response occurs. (This is most likely what you were thinking of as materials will deform significantly more after this load threshold is reached.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Wrong.  They deform elastically before they cross their elastic threshold.  They retain plastic (permanent) deformation after this.</p>
<p>The thing he's asking about is feasible with some math on paper, but it's a Fuck It Friday for me so I'm not doing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you linearize the deformation the way that the original answerer did, it really isn't that tricky. It's just basic calculus:</p>
<p>Each penny would be under the force of the weight of every penny above it. Skipping over some of the mass/force calculations and just using the figures given by the original answerer (deformation rate of 0.000000175&quot; per psi and 0.0106 psi per penny), you get a deformation rate of about 1.85E-9 inches per penny above the one that's being deformed. Integrate 1.85E-9 inches per penny from 1 to 16,172,452 pennies, and you get a total deformation of roughly 3.8 miles. So, just take the 14.3 miles and subtract the 3.8 miles to get 10.5 miles.</p>
<p>Of course, none of that really matters because the assumption of linear deformation that the original answerer made is wrong. You'd need to consider the stress-strain curve of the material in question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The penny is also placed into a small groove on the bottom wheel, and the top one has a die that slides right into it. Then there's a whole lot of gear reduction going on with those machines. While you may turn the big crank 20 times or so, the pressing wheels may only turn a few degrees. This means a lot of &quot;easy&quot; long-distance work (20x easy turns) gets turned into a small amount of &quot;hard&quot; short-distance work (few degrees at a lot of psi).</p></div>		</li>
