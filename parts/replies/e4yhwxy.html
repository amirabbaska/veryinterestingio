			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought you simply increased your speed, pulled up on hut front on the bike, and ramped up over the car ahead in those situations, it’s way safer.  Then you swing that baby around, and it’s just screaming in a sick 180 burnout that whips your long untamed hair around. The sun is setting, and for a moment, lights it up like otherworldly filament.  Everyone on the busy interstate was entranced by the sight—some even smiled—when you jammed on it, ramped <em>back</em> over the car and also you’re firing off a badass, silenced, scoped uzi that’s been your trusty companion through this whole wild ride.  That’s what real friendship looks like, if you ask mr.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was always told hugging the inside of a turn was dangerous too though because if a dumb driver, which is common, crosses the center line in a turn they can hit you on a bike head on and instantly kill you. Riding a bike def takes skill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no always.<br />
It always depends on the traffic.<br />
If you are in the middle lane, you can't just hug one side without risk of someone from that side. If you are on the left or right, it depends if you feel what the car / bike next to you do, and adjust accordingly.<br />
Adjusting yourself to the traffic is what you need to do, not put rules that can get you injured.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume you mean the outside? Inside would be in the direction of the turn, away from the other lane.</p>
<p>Edit: People are for some reason confused by this. </p>
<p><em>Inside</em> of a turn has always meant the direction of the turn, regardless of where you are or your position on the road, it's not the same as Inside/Outside lane. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean I'm not the guy you're replying to, but... no? Inside and outside changes with different perspectives (also has a different technical meaning). Direction of the turn/curve, which side of the road you drive on, etc. Inside and outside can also refer to your placement between traffic lines on a turn/curve. For instance, a biker in America riding a curve that goes to the left while hugging the interior traffic lines would simultaneously be hugging the inside TOWARDS the other lane.</p></div>		</li>
