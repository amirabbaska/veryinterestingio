<p>I guess I would qualify as an expert, and you are pretty much spot on.</p></div>		</li>

A battery has a certain voltage. E. g.  a full lithium battery has 4,2V, an empty has around 3,6V.  When the voltage drops too far the device will shut off or crash (because it got unstable due to the low voltage).
Howevee there is a very important part to the voltage: the actual voltage depends on more things  </p>
<ol>
<li>kind of battery and state of charge (e. g.  lithium 3,6 to 4,2V)  </li>
<li>The voltage will drop under load.  The higher the load is and the worse the battery is (= internal resistance) the more voltage will drop.<br />
E. g.  a battery with 1 ohm of internal resistance that outputs 1 A of current will have a voltage drop of 1V ( because 1 * 1 = 1).  This voltage drop has a near instantaneous correlation with the current.<br />
So where is this heading with smartphones?
When your battery gets old the internal resistance rises,  and so the voltage drop under load rises as well.<br />
Imagine having a full battery: 4,2V. The user starts a program that needs a lot of power.  The voltage drops to e. g.  3,7V.  This isn't good,  but you're still in the safe voltage.   The device will continue to run.<br />
New scenerio: the battery is nearly empty,  10% charge left at 3,65V. When a heavy load occurs now the voltage will drop to e. g.  3,1V. A voltage lower than the device can handle: it'll crash</li>
