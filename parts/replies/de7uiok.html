<p>So it seems dopamine is highly elevated prior to ejaculating to porn, and then comes crashing down afterwards, and by doing that we are actually killing our dopamine receptors and weak neurons in the brain and it's all because of the abnormal hit of dopamine.</p>

<p>So you make it sound like dopamine just floods the brain which over stimulates dopamine receptors and kills neurons. This is entirely wrong. First off neurotransmitter release is localized and tightly regulated at synapses. Second having &quot;too much&quot; dopamine released would result in a post-synaptic signal sent to the soma for integration to determine whether or not an action potential is to propagate down the axon. The worst you can do to a neuron by stimulation is use up it's energy stores and require it to relax and wait for more energy to be produced. However you will not kill the neurons. Your explanation is wrong. </p></div>		</li>
