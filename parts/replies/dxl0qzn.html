			<div class="markdown"><p>How do things get complicated in the first place?  If everything crumbles to dust eventually, how did solar systems form?  Life itself seems to be evolving into more and more complex forms as time goes forward, seemingly going against entropy.  I don't understand how this can be if entropy is always increasing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that it is all dependent upon the level of active energy present.  We are still running off of the Big Bang and the initial burst of energy that created out universe.  The increasing complexity is the problem, or rather the action that drives this.  The universe is making more complex elements, but it does it with a star as a forge, a pretty big energy expenditure.  We are organizing energy into greater concentrations of energy but this is accomplished by converting incomprehensible amount or already organized energy in a less complicated form into less complex forms of energy like heat and light.  It’s is a net loss of complexity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>life can be complex because of the constant influx of the suns energy... if the earth was knocked out of orbit by a passing star, and flung into deep space, almost all complex life on the planet would halt within weeks.  we may use tech to survive longer, but eventually...</p>
<p>earth is like a phone, and the sun is like the battery.  your phone can do some AMAZINGLY complex things.  but never forget where it's getting to power to do so.  no battery, no complexity.</p>
<p>entropy is always increasing in the universe as a whole... certain small  pockets can go against the grain... but eventually, they'll give out as well.</p>
<p>FINAL TIDBIT: read the amazing short story &quot;THE LAST QUESTION&quot;, it is one of the most perfect thought experiments on this problem ever written IMO.  you can finish it in an hour. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question - I saw an awesome video explaining it on PBS Space Time.  Basically the answer is that complexity can arise where there is a difference in energy distribution as it shifts towards equilibrium.  They explain it much better here: </p>
