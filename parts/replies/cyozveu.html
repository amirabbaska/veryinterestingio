			<div class="markdown"><p>why would the normal force cause the irregular shape to rotate? Imagining an elongated cube, it seems like it wouldn't rotate (but the flat bottom would stabilize it even if it tried); imagining an egg, it seems like it would rotate (but I think that's just friction making its way back into my imagination). Please help so I don't stay up thinking about this tonight :|</p></div>		</li>
