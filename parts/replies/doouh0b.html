But are diet and nutrition in the first five years still the primary determinant of adult height when malnutrition is not in the picture?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Age 0, there's plenty of material that the <em>baby</em> should be drinking mother's milk but I'm not sure how solid information on what the <em>mother</em> should be eating is going to be. In the US, a huge problem is the amount of corn and corn syrup that gets into everything and there's plenty of studies on the negative effects of <em>that</em>.</p></div>		</li>
