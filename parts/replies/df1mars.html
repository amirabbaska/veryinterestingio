			<div class="markdown"><p>You are welcome :) As far as culture shocks are concerned, this was one of the biggest that I encountered as I moved out of India for higher education. Though it would never come up for discussion for obvious reasons. In India, we even have a hybrid of Indian and western-style lavatory which are becoming common these days, in which you can either squat or sit as per your preference. It makes much sense as people get old and have joint problems or obesity, squatting could become a problem. </p></div>		</li>

<p>toilets like you have in europe are pretty common in asia these days. i'm from pakistan, and most homes, even not-so-rich-ones, have both european style toilets and squatting toilets. and they usually have a hose that you can take and spray water at your bum with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense too - if you got poop on your hands/legs/literally anywhere else on your body would you simply wipe with a dry toilet paper and call it a day? Why should it be any different in an area that breeds bacteria more readily? Water is far more sanitary! Those wipes are an attempt at that but theyre just massively not eco friendly so those bidet toilets seem like a better next step in sanitation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are your thoughts now on water/soap vs toilet paper?</p>
<p>I've had western people make the opposite transition who described it like getting poo on your arm and wiping it off with paper: Nobody in western culture would consider that to be a clean enough solution, yet for our bums it apparently is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water/soap is a lot more hygienic than TP. You've probably just been conditioned to feel like your bum is cleaned after using TP, but as someone grown up with bidets and jet sprays, it really isn't and you can feel it. As for getting poo on your hand, that doesn't happen because there is a constant flow of high pressure water cleaning you as you go about your washing. I've had A LOT more disgusting moments accidentally having my TP ripped apart and getting a bit of poo on my fingers. Damn the thought makes me wanna throw up. Also, you wash your hands with soap right after too. </p>
<p>That being said, I live in US now and use TP exclusively and over time my hole got used to the feeling of not being clean all the time and now I barely notice it. There's still always some lingering stink though, which is disgusting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am still not completely comfortable with just wicking away with toilet paper. At home, I still use water to clean up. If I ever have to use toilet in office or somewhere in a public space, I have learnt to adjust. But I still have to clean up when I am back home to feel OK. But then, it's also about how we were conditioned to react to certain things and it's a cultural thing, so I am not passing a judgement. </p>
<p>In terms of hygiene, it's a fact that cleaning up with water and soap is always way better than just wiping off with paper as the fecal remains form a hotbed of bacterial activity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's not so much about being conditioned. I've been using TP exclusively for 2 years now cause of convenience and although I'm pretty comfortable with it, there's still always some lingering stink and your butt hole doesn't feel as clean and fresh after. Water is a better option and a lot of westerners are seeing that too!</p></div>		</li>
