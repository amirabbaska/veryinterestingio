			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, not all cancer survivors are banned.  You have to wait 12 months (because they want to make sure you are healthy), but a lot of people with certain cancers can donate once cured.  But they do ban leukemia and other types of cancers from donating for life, mostly just for the reasons you stated, to be extra careful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is understandable but also infuriating because in my 153 days in hospital I received 200+ units of blood and platelets and can't return the favour of donating those incredibly crucial materials now that I'm in remission and have been for 12 years</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't think of it as infuriating. I know you want to help, but you need switch your thinking to &quot; i can help keep the blood supply safe&quot; because as much as you want to help some one by giving them blood, but if they get sick because of it, it's kind of counterproductive </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solid organs definitely, but cancer cells aren't vastly shed in urine or semen or spit but hey anything is possible. Delivering cells directly from blood to blood avoids a lot of immunological barriers as opposed to ingesting some saliva or other bodily fluids that could be contaminated as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possible, but very unlikely. As others have stated above, the cancer would have to have mutated to avoid immune detection and your immune system would also probably have to be unable to recognize foreign human cells as non-self - so a perfect shit storm of bad luck and immune compromise would have to happen. Or just bad luck. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this is true because any cells with DNA would have to deal with the same genetic markers like organ transplant. They would be rejected, but in small amounts it would be like a mild flu and done I think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's radiation in the body, if I'm looking at what I think you are showing me. I'm pretty sure they separate out blood into platelets and plasma and RBC. PLUS, since blood doesn't really have DNA, they sterilize blood with radiation. Chemo might be a different story.</p></div>		</li>
