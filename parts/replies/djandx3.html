			<div class="markdown"><p>It may not be easy, but it is possible. Fire investigations are kind of like archaeological digs. There are layers of everything, and by digging through the layers, peeling them away piece by piece, investigators are able to determine where items were, at which point they fell, etc. </p></div>		</li>

Pretty much like an airplane crash, I'd think</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In many cases they don't.  Fire investigation techniques are good enough to determine a probable cause, but they're not reliable enough to depend on for a court case.  Scientific American did <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-we-trust-crime-forensics/" target="_blank">a good writeup</a> on the problems associated with forensic science being used in arson investigations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recent research suggests that they don't. Determinations of arson (by use of accelerants) by fire investigators is highly questionable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how they reach that conclusion. If it's solely a judgement call based on visual clues, then yeah that's questionable. For instance, some polymer flooring materials can melt during a fire and form burning pools of molten plastic that leave pretty much identical marks to what you expect to find if someone poured gasoline on the floor.</p>
<p>We always take samples to be chemically analyzed (i think by gas spectroscopy?) in order to verify or disprove any theories of accelerant use. Control samples must be taken from spots where you don't suspect anything, and of course there may be benign reasons for an accelerant to be present (like a bottle of lamp oil or booze or whatever stored somewhere near where the fire started).</p>
<p>Most importantly fire investigation must always be done as a process of elimination, trying to disprove all possible causes until you're hopefully only left with one. Starting with a theory and trying to prove it is a recipe for miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p>Oh, and people do sometimes set stuff on fire for the insurance money. Oftentimes they get away with it too- but greed often gets them eventually. Statiastically few people suffer more than one fire in their lifetime, so when a guy files his sixth fire insurance someone is going to ask pointed questions (real world example there; one man claimed to have lost multiple boats and buildings in mysterious fires over a couple of decades. The fires would always start when some renovation project ground to a standstill or expensive repairs were needed).</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is where witness statements, and circumstances, and interviews come in. Was homeowner complaining on facebook about how he really wanted to update his kitchen, but didn't have the money? Did the homeowner recently call their insurance company to make sure they had fire insurance, or to increase their policy amount? Have there been any recent fights between residents? Any mental health issues? Any previous fire incidents?</p></div>		</li>
