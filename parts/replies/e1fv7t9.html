			<div class="markdown"><p>This ruling eliminates &quot;shop&quot; or &quot;agency&quot; fees for public sector unions. Because it is based in the premise that all public sector union activity is political, and thus compelling people to pay for that activity is a 1st amendment violation, it has no effect on private sector unions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotcha. I’ve really only seen Twitter and Reddit headlines and haven’t really delved into the articles. Thanks. </p>
<p>ELI5...a Public Sector Union would be a government job, and then private sector would be like the UAW, IBT, etc.?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right. Unions representing people who work for any level of government are affected by this ruling. Unions representing people in non-government positions are not effected. I hesitate to separate it out by union org (UAW, IBT, etc) because it's really a shop-to-shop distinction. UAW, for example, has both public and private sector members (as they represent grad students at State Universities). The public sector members of UAW will be affected by this and the private sector members (at GM, for example) will not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was based on the premise that unions were overcharging non members for activities not actually part of collective bargaining. In the case this was evidently true and given my own Union's shop fees are 90% of full dues.... Seems like they're onto something suggesting that unions have been screwing over the non members.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The unions are obligated by federal law to bargain for all workers in their unit, members or not. </p>
<p>Non members either need to pay the fuck up or fuck off and negotiate their contracts entirely aside from the union. </p></div>		</li>
