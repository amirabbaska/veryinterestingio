<p>Once all this work is done, Marketing looks at the numbers of people playing splitscreen and decides it's not worth doing all this work on the next game.</p>

<p>Setting all else aside, this is what everyone in this thread is missing.</p>
<p>The people who go onto gaming forums (or just internet forums in general) and ask these sorts of questions are <strong><em>BY FAR</em></strong> the minority.  Nobody today gives a crap about split-screen gaming.  At least, &quot;nobody&quot; as in not enough people to even remotely make a blip on the sales radar of a AAA game today.</p>
<p>The reason nobody makes split-screen games anymore?  It's a waste of money for them to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A while back I replayed Crash Team Racing. I still have the original disc and I noticed things I never really noticed as a kid. So many things removed and look so bad on split screen. I think I kinda noticed Roo's tubes had no fish skeletal thing on the final stretch but there are all kinds of things removed so that it could render split screen. Things people would probably notice more now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'At least twice the computing power' does not seem believable to me. I mean...it definitely takes more. But you're not rendering two 1920x1080 screens.</p>
<p>So you're drawing two scenes...but it's two half-resolution cropped-FOV scenes. Really seems like it should be doable in most games with just a little finesse. I think people who want splitscreen would rather play with the LOD turned down a notch than not at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on where the bottlenecking the engine is. If the game is limited only by pixel fill rate (i.e. how many pixels it can colour in in a single frame) then split screen won't take much more work as you still have to colour in 1920x1080 pixels). But if the bottle neck is in the draw calls, (each draw call is essentially a function call to tell the GPU &quot;Hey please draw this model, at this position from this point of view&quot;) then split screen doubles the number of draw calls as you need to tell the GPU to draw everything twice once from each point of view. (I'm ignoring frustum culling and other subtleties because this is not /r/explaininglikeimacompscimajor).</p>
<p>Interestingly when rendering for VR you essentially do split screen as you need to render each eye from a slightly different viewpoint, and the recent popularity of VR has pushed for the creation of new APIs to enable a GPU to render the same scene from multiple viewpoints with a single set of draw calls. &quot;Hey GPU draw this model at this position, from each of these viewpoints&quot;. An enterprising developer could use these new functions, which were intended for VR and repurpose them to efficiently render split screen games and drive a resurgence in couch co-op.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CPU's are the main issue this generation. Even the Xbox X is only a slight improvement over last gen in the CPU department. The consoles GPUs are more then capable of rendering two versions. It's the extra work the terrible CPUs have to do with modern games that is the issue. </p>
<p>And that is what happens when you use a tablet CPU for gaming. </p></div>		</li>

<p>No its not.  Current consoles are extremely underpowered at the moment with many games struggling to run on them.  For the PS4, developers have to work with the constraints of a sub $70 GPU, 8 GB of shared memory, and a garbage laptop CPU.  Having a co-op mode increases those constraints immensely.   </p>
<p>Unless AAA games begin to have higher budgets and demand for co-op games increases, developers are going to ignore co-op as it is an added bonus for most games.</p></div>		</li>
