			<div class="markdown"><p>linking 2001 with Silent running is Douglas Trumbull. He worked special effects on both. Originally they wanted the Discovery to go to Saturn, but they couldn't do a good depiction of it. When Silent Running came around, Douglas had figured out how to do it by 'painting with light'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason they wanted to go to Saturn is in the book version that's where they went, not Jupiter. The 2010 book version also uses Saturn instead of Jupiter. They had to alter it in the script which is why  there's the divergence between the film and the book even if the author of the book had a hand in the first movie.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the author of the book</p>

<p>Do you mean hugely celebrated and influential, prolific science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke? Sorry, just seems odd to refer to such a well-known figure so anonymously. “During the American Civil War, the president at the time gave a speech.”</p>
<p>Also, in 2010 the novel, the Discovery was already changed to be next to Jupiter to match the first film.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a bit of an understatement - the book was written for the purpose of turning it into the script for the film, so I imagine they were more or less writing the two simultaneously. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that the styling is very heavily 1960s, although it's mostly so well designed and so iconic that it still stands up as looking good, rather than dated, today. Good design is timeless, not to mention cyclical - who's to say that 60s modernist style won't come back around by the time we have commercial space travel?</p>
<p>One aspect I find interesting is 2001's use of typography. It <a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/2014/01/31/2001-a-space-odyssey/" target="_blank">literally sets the standard</a> for sci-fi lettering which is still in use today.</p>
<p>People still use Eurostile Bold Extended because it looks futuristic and it looks futuristic in no small part <em>because it was in 2001</em>.</p></div>		</li>
