			<div class="markdown"><p>That situation has never come up. So we don't know what would happen based on past events.</p>
<p>It's <strong>probably</strong> safe to assume that the President cannot be arrested for crimes committed prior to entering the office, because the only ones who <em>can</em> hold the President accountable for his actions are Congress through Impeachment, and the General Public in the next election.</p></div>		</li>
