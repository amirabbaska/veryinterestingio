			<div class="markdown"><p>Well for one thing, we need just about as much sodium as potassium in our bodies. The Sodium Potassium Pump which allows neurons to work uses both ions, yet normal table salt only contains sodium. This isn't usually a problem I guess (cause we get potassium from foods like bananas), but I believe hypernutrimia is often caused by depletion of potassium ions before depletion of sodium. A chemist once told me that if we wanted to be healthier, we would fill our salt shakers with 2/3 sodium chloride, 1/3 potassium chloride to keep the right stochiometry in our bodies. Not sure if this is true or not...</p>
<p>Edit: low potassium levels is called hypokalemia, so I'm not sure how true it is that potassium levels fall alongside sodium levels when we drink too much. Quick, someone who knows better than me: is this right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that, but the Na+/K+ pump is in almost every cell in your body, not just in electrically active cells like muscles and neurons. A great example of this is in the intestine, where a energetically unfavorable sodium gradient is created (lots more in the lumen of the gut than in the epithelia) and a protein that is called a co-transporter that must bind both sodium and glucose facilitates the uptake of sugar into your blood. Even though glucose concentration is higher in the intestinal lumen compared to the blood, the high sodium gradient drives sugar into your bloodstream! And you are right /u/TiHKALmonster </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your kidneys will kick out extra salts, but I think the major issue has to do with tonic cells. Briefly, too much salt and they wrinkle up, no salt and they blow up like balloons. Also salt makes the blood thicker and harder to pump putting more stress on the heart. But to maybe answer the original question, generally potassium is less soluble in water by about 50% so the body will remove sodium more. Just drink enough water and getting to much of either can be less of an issue too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here. One thing I have realized is it's probably not a good idea to listen to advice, or at least medical advice, from reddit. There are a lot of smart people using reddit, but clearly this is not their area of expertise. As for the original question; &quot;why is sodium listed but not salt?&quot;, the guy above answered that pretty good. Basically, not all salts are sodium salts (specifically sodium chloride). &quot;Salt&quot; is the layman's term but usually what is important is the sodium. Why isn't chloride listed? I don't know that's an interesting question, people don't usually give a shit about chloride unless you have a relatively uncommon disorder. For the most part, if you're talking about &quot;salt&quot;, you're talking about sodium chloride, and as someone mentioned it's the sodium component of that which can cause a problem over time. Fluid retention and hypertension being the predominant concerns for the general public. As far as &quot;half salt&quot;, I've never heard of it until now. Can't say it's safer or better for you since I don't know anything about it. But if you're concerned enough about your health to go out and buy &quot;half salt&quot;, I would hope you are already eating a relatively healthy diet and getting regular exercise. Stop smoking, and drink less alcohol. I wish I could say I was drinking less but you can't win at everything. Anyway, if you're not doing the basics you have no business adding &quot;half salt&quot; to your diet and thinking you're making a dent in life. As for talks about sodium-potassium ATPase pumps and ion channels and cystic fibrosis... wtf??? That's like someone asking about their plumbing problems in the kitchen and you commenting on hydrogen bonding as a cause. It's just not the issue at hand. Trying not to hate, but the questions are very general and the answers are too specific. And wrong. Not always factually wrong, just not answering the questions. I just wouldn't introduce these responses into a conversation if you someday find yourself talking about salt or chloride.  It will be pretty obvious you don't understand the questions. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is the link between sodium and hypertension based on recent research or is it just theoretical?</p>
<p>What I've Learned (YT channel) just did a sodium episode the other day and I remember seeing others claiming that many people might actually need to eat more sodium, rather than less. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't have to be. The salt term in chemistry just refers to a substance bound by ionic bonds. When you are talking about food / nutrition, we understand salt to mean the particular salt, NaCl since you trust when you sit down at a restaurant they don't put any &quot;salt&quot; in the salt shaker, they just put table salt. In Chemistry you may reference other things which are also salts, but you would know based on context whether or not you were referring to salts more generally. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Really? That's not a definition we ever used. Salt was specifically a non water product from an acid/base reaction where the base's cation (or other metallic cation) replaced the acidic proton. So NaCl is the result of HCl + NaOH, as an example.</p>
<p>Using that quoted bit probably would have made it stick better for some students, but it's honestly not how it was ever put (for us)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iodine is a trace element we need in very small amounts. It is added to table salt as a convenient means of distribution to the masses. See <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodised_salt" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> for a basic primer on iodized salt.</p>
<p>As far as salt being a nutrient, it is. That does not mean it's nutritious, only that it is something the human body absorbs from the diet. It is used in many body processes as described in the other comments. As with anything, an excess of sodium or potassium is harmful. See the health warnings associated with Half Salt before using, as it is not safe for everyone.</p></div>		</li>
