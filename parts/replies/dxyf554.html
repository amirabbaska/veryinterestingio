			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar story for me, but not for sleep apnea, I had anxiety issues. Long story short, I didnt truly REM deeply for almost a decade. First week on medication I ended up in the ER overnight as I thought I was having schizophrenia symptoms. </p>
<p>Turns out those are just dreams.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait wait wait hold on here. There is a chance I have just not been getting real sleep? I haven't remembered a real dream in like 8 years should I get sleeping pills?</p>
<p>Edit: rereading makes me think you got anxiety pills. Maybe I should do that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am indeed on SSRIs for my anxiety. Sleeping pills inhibit REM actually.</p>
<p>Not remembering dreams is fairly normal from what I've heard. </p>
<p>Regardless, seeing someone for sleep trouble or therapy is always a good thing dude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>remembering dreams is something you need to teach yourself to do.</p>
<p>you may not realize it but for a very short time after you wake up you do remember what you were dreaming about and then forget.</p>
<p>in my half-assed attempts at lucid dreaming i remember more dreams than I used to even with the minimal efforts Ive put in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the most useful response... If op wants to decrease the time they spend in bed, they should ensure they are getting restful sleep. Improve sleep habits, get a sleep study, etc and then see if they've decreased the time it takes to achieve a restful nights sleep.  Sleep deprivation is a horrible idea...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor pedantic comment, but it's not a volume (cm^3 of air), it's 12cm of water, or the pressure exerted by a column of water 12cm high, a bit over 1 kPa, or about a 100th of atmospheric pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The requirement to keep the airway open is pressure related. A volume of gas doesn't have a fixed pressure, because it is compressible. </p>
<p>So if I have a volume of gas at say atmospheric pressure, I could then compress it to half the volume, and the pressure would double to 2 atmospheres (for instance).</p>
<p>Liquid is noncompressible, so the pressure exerted by a column of fluid (in this case 12cm of water) is a known amount of pressure.</p>
<p>I'm more familiar with anaesthetic machines than CPAP machines, anaesthetic machines use a circle system, so we only need very small flow rates (less than 200ml/min) and we can generate up to 40cmH2O. But a CPAP isn't a circle, and I'm not clear what the flow rates are to produce pressures, probably more than a circle system anyway.  </p></div>		</li>
