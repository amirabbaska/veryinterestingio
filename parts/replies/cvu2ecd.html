			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand a tiny bit on this, before a star goes super nova it can have a very large radius. Just before the star explodes it collapses in on itself, bringing its radius from very large to very small. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, as that mass shifts inward, the star will start to spin faster. The supernova then blows off the outer shells of the star and you are left with the rapidly rotating core (which can be a pulsar).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for that post, I was wondering, what speeds it up so fast.  So it's like spinning with arms stretched out and arms kept close to the body? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on /u/weredawitewimenat's question and /u/koverstreet's response, the pulsar formation scenario looks like this: Consider a star that's about 8 times more massive than our sun. This star, like all others, is spinning on it's axis, and has a dipolar magnetic field (much like Earth). When that star runs out of fuel, it goes supernova. A lot of the matter is flung out into space in the supernova, but maybe 1.5 solar masses worth of stuff is crushed into a neutron star; a star about the size of DC.</p>
<p>So think about that. You have this unbelievably huge, rotating thing that gets crushed down to something about 10 km in diameter. Conservation of angular momentum says that this is gonna be something that spins super fast. Not only that, but the magnetic field lines are going to be much more densely packed, since the star itself is more densely packed.</p>
<p>So the idea that neutron stars are rotating isn't something that comes from nowhere. It comes from the observation that stars rotate and taking this to the logical conclusion of what would follow from a supernova. Ask your friend where his idea comes from.</p>
<p>P.S. The conservation of angular momentum thing doesn't describe how the fastest pulsars came to spin so quickly. For that, there are some additional things that need to happen, but it's not really relevant to your question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you all for your time and responses. He claims that his idea was from the ocean; a wave that appears to travel but the actual mass that grants it shape is not moving forward.</p>
<p>I have quoted some of your responses but still is unconvinced. He claims my question did not directly state 'rotation' meaning, for example, the easternmost neutron shifts position to eventually be where the westernmost neutron was positioned.</p>
<p>I think he is arguing out of pride more than anything at this point. He is quite cantankerous (70yrs old), but very smart nonetheless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem! I study pulsars, so it's easy to get some kind of tunnel vision when thinking about them. Conversations like these often make everyone think about things in more depth and from a perspective they don't usually see, so even if the person is wrong, the conversation can have a lot of value.</p>
<p>Maybe (if he still wants to continue the conversation), I'd ask him what happens to all that angular momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is what I believe... I also read its caused by the law of angular momentum conservation. When placed in a supercomputer Cray X1E, the simulation results read that a star that is  exploding doesn't even need spin, the force of expansion adds this force to the remaining core. However he stated that he doesn't trust this explanation.</p>

<p>This is the one I read to him mainly because it was simplified.</p></div>		</li>
