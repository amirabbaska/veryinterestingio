			<div class="markdown"><p>The UVB light damages parts of the instructions your skin cells use to create proteins. While the parts damaged by the light are not directly used as instructions, neighboring cells detect them as &quot;bad stuff&quot; and send molecules to fight and destroy them. These inflammatory molecules cause redness, heat, swelling and loss of function in the affected areas (your skin) </p></div>		</li>
