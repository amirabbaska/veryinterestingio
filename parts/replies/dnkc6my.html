			<div class="markdown"><p>Outside of aviation gas turbines, most other implementations place the turbine inside of a sound-insulated box. Ship engine rooms that use gas turbine propulsion and generators tend to be much quieter than those in ships that have medium speed diesel engines or generators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add a fun fact regarding con #4: sand can sometimes be an issue not just because of the abrasion, but because the turbine may <em>melt it into glass</em> that ends up sticking to the inside of the engine in bad places. That's also why volcanic dust in the air after eruptions is bad for airliners. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest from everything I've experienced with gas turbines, volcanic dust is less of an issue due to that, than the fact that the dust will block all the sensors linked Into the engine and continuously give false readings/mess the engine up farther</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because I know road train as semi-trucks with multiple trailers, but in the context of your post, they seem to be long-distance freight trains?</p></div>		</li>
