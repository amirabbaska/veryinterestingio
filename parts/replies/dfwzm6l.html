			<div class="markdown"><p>This is usually a better approach than the top answer of fitting an nth degree polynomial to n+1 points, because that polynomial is usually going to look very differently than the original curve at points other than those n+1 points. This is what we do when we do approximate integration usually: we approximate the curve with piecewise lines or parabolas which we know how to integrate analytically.</p></div>		</li>
