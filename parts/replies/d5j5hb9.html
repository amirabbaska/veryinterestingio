			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only right answer. Source: I am a PhD student who studies optics</p>
<p>To elaborate, ELI5 style:</p>
<p>Basically, a fiber optic and and coaxial cables all transmit signals as electromagnetic fields. fiber optics can transmit much much much higher frequencies of electromagnetic fields though (by a factor of about a million). Audio signals are typically in the kHz range. Radio waves are in the MHz range. Microwaves are in the GHz range. Optics work in the THz range. </p>
<p>As a result of the higher base frequency, you can also turn the signal on and off A LOT faster (imagine turning a flashlight on and off -- this is analogous to amplitude modulation i.e. AM), which results in higher bandwidth. The signal itself however travels through space at about the same speed.</p>
<p>Also extremely important: you can make extremely low-loss fiber optic cables that can transmit a signal for ~100km without amplification. By contrast, you could probably go ~100m in a coaxial cable before you need to boost the signal.</p></div>		</li>
