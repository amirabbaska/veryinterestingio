			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is how cured sausages such as salami are made. The meat is salted killing most microbes at the very start. Then it is fermented in which “good” microbes produce lactic acid which lowers the pH of the meat making the environment even more hostile killing off even more microbes. Then lastly it is dried, the removal of moisture makes the remaining molds go dormant and stop reproducing.</p>
<p>These steps can occur naturally or you can inoculate the meat with two different types of molds: acidifiers internally which help produce the lactic acid during fermentation and other surface molds (penecillium nalgiovense) similar to the molds found in cheese. These outcompete the “bad molds” naturally on the meat during the drying phase and add a mushroom cheese like flavour to the end product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes!  Many molds (and some bacteria) actively kill potentially-harmful bacteria.  Penicillium, for instance, is a famous bacteria-killing mold which are the original source of the antibiotic penicillin.  It is used in cheese and meat (e.g. sausage) production because it keeps your food safely bacteria-free.</p></div>		</li>
