<p>The ants have shown the ability to recognise each other even though they may come from opposite ends of the colony</p>

<p>If the ants were friendly with eachother, they'd have to be from the same colony. Argentine ants are known to fight and die in their millions between supercolonies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The largest recorded colony of ants in the world stretches 6,000 km (3,700 miles) from northern Italy, through the south of France to the Atlantic coast of Spain, and is made up of a species of Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) introduced into Europe approximately 80 years ago. The ants have shown the ability to recognise each other even though they may come from opposite ends of the colony. The discovery of the 'supercolony' is the result of research carried out by Swiss, French and Danish scientists whose findings were published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Id like to know more about that if you find any more info link it to me!</p>
<p>But what defines a &quot;structure&quot;? Dont you think the US interstate system would count as a structure if an anthill does? What about the large hadron collider? Oceanic cables? Is there a strict definition for structute?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The physical Internet infrastructure is definitely a structure then. The ant colony isn't even connected. Just ants walking on dirt leaving pheromones. I'd say we have them beat with millions of miles of fiber and copper all connected. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure the ants are thinking they're in the lead:</p>
<p>&quot;Our colonies are definitely bigger than the human structures. Sure their contraptions are large in size but they don't even have any dirt or pheromone connections, just useless metal. Certainly just a byproduct of smaller, non-connected structures.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
