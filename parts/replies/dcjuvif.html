			<div class="markdown"><p>I think volume controls are still somewhat logarithmic. Play with a program like winamp and set the volume to linear mode. It's super annoying. Subjectively 0-10% of the range moves the volume from 0-70% loud. Where the rest of the slider just makes it slightly louder. Logarithmic more closely matches the amplitude response of our ears. That's why we measure sound in decibels. That's why you need a stereo with four times as many watts if you want it to sound twice as loud.</p></div>		</li>
