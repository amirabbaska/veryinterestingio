			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were falling from space and hit the atmosphere, would you feel yourself come into contact with the atmosphere? Or would you just suddenly find yourself inside earths atmosphere and not feel anything as you transition through it? I'm not sure if this question makes any sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on, not in furtherance of your answer but just because they're freaking awesome and most people don't know this, the deceleration is so much greater during a ballistic re-entry that they typically use an ablative heat shield because the compression heat generation is that much higher.  I just find the entire idea behind them genius.  </p>
<p>The air compresses and gets really freaking hot, heating up the heat shield to also be really freaking hot (e.g. hot enough that the thermal radiation it puts off pre-heats the incoming fluid, making it really freaking hotter).  The shield burns away, likely also involving dissociation of molecules, then the super-hot particles of the heat shield detach from the not-so-hot particles taking the heat with them.  It doesn't insulate as most consider insulate, it absorbs the energy then buggers off.  </p>
<p>So simple, so effective.  It's the type used on the re-entry modules from when we first started going to space and caring about what makes it back.  While it was the new-hotness to have reusable heat shields with the space shuttle, the old fashioned ablatives are not second rate as they allow for faster velocities due to greater deceleration potential and are generally more effective per unit weight (although perhaps this has changed with modern materials?) and unit volume than conductive insulators.  The only downside is that they're generally one time use.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Soyuz has a few different launch escape systems. The tower, the most famous escape system (the &quot;needle&quot; sticking up from the top of crewed launch vehicles, like the Soyuz), was jettisoned a few seconds before the failure. They used a secondary abort system, small thrusters embedded in the shroud around the Soyuz, to boost them away.</p>
<p>There's also the Soyuz itself, if something went wrong with the third stage (which wasn't firing when the booster failed), they would just use the small thrusters on the bottom of the Soyuz capsule to carry it away since every other escape system was jettisoned.</p>
<p>I believe they pulled about 4 gs from the shroud thrusters, but they would have pulled <em>8</em> gs using the tower.</p>
<p>You don't want to use the tower!</p></div>		</li>
