			<div class="markdown"><p>So i have a question. I have noticed that my arm &quot;falls asleep&quot; really, really easily. Sometimes i'm just sitting on a desk with my arm flat and a tingly feeling comes through. I know its a long shot but do different people have different tolerances for nerves or is it due to lack of something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for the webmd response, but do your fingers turn white when this happens or is it just the tingling?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I havent really noticed. Just that sometimes the tingling is not really tingling but gets kinda painful. Like really tiny needles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's likely due to your own unique physiology. You probably have nerves routed in such a way that it's very easy for them to be compressed in some way. I knew someone that needed to have channels around her elbow widened out surgically (not sure what the term for that was) because the muscles were compressing the nerves and slowly causing permanent nerve damage. It effectively ended her ability to rock climb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fell asleep sitting sideways on a computer chair with my arm leaning over the backrest. Woke up a while later (30 minutes or an hour... didn't think to check) and my arm was 100% numb, and I couldn't move it. It was pretty freaky, so I massaged the blood through it to speed up the oxygenation, and it slowly came back. Seemed like it took 10 minutes for the tingling to finally subside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC it has nothing to do with blood or oxygen. Its a pinched nerve, and has something to do with the ion exchange being inhibited due to pressure.
I may be wrong on that, but I'm pretty sure blood/oxygen aren't the key players in this. </p></div>		</li>
