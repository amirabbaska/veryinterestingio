I have no real science to back this - and I highly doubt the originator of the shower thought does either - but as a lifelong dog owner I'm pretty sure they can tell your intention from body language, etc., and quickly realise it was an accident.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Animals, including humans, almost all have a sense of time that is described in three scales: millisecond timing, which is largely controlled by the cerebellum and mostly concerned with coordinating movement; interval timing, on the scale of seconds to minutes to hours, distributed throughout the brain (and especially the striatum) and concerned with determining the typical duration between two events; and circadian timing, the 24-hour internal clock coordinated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus and adjusted based on solar cues (and, to a lesser extent, cues like eating times).</p>

<p>What a hell of a sentence.... let me break this down in case I'm not the only one who couldn't follow it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Millisecond timing - which is largely controlled by the cerebellum and mostly concerned with coordinating movement</p>

<li>Circadian timing - the 24-hour internal clock coordinated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus and adjusted based on solar cues (and, to a lesser extent, cues like eating times).</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not calling you out or anything, I'm just genuinely curious: do you really have a harder time differentiating multiple ideas if they're in the same sentence? I honestly didn't even notice until you said something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Below is a response I made earlier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To clarify, it was not the semicolons that I found difficult. What tripped me up were the nested parentheses, frequent comma usage, and several conjunctions - all combined with the semicolons.</p>
<p>I wasn't trying to dumb it down or anything remotely like that. I left it intact as much as possible because I didn't want to imply I had a problem with his grammar. I really didn't expect this sort of response though.</p>
<p>If I had rewritten it the way I originally intended, I would have left the semicolons but heavily edited the punctuation between them.</p>
<p>Full disclosure, I have ADD. While I try never to bring it up, it does make following nonstandard sentences difficult. I simply don't have much practice dealing with them and I have a difficult time keeping my place with dense and unexpected punctuation (everything, but the semicolons). That said, I can typically read at a fairly high level without issue.</p>
<p>The block of text in question, I tried reading 5 times and I simply could not process the information as it was presented. I broke it down in a way that I found useful while not insulting or confrontational, and choose to share it for the potential benefit of others.</p>
<p>As a side note, I quite like semicolons and wish they were more frequently used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something like the below was my original rewrite. I suppose the part I found most troublesome, was the frequent use of commas  under multiple use cases. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't accept your apology.  It was refreshing to read your complicated but expertly written sentence.  We see too little of this in our sound bite world and I for one, prefer your work to the suggested rewrite which at best is the sort of thing one finds projected on a screen at a conference. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What you're talking about is circannual timing, meaning the timing of yearly (or thereabout) events. This almost certainly is largely controlled by instinct, or at best by other cues (e.g., shortened days and colder temperatures). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not clear why you'd consider the circannual scale qualitatively different from circadian scale. You mention that circannual is likely tied to exteroceptive stimuli (and in fact there is good evidence of that for even a number of insect species, as well as some mammals), but how is that functionally different from the impact of zeitgebers on circadian rhythms?</p></div>		</li>
