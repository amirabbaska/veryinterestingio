			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great post.  A lot of people don't seem to realize the huge, complex pathway everything has to be channeled through.  The longer the distance, roughly speaking, the more interchanges will be necessary and the more the latency will increase.</p>
<p>But I will add a quick mathematical detail.  OP's question basically thinks that 300,000 km/s is fast.  But it's not fast at all.  That's only 300km per milisecond.  Latency is typically measured in double-digit miliseconds.  Once you start getting over 150 to 200ms, you start to notice significant lag in your games.</p>
<p>Well going across 3000 miles of the US (~4800km) is going to take 16ms.</p>
<p>And that's light speed.  Electricity is fast, but it's still only around a third of the speed of light.  Maybe a bit faster.</p>
<p>But already, with a perfect, straight line with no switching or processing or anything, sending a signal from one side of the US to another is going to take 48ms just from distance propagation delay.  That's not an irrelevant amount of time all on its own, purely due to distance.</p></div>		</li>
