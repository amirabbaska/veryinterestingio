			<div class="markdown"><p>You're welcome; I'm glad it helped!</p>
<p>For the longest time the only thing I knew about imaginary numbers was that in electrical work you sometimes need to know the sq.root of the current, and if it's AC then you might be taking the root of a negative so it would need <em>i</em>.  This explanation really helped me understand it beyond that use.</p>
<p>A friend showed me an equation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion" target="_blank">the quaternion</a>) using i, j, and k to make it four dimensions.  Blew my frickin' mind!</p>
<p><em>i</em>^2 = <em>j</em>^2 = <em>k</em>^2 = <em>ijk</em> = -1</p>
<p>Same thing, but an &quot;imaginary&quot; number in each different dimension...  Don't know why I'm bringing it up, other than to share my confusion of complex maths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quaternions are super awesome if you are developing 3D Simulations. You use them to translate/rotate objects in space. You don't even need to understand the math behind them, if you are given properly implemented quaternion classes. You just use their operations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a minor quibble.  The quaternion is used to do mathematics in 3 dimensions, even though it uses four components to get it done.  The realization that you need four &quot;numbers&quot; in order to do 3d mathematics was a major breakthrough back in the day. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Ramanujan might have been able to dethrone him, alas he died too early.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that. It's just that if you'd ask me in 8th grade, &quot;What's the square root of -25?&quot;, I'd think &quot;you can't multiply two numbers and NOT get a positive  number, right? That's like, how it's defined&quot;</p>
<p>In comes this crazy idea of i. To get numbers you could square  and get negative numbers, we expanded the number line, and added a lateral dimension to it. We basically invented &quot;more&quot; maths.</p>
<p>My question is can't we do the same with 1/0?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the answer is &quot;infinity.&quot;</p>
<p>You could go the route of saying &quot;x times 0 = 0, so dividing something by zero should get you back to x&quot; but then you need to know what x was in the first place.</p>
<p>Basically, you need to understand u/functor7's answer</p></div>		</li>
