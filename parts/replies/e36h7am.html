			<div class="markdown"><p>They are wrong. You cannot generate paresthesia sensations by activating peripheral nerves themselves. Must be at least spinal, and more likely central. You just cannot get that from peripheral activation.   </p>
<p>To be clear, the reported sensations INCLUDE some sensations almost certainly generated in the retina, and others almost certainly generated in the central nervous system. But the pins and needles sensation is central in origin, also. Probably intracranial. </p></div>		</li>
