			<div class="markdown"><p>it's more to the effect that since there is no one objective standard, it violates Equal Protection requirements to apply standards capriciously. One major difficulty has been that what is or isn't gerrymandering has been difficult to quantify. Qualitatively, sure, you can look at how this particular district has borders that were drawn by a dizzy snake, or how that district has this weird tentacle that reaches into the neighboring town for no apparent reason. But what makes one district more gerrymandered than another? Where is the line? What is the criterion? </p>
<p>There is actually a case that will probably wind up at the SCOTUS called <em>(deep breath)</em> William Whitford, Roger Anclaim, Emily Bunting, Mary Lunne Donohue, Helen Harris, Wayne Jensen, Wendy Sue Johnson, Janet Mitchell, Allison Seaton, James Seaton, Jerome Wallace and Donald Winter, v. Beverly R. Gill, Julie M. Glancey, Ann S. Jacobs, Steve King, Don Millis, and Mark L. Thomsen. </p>
<p>Probably will get abbreviated as Whitford v Gill when all is said and done. This was ruled on last November in the 7th US Circuit, and it's remarkable because it actually includes a definable metric based on wasted votes. </p>
<p>In essence, if I have 1000 each of Purple Party voters and Beige Party voters and I divide them into 10 districts of 200 people each, then if I can draw 9 districts to be 110/90 and 1 district of 10/190, then I can make my legislature be 9 Purple and 1 Beige.</p>
<p>Each Purple district has 9 wasted Purple votes to be over the 50%+1 majority. But that Beige district has <em>179</em> votes more than are needed to offset the 10 Purple voters. While this is clearly an extreme example, it turns out that the fundamental principle of how many superfluous votes were cast over the course of several elections is a really good metric for how gerrymandered districts are, and, when you run the calculations backward to see what fair elections look like and you plot them on a map, lo and behold the resulting districts look a lot less insane. </p>
<p>This essentially reverse-engineers what the unironically-named <a href="http://www.redistrictingmajorityproject.com/" target="_blank">REDMAP Thinktank</a> set out to do in the wake of the 2010 census and elections. (Read their page, it's remarkable how brazen their intentions can be when they believe their work to be immune to judicial challenge.)</p>
<p>And since the last time gerrymandering was before the Supreme Court, Justice Anthony Kennedy lamented the fact that there was no set metric for measuring what these lawsuits seek to remedy...watch this space for further developments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a pretty reasonable metric. However I'm curious if this would force districts to be as close to a 50/50 split as possible. Sure it sounds good but I can see this creating problems. You might have district's consisting of two very different populations. Eg if you made a district of 100 people in California and 100 people in Alabama you could have 50/50 splits every election but that wouldn't really be a functional system.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>REDMAPâ€™s effect on the 2012 election is plain when analyzing the results: Pennsylvanians cast 83,000 more votes for Democratic U.S. House candidates than their Republican opponents, but elected a 13-5 Republican majority to represent them in Washington; Michiganders cast over 240,000 more votes for Democratic congressional candidates than Republicans, but still elected a 9-5 Republican delegation to Congress.  Nationwide, Republicans won 54 percent of the U.S. House seats, along with 58 of 99 state legislative chambers, while winning only 8 of 33 U.S. Senate races and carrying only 47.8 percent of the national presidential vote.</p>

And Another person saying No! The paint is poisonous... and then being like... well, I guess it's ok to eat the lead paint because you couldn't agree on why it was bad...</p>
<p>I could understand if there were three opinions on why it wasn't unconstitutional and three opinions on why is wasn't...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think its also hard to prove that it happened. The system we use to draw the boundaries needs to be replaced tbh. </p>
<p>This might help understand how it happens, but it doesn't go into the political consequences. (or lack thereof) </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really accurate. You are correct on the non-justiciable part. The SCOTUS can't decide if something has been gerrymandered because it have held that that is the legislature's job. However, partisan political gerrymandering is NOT illegal. Race based gerrymandering IS illegal. So when you have something like the 5th district of Florida, which is openly gerrymandered to be a black district so that blacks will have representation is congress, (not a bad thing at all imo,) they can let it slide by assuming it's partisan gerrymandering to help the Democratic Party have a safe district, rather than carved up along racial lines</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they're going to examine partisan gerrymandering at the Supreme Court level in 2017. We not only basically haven't decided yet if partisan gerrymandering is illegal, but we have no set way to define when it's happening. </p>
<p>The December 8 &quot;We The People&quot; podcast by the National Constitution Center did a pretty good outline. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A better question is, why is it so hard for the US courts to decide what is partisan gerrymandering, when Canada has no problems drawing fair districts with almost zero partisan political complaints?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that the courts find it difficult, it's that they aren't allowed to make decisions on those things. The US constitution outlines separation of powers in a different way than those in Canadian laws/politics. </p></div>		</li>
