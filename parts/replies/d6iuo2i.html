			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd love to find some resources on how different crystal shapes form, preferably a colourful youtube video with gentle background music, but some research papers would be okay I guess. </p>
<p>I'm cringing already at how much of a layperson I'm going to sound here, but, I've always wondered how for instance, salt crystals &quot;know&quot; how to stop at an edge and make near perfect cubes. I get that it's all local rules and processes that form the greater whole, but I've never been able to find very good explanations as to what is happening to the molecules as they crystalise, what is defining the boundaries, and angles etc.. Your explanation of hopper crystalisation is great by the way, exactly the sort of thing I was looking for. My terrible google-fu only turned up videos of people putting bits of string into sugar water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its thermodynamically driven. Thats the &quot;easy&quot; answer. At equilibrium, a system will be driven to its lowest free energy state. In the case of table salt, that is a halite structure. Basically, you have equal spacing between all the atoms, and you have every Na surrounded by 6 Cl and every Cl surrounded by 6 Na. I don't know how much chemistry you know, but this is due to the ionic nature of the NaCl bond. Na is a + charged ion. Cl is -. Opposites attract and like charges repel, so to achieve a lowest energy state, they form this structure. This is valid for a long range ionic structure as well. Each atom in the structure &quot;sees&quot; every other atom, and this causes its long range order to be cubic as well. That is to say, it is energetically unfavorable for a bunch of cubic cells to line up in a line or form some sort of complicated cubic stack, because they are energetically driven to form cubes of cubes. This continues no matter how large you grow the salt crystal. </p>
<p>Edit: I chose this example because it is pretty clear WHY the atoms would energetically favor this structure. But it holds true for ALL structures, even the slightly more complicated ones like perovskites. Basically, what you are seeing is the atoms arranging themselves in the lowest energy state available to them given the kinetics they are allowed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like this: the structure of salt is formed by atoms arranging into a cubic structure, alternating which element is in which place in the crystal lattice. When an atom attaches itself into this structure, it has ionic bonds (just electrical attraction) to the opposite-charge atoms right next to it. When there's a bit of the crystal that's not filled in to make a perfect cube, that little corner is more attractive to an atom, because it is adjacent to, and therefore attracted to, atoms in multiple directions, so the atom wants to clip into there more than anywhere else. That means an atom can be captured into that space even if it has too much energy to adhere to a face of the crystal, and this makes the crystal preferentially fill out into cubes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't worry, the general and exact prediction of how an arbitrary substance crystallizes is still very much an open question, because answering the question quantitatively requires extremely computationally intensive calculations.</p>
<p>In general, a single ion or other species sees only its local solvent environment and whatever facet or edge of the crystal it collides. In crystallization, there are very large numbers of molecules that bump into all parts of the growing crystal, so the law of large numbers applies: you see the effects as an average. If you calculate the energy of each trajectory and conformation of the species vs. the knobbly surface of a crystal facet, some of them will be a better fit and result in a lower energy, electronically or sterically. So, ideally, you could find the <em>thermodynamic</em> equilibrium. But, this is a real reaction: meanwhile, the transition state - the conformations the species must go through before attaching itself to the surface - may have its own energy. The probability of an elementary reaction goes up if the reaching the transition state takes little energy, and vice versa. This is how crystallization doesn't just always jump into the perfect thermodynamic equilibrium, but depends on conditions, temperature, concentration, impurities, whathaveyou. All of these may modify the transition state or the probability of reaching them.</p>
<p>When you get nice cubic crystals as from e.g. pyrite, the reason is that the energy gain of attaching to a flat facet is much higher than attaching to a defect or edge. Thus, with a large number of molecules, most attach to the facet. Also, growing on a facet can only start from an existing facet; the number of crystal seeds that can jumpstart this process contributes. But, at more forcing conditions, the defects may not be that different in energy from a clean facet, and you get smaller, more irregular crystals from a larger number of defects and seeds.</p>
<p>Modeling of the process can be done with QM/MM methods. First, you calculate the quantum mechanical (QM) states of a simple species like a single molecule. An effective force field model is crafted from this result, and simulations are conducted on this artificial force field model by molecular mechanics (MM). Force field models are inherently unrealistic, but computationally tractable. A full QM treatment is infeasible for a large system like a crystal; there are simply too many cross-interactions between electrons, and most of them are practically negligible, so using MM model isn't that unrealistic after all. You can predict for example melting points to accuracies of ca. 1-5 degrees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is the hopper growth in (seemingly) regular steps?  i.e., even if there were steps (due to edges) at the atomic level, at our macroscopic scale why isn't there just a seemingly smooth 45 degree slope?</p></div>		</li>
