			<div class="markdown"><p>It can also be noted that the bottle and the box -- the presentation -- are also part of this art depending on the brand and whatnot. Over at Fragrantica there are a few examples of fragrances that not only list the &quot;nose&quot; behind a scent but also who designed the bottle.</p>
<p>Sometimes the box will convey a common theme, such as Burberry house with its tartan (the plaid) on most boxes. Or sometimes a company will go with a standardized bottle, such as Etat Libre D'Orange, who use the same &quot;bullseye&quot; bottle for everything, but instead have a gimmick of making a story and then trying to put that story to scent (such as their EDT Fat Electrician). There are also other companies who take the same approach, writing a story out and making a scent about it; imagine it as a fragrance adaptation of a novel rather than a movie.</p>
<p>But it is also not difficult to find presentations that are works of art in themselves. Whether it is to solidify the idea the fragrance is trying to evoke, or just to really jump out at you on shelves. As an example, Jean Paul Gaultier's Le Male. It comes in a tin can with a bottle shaped like a man's body. It certainly lends an idea of a manly scent. And now that shape is iconic and serves as instant brand recognition.</p>
<p>The whole of the perfumery business is set really deep in artistry, as you said.</p></div>		</li>
