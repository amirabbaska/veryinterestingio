			<div class="markdown"><p>They have one-track minds. There are way too many cases of snakes swallowing other snakes that were latched on to the same prey. It's like Lady and the Tramp except one dog eats the other one. </p>
<p>It's bad enough that the one snake eats the other--what stands out is that the other one still doesn't let the fuck go. The basic brain function is &quot;swallow until you reach air.&quot; It doesn't matter what the hell is there, they just keep swallowing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a kid I caught a garter snake and a frog, and tried to feed the snake. It then vomited up another frog it had eaten. I thought it was gross and freaked out a bit and threw the snake into the lake, but then thought the snake's swimming was super cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was told about this a long time back, if a python starts wrapping itself around you, first cover its eye; this disorients the snake and then you slowly dislodge it's teeth from your body followed by trying to unwrap it off your body.  </p>
<p>Maybe covering the eyes of your pet snake could help you pull it off stuff? </p></div>		</li>
