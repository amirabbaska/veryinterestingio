			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm saving this comment if only to remind myself that mental energy is still energy being used! Like, if you just went to class and had a discussion, talked to peers and professors, worked out some problems which don't require physical energy but organization and deep thought, you might feel like you didn't do much all day. But damn if it doesn't make you feel tired sometimes! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I play a strategic card game competitively (Magic, the Gathering) and have realized that after playing 8-9 rounds of Magic in a day (basically 8-9 straight hours of strategic gameplay with occasional 20 minute breaks) you just get so drained. I never thought a card game could do that to you but wow can it ever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our brains use up to 20% of the calories we take in. It's quite the energy hog.</p>
<p>On that note, you know how runners can run a marathon and still push during the last leg, despite once appearing as though they couldn't put forth any more energy? It's because the brain doesn't want you to drain all your energy resources so that it can continue to function. It leaves some caloric padding so that it can go on doing what it does. Why do I say this? You can handle more than your brain tells you that you can handle. Please don't hurt yourself, but, for future reference, if you feel you &quot;can't&quot; focus any longer, can't finish the last few minutes of that run... Try it. You probably can. </p></div>		</li>
