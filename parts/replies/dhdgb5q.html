<p>Biotin is an awesome vitamin to add to strengthen hair and nails. Might help?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the very very beginning of the benefits are showing at a month. </p>
<p>For me, a late 20s female with a healthy diet? I noticed my hair growing slightly faster within a month or two  but thickness and a real improvement in health took a few months. After a year of consistent use my hair grows at least twice as fast, and so much thicker than it used to. It's also much stronger and shinier and I'm growing it out longer than ever. It's frizzy but cause it's curly and there's still old damage growing out and a lot of breakage, the new virgin hair is sooooo much healthier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you do anything to condition your beard? It's important to have a good balance of oils (i.e. Regular shampoo with its surfactants can strip away beneficial oils, molded combs as well will damage hair as well). A beard oil with jojoba and/or argan oil might do the trick. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this has happened to me a few times too...pretty weird. perhaps it does happen to the dark ones but i think i would have noticed it. i don't think (hope) i'm going grey/white in the beard either. the only white hairs that seem to come in are albino white and split at the root. i pulled one out once and it was super thick.</p></div>		</li>
