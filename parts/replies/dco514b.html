			<div class="markdown"><p>They have to travel through the Earth for a far greater distance to get to the LHC, which means that far more of it will be absorbed by the Earth. The &quot;above&quot; direction will provide by far the largest contribution to cosmics in the LHC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a fun but rare way in which a cosmic ray coming from the sides or below the LHC can interact with the experiments. Most cosmic rays are high energy protons which interact with our atmosphere and produce showers of muons, neutrinos, and photon/electron pairs that &quot;rain&quot; down onto the surface. Now since the earth is basically transparent to neutrinos, a neutrino from a cosmic ray shower can come from any direction. Also to be complete there are neutrinos coming from many other sources as well, our own sun for example. Rarely these neutrinos can interact with the earth right before the detector cavern and produce a high energy electron/muon/tau (but taus will just decay into an electron/muon) that can then fly unobstructed at the detector from any angle. </p>
<p>Now this is quite rare, and even if the resulting electron/muon did happen to line up just right with the proton-proton interaction point of the detector it would be traveling from the outside-in and would be easy to spot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew it!  </p>
<p>I mean, I have no credentials whatsoever (I even mixed up cosmic rays with neutrinos), but my gut told me that it would be those rare &quot;edge&quot; cases that produce the most interesting results.  </p>
<p>BTW, how much time would it take, or what is the probability of this happening:  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you please answer this for me? How are the particles put into the accelerator? Like where do they come from, how they're inserted into the beam and how do they know they're only inserting the 1 particle they want and not something else along with it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They come from another accelerator, the Super Proton Synchrotron.</p>
<p>Where do those come from? Another accelerator of course, the Proton Synchrotron. Those in turn come from the Proton Synchrotron Booster, which in turn come from Linac 2, a linear accelerator.</p>
<p>Linac 2 gets its protons by ionizing hydrogen gas to get rid of its electron.</p>
<p>They don't insert just one particle though. The accelerators work on &quot;bunches&quot; of many particles at a time.</p>
<p>At least that's how it works when running protons. The LHC sometimes runs with lead ions too, which may use a different process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a bit more:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>About 100 billion protons per bunch.</p>
<p>Lead ions use a different source, but starting from the Proton Synchrotron Booster they are accelerated in the same rings.</p>
<p>The LHC can also accelerate protons in one direction and lead ions in a different direction to study proton-lead collisions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the next source will make H^- ions, i.e. a proton and two electrons, which then get stripped away by a thin foil. Surprisingly this actually allows you to get to higher intensities, mainly because accelerator physics is non-intuitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a more straightforward answer,  they come from <a href="https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CERN_LHC_Proton_Source.JPG" target="_blank">this tank</a>.    </p>
<p>Also,  they never insert one particle, the beam consists of about 0.00000000047 grams of matter at any given time, which is,  like,  a gazillion protons.  The bulk pass through the target many times before colliding. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no &quot;target&quot; in the classical sense - two beams intersect. Out of the ~100 billion protons in each beam, about 40 collide with 40 of the other beam, all other protons continue to fly in their beam, and get another chance to collide after one round (and also in the other experiments).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Particle accelerators in general use ion sources which can vary quite a bit. Often it is hydrogen which has its electron stripped off to make it H^+ (neutral atoms cannot be steered by electric or magnetic fields). Other times it will be a plasma which does emit many different kinds of ions depending on the source gas used to ignite the plasma. At that point a bending magnet or several will be used to specifically only bend the desired ions into the beam pipe. All others will either bend too much, or too little, and crash into the side of the pipe. It's mass spectrometry. </p></div>		</li>
