			<div class="markdown"><p>This made more sense to me than anything I've ever read about either wave/particle duality or the uncertainty principle. Admittedly, the bar's not set <em>terribly</em> high for that, but still.</p>
<p>So what I'm getting is that &quot;light&quot; or &quot;photons&quot; are just a way of moving energy around in the space-time continuum? Does the &quot;electrons wiggling in different places&quot; thing have anything to do with quantum entanglement (having heard that word and knowing nothing else about it)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really related to quantum entanglement. That’s a whole other ball of weirdness. </p>
<p>Light is pretty much exactly as you describe. The transfer of energy from one electron to another, at a distance.  That’s it. </p>
<p>Note - I should probably generalize that to transfer of energy from one <em>particle</em> to another rather than specifically an electron, before some pedantic asshat chimes in with some weird exotic particle, or high energy gamma rays (technically the same as light!) that can interact with the nucleus of an atom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if im wrong, but isnt quantum entanglement pretty simple? </p>
<p>Two or more particles share the same state, and change state at the same instant, regardless of the distance between them, and this information will be &quot;sent&quot; instantly ignoring the delay of light speed? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like where you are going with this, but this answer seems to imply that electrons &quot;really exist&quot; while photons are just a useful construct. Electrons and Photons both exists at the same conceptual level in the standard model, so either they both &quot;really exist&quot; for however you define that or they are both just useful concepts for describing certain aspects of our universe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I understand the whole “reality is probabilistic” thing, but it’s only useful if you consistently apply the concept.</p></div>		</li>
