<p>less than a pixel</p>

<p>Does that mean the camera scaled it up to one pixel?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Scaling up&quot; isn't the best way to think about it - the pixels are like buckets for light. If you put a bucket under a running tap that's smaller than the bucket, the water gets spread out over the whole bottom of the bucket. The same thing happens with the light - it gets spread over the whole pixel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of a pixel like a bucket, it counts how many photons hit the bucket and that's the light level. For color sensors there are usualy 4 buckets, red, blue, green, green, each with a filter that only let's that color throught.</p>
<p>That pixel covers some angle in the field of view,  the earths angular size at that distance is smaller. So to answer your question it didn't scale it, it's just dimmer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer, yes.  The radioactive power supply of voyager is degrading.  I believe it's the thermoelectric generators which are losing efficiency.  (devices which turn heat into electricity, when one side is hot and the other side is cold.)</p>
<p>It may be able to power it up, but it would be at the expense of other more critical devices.</p></div>		</li>
