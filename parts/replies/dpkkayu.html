			<div class="markdown"><p>B vitamins were grouped together because they were originally found occurring together in the same foods, and when supplemented they were given as a &quot;B complex&quot; rather than just a single one of the B vitamins.</p>
<p>They are chemically distinct and do have different roles in the body, so they could have been given separate letters.</p>
<p>Only 8 of the B vitamins are actually vitamins (i.e. the body cannot manufacture them). The other missing numbers were found to be produced by the body so were technically not vitamins, for example, inositol used to be vitamin B8, until it was found the body can make it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope most B vitamines are structurally very different to each other, the naming was done because they mostly occured in the same foods thus making it easy for the laymen to understand.</p></div>		</li>
