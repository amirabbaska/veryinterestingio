			<div class="markdown"><p>A dozen years ago I had a client who had between 14-17 children in state custody.  They weren't sure of the exact number because some of them might have been his identical twin brother's babies.  The source of info was the mothers of each, who weren't sure which twin was the father, either.  And DNA testing - at least what the state was willing to pay for - was unable to distinguish between them, though both had submitted to paternity testing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Years ago the technology to test for those individual base pair differences wasn't around. </p>
<p>Now a days it is still pretty cutting edge, and costs a ton of money. It still isn't regular practice for autosomal (chromosome location) DNA testing or paternity tests.</p>
<p>If the paternity situation is trying to determine which brother contributed, it can be done now with that more individualizing test. </p>
<p>When new technology comes around, it takes decades for it to seep down into the regulated labs. It will be a long time for legislation and funding to catch up, and for scientists to even be able to provide meaning for results. </p>
<p>By that last part I mean this:  the sensitivity of DNA testing technology is now so incredible that there are hundreds of &quot;so what?&quot; types of questions regarding actually finding a DNA profile somewhere. A single one of your cells can end up somewhere you've never been, and a profile <em>can</em> be pulled from it. Scientists are still i  the researching phase tp determine exactly what weight to give this type of information now. It's an interesting time in forensic biology.</p>

<p>This was a test done very recently on a single child with a known father. Just FYI. It's more than 97% :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Probability of Paternity: 99.99998%</p>

<p>So there's a 0.000002 chance he isn't the father, right?</p>
<p>Does that mean somewhere out there there's a person who might get the same results? If there's a chance the test is wrong, does that mean 1 in 50,000 people might get a &quot;false positive&quot; for paternity?</p>
<p>Imagine sitting in a stadium knowing one of those people might have such a similar DNA to yours that a paternity test would show he's your father, even though you're not remotely related. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This type of DNA test is what's called restriction mapping. They use enzymes to cut the DNA into different segments, and then they measure the size of them by electrophoresis.</p>
<p>So in the unlikely (but possible) case that this type of test showed a false positive, it wouldn't actually dictate similarity in the actual DNA at all. Just that the sites where the restriction enzyme cut it are the same length.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ultimately you don’t just test the stadium- you have a known list of people that were slept with. The chance of one of those few people being correct is much much smaller. In my case, only one, but some paperwork fudging left us without him listed on the birth certificate and a big pain in the butt :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So tests have two measures of wrong answers (somewhat counterintuitively).</p>
<p>You have specificity, which is what percentage of people will get a true (aka correct) negative result, and you have sensitivity, which is what percentage of people will get a true positive result. The counterintuitive part (to me at least) is that they aren’t always, even often, inverses (i.e. a test with 99.9% sensitivity won’t <em>necessarily</em> have .1% specificity, meaning 99.9 percent true positives and .1% true negatives).</p>
<p>Why?  Well it’s not actually counterintuitive. They measure two different things. If I test 1000 people given my previous numbers, 999 people who <em>have</em> X disease or <em>are</em> Y’s daddy will get a true positive result, and 1 will get a false positive.  Just 1 person who <em>doesn’t</em> have X disease or <em>isn’t</em> Y’s daddy will get a true negative response. That’s one shitty test: it can tell me pretty much for sure when someone <em>does</em> have a positive state, but it’s only correct about when they have a negative state 1/1000 times. So basically everyone gets a positive result and/or the negative results are meaningless. </p>
<p>Better would be the same sensitivity and a comparable specificity, let’s say 98.9%. That would mean 999/1000 positive results are correctly identified as positive and 989/1000 negative results are correctly identified as negative. </p>
<p>Together that means 994/1000 times the test is done, the correct result will be found, but it doesn’t have to do with someone being so similar the test is fooled <em>per se</em>. It just means it is not precise enough to say with certainty, and 999/1000 when the actual answer is yes, it will say yes and 989/1000 when the actual answer is no, it will say no. So it’s not that one other person could get the same results, it’s that some number of people would yield an incorrect yes answer and another number of people would yield and incorrect no answer. </p>
<p>The no answers don’t make as much intuitive sense for paternity but you kind of have to imagine imaginary children cuz probability. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For myself, because every female on my mother’s side as far back as they can trace, had and died of breast cancer. I took the BRCA tests and they were determined “positive”, however they really need the test done to another first degree relative with breast cancer to properly determine your risks. Without those results (my mother passed away before the tests became mainstream) a generic specialist reviews your results to see if a prophylactic mastectomy would be advisable. In my case, it was.</p>
<p>In my children’s case, one of them had some serious, possibly genetic, kidney issues and one did not. They examined both their DNA to see if they had any different genetic markers that would indicate a predilection towards kidney disease. From what they told me, DNA study is still in its infancy so to be able to study ID twins where one is presenting with a potentially telling genetic blip would be very useful. </p></div>		</li>
