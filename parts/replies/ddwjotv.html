			<div class="markdown"><p>WWII was basically all that was required for US manufacturing to be king.  All of the majorly industrialized countries that could have been a driving force were in rubble.  The USSR couldn't export like we could.  We rebuilt countries after WWII and being the only supplier who could produce the goods everyone wants put our workforce at the time in a place where extremely high wages were easy to afford.  Now we share a piece of the pie with everyone.  Countries have recovered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. After WWII the US was in a position to manufacture goods for the rest of the world. They had to pump out product so fast that they lost sight of quality and pushed entirely for quantity, as other countries were buying this stuff up faster than it could be made. Once countries like Japan were well established and didn't have to focus on military expenses they began producing goods with a focus on quality. This effort was spearheaded by American by the name of Deming, who is considered the father of statistical quality control. America wasn't interested in it, Japan drank it up, became a competitor and then America became interested. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good,ol Deming! I remember him from my QA courses. Japan picked up his principles in the 50's. The US auto industry didn't get into until the Ford Taurus. Let that rack your mind. The Taurus was what the mid to late 80's. And it was still a pos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>I know you're 5, but I'll throw this in there as well. Part of the Reagan revolution was to change the tax code to eliminate very high taxes on the highest paid individuals. The highest tax bracket was 70%. Reagan reduced it to 28%. This helped concentrate wealth to the top.</em></p>
<p>That's the equivalent of one hell of a raise. Part of me already knew this, but it is still shocking to read it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the Republican party has been waging a war on the middle class since Goldwater. Decreased taxes on the wealthy increase the tax burden on the middle class. Decreased union power helps keep wages stagnant. Underneath it all is a war between corporations and the rest of us.</p>
<p>My desire is that the government serves to balance the power of the corporations to prevent over-exploitation, but, that doesn't seem to be a priority for either party. </p>
<p>Edit: Topic is locked, can't respond to the response, so I'll respond here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You realize Ronnie had a democratic house, right</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, you're right, and I did over-simplify politics by simply referring to the president rather than the whole steaming mess. I singled out the Republican party, but I am not a Democratic apologist. Clinton's policies (WJC) were not hugely different from Reagan's, with respect to regulation and finance, at least. It's not difficult to argue that WJC simply continued the policies began under Reagan. Both major parties have participated in this trend of wealth concentration. You could argue it's kleptocracy or simply crony capitalism, but our government has been in thrall to corporations for quite some time, on both sides of the aisle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You realize Ronnie had a democratic house, right? As in, <strong>democrats</strong> voted for those tax reductions that the president signed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>is a shock, but 70% sounds excessive. I know I will never make close to the 30% they take home, but 70% still feels rather high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When they say the top tax rate is 70%, that doesn't actually mean they're only taking home 30%.  What it means is that the income they make after a certain level is taxed at 70%, so it really isn't as much as it seems.</p>
<p>So for example, if the (very simplified) tax brackets were:
30% at $100,001-$500,000, and 70% at $500,001-$2,000,000</p>
<p>Then someone making $120,000 and someone making $1,500,000 would pay the same tax rate, 30%, <em>on the first $500,000</em> they each make.  So the $1,500,000 guy is only paying 70% on anything they make over $500,000, while the guy making $120,000 is paying 30% for his entire income.</p>
<p>Hope this clears things up!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Was 90-something% under Eisenhower. But that's somewhat of a misnomer as it was like &quot;you get the first million tax free the rest you gotta pay&quot; </p></div>		</li>

Though I do not know if this accounts for capital gains which makes up a large part of CEO pay now.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me add Europe was just as bad off as Asia.
BTW: The systems that the Japanese put in place were Quality Systems designed by American academicians. The US auto industry paid no attention to them but the Japanese adopted them whole hog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, agreed. We studied that fact about Japanese manufacturing in our production classes. In fact, I believe it was an American academician who was brought over to Japan to get the whole JIT stuff rolling.</p></div>		</li>
