			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched a video where they said that the machine that cuts the noodles from the dough can either make them straight or wavy.</p>
<p>But your answer is otherwise correct:  It's the same reason why curly hairs are curly, because there is more &quot;stuff&quot; on the outside of the curl than on the inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it’s not like they make them straight and then bend them into wiggles.  They’re formed to that shape to start with.  They aren’t going to revert to a straight noodle because they’ve <em>never been straight in the first place.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The noodles get straighter when they're wet and you hold one up because they've soaked up water and are heavier. The weight of the water pulls them straight. Same with hair. Also worth noting that how straight your hair gets depends on how curly it is. If your hair is only a little wavy, it'll get much straighter when wet than if you have super curly 4C hair.</p></div>		</li>
