			<div class="markdown"><p>Your question was not clear.  It seemed like your question is what are the consequences for the <em>reason</em> (i.e. mechanism) behind the flipping.</p>
<p>But what are the consequences of flipping?  Well first off, it's important to know that flipping doesn't happen overnight.  The magnetic field weakens and the magnetic poles will shift positions to the opposite hemispheres and then strengthen.  This happens over a period of <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100358" target="_blank">1000-28000 years</a>. </p>
<p>For humans, the greatest impact will be that the shielding effect of the Earth's magnetic field will become much weaker.  This will make it more difficult for artificial satellites to operate correctly and means we'll experience a higher flux of radiation (i.e. increased cancer rates, mutation rates).  But also Van Allen Belts will capture fewer particles and the auroras will become more widely viewable (though I suspect they will become weaker overall).  Beyond the increased mutation rates, plants will largely be unaffected.  Some animals who use magnetic navigation will have to recalibrate -- but again the process is so slow they'll likely adapt well.  Geologically, the only thing to change is that the magnetic fields recorded in volcanic rock will change directions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'm thinking that satellites might be fucked with the weakening of the magnetic shield. More cancers in humans and other animals, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do have satellites that operate outside the Earth's magnetic shield today (Voyagers, Mars Orbiter, STERO satellites, Kepler, etc...).  So we know how to build satellites that would operate when Earth's magnetic shield weakens.  It just costs more money to manufacture those types of electronics.  That's why I said &quot;more difficult&quot; as opposed to &quot;impossible&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weaker magnetic field --&gt; More high-energy cosmic rays &amp; solar radiation makes it to Earth's surface --&gt; humans experience higher radiation doses --&gt; higher cancer rates.</p>
<p>If any step above isn't clear, let me know and I'll try to explain it in more detail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More radiation in cancer causing form (UV light) will reach the Earth's surface because the magnetic field will be weaker (and less organized) and absorb less energy in that spectrum. It's like the ozone hole.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how much higher cancer rates will be, but humans will probably want to stay indoors more to avoid getting sunburned. It will probably be like the whole planet getting equator-levels of UV or maybe 2-5x that much even. Not sure what the effect would be at night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify: the 1000-28000 range given here is just for the transition period. The actual timespans between magnetic field reversals do not occur at regular intervals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, I know that, but how long does this take to flip? Would there be &quot;lights&quot; around the equator as the poles slowly flip around? Is it a super fast (geologic time scale) flip where it only takes a year or so?</p></div>		</li>
