<p>Yeah! Coastal sediment analysis is one example of this. It also has an awesome name.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a fair bit and for reference, this general field is known as paleotempestology, which uses a variety of proxy measurements (not just sediment cores) to infer past cyclonic/hurricane behavior in the past (not just limited to the North Atlantic). <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/palo.20012" target="_blank">Toomey <em>et al.</em> (2013)</a> used sediment cores to back-date hurricane events in the North Atlantic to 7,000 years(!). Groups like <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X15004781" target="_blank">Kenney <em>et al.</em> (2016)</a> have also looked into the fidelity of these measurements and found that sediment deposition from hurricanes is consistent despite high winds. This means that storm events don't necessarily cause significant mixing (or erasure) of stratigraphic profiles, which is a hugely important consideration when interpreting sediment cores.</p></div>		</li>
