			<div class="markdown"><p>Once upon a time I thought the word &quot;Several&quot; was just another word for Seven. You know how when you say &quot;I want a couple of ice-cubes?&quot; And &quot;Couple&quot; means 2? Pretty much I thought it was another version of that. </p>
<p>Somehow I made it to 12th grade physics without ever having been corrected about this.. I'd been struggling on a question for most of the lesson. The question was one of those worded maths equations where you read this short description of the problem then make a maths equation out of it, etc. So i see the word &quot;Several&quot; and figure ok so thats a 7... ive got all the peices I need to solve this problem! Except my answer wasnt adding up (Obviously). My teacher comes over to help - reads through my work and sees this seven. He asks me where I got this from and being the dumbass I was, I explained that I got it from the question as it mentioned several/severally.</p>
<p>Yeah nah turns out I'm a moron. He had fun explaining it to me though, i think it was because, for him, he now had one of those old war stories he could tell about this dipshit student who never realised that several is in no way connected to seven.. Ive been questioning everything I thought I knew ever since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, this might be a dumb question, but pale when depressed and red when angry seem to suggest less blood / more blood in the stomach area.</p>
<p>So, when we're depressed, would we subconsciously choose to eat something (like a cheese burger or ice cream - usual 'feel good / guilty pleasure' food because that would cause blood to rush back to the area to help digestion and in a strange cause / effect situation, stop us feeling depressed?</p></div>		</li>
