			<div class="markdown"><p>None of those things really apply to Mars, since we already know it has water ice. You mentioned using it as fuel, which is a very energy intensive process. If we can electrolyze the water, we certainly have enough energy to melt it.</p>
<p>As for &quot;everywhere there is water, there is life&quot;: All that really proves is that life on earth infects everything here, not that water is inevitably going to contain life. If the liquid water of mars contained too much sulfur (or whatever), it could prevent anything organic from ever growing. At that point, we're past &quot;life as we know it&quot;, and water is no longer special.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an important and overlooked distinction. Life on earth has gone on to 'infect' basically every trace of water on this planet, but this life comes from a source environment that we don't understand yet. </p>
<p>Life does not independently evolve in all bodies of liquid water on earth, existing life however happens to have spread to all liquid water here on earth. </p>
<p>If liquid water currently sustains life on Mars, it like has survived quite miraculously as a remnant of life that may have flourished in far more favourable and moist conditions billions of years ago, under completely different environmental conditions to those on Mars now. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Even this hard to say either way, because any new abiogenesis event would be completely dwarfed by the existing life in the same environment. Whether new life is rare or whether existing life is simple out-competing new life is difficult to clarify considering our limited sample size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Energy probably won't be that much of a problem for early Mars missions, because they'll probably bring along a small nuclear reactor. </p>
<p>And if you bring hydrogen along just mix it with the CO2 atmosphere - bam we have rocket fuel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also means if there is liquid water on another planet in our galaxy, the odds of liquid water on planets in most solar systems goes up quite a bit.  With those odds going up, it also pretty much guarantees the existence of life beyond Earth in some capacity.  Planets with liquid water will not be as rare as we once believed.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We already know water is extremely abundant in our solar system. Some of the outer moons are basically gigantic oceans covered by ice. It's practically boring at this point to announce that a comet has water ice.</p>
<p>The only question is if Mars has liquid water, not even if it has H2O in frozen form (which we already know there is plenty of).</p>
<p>Water is likely to be extremely abundant in the universe. It's made out of hydrogen (by far the most common element), and oxygen (released in truly massive quantities by exploding stars). Oxygen loves binding to other atoms, and water is a particularly easy and stable arrangement for it.</p>
<p>All that's need(ed) for the water to be liquid is heat, and there's plenty of that in the right places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do we always focus on water as the source of life. Can't completely different forms of life that have no need for water, oxygen or an earth-like atmosphere exist? Surely it's a bit arrogant to think that our form of life is the only form of life.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oxygen is also the <em>third-most</em> common element in the universe, although it is a distant third after Hydrogen and Helium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't water on Mars &amp; Earth just mean that something happened in our solar system to bring us water, and not necessarily that water is more abundant throughout the universe than we previously thought?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but if something happened in our solar system to bring us water, such as asteroids which is a common theory, then that event would very likely also happen in other solar systems.  Given also ice on various moons throughout our solar system as well as likely an ocean under one of Saturn's moons, I believe the discovery of water also being on Mars can at least allow us to entertain the idea that water is not as rare as we thought in the universe and in fact may be quite common.</p>
<p>Given that assumption it can also be concluded..based on the theory of water being common, that alien life in some capacity can be quite common throughout the universe.  Its very exciting.  </p></div>		</li>
