<p>While we are members of the single market, we have a voice in shaping the EU regulations. If we leave, then we'll have to obey all the regulations if we want to be able to export goods to the EU, but won't get any say in what those regulations are.</p>

<p>Wouldn't this put the UK at a major economic disadvantage considering that they now would have less power to influence the regulations that they're still subject to?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it would. Norway has complained about this for a while, as that's the position they are in. They are actually in the single market though, so they are exempt from the duty aspect. They still have the obey the regulations though, without any representation (as are not EU members.)</p>
<p>If we leave, we don't <strong>have</strong> to follow the regulations, but economically it would be difficult not to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So are there plans in place to renegotiate all existing trade deals? How would the UK get around following EU regulations regardless of their decision to remove themselves from it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So do the swiss. They also remark that they don't have the capacity in man-hours or in political power to debate EU law and regulations in any detail. Meaning not being an EU-member but still being part of the single market is a pretty huge hit to your sovereignty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The theory that pro-exit people bring up is that the UK can now make trade deals with various countries on a more specific basis, which narrows the scope of the deal and makes it more customized towards the UK's favor. </p>
<p>In a sort of bad example as I don't fully understand the process: When part of the single market, such trade deals need to come from the perspective of the EU as a whole, so the UK trying to make a deal with say, Canada, would have to make concessions in the deal with regards to Germany, which might make the deal worse for the UK.</p>
<p>What remains to be seen is if these new UK-specific deals will overcome the loss of efficiency that being part of the EU single market brought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That egg washing fact is mind boggling!!</p>
<p>I lived in the UK for a year and noticed that no one refrigerated their eggs. When I came back to North America, I stopped refrigerating my eggs because I assumed it just wasn't necessary. They always taste weird now and I didn't get why....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They last longer if you refrigerate them, but once you have cooled them, the membrane breaks and they won't last long not being refrigerated. Refrigerating them at home is fine, but it's not a good idea in the supply chain. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think they do - no supermarket I've ever been in stored their eggs in the fridges. They just keep it out on the shelves in boxes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good information, thanks. </p>
<p>About the duties between countries, couldn't this help the UK by motivating foreign companies to set up shop in the UK?  An Italian autopart manufacturer wouldn't have to pay duties if they set up shop in the UK right? </p>
<p>And wouldn't it sort of &quot;come out in the wash&quot; if the Italian company pays duties moving parts into the UK, and the UK pays duties moving parts into Italy, don't they sort of offset?  Obviously, the biggest exporter would benefit, but for the most part they would equal out right? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 26 countries in the EU apart from the UK, it will very often not be worth the bother for companies in those countries to set up a subsidiary in the UK just to simplify selling things to the relatively small UK market especially if they are going to want to keep profits flowing back to their home company. </p>
<p>On the other hand, UK companies will often be sitting there with the opposite problem of having to consider setting up subsidiaries so as to have easier access to one of the largest markets in the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the government provides services for the people and takes taxes from the people (or businesses in this case).  So if duties are collected, then the government can reduce corporate taxes or taxes on individuals.  </p>
<p>So either the companies would get a break, or the people would get a break and have more money to spend in the economy, which benefits the business.  So in the end, it would all work itself out. </p></div>		</li>
