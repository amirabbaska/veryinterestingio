The discount window rate is typically above the Federal Funds rate, although it's was still pretty cheap to borrow from during the recession.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discount_window" target="_blank">Source</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's one of my pet peeves... The Fed doesn't set the <em>rate</em>. It sets a target for the rate that it maintains through open market operations, deposit requirements, and the discount window (as you know already, I just wanted to clarify)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which also explains why most workers will never see high wages: the companies that borrowed and made money via the stock market and oversea investing (technology and workers that replaced our workforce) are keeping the money for them and their investors. This was very &quot;trickle down economics&quot; and it didn't work.
Great explanation, by the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a bit more to the story here, though. &quot;Trickle-down&quot; assumes that companies don't commoditize their employees, and instead treat them as an investment, no? </p>
<p>As such, for Trickle-down Economics to work, in theory, a more profitable company will increase the wages of their employees, thus improving their lot. </p>
<p>The reality, though, is that employees are and have always been considered a commodity, not an investment. That is to say, labor is &quot;purchased&quot; the same way that all other equipment necessary to the business is, and so the business in turn pays the lowest possible market rate to obtain the goods/services needed to run their business. </p>
<p>This is what made Unions so powerful, and why Unions are actually, for all the shit that they get, a good idea: Unions act the same way that an independent labor firm would by negotiating with corporations for the pay and benefits expected for the labor provided by the employee. They stymie the ability of corporations to use threat of a loss of a job and arbitrary rules/conditions for employment. </p>
<p>Now, the only pressures that companies have in setting wages are the competition between companies for individuals with specific talents, which, like all supply and demand, means that they will pay as little as possible but high enough to attract talent over the other guy, assuming 1:1 job availability. </p>
<p>that's why you see so many people that dislike the H1B visa programs being abused by companies, and off-shoring: it gave companies an out to buy super-cheap labor at wages that don't pass for a living wage, and definitely below what anyone in the US can afford to make without taking drastic actions. </p>
<p>Then, of course, you also have the impact of inflation on stagnant wages, which means that as the price to make and deliver goods goes up, so too do the prices of goods, without wages keeping pace. SO, on paper you could make, say, $250k in California, for example, but end up paying out 75% of it on basic necessities, and assuming inflation keeps driving up prices, unless wages raise at the same pace, the percentage of your income going to basics will keep tightening your available discretionary spending.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The H1B Visa program isn't just bad because of the wage pressure. It also creates compliance pressure since the Visa has to be sponsored by the company and these workers don't just stand to lose their jobs but they will get deported too. So they'll never say no to working extra hours, skipping breaks, etc. Because they don't have the option. And now neither do you, because you're competing with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To me it is obvious trickle down is a flawed philosophy.   Obviously weallth flows upward from the consumer to the producer.      </p>
<p>A poor person spends a larger proportion of their income than a rich person so raising the income of the lowest class however we can should have the largest  positive affect on the economy.    Raising the income of the wealthiest class will only succeed in increasing the amount of money in their personal bank account. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply-side_economics" target="_blank">Supply-side economics is likened by critics to the theory of trickle-down economics, which may, however, not actually have been seriously advocated by any economist in that form.</a></p>
<p>I'm definitely an arm chair economist but I'm of the opinion it might work when the market is inefficient and companies want to invest in them selves to become more efficient. However, if the market is efficient and your company doesn't benefits from self investment, then tax breaks go straight to profits. </p></div>		</li>

Yes, we have tried &quot;trickle down economic&quot; for about 34 years now, and the tide has most definitely NOT lifted all boats. Time for a new idea. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny when conservatives use that line to push trickle down, because if that's true, it should work the other way around, right? If you enrich the poor, shouldn't the money 'trickle up' to corporations? That's the only place it really CAN go. Consumers tend to spend their money quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think lowering the federal funds rate or engaging in quantitative easing are considered supply side economics or the &quot;trickle down&quot; policies president Reagan is know for.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I question that the money was ever intended to create jobs.  It was intended to stabilize the big banks.  It was assumed that this would end up creating jobs because fifty years ago, this would have been true.  Fifty years ago, the US wasn't home to primarily multinational companies and there weren't well trained work forces coming available in third world countries.  I think OP's question is another case of mistaking correlation with causation.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.  The money truly was intended to create jobs, and the exact amount of monetary policy/quantitative easing plus fiscal stimulus was meant to be chosen at precisely the level needed to restore full employment.  The fact that the total magnitude of expansionary policy was less than what was needed has <em>nothing</em> to do with Fed policy per se - it was a failure on the fiscal stimulus side, because Obama wanted pointless bipartisanship and that required cutting the stimulus down to get GOP support.</p>
<p>However, the both the administration and the Fed did pursue some <em>other</em> policies that stabilized the banks at the expense of the recovery.  In the first place, they should have nationalized the banks that needed help instead of lending them money, but they didn't want to: at best this was prioritizing financial stability against the public good, at worst it was a giveaway.  Second, the Fed paid interest on reserve requirements in an effort to strongarm all the banks into meeting voluntary reserve requirements, and that was nothing but stability at the expense of recovery.</p></div>		</li>
