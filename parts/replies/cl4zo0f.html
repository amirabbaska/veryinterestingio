			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer to a good question. Since your advice isn't free I'd better shell out some gold.</p>
<p>Quick follow up: Is enthalpy in this case equivalent to potential energy? I don't see a pressure or volume change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Enthalpy has an internal energy term U (dH = dU + p[dV]). If volume change is 0 and we keep at atmospheric pressure, we're looking at an energy term. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It comes down to electrostatics (again, note we are dealing with enthalpic considerations, which is our clue here). The electrostatic interaction between the walls of the napkin and water is greater than the interaction between water molecules</p>

<p>Magnets, how do they work? </p></div>		</li>
