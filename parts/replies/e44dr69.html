			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok. so Government mortgage refers to a mortgage securitized through Ginnie Mae, so is an FHA, Department of Veterans, Debt of Agriculture or a few other programs. Government mortgages can be Purchase or Refinancing, so a slowdown in Refinancings is a separate issue compared to a decline in Gov't share of mortgage origination.</p>
<p>Slowdown in refinancing: this is rate driven, however it doesn't tell you really anything about the strength of the housing market. </p>
<p>Decline in government share of mortgage origination: private mortgage insurance (PMI) has been gaining share at the margins versus FHA/GNMA (an alternative way to think of this is that more loans are going to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac than Ginnie Mae) - the reasons for this are a few fold: 1) GSEs (Fannie Freddie) started offering a higher LTV product that more directly competes with FHA; 2) Credit box has been widening for conforming (GSE) loans, 3) Many large banks (JPMorgan for instance) substantially cut back FHA lending due to Contingent Liability (this was years ago though and freedon / quicken picked up a lot of the slack); 4) Investigations into &quot;churning&quot; may have slowed some of the more aggressive FHA refinancing programs (haven't seen this in data yet).  The Mortgage Insurers recently reduced their rate cards which could shift additional market share form FHA to the GSEs, but most of these went into effect in June, so we haven't seen the impact yet. </p>
<p>TLDR: Refinancing &amp; Government mortgages are apples to oranges. Refinancing are rate driven but that doesn't talk to health of the housing market. Gov't market share shifting to other programs is also whatever, and hasn't been very meaningful and that volume isn't disappearing - just going through alternative pipelines.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Colorado (near Denver) and houses are selling above asking price within a week, however there's still been a slowdown due to people not selling as quickly as they would like because other places in the area are so expensive, so even if you can sell your house for 2x what you bought it for, you can't afford to really upgrade to a better house a lot of the time.</p>
<p>Also, investors used to buy houses cheap, flip them and sell them at a higher price, but after the last recession in 2008 they bought them and instead of selling them they're mostly keeping them and renting them out, so the number of houses for sale on the market is lower than after previous recessions.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>For those that may have a hard time grasping this concept, here is an example...</p>
<p>So, let's pretend you bought your house for $500k.  You put 20% down ($100k), and you paid off $25k of the principal over the past few years, so you now owe $375k in principal.  </p>
<p>If it is now worth $1mm (double $500k), you want to upgrade to a house that is $1.2mm,  and you use all of the equity in your current house as a down payment on the new one, you would owe (375+200) = $575k on the new property, minus any sales fees.  If interest rates have not risen and you keep the same duration of loan (eg. 30 years), then your payment would be 43% higher than on your previous home (575/400 = 1.43).  </p>
<p>Since interest rates have risen over the past couple years, your payment would be significantly more than 43% more.  A $2000 payment becomes $2900+.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same is going on in Utah. House values keep going up and there is actually a shortage of housing.
Wife and I considered selling and buying a new home about six months ago because our home value had gone up around $60k. But then we looked at houses we wanted and they were all over $400k. And within a day of them being listed, they would have five offers, all over asking price.
A buddy of mine is a realtor and he thinks there will definitely be a correction in the next couple of years. But until then house prices will continue to climb. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man that's long.. We were looking for a house for a good while.<br />
Every time a house was put on the market we'd be there the same day and 9/10 times we were not the first to put a bid on the house.  </p>
<p>The house we ended up buying, even though we were not the first bid, we did end up getting it over 11 other offers.  All made on the same day.</p>
<p>A few hours is really not long enough to figure out everything that comes with a house and whether or not it'll be a good match for your life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I'm at in the us, schools are about to start, they usually start the last week or 2 in August. If you go further north, schools start to include days for extra heavy snow days that if it's a heavy year, they have school on those days, if it is a light year (as in less snow days) they just have the day off and have a 3 day weekend. This is done so school will start and stop on a known date unless there's just an insane amount of snow days. Or at least that's what I've seen where I've lived. Idk about really far north where they basically live in snow in the winter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only half true. Home affordability remains in pretty good bounds versus historical norms - and broadly speaking down payment is still more of a constraining factor (at least in terms of survey answers as to why people are putting off buying). Even with higher rates existing home sales have been pretty range bound since 2016.</p>
<p>You have seen some frothiness and slowing in certain high end markets but not broad based. On top of that lending standards are slowly creeping wider, making it easier to get a mortgage / buy a house. </p>
<p>The big issue atm is housing stock of entry level homes and cost of new construction. This is impacting the new home buyers, and depressing housing turnover, which has a carryon effect in the broader market. Housing supply remains quite constrained.</p>
<p>With regards to being over due for a correction: My personal view is that corrections at this point in the cycle will be geographic and not broad based. </p>

<p>Edit: the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard puts out a pretty solid annual report looking at the state of housing (<a href="http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/state-nations-housing-2018" target="_blank">LINK</a>). If you aren't following month to month trends (and even if you are), this is a pretty good source for broad based housing market commentary. </p></div>		</li>

<p>We're seeing nationwide slowdowns in mortgage applications, and an increase in rejections due to underwriting concerns. That's why you're seeing standards being lowered - it's an effort to approve borrowers who are marginal.</p>
<p>I agree that price corrections will be regional, however. This isn't 2008.</p>

<p>The increase in rejections is interesting - Fed Senior Loan Officer Survey shows a loosening in GSE eligibility standards; and you've seen FICO bucket and LTV creep in volumes... You did see a pull back in risk layering with the cut-back in high DTI lending early in the spring (but that's the only credit tightening event i remember seeing).... So increased rejections implies that applicants are getting worse? </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a huge point. </p>
<p>We bought well under what we could have technically afforded a few years ago and bought a 'starter' house in need of work.</p>
<p>I've spent the last 2 years and god knows how much money (well i could tell you, but i'd cry if i did the math) taking what was a basic 1960s cape, and bringing it up to what people consider current standards.</p>
<p>As such, there is one less &quot;cheap&quot; house on the market.</p>
<p>a lot of people went that route in the last 5 years.</p></div>		</li>
