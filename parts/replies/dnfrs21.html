			<div class="markdown"><p>That hasn't been done yet of course, but it might not be impossible, and it's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive" target="_blank">Alcubierre drive</a>. I don't understand the physics behind it, but as you said the general idea is that moves space around it in a sort of bubble, but it'd carry lots of energy with it, creating a large outburst of energy when it stops. Also it needs a imperial fuckton of energy to run, and due to some quantum mechanic thing, it might not even be possible. Like I said I really don't understand it too well, its a bit beyond me right now, and I haven't looked into it much, but feel free to research about it for your audiobook, and be sure to PM me about it once you get it going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea behind the Alcubierre drive is that it wraps space-time around a ship. Creating a &quot;bubble,&quot; isolating the ship into a sort of pocket universe (&quot;warp field&quot;).</p>
<p>The bubble is designed in such a way that it's leading edge (the direction you want to travel) is attractive, while the opposite edge is repulsive.  </p>
<p>The bubble, being made of space-time, is not subject to the relativistic speed limit, so it can travel many times faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>The ship inside of the bubble isn't actually moving with respect to the space around it, so no relativistic time dilation or other nasty effects.</p>
<p>There are just a few problems:  </p>
<p>First, this setup takes a metric butt-ton of energy and maybe some impossible things like exotic matter with negative energy.  We're talking anywhere from the mass-equivalent of a medium-sized asteroid up to more energy than the entire Universe, depending on who did the calculations</p>
<p>Second, once the bubble forms, the ship inside is causally disconnected from the rest of the universe--there's no way to shut the field off.</p>
<p>Third, the leading edge panther bubble would trap particles from the interstellar medium--and because of it's ridiculously high speeds, these particles would be trapped with <em>stupidly</em> high energies:  dropping out of warp would release an unimaginable burst of radiation and energy (explosion)--and the farther you travel, the bigger the boom, all the way up to &quot;artificial supernova.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Erm, while I agree with the bubble, I read it not so much as the leading edge is more &quot;Attractive&quot;, but rather that it's bending spacetime itself, similar in concept to the way gravity bends spacetime. If we could basically &quot;compress&quot; space leading the ship, and stretch the space behind the ship, the ship itself would be moving at a normal, subluminal speed relative to, say, earth. However, because we've distorted space somehow to &quot;compress&quot; it, we've altered the time it takes the ship to cross a certain distance of space. Sort of like temporarily and locally reversing the expansion of space between objects so that they are &quot;closer&quot;.  </p>
<p>Imagine that space is like a rubber sheet that's stretched out over, say, a table, and is moving like a toy car between two points drawn on the sheet. In &quot;flat&quot; space, the two points are, say, 2m apart. </p>
<p>Now, let's say we found a way to &quot;unstretch&quot; the part of the sheet ahead of the toy car as it moved. The toy car would still be moving at the same speed, but because the sheet in front of it is 'unstretched', the toy car can cross more &quot;space&quot; per unit of time than in &quot;flat&quot; space. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I have lots of lucid dreams and in one there was a spaceship shaped like a perfect sphere and invisible, and it travelled using the way you just described. Crazy. Thank you for the information!</p></div>		</li>
