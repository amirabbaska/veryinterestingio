			<div class="markdown"><p>How many people died trying to discover and learn how the ocean works? It's the only thing I can think about when hearing about that stuff. For every one person who went out in the right direction with the correct amount of supplies, how many didn't come back at all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't have to die to figure out that clouds like to group up over land. You don't need to die to see that stars have a regular course over the seasons. You just go where you can safely go until you get real good and then go a bit further etc. etc. I'm a firm believer that the Polynesians had a masterful handle on the seas since the ocean was basically their highway.</p></div>		</li>
