			<div class="markdown"><p>Also plants are generally limited more by CO2 availability then light, at least under full sun anyway. Thats why plants grow just fine in greenhouses with sun shades drawn to block a portion of the light, still getting all that they need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you expand a bit on the discussion of CO2 limitation? Is there some kinetic limitation for incorporation of CO2 into Rubisco or diffusion of CO2 from air to chloroplast? Water limitation can certainly be an issue for CO2 acquisition due to plant transpiration demands, but I'm less familiar with direct CO2 limitation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally limited by CO2 availability from the air. Still air will rapidly be depleted of CO2 around plants. This is why increasing CO2 in greenhouses under otherwise unlimited conditions (lots of light/lots of water) causes increased growth and can also increase plant heat tolerance.</p>
<p>Edit: Also why fans and wind are so good for rapidly growing plants and part of the reason why greenhouse ventilation is such a big deal.</p>
<p>Edit the 2nd: The &quot;unlimited conditions&quot; in the greenhouse would also need to include full access to nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's basically how inefficient RuBisCO is, as it will almost just as happily use O2 rather than CO2.</p>
<p>This is the reason there are different photosynthesis methods in plants:</p>
<ul>
<li>C3  </li>
<li>C4 - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_carbon_fixation" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_carbon_fixation</a></li>
<li>CAM  </li>
</ul>
<p>Now, you're correct that these methods are adaptations to environments, in particular water stress from transpiration.  But, the ultimate reason they are necessary is the inefficiency of RuBisCO / low concentration of CO2.  It's a tradeoff - you can maximize your concetration of CO2 with high transpiration, but then lose lots of water.  If there's lot's of CO2, you can still be efficient and have low transpiration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RuBisCO is also very slow kinetically compared to other enzymes, which is why there's such an enormous amount of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in the Philippines people burn leaves (along with their trash) because they believe it's supposed to help plants. I think it's doing more harm than good to both the environment AND the health of people breathing the stuff in. </p>
<p>Would burning leaves in a greenhouse increase the growth of plants? Is there any other simple way to increase the amount of CO2 in the air around plants you want to grow faster that isn't as harmful as leaf burning?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Burning them in the greenhouse would kill everything in it. Plants don't like smoke or fire at all. </p>
<p>However if you compost the leaves in the greenhouse you get lots of CO2 plus gentile even heat. Thats a good plan and moderately commonly done. I am sure that a google result will pull it up for you. It also wouldn't involve burning down your greenhouse. :)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/heating-greenhouse-compost-and-manure" target="_blank">Here</a> is a good basic guide, haven't read it in detail but seems helpful.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, I've seen purple plants before, like the plum tree, is that what they're doing???</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read arguments that they go hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>Purple plants take advantage of the strongest part of the spectrum, but they pass purple light. Understories will find that the green parts of the spectrum have been stripped, but the red and blue parts of the spectrum are now stronger -- organisms in those regions will evolve to take advantage of those (and end up reflecting/passing green light). This may have all gone down very early in evolutionary history (think of red and green algaes at different depths). The green variants ended up colonizing the land niches, where the whole process repeated but in an inverted form, with purple leaves evolving in the understories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. &quot;Purple&quot; plants have the same fundamental setup as green plants, but also contain accessory pigments. Plants of different colors are all green plants with additional pigments, and all still reflect a larger percentage of the green spectrum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>probably not because some processes require specific higher energy photons and won't work regardless of the energy gained from low frequency light.</p>
<p>Most plants get more than enough sunlight and the rate of photosynthesis is limited by the availability of carbon dioxide which can only diffuse into the stomata at a certain rate so there would be no benefit to absorbing green light instead of red or Blue</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Healthy green plants absolutely absorb across the entire visible spectrum, including the &quot;green&quot;. It just absorbs relatively less in green thus appearing green to our eyes.
