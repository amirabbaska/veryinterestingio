			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>During the Pascal-B nuclear test, a 900-kilogram (2,000 lb) steel plate cap (a piece of armor plate) was blasted off the top of a test shaft at a speed of more than 66 km/s (41 mi/s; 240,000 km/h; 150,000 mph). Before the test, experimental designer Dr. Brownlee had estimated that the nuclear explosion, combined with the specific design of the shaft, would accelerate the plate to approximately six times Earth's escape velocity.[9] The plate was never found, but Dr. Brownlee believes that the plate did not leave the atmosphere, as it may even have been vaporized by compression heating of the atmosphere due to its high speed. The calculated velocity was sufficiently interesting that the crew trained a high-speed camera on the plate, which unfortunately only appeared in one frame, but this nevertheless gave a very high lower bound for its speed. After the event, Dr. Robert R. Brownlee described the best estimate of the cover's speed from the photographic evidence as &quot;going like a bat!&quot;[9][10]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still so hard for me to wrap my head around these numbers. I read about this a couple years ago and I enjoy trying to imagine it from time to time but it's just...not possible. No metaphor or relation adequately describes the forces involved in this situation.</p>
<p>You've accelerated a manhole cover the size of a Volkswagen from zero to incomprehensible in the time it takes to leave only a single frame from a high speed camera's reel. It's just so fucking impressive. </p>
<p>And I love how low tech it is. Like all these other important things going on during the test and the scientists are like, &quot;you know what'd be fucking cool...?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it was made of metal, the powerful air-resistance could theoretically literally mold the metal through heat and raw force into an extremely aerodynamic shape so it could reach space with relatively no resistance. I think the YouTuber &quot;cody's lab&quot; did an experiment with a scaled down version with explosives and small metal plate. Check it out!!</p></div>		</li>
