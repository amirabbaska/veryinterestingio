<p>Does the spin of the planet also play a role? Do any planets settle with just north-south &quot;polar&quot; rings, or some other angle, or does the equator always win?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The spin of a planet is the result of the spin of the debris that collapsed to form the planet, and rings are typically formed from the same spinning debris cloud. The rings will eventually coalesce on the debris equator (which mirrors the planets equator), so yes, rings favor equatorial orbits. </p>
<p>Even planets with wonky axis of rotation, like Uranus, display equatorial rings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not necessarily true. There is evidence to suggest that Saturn's rings are quite young. In fact, a captured asteroid could result in an orbit that brings it close to the Roche limit long after the formation of the planet, thus producing rings that are not related to the rotation of the planet. However, there are tidal effects with the rings that can slowly shift their axis to align with the rotation axis of the planet.</p>
<p>The key thing here is Uranus. Uranus's high axial tilt suggests that some kind of large collision resulted in an unusual rotational axis, potentially after the formation of the planet. However, the rings of Uranus are equatorial, as are the orbits of most of the moons (approximately). IF Uranus's axial tilt occurred after formation of the rings, then there needs to be some mechanism by which the rings rotated with the planet.</p>
<p>More information is needed. An interesting discussion on this topic is here: <a href="https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/8112/how-long-do-planetary-rings-last" target="_blank">https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/8112/how-long-do-planetary-rings-last</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but since tidal forces are proportional to the size of the objects, they have very little direct effect on ring particles.  Tidal effects do tend to bring large moons into the equatorial plane and these may in turn affect ring planes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well rings can either be from the early stages of planetary formation or the rings could be the result of moons colliding or breaking up. In the first case if the ring is formed during planetary formation it is likely that the angular momentum of the ring and the planet is aligned, so the ring will coalesce around the equator.
In the latter case the ring will have the same angular momentum as the moon. Moons tend to orbit in the equatorial plane so the rings also tend to coalesce in the equatorial plane. But if the moon is not orbiting the equatorial plane neither will the ring. </p>
<p>However I believe that tidal forces may force the rings into an equatorial orbit. But as far as I know it is also unclear how long rings can last. Saturns rings for example a thought to be quite old, but some researchers believe that rings cannot last billions of years. So it is still an open question to some degree. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Eventually, through enough collisions, everything will settle down until you get a disc or a ring  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>How exactly does that happen? With particles in randomly oriented orbits there are clearly momentum and velocity vector components that are not aligned to the plane of the planet's rotation. How is it that these non-rotation-aligned components get canceled out while the components aligned with the rotation persist?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The debris that formed the planet basically never have <em>perfectly</em> equal angular momentum in all directions (a total angular momentum of zero).  As the particles form the planet and ring, the &quot;left over&quot; angular momentum is what determines the axis of rotation.  It's not that a certain axis is favored not to cancel out, it's that a certain axis tends to have a bit of surplus after all the cancellations happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The particles aren't truly randomly oriented. The disc that formed the planet and moons/rings were already moving/orbiting before they formed the planet, so the system begins with an angular momentum. After enough collisions, the system tends toward the statistical center of the momenta of the particles, which comes out to L_φ = 0, L_θ = whatever the systemic momentum already was. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was about to ask a follow-up question along this line. So in layman's terms, the plane of the disc is the average plane of momentum before collisions, and after collisions? </p>
<p>Is the average determined only by external input and all collisions that occur within the system maintain the same average plane of momentum? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the gravity of the debris also contribute to them occupying the same plane? Like a feedback loop where the more debris on a given plane has stronger gravity to pull in stray debris adding to gravitational pull on more stray debris until all debris are orbiting with minimal collision on the same plane?</p></div>		</li>
