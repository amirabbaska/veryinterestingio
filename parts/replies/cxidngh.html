			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry if I put a shade over everyone's day, I guess what I can say is that no matter if you believe after death there is infinite blackness or a kingdom in the clouds, my dog is now in a better place.</p>
<p>Also, that dog brought my family so much damn happiness, if I lived a life where on my deathbed I can say I singlehandedly improved the lives of 4 people, saved them from self harm, comforted them in the times that they needed me most, and gave and received an unexplainable amount of love, I lived a damn good life.</p></div>		</li>
