<p>If you look at the HP models from the 80s, you'll find that they STILL sell for good money. </p>

<p>Can confirm. I recently decided I wanted a simple RPN calculator for everyday use. I trolled around on eBay for HP calculators, since they're the only ones I know about that have this functionality. Checked the 15c first because &quot;lower number == older == cheaper&quot; and quickly noped away from that price.</p>
<p>(Wound up getting an HP 50g for $40 shipped. The thing is fantastic, but part of me still wants a smaller calculator like the 15c.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The HP 42s is amazing, small, and around $150. Best self-contained scientific ever made IMO.</p>
<p>The HP 32sII is somewhere around half the cost of a 42s, has slightly less functionality, but is the same size as the 42s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We moved two months ago, so if I still have it, it's buried in a box somewhere and hasn't been unpacked for a couple of moves. I used it through graduate level statistics, though.
Looking through pictures, I think it's probably an 11c, but possibly the 15c or 16c.</p></div>		</li>
