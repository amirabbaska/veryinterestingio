			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind, if you are living in America, the European people that you will see are going to be the wealthier ones who can afford international travel and vacations.  So your perspective of European body types may be skewed toward the wealthier, who have a notable advantage in health &amp; fitness. (think Beverly Hills)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a stricter educational program enforced by parents and more competitive job market in china makes them smarter, education in north America is a joke and most kids don't try anywhere near as hard as the average Chinese.  They work just hard enough to get by and pass, not competing for the #1 spot in the class.  So I doubt Chinese are smarter, just more education focused as a culture-but comparing their brain power and capacity to any other country and they'd likely be the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right. Obesity rate in Europe is 25%, in America it is 35%.  But our overweight (which includes obesity) percentages are roughly the same at 65%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That can really depend on the state your in and European country. European rates by country seem to be average lower 20s - 25 with a couple outliers like some close 30 and some right below 20. There are quite a few states below 25% and even more between 25 to 30 percent so unless you lived in one of the very obese states, any difference would be very hard to actually see, so I imagine there is some confirmation bias at play.</p></div>		</li>

The person comes in saying &quot;fact A is true, why?&quot;, when actually it's not and the entire question is invalidated because it relied on an assumption that is false. A better question would be &quot;what causes a beer belly and does the type of beer affect that?&quot;</p></div>		</li>
