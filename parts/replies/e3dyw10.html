<p>They didn't just send you anywhere they felt like it.</p>
<p>I had a couple friends I served with that were stationed with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Agency" target="_blank">White House Communication Agency</a>, which do things like set up foreign press conferences for the POTUS, and update the crypto on his car phone every day.</p>
<p>Also knew a couple of guys that served on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Constitution" target="_blank">USS Constitution</a>.</p></div>		</li>
