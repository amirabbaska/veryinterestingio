			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably more philosophical than is usual on this sub, but is this getting down to the problem of physics (and any science) as a human approximation of the natural world? And that our understanding of the universe is always shifting and coming down to finding something that is approaching the “T”-truth, but never actually getting there?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Every time you try to explain something you create an argument based on some dogma (a observation, or an idea you assume to be correct, the &quot;T&quot;-truth you are talking about, probably). But then, you can always ask: why is this truth correct? Then you proceed to create a new argument (theory) to answer that. And this cycle can always continue (that's what Feynman did with the reporter, showing that a why question has a huge amount of possible answers, to the point you reach a question you do not know how to answer anymore). </p></div>		</li>

<p>If you're interested in the purely (?) philosophical, Kant's idea of the noumena and phenomena is basically a discussion of the question you proposed. The <strong>general</strong> (no way I can put it shortly and not be controversial) point is that there are two &quot;realities&quot;. The noumenon is the thing in itself and the phenomenon is the thing in itself as it appears to the observer. Kant doesn't think we can access to the noumenal realm, but we can get closer. It's so much more interesting than that though, so if you're interested, I'd skim the link I posted.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That begs the question, what is an example of something we know that cannot be traced back to the standard model or general relativity? I assume quantum physics is one of those things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from parameters that feed into the standard model and general relativity (i.e. inputs to those models), there are only a few known natural phenomena that do not fit neatly into these theories, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>neutrino oscillation</li>
<li>dark matter</li>
<li>baryogenesis and leptogenesis*</li>
<li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_radius_puzzle" target="_blank">proton radius puzzle</a></li>
<li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalous_magnetic_dipole_moment" target="_blank">anomalous magnetic dipole of the muon</a></li>
</ul>
<p>*enough to explain the amount of matter in the observable universe</p>
<p>It is expected that many of these problems may be resolved by &quot;physics beyond the standard model&quot; -- some undiscovered modification of the standard model, or superceding theory such as a grand unified theory or theory of everything.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		</li>
