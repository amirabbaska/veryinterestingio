<p>When you get a curving boomerang throw right the first time it's terrifying as it comes back towards you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They don't exactly &quot;come back&quot;.</p>

<p>Yes this. I had one when I was a kid expecting it to go out and back like in Zelda or something like that and never learned to throw it.  It took the invention of YouTube for me to realize you basically throw it really hard and it just makes a large arc, and with practice, you can get it to come full circle back to you.  I heard they were for hunting and thought &quot;wow what a shitty hunting implement&quot; ...the toy part for the ones that curve so much makes more sense.</p></div>		</li>
