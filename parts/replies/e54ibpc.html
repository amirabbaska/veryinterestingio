			<div class="markdown"><p>When things go wrong (also excerpts taken from the book):</p>
<ul>
<li>“We slowly removed more and more of the tumour, and by midnight, after fifteen hours of operating, it looked as though most of it was out and the cranial nerves were not damaged. I should have stopped at that point, and left the last piece of tumour behind, but I wanted to be able to say that I had removed all of the tumour. As I started to remove the last part of the tumour I tore a small perforating branch off the basilar artery, a vessel the width of a thick pin. A narrow jet of bright red arterial blood started to pump upwards. I knew at once that this was a catastrophe. The blood loss was trivial, and easy enough to stop, but the damage to the brainstem was terrible. The basilar artery is the artery that keeps the brainstem alive and it is the brainstem that keeps the rest of the brain awake. As a result the patient never woke up and that was why, seven years later, I saw him curled into a sad ball, on a bed in the nursing home. I will not describe the pain of seeing his unconscious form on the ITU for many weeks after the operation.”</li>
<li>“The tumour was a mass of blood vessels, in the way that some brain tumours can be, and I had struggled desperately to stop the bleeding. The operation became a grim race between the blood pouring out of the child’s head and my poor anaesthetist Judith pouring blood back in through the intravenous lines as I tried, and failed, to stop the bleeding. The child, a very beautiful girl with long red hair, bled to death. She ‘died on the table’ – an exceptionally rare event in modern surgery. As I completed the procedure, stitching together the scalp of the now dead patient, there was utter silence in the operating theatre. The normal sounds of the place – the chatter of the staff, the hissing of the ventilator, the bleeping of the anaesthetic monitors – had suddenly stopped. All of us in the theatre avoided each other’s eyes in the presence of death and in the face of such utter failure. And as I closed the dead child’s head I had to think about what to tell the waiting family. I dragged myself up to the children’s ward, where the mother was waiting to see me.”</li>

<p>I can’t imagine having to lose a child in my care but also then have to tell the parents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cannot imagine having that kind of responsibility hanging on the smallest of errors. My job is not exactly trivial and if I were to fuck up seriously it could cause a lot of harm, but there's a pretty good margin of error and most fuckups can be fixed. I'm not sure I could handle doing something where a tiny mistake could mean the difference between life and death. </p>
<p>We are lucky to have people who can do this and keep doing it even after fatal mistakes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some surgeons can literally cut the scalp, drill off a part of the bone, resection an entire tumor, drill bone back on, and close skin in a matter of 2 hours all while debating Israel-Palestine with me. They are awfully impressive people in many instances. Some surgeries obviously require more work. The job is done when it's done—I often have to call surgeons SOs to tell them not to wait up for dinner...during a surgery that was scheduled to end at 10am.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yah.</p>
<p>IMO we need social insurance like some European countries have against bad outcomes.  Because malpractice/damages/litigation attaching when things go wrong just compounds the harm.  </p>
<p>I think it's awful that a medical provider can do as good of a job as is humanly possible, and then when someone has a terrible outcome they have to sue that provider and hope that they can prove some kind of fuck-up to get money to live on / provide for their family / pay for funeral / whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a hemangioma removed from a kids brain a few months ago on my neurosurgery rotation. I'll give some idea of how it went down:</p>
<ol>
<li>Previous CTa (angiogram) - which is a series of xrays with dye in the vessels - was uploaded to a 3D locator device. The locator has a wand that you touch to specific spots which correlate to spots on the xray. For instance, the software would put a dot on the xray's chin bone -&gt; you touch chin with wand.</li>
<li>After 3D locating syncing is done, you can move the wand along the head and it shows you that spot on the xray pictures. The surgeon has already decided where he wants to enter the skull and how to cut through brain in the least damaging location to retrieve tumor.</li>
<li>Shave/drill/cut into skull and create a window to work through.</li>
<li>Cut away the meninges, or leathery covering in the brain.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now on the previously done angiogram, you can see all the blood vessels feeding into the tumor. In this instance there were about 4 major ones. First the surface-most one was chosen.</p>
<p>5. Look for surface-most vessel feeding into the tumor through a microscope and using geographic landmarks from your CTangiogram. </p>
<p>6. Once that is found, carefully dissect around it with blunt instruments.</p>
<p>7. Use electrocautery device to close off that vessel.</p>
<p>This is repeated for the other 3 main vessels. For deeper ones, pieces of brain are strategically cut out or you just carefully dig alongside the tumor until can get to the vessel.</p>
<p>8. An xray machine is brought over the patients head and dye is injected. Take xrays to ensure that all the main blood vessels feeding into the tumor have been correctly cauterized closed.</p>
<p>9. Dissect away the tumor with a mix of blunt and sharp dissection (scissors and scalpel) also under a microscope until it is free and you can remove it.</p>
<p>9a. Along the way, any little bleeding that crops up, coagulate it with your electric cautery device (dont want any bleeding in the skull since its a closed space)</p>
<p>10. Close the meninges, +/- close the skull bone and skin.</p>
<p>11. Congratulations! You've just performed brain surgery!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The neurosurgeons regularly refer patients to us for neuropsychological assessment. Sometimes to see if the patient is fit for neurosurgery, but most of the time it's to to establish baseline cognitive profile. This will allow us to retest the patient after surgery to see if there are are cognitive impairment/difficulties following the surgery.</p>
<p>Anyway, I attended one of the neurosurgeries. The wand was hoenstyy what I was most impressed with! It's so cool!! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondering how cauterizing a blood vessel to the brain is acceptable. I know most of them are surface vessels and not sources of major circulation, but will it really be alright to just seal them up like that? </p>
<p>Why permenant cuterization rather than something like a vessel clamp?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the vessel. A hemangioma (actually the one I talked about above is an AVM but close enough for ELI5) is a tumor of blood vessels. The vessels going to it aren't natural or have been changed by the tumor's growth factor so they dont really function anymore. Most of the brain has collateral circulation though anyway so if you lose one vessel another supplies that same tissue. That being said, in really sensitive areas like the motor strip (small sliver of the brain that controls all the movement) you would think long and hard before ligating a vessel.</p>
<p>The problem with a clamp is that these are tiny tiny vessels usually that just started bleeding. Clamps are used in other surgeries in the abdomen and chest (for instance kidney transplants).</p></div>		</li>
