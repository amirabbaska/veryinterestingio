<p>The pathways that take place are sometimes very efficient (Krebs cycle) and sometimes can be less efficient like the Electron transport chain (where the most ATP  is produced) which will lose around 50 of a vital step (H+ gradient) as heat instead of generating ATP.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no sometimes, as far as I can tell between etc and krebs. You can't have Krebs cycle without ETC. Ultimately kerbs mainly produces NADPH which can't really be utilised without OxPhos.</p>
<p>Are you confusing Etc with lactic acid pathway? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he's referring to &quot;uncoupling&quot;, when the [H+] gradient is uncoupled from ATP synthase to generate heat.</p>
<p>Fun fact:  so called &quot;Brown fat&quot; is brown colored because its contains large numbers of mitochondria that generate heat via uncoupling.  Babies have a large proportion of brown fat to help maintain body temperature, even though their surface area to body mass ratio is so high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, the Krebs cycle is not exclusively used to produced the NADH and FADH2 used by the ETC to pump protons. The intermediates of the Krebs cycle are also central to several pathways for amino acid and nucleotide synthesis. So depending on the cell type and energetic status, the Krebs cycle or some part of it could be turning substrate over very rapidly, but not transporting electrons to the ETC.</p>
<p>Also, if the Krebs cycle is working faster than the ETC, the extra NADH is converted to NADPH by the NNT and used to help reduce the antioxidant proteins after they dismuate ROS (superoxide anions or hydrogen peroxide for example) </p>
<p>Additionally if the proton gradient producing half of the ECT completely stops (such as would happen when there is no oxygen) complex V of the ECT (the ATP synthase) will work in reverse to consume ATP and pump protons to maintain the proton gradient. </p>
<p>So classic energy generation does require the Krebs cycle and the ETC to work in tandem, the Krebs cycle has many functions other than sending electrons to the ETC, and the ETC can work without the Krebs cycle in an emergency. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is very nice to read another poster who actually knows their stuff. Good work! Basic physiology is the most valuable bit of knowledge that you'll take with you when you go out into the clinical world. Don't forget it. I would recommend that other interested posters download a free if slightly outdated medical textbook on physiology put out by Guyton and Hall. It's a very readable book and it is the world gold standard for stuff like this. It is not rocket science. Or you could buy the latest edition online.</p></div>		</li>
