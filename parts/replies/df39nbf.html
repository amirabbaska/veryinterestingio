			<div class="markdown"><p>OpenVPN is what you're looking for. Link is for doing it at Digital Ocean, but it should apply anywhere that offers Ubuntu server (which is any hosting company, really). Some knowledge of Linux command line helps, but really if you're even kinda technical you should be able to get by with copy paste and figure it out. </p>

<p>One thing to note is that this is not a good solution for doing illicit things. Your home ip will not be tracked, no, but your server ip will be. That server is yours and linked to you personally. Great for Netflix, not for torrents.</p></div>		</li>
