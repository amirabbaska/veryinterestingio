<p>I kind of expected an argument about how cars move faster that bikes, so time dilation would cause a decreased perception of speed or something like that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That also works with the plane. Your only real frame of reference is the plane itself, which is hopefully going as fast as you are. All other things you could see as a reference frame are clouds and the ground, which are too far away to aid speed perception. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly. If you are in a car, especially driving, you are probably looking at your phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good job getting both major points.  I would only add that point 2 is made more important by the things that contribute to point one.  Hitting a patch of gravel or a pot hole wrong in a 2,000 lb machine while wrapped in a seatbelt and airbags is considerably less threatening then doing so while perched on top of 20 lbs of aluminum or carbon fiber that will only serve to increase your potential for injury.</p>
<p>In a car, you're typically focused several hundred feet in front of yourself, while on a bike you need to react to things much closer.  So you see things appear to be moving faster.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's what does it for me. Well, that and the cars angrily swerving around me because I won't hug the curb at that speed.</p>
<p>25 MPH on a motorcycle is nothing like as scary despite the same exposed, wind-in-your-face thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the eyes focusing on stuff far away makes a lot of difference. Try looking straight out the side window (obviously not while driving) and look at lamp posts and stuff passing by. Looks a lot faster than viewing them 200m ahead. </p>
<p>Also, the closer the stuff around you are, the faster they'll appear. Seeing the trees 10m away from you on a wide road makes them seem slow, while on the bike on a normal trail the trees might be 1m away from you. And most importantly, you'll see the ground beneath you in your peripheral view while that's impossible to do in a car due to the floor. If you'd in a completely transparent car I bet it'd feel faster. </p></div>		</li>
