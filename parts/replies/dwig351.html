			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation, thanks!</p>
<p>It's crazy to me that people understand orbital mechanics well enough to calculate the best trajectory for maximum surface coverage for stuff like this. </p>
<p>Or the one that orbited that asteroid like 11 times before landing. Unrelated but this just is just incredible: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/TUkKuhf.gif" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/TUkKuhf.gif</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What a cool gif! I haven't seen that one before! I didn't realize they did so many gravity assists! </p>
<p>Just a quick correction/further specification: Lutetia and Steins are asteroids (flybys, mentioned on the gif) but the main target of Rosetta was comet 67P, not an asteroid. Though that certainly doesn't change how impressive it is! </p>
<p>Stay tuned in mid-late 2018 as currently-active missions Hayabusa2 (JAXA) and OSIRIS-REx (NASA) get to their target asteroids (Ryugu and Bennu) and we see the first really good images of them!! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's part of the reason it bugged me in The Martian when Donald Glover's character had the stunning revelation to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcyfDRYKDJM" target="_blank">use a gravity assist</a> and blew everyone's minds. Seems to me that would be pretty much the first thing anyone at NASA would come up with - we use those <em>all</em> the <em>time</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They have their ways... and it's not a secret. It's possible for you to learn and study their methods and papers, learn their maths, learn about their machines and instruments. There's no devine intervention. But it <em>is</em> glorious.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That’s a very good way of phrasing what I’ve tried to tell people before. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Good question.  A good response is to investigate.  Sadly the response often is <strong>only</strong> skepticism and subsequent ideology born from that attitude.  </p></div>		</li>

They showed us these miniature thrusters that could deliver a precise, minute amount of thrust for a fraction of a second. Absolutely amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are absolutely correct in this answer, except that fuel wasn't the only constraint that prevented us from imaging the other hemisphere of Mercury. The real limitation was Mercury's magnetic field.</p>
<p>You see, the mission to Mercury was a mission of two camps. In one camp were the planetary geologists who were fascinated by the lunar like surface on a high density planet, and in the other camp were planetary magnetic field experts who were fascinated by such a small world having a full magnetic interacting with the Sun. </p>
<p>Both camps had some objectives filled by the first pass: the surface of one hemisphere was imaged, showing the wonderful structures seen in this image, and the magnetic field was measured in unprecedented detail. There was enough fuel for one more pass of Mercury, and the aims of the two groups were entirely split. Geologists wanted to observe the other half of the planet and space physicists wanted to fly past the night side of the planet, because that hemisphere would be facing away from the Sun. That would allow the first ever measurement of an empty magnetic cavity away from any solar influence, but of course you wouldn't be able to image the dark surface.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the magnetic community won the argument, to the long term chagrin of geologists. I learnt about Mercury from one of the old hands from this mission in the nineties, and he still railed against the decision. Now I'm in the space physicists community, I've seen the other side of the argument, and of course we have now seen Mercury's other hemisphere, and I think the choice was the right one... But until recent observations, we didn't know for sure whether we'd missed something amazing in this hidden other half.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but i agree that the magnetism measurements were more important than the surface imaging.</p>
<p>Understanding the interactions of planetary and solar magnetic fields is more relevant to our lives on Earth than planetary formation and geology. Those magnetic fields affect our telecommunications, power grid, exposure to cosmic radiation, and radiotelescope observations.</p>
<p>To put it simply from a scientific view, the magnetic observations would give us not only more answers and more relevant answers, but it would be more helpful in finding the answers to questions beyond itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating, I was unaware of this story.  I think there's something I'm missing, though... the magnetic field guys care about which side of the planet they fly past, but for making global maps from moderate distance, the planetary geologists care about <em>which side is sunlit</em>.  If there was enough fuel to enter a 3:1 orbit that made a second pass at a time when the &quot;mystery side&quot; was sunlit, making the geologists happy, they could have just flown by the night side on that pass and make the space physicists happy.</p>
<p>The geologists wouldn't get <em>high resolution</em> images without a close flyby on the dayside, but at least they'd have a global map.</p>
<p>I've got a planetary geologist friend who should know the answer to this, I'll ask him.</p></div>		</li>
