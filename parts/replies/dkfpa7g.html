<p>Read a little about Millikan. He won a nobel prize in physics in the 20's. His professor in greek asked him to teach physics but he had no expirience with the subject and read up on it during the summer and teached his class like a pro. </p>
<p>Couldn't find anything about the oximetry machine tho but nonetheless a very intresting dude!</p></div>		</li>
