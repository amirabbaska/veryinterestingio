<p>When you are awake, it builds up and makes you feel tired.

<p>But this could just be a flag or indicator for a far more complicated process, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's thought that the buildup of certain chemicals has a causative role in tiredness.<br />
For example, caffeine antagonises (blocks) the effect of adenosine and makes you feel less tired.<br />
But it's probably not the whole story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right but is the adenosine the product of another reaction, or are our bodies specifically putting it out to make us feel tired, so that we might do the necessary repair and rejuvenation work done during sleep?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In short, yes, but the specifics of how compounds get removed from sleep is still a topic of a lot of debate. What is known is that, when we sleep, the balance between intracellular space and extracellular space of the brain shifts drastically. Under awake conditions, the extracellular compartment takes up about 14% of the brain's volume, whereas in sleep conditions it becomes about 23% of the volume. It's this compartment that contains the chemicals that can interact with cells and affect their functioning (e.g. neurotransmitters). It is believed that this increase in the size of the compartment facilitates the clearing of these chemicals. </p>
<p>So, when we're awake, the space is small, buildup of metabolites and chemicals might occur and impact how our brain normally functions. When we sleep, the space expands, allowing for these compounds to clear and we can get back to a baseline concentration of these chemicals. The fact that the space expands and shrinks between states is well accepted, but the details of how clearance is changed in these states is still a topic of debate.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know there is a lot of research on how sleep helps us recover from the stuff that happens when we're awake. If there any research being done on how to reduce the awake-time stresses on the body so that we can be better off during those awake time hours (and to mitigate the problems that come from when we don't get as much sleep as we need as individuals)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anything could be revealed in the future, but it's the best theory we have at the moment (and very new). One example of supporting evidence comes in the form of higher levels of beta-amyloid in people with alzheimers and dementia, who show consistent sleeping difficulties. AmyloidB is one of the chemicals cleaned out of the brain by cerebrospinal fluid while we sleep, and amyloid plaques are markers for these diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I always wake up and spend my whole day feeling tired, even after getting proper amounts of good, full sleep, does this mean that I have an issue getting rid of that build up? At least in theory </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I've wondered since I learned about adenosine affecting tiredness: is this the same as the adenosine in adenosine triphosphate (ATP)? Is it adenosine whose phosphate has broken off in the reaction that releases energy in cells?</p></div>		</li>
