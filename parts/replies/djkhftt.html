			<div class="markdown"><p>Before I was diagnosed with major depression, I had a very similar problem. Nausea and vomiting every single day for no apparent reason. Eating would make it stop, but I had no appetite and all food looked disgusting, so I'd force myself to eat fruit. Turns out that it was entirely attributable to my depression. It stopped after I started taking an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor).  Serotonin controls a plethora of bodily functions, so not having enough of it (the most likely root cause of clinical depression) affects more than just your mood, including digestion and body temperature regulation (you may feel cold all the time.) Some people with depression such as myself feel the physiological effects of depression more severely. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry what?  Unless you have a predisposition to hypoglycemia or some other disorder fasting isn't dangerous....in fact it's quite healthy and one of THE best ways to lose weight.</p>
<p>I fast daily.  I don't eat breakfast or lunch.  No snacks, just water.
I have dinner and then sometimes a snack later on before bed.  This reduces my total caloric intake to between 800-1500 per day.  Super easy to lose weight like this without doing any exercise at all (but a little exercise is always good).</p>
<p>I've never gotten &quot;lightheaded&quot; or &quot;exhaustion&quot; from fasting.  I only get that hunger nausea sometimes, and if so, it lasts less than a minute and goes away as soon as I drink some water.  And that might happen once or twice a day if at all.</p>
<p>I have a friend who I've even watched pass out due to not eating on time, but she specifically has hypoglycemia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You understand there is a huge difference from fasting on purpose and getting used to not eating all day by your self but when your body stops telling you that you need food it is an emergency. Fasting is safe as you make it. Starving yourself because you're too mentally overwhelmed. Whole different ball park my friend. If you've personally experienced any sort of emotional trauma it's the same effect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nutrient deficiencies can increase depression so please try to force yourself to eat good food. </p>
<p>I know it's fucking hard sometimes but it is so important and ridiculous how much it actually makes a difference. </p>
<p>Depression and anxiety can both also make you feel not hungry when your body needs more calories and nutrients :/ </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went through some hard times and got pretty depressed and it was amazing how little I could eat. You just have to force yourself, milkshakes helped me get in the calories. Try and see a Doc, there are treatments for depression.</p></div>		</li>
