			<div class="markdown"><p>The only problems I have with this hypothesis is that (1) they'd have to both ignore the obvious eye sockets in the skull (a huge - pardon the pun - oversight), and (2) not know about elephants.</p>
<p>Number 1 is more important. These weren't modern people with supermarkets. They were familiar with slaughter and animal carcasses. Skulls weren't hypothetical imagery on pirate flags; they were things they put into pots to boil for soup. </p>
<p>It's an interesting theory, but not everything imagined has to have &quot;reasonable&quot;, logical origins. Hillary Clinton's supposed child-sex-ring operating out of pizza parlors makes one-eyed giants seem downright plausible...</p>

It's really not hard to see how the trunk-hole looks much more like an eye socket than the eye-holes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay I knew that was an Elephant skull from your description, but I still think that looks like a cyclops. And I'm not some grog-sodden Greek sailor. </p></div>		</li>
