			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel the problem intrinsically lies in the somewhat ambiguous terminology.</p>
<p>To distill this issue, one can look at the game of connect 4.  There are strategies and general concepts, but a perfect game has the first player win every time.  Does this mean, assuming who goes first is set randomly, the game is completely chance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it is believed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solving_chess" target="_blank">chess is solvable</a>^*, it is not yet known how it would be solved.  We don't know if white could always force a win, if black could always force a win, or if either player could always force a draw.  Without that information, we can't say if the randomness of the starting color makes a perfect game of chess random.</p>
<p>^* Sorry for the Wikipedia link, I'm not up for searching any more deeply right now.</p></div>		</li>

But the complexity is greater than today's computers can handle and probably greater than today's players can handle. The best players (Trump excluded) use an evaluation system to determine which strategies have the best likelihood of success.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the example of chess, the popular school of thought is that with perfect play the game's result is a draw.</p>
<p>But even in a game of chess, the line for what defines chance is somewhat blurred.  An interesting question would be, &quot;In a game that is defined to have no factor of chance, should the better player always win?&quot;</p>
<p>If you answer yes, one could claim that a game like chess is <em>not</em> a game without chance.  After all, with enough hypothetical time, a robot playing completely random valid moves (a chess player most children could beat), can eventually win a game of chess against Magnus Carlsen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like you would want to look at how much advantage can be gained by playing perfectly versus playing randomly. For War, there is no advantage (100% chance). For Connect 4, perfect play will defeat random play 100% of the time for the advantaged side (0% chance). For Blackjack and Monopoly, it's somewhere in between. How do you calculate which one is more chance?</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could look at the difference between optimally good versus optimally bad play, but that would skew results for games like Blackjack where a 100% losing strategy is available. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While plausible, due to the connotations that are associated with &quot;chance&quot;, it can lead to strange conclusions.</p>
<p>Lets play a card game called &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;. We both get half a deck for a hand.  We both have to play any one card from our hand (can choose).  If you play ace of spades, you win.  If neither player plays ace of spades, you swap hands, and continue play.  In practice, this is a game of 100% chance, because you will just look through your hand, and if you got ace of spades you win.  </p>
<p>However, a random player versus perfect player:  Random player will lose 50% of the games (when perfect player gets the ace).  They will lose 25/26 (96%) of games where they have the ace, when they fail to use &quot;skill&quot; to play the ace of spades.</p>
<p>With this, we can deduce a perfect player only has a 1.92% chance of losing.  Implying this is a game largely of skill, and not chance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a way to separate randomness inherent to the game itself (e.g. dice rolls) and 'luck' that results from sub-optimal gameplay by your opponent? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. We are simply not calling the latter &quot;luck&quot;.  We want to know what portion of a game is dice roll luck assuming perfect play.</p></div>		</li>
