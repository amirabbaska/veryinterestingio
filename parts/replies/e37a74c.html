<p>Become an art historian.  We use it all the time.  You know, to describe things that are rectilinear.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The rectilinear art nouveau style of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. </li>
<li>The exhibition illustrates developments in modern architecture as a movement away from the uniformity of standardized rectilinear forms.  </li>
<li>The bouleuterion generally was a covered, rectilinear building with stepped seating surrounding a central speaker’s well in which an altar was placed. </li>
<li>The ancient boteh motif was widely used by weavers throughout Persia and India ... the pattern could be displayed in various directions and arrangements, in a curvilinear or rectilinear style.  </li>
<li>At this time Asian motifs found their way onto all makes of Greek pots. Curvilinear patterns, sometimes of wild exuberance, supplant the older, rectilinear ones. </li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on and on.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s from the song “Get Off,” I believe from the Generator album. And holy shit are they not verbose. I’ve had to look up words in the dictionary after listening to some of their songs. </p>
<p>Edit: it’s from against the grain. Not generator. </p></div>		</li>
