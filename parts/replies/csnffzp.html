			<div class="markdown"><p>I am an American living with my wife and her family in northern Japan. We actually eat fugu (puffer fish) regularly in the form of fish stew. The white meat (probably the only parts Americans would eat) is quite safe. It is not nearly as risky as the Simpsons would have you believe. Sometimes you get pieces of the organs but the fish has been cut to remove the poisonous areas. I swear that sometimes if I eat around the bones, there is a tingly sensation felt immediately in my lips and my father in law says many Japanese enjoy that sensation as a kind of risk factor. I've even had it so strong once where the tip of my tongue felt numb. It's actually pretty tasty fish and relatively cheap since many Japanese are avoiding it these days do to the increased social stigma through greater use of the Internet. To me the white meat tastes like a slightly tougher cod. I am always happy to have it for dinner though. Even my daughter who is 11 months old has eaten it. My wife mushes it up and feeds her just like she was fed when she was a baby. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I lived in Japan I visited Shimonoseki, which is famous for its fugu. I was told this story:</p>
<p>Two fishermen caught a blowfish and decided to make a stew out of it. However, when it was finished, they were both too afraid to try it. So, they decided to give a bit to a homeless man and see if he survived. The next day, they saw the homeless man up and about, so they knew the stew was safe. They enjoyed the blowfish stew and went back to the dock to fish. Later that day, the homeless man went looking for them, and when he saw them working, he knew their stew was safe to eat. He then went back to his tent and took out the stew, which he had yet to try, and enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: I have no idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The story seems to touch upon whether the homeless man should be suspicious of the fishermen's intentions when accepting gifts (had he decided to go ahead and accept this feast and it turns out to be laced with chemicals...)</p>
<p>The second part is to demonstrate that people who go out and use others will get their just desserts (that the fishermen would've died if the stew was in fact, poisonous...)</p>
<p>So perhaps the moral of the story not to lay that burden (in this case, testing your food) on others if you can't handle it yourself.</p></div>		</li>
