<blockquote>
<p>This the exact opposite of what entanglement is. You're just describing classical information, do you think there would be all this fuss over quantum mechanics if a quantum state was just classical information (left and right handed gloves placed in separate boxes)? What you're describing is a local hidden variable theory, which is precisely something quantum mechanics isn't.
Quantum entanglement is a quantitatively subtle effect, which is a big reason that it is so difficult to convey to layman, see for example the difference in predictions for a spin singlet between classical and quantum mechanics:
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Bell.svg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Bell.svg</a>
In fact the two theories coincide when the detectors are at &quot;round&quot; angles like 0, 90, 180, 270 and at other angles the difference is non-zero but not huge. However, you can see that the whole point is that there IS a difference between quantum mechanics and classical information (gloves in a box).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically, the difference between the blue and red lines IS a correlation.  That's the whole point, they're correlated in some NON-classical way, that's why quantum mechanics was invented, because the behaviour is non-classical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP's question was about communication between entangled particles. As no communication happens between entangled particles, and anything useful learned from measuring an entangled particle's state would still require classical information to communicate, classical information theory can answer OP's question, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the collapsed wave function our classical technology can measure is measuring just that, the wave function after it collapses. It is then acting within the realm of classical theory.</p>
<p>Once entangled and seperated in the twin parodox they still undergo quantum effects and testing would collaspe the wave functions for their respective dialated points in time if my understanding is correct.</p>
<p>Our classical theories and approaches fail as soon as we need to take general realtivity and quantum feilds into account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I take some issue with this statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing is &quot;collapsing&quot; but our ignorance of the actual state</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't it a core tenet of quantum mechanics that it is NOT deterministic? The particles are not in some defined/&quot;actual&quot; state that we don't know yet, they are genuinely probabilistic until observed or measured. I agree with your conclusion about OP's question, though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, quantum mechanics <em>is</em> deterministic in that sense. Each quantum system has a state (sometimes called a &quot;wave function&quot;) which evolves in time deterministically according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation" target="_blank">Schr√∂dinger equation</a>.</p>
<p>The thing is that we don't ever observe the <em>state</em> of the system, we only observe measurements made <em>on</em> the system. These measurements are what can only be predicted on a probabilistic basis.</p>
<p>As it relates to your comment, true there is no &quot;state&quot; in the sense of a &quot;state&quot; being a classical state, that is, in one-to-one correspondence with observables. Quantum states can be linear superpositions of various classical states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe this is a difference in semantics or wording, then, but I'm not following your logic. As I understand it (a lowly BS in Physics) the fact of a quantum superposition would mean that there's no collapse of <em>our ignorance</em>, there is a quantum resolution of reality. The measured quantity stops having a superposition, and becomes a delta function at precisely that instant. The measurement physically resolves the system at the moment of observation; it does not resolve the observer. Does the two-slit experiment not conclude that the observation changes the system? I'm not trying to argue, I'm genuinely curious for clarification here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, the view that there is some &quot;actual state&quot; that we were merely ignorant of is falsified by simple interference experiments, if one accepts hand-wavy arguments, or by Bell's theorem, if one is in denial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on your interpretation of QM. We've proved there aren't local hidden variables, but there are still non-local deterministic interpretations. Many-worlds, pilot waves, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right about pilot waves, but Many-worlds does not allow for an ignorance interpretation either. Both measurement outcomes do happen according to it, so there is no sense in which you could be ignorant of the &quot;actual&quot; result. And it is local, by the way.</p></div>		</li>
