Observed from Earth, it would take 1.19 years, and would have travelled 0.56 light years.</p>
<p>After two years on the ship at 1g, you would reach 0.97c, however 3.75 years would have elapsed on Earth and you would have covered 2.90 light years. Viewed from the Earth, your mass would have increased 4x, and you would be a quarter of your size!</p>
<p>After five years on the ship, you would reach 0.99993c. 83.7 years would have elapsed on Earth, and you would have covered 82.7 lightyears. You would stand about an inch high, and have a mass of about 6 tons as seen from Earth, though you would not notice any difference.</p>
<p>After 8 years, you would reach 0.9999998c. 1,840 years would have elapsed on Earth. Great, you are far from what was your home. 400 US presidents came and went. What is more, you are now 1mm high and have a mass of 140 tons.</p>
<p>Nothing to lose now, lets go on, still at 1g...</p>
<p>After 12 years, you would be travelling 0.99999999996 c. By now you would have crossed the galaxy and be 113,000 light years from home. Time is now running 117,000 times more slowly for you than on Earth. You stand 15 microns tall, and your mass is about 9000 tons.</p>
<p>So, in fact you have travelled &quot;faster than light&quot; by covering 113,000 light years in 12 of your years, but well and truly burnt your bridges in doing so.
You have also become a very significant problem for any destination, and would require 12 years too to slow down at 1g, assuming you have survived the deadly blueshifted light and cosmic radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light travels at the same speed in any reference frame, and velocity is distance over time, so in order for observers moving at different relative velocities to see light moving at the same velocity, the observers literally see each other being compressed in the direction of motion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This whole scenario is completely unrealistic. No engine we can imagine could sustain such an acceleration for such a time. So without knowing what kind of ungodly propulsion you are using this question is hard to answer. </p>
<p>But no. If your are using something like a rocket with a magic endless fuel supply, you are golden. In a perfect vacuum. Except, the are hydrogen atoms in space, roughly one per cubic meter. And you pass through a lot of cubic meters per second. And at this speed, every single hydrogen atom you encounter exerts the energy of a bullet against your front window. And the background radiation is blue-shifted to deadly levels.</p>
<p>So in a real universe, you need more energy because you need to run your magic rocket through massive lead which is also a constant nuclear explosion <em>while still accelerating.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think not: speed is always relative. </p>
<p>Your speed is near c <em>as seen from earth</em> but if you turn the light on in your ship, the photons emmited from your lightbuld will spread at the speed... of light.
The point is that you're not going faster and faster, and you'll never go as fast - or almost as fast - as light because light always travels at lightspeed relatively to you (and everything else). The distance between the earth and your ship is augmenting faster and faster but constant acceleration only requires the same constant amount of energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light can't exceed C. So what happens when you travel at the speed of light and a photon hits you head on? Isn't the relative velocity 2C?</p>
<p>No. C is the highest relative velocity that can exist. From our point of view the photon approaches us at C.</p>
<p>But that makes no sense, you say! It is unintuitive.  But the universe has a way to deal with the missing velocity.  You see it as blueshift.  Instead of going faster you get higher energies. The universe has no energy limit. We describe this as the Doppler effect.</p>
<p>That light can be blueshifted until it isn't even light anymore. Xrays, gamma rays, you name it. The higher energy give the photons the power to damage matter, eg DNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the universe of the Expanse they stay within the solar system. </p>
<p>There is a fictional method of generating thrust called the Epstein drive that can do like 15 Gs of acceleration. However if you actually accelerated for that amount of time you’d destroy the engine. </p>
<p>In the books the dude who made it didn’t realize how efficient it was, and died trying to reach the button to turn off the ship, unfortunately for him he was accelerating so fast his arm weighed like 200 lbs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In real life it definitely would.  It would start taking exponentially more energy, i.e. reaction mass, to keep accelerating even marginally.  Your ship would quickly have to become bigger than the entire solar system just to have enough energy to keep accelerating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In response to the question of what kind of fuel the fictional drive in the show runs on, the creators simply responded &quot;efficiency.&quot;</p>
<p>It'd take a ton of fuel for the constant acceleration they show in the show, but it still at least pays attention to physics, and is one of minor plot devices you just kind of have to accept.</p></div>		</li>
