			<div class="markdown"><p>Eggs do, so I imagine anything that would heat unevenly, has a lot of water or fat, and some kind of stronger outside layer like a shell might be a problem.  I'm not sure I'd microwave a raw potato for example, for fear the inside would cook much faster than the outside and it would burst.</p>
<p>Still, you'd just be talking about a mess in your microwave, not anything particularly unsafe.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true in theory but often not in practice.</p>
<p>The problem is figuring out when “long enough” is for some foods (like raw meats) because microwaves have a hard time heating evenly. </p>
<p>Other foods aren’t strictly safe to cook endlessly because steam builds up inside them and they can explode.</p>
<p>For example, you can heat water up to the point that it is superheated and it will flash boil when you move the container. Similarly, you can microwave raw chicken and have some parts cooked and others still raw. If you didn’t happen to put a thermometer in the right place you wouldn’t know it until you’ve cut into the chicken. </p></div>		</li>
