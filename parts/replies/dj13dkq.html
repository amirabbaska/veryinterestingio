			<div class="markdown"><p>Steam also expands a rate of 1700 times the volume of water. So even a fairly small amount of water that flashes into steam quickly can have devastating consequences. This applies to any kind of steam generation. I operate large industrial boilers as part of my job, one of the first things we learned is you never ever put water into a boiler that is firing in a low water condition. Things go boom very quick. </p></div>		</li>
