<p>Regarding your question, cividis was optimized for deuteranomaly (a type of red-green colorblindness), but our Python package (cmaputil) can be used to optimize for tritanomaly (blue-yellow colorblindness) as well. We encourage you to check out the code.</p>
<p>Thanks for the source for correcting the sensitivity to grayscale! We will look into this more for sure.</p></div>		</li>
