			<div class="markdown"><p>The paper doesn't actually claim that the Gulf Stream has no contribution to warming Europe but makes the case that it's <strong>not solely</strong> the Gulf Stream but also stationary waves in the atmosphere. We have plenty of direct measurements that the Gulf Stream transports significant amounts of heat northward and that this heat eventually goes into warming the atmosphere which, on average, is blowing in the direction of Europe. It also appears to be the case that these loops and meanders of the jet stream in the atmosphere also act, on average, to blow warmer air up from the tropics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sea Surface Temperatures certainly influence the atmospheric circulation but my understanding is that the large-scale stationary structures in the atmosphere are more due to the massive mountain chains such as the Rockies and the Himalayas.</p>
<p>I think the authors really overstate the significance of this work.  (Apparently it pays off because it's frequently referenced in /r/askscience).  This paper is the analysis of an atmospheric model and when you dig down into the details they have constructed their system with an ocean-model that doesn't allow for a robust Gulf Stream so it's sorta not surprising that in the absence of a Gulf Stream Heat Transport they find that the atmosphere becomes more important in warming Europe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also important to remember the difference between a Continental Climate and a Coastal Climate.  The further you get from large bodies of water, the more extreme the teperatures become on both sides (the hotter your summer <em>and</em> colder your winter).  This is because large bodies of water act as thermal regulators for weather.</p>
<p>Water has a high specific heat, higher than most things.  It takes more energy to raise the temperature of water than it does land.  So water heats slower than land, meaning when it's very hot, the surface of the water is cooler than the surroundings.  The water cools the air, which cools the land near it in the summer.</p>
<p>Water is also an amazing insulator.  It loses heat slower than its surroundings.  Also the ocean is salt water, so it has a lower freezing point than water on land.  Ocean water can get cooler than fresh water and stay liquid, allowing it to continue to redistribute heat through convection.  So water is generally <em>warmer</em> than the land during the winter, creating warmer air around it.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with Western China?  Western China nearly as far away as you can get from a large body of water on Earth.  So you get highs above 100F in the summer and high in the single digits in winter.  </p>
<p>For the same reason <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oymyakon" target="_blank">Oymyakon, Siberia</a> has the highest recorded temperature swing between high and low in one year (around 180F difference between the high and low that year).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's also wind direction.  Land areas that are downwind of the ocean get a much more moderating effect than areas that are upwind.  That's one reason why Portland OR has a much more mild climate than Portland ME, and why San Diego CA has a much more mild climate than Savannah GA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might have to submit this as a new question to /r/askscience, but as a thought experiment what would happen if we pumped millions of tons of seawater into the least populated area of the Sahara Desert - would the evaporating water moderate the temperature and would we eventually end up with a saltwater lake with marshes around it?</p></div>		</li>
