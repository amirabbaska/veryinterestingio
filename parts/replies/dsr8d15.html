			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, so obvious really. The electric nervous system is just one of many myths accumulated in childhood that I need to shed.</p>
<p>Another idea that struck me is that the magnetic effect must actually help the entire process rather than being some nuisance to work around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neurons use both electric and chemical system at different parts.</p>
<p>At the synapses, where two neurons are connected, they use chemical messaging, usually known as neurotransmitter. This process cannot be detected by EEG, nor interfered by TMS. </p>
<p>However, along the axon, like the wire part of the neuron, the message is <em>electrochemical</em> (action potential to be precise, different than how electricity travels down a cable, but <em>still have electrical element</em> nevertheless). This process can be detected by EEG, and interfered by TMS. </p>
<p>It needs a certain amount of power and frequency to disturb the electrical activity of our brain. This is achieved by TMS (Transcranial magnetic stimulation). Most electromagnetic signal that we have around are neither strong enough, nor at the right frequency, to disturb our brain.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The propagation of nerve signals down an axon is so different from how electricity flows through a wire, I really avoid comparing the two at all, because the idea that the human body uses electricity to transmit signals is so horribly misunderstood by most people and leads to some bizarre and very incorrect beliefs and ideas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say &quot;respond&quot; to electricity. Rather, EEG, etc., responds to ions accelerating across the synaptic gap. This produces electric fields which can be measured with EEG, microelectrodes, or myoelectric probes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It IS possible for magnetic fields to influence the brain. That's what TMS / rTMS is. But note that in order to produce a during enough magnetic field to affect the brain, you need a great big electromagnetic coil positioned mere inches from the head. So that's why we aren't constantly experiencing interference from magnetic fields... It takes an exceptionally strong magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I've heard firat hand from an EE engineer who had to do some work and a very powerful transformer. It required him to reach past it and get his head quite close. IIRC he got bright flashes of light in his vision, as well as feeling weird in general.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, let's say there's a hypothetical Magnetar (for the uninitiated: A star with a magnetic field trillions of times stronger than the sun's) close to us, does that mean that the magnetic field can cause mass disruptions in all the brains on earth?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The amount of interference absorbed is low -- notice that your computer and phone, which are electrical, are not being disrupted either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But often itâ€™s quite a big challenge to design it that way. Electromagnetic compatibility is an important part of modern devices. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The brain/nervous system operates mostly <em>chemically</em>, with electricity being used as a bridge between chemical reaction sites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To expand on this concise answer (IIUC): </p>
<p>Signals are sent <em>within</em> neurons by transferring sodium ions, where a buildup of electrical charge on one end travels to the other; the concentration of like charges creates a pushing force that spreads like a wave. The wave travels much more quickly than individual ions but much more slowly than charge in a copper wire.</p>
<p>It's only when the wave reaches a synapse - a tiny gap between two neurons - that that wave of electrical energy is converted to chemical energy, releasing a chemical called a neurotransmitter that docks at the next neuron to trigger the process again on the other side.</p>
<p>In a conductive wire, charge travels in much the same way as it does inside a neuron, with two major differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The moving things are electrons, not sodium ions; and</p>
</li>
<li>While the sodium ions in a neuron are floating in water, the electrons in a wire are floating in a tightly packed material.</li>
</ol>
<p>Electrons are unbelievably tiny compared to sodium ions even though they have the same amount of charge (with electrons it's negative, with sodium ions it's positive). They are also unbelievably more tightly packed in a wire than sodium ions are inside a neuron.</p>
<p>The combination of these explains why charge travels so much faster in a wire.</p>
<p>I also thought I could explain why neurons should be less vulnerable to magnetic interference than charge in a wire, but I confused myself thinking about it so I will stop here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neurons are essentially coax cables.   Coax cables are shielded, and EMP-proof (or at least very, very EMP-resistant.)</p>
<p>Also, they're imbedded deep inside conductive saltwater.</p>
<p>If you zap yourself on a car door in winter, your neurons will be overloaded, and your muscles contract without needing brain signals.</p></div>		</li>
