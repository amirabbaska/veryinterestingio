			<div class="markdown"><p>In order to leave orbit it would need escape speed, which is about 10,000 m/s. If an object has escape speed, it will escape no matter what direction it is headed (assuming it doesn't hit Earth).</p>
<p>The air leaking from the station isn't anywhere near that speed, so it's just going to fall to Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ISS is moving at 7.7 km/s so hitting 10-11 km/s is not as insurmountably huge of a deal as you're making it seem. Escaping Earth's gravity from LEO takes less delta-v than landing on the planet (it's just that we conveniently have an atmosphere that can provide a lot of delta-v via aerobraking).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does escape speed not decrease with altitude?  Or is it so low that escape speed is still really that high?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know much about this and a quick Googling didn't help me out. But wouldn't the gas get ionized pretty quickly and then, instead of &quot;falling&quot; to Earth, just mix with the rest of the ionosphere? magnetosphere? thermosphere? What-ever sphere the ISS is in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly. It's not that it's a low escape velocity. It's that the ISS is already going pretty fast.</p>
<p>ISS orbits at 7660m/s. Escape speed has been mentioned in this thread at over 10000ish m/s at ground elevation, possibly less at 300km up? If the escaping air goes prograde (direction of the orbit), the numbers(7660 and air speed) will add up and it might go over the escape speed. If the escaping air goes retrograde (backwards) it will very likely deorbit (you only need a couple of 100 meters per second that way to intersect the atmosphere).</p>
<p>Accelerating up or down while in orbit is counter intuitive, it's not going to result you actually going that way in the long run. You want prograde or retrograde.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not even close. Escape velocity is 3km/s higher then orbital, and the air is not leaving the ISS anywhere near that fast. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think &quot;falling back down&quot; would take all that long. The ISS orbits quite low and there's nonzero atmospheric drag.</p>
<p>An isolated air molecule (N2, O2, or whatever) would travel a distance approximately equal to its <em>mean free path</em> before colliding with an atmospheric particle. I don't have the data for mean free path in Low Earth Orbit, but I'm pretty sure it is much, much smaller than the circumference of the Earth.</p>
<p>Once the first collision happened, that air molecule would lose a large % of its kinetic energy and would no longer be moving fast enough to stay in orbit. So it would fall down and reach equilibrium with the rest of the Earth's atmosphere. The process would be quite rapid.</p></div>		</li>
