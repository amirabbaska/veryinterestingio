			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, this is what happens to hair with curling or straightening irons on damp hair. If you dont fully dry your hair and you put an iron to it youll see a steam come out, thats a bad sigh as that mean water is being instantly heated to a gas which can easily cause your hair to break off. A good example of this is the video that went viral a fews ago when the girl was trying to show you how to curl hair and her hair just complete fall off. Make sure you dry your hair 100% before you iron it or risk massive breakage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorta. Electricity passing through a resistive material generates heat. Since human fluids/body is more conductive, it is less resistive, therefore does not generate the heat that would boil us like you're imagining. That isn't to say a lighting strike wouldn't burn you or damage you internally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, and this is kind of gruesome, imagine you're chopping wood. You take a swing of the axe and even if it gets stuck just a few inches in you can still split the wood with a few more taps. Now imagine you swing an axe into a person, right in the middle like you would do with a log. The axe gets stuck, but you don't bisect the person. Even if you hammer away at it, the person will not split down the middle unlike the wood.</p>
<p>People are spongey, elastic, and malleable. We don't have a particular grain upon which we are easily split.</p></div>		</li>
