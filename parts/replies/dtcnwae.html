			<div class="markdown"><p>Though confusing, it's worth noting that at the time LTE was just starting to roll out in the US, HSPA+ on GSM carriers (T-Mobile and AT&amp;T) was significantly faster than the existing 3G technology used by CDMA carriers (Sprint and Verizon).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume this isn't globally true, and also, I'm confused by it. Screenshot of my phone currently saying &quot;4G&quot;, but apparently I have LTE: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/lebYb" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/lebYb</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally correct. As far as I am aware, this scam by naming a HSPA+ connection 4G is exclusive to the USA. Everywhere else 4G means an LTE connection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My phone displays H+ sometimes when it's not strong enough to get 4G but H+ is always faster than 3G, does H+ stand for HSPA+? I live in the UK</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, what determines the little letters that show up there? When I'm in the US with my AT&amp;T SIM, it says LTE. Here in Israel, it says 4G. Does the carrier tell my phone what kind of branding to use for the network? Is there some technical difference under the hood?</p>
<p>Cell phones are an enigma.</p></div>		</li>
