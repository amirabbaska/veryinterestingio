			<div class="markdown"><p>The treatment amount, isotope 131, was to kill off any remaining thyroid tissue. The 123 isotope is to see if there's any update which indicates that there is some remaining tissue that needs killing. Prior to the test I go on a no/low iodine diet. Katelyn they've been replacing that with an injection of thyrogen. </p></div>		</li>
