			<p>I've read somewhere, though I can't remember where, that the sight of an injury can make the pain worse. Like, for example, skinning your knuckles working on a car and you don't notice anything until you see some blood running and look, then the pain starts. This is something I've experienced myself so I'm sure there's something to it, I just forget what the mechanism behind it is (or whether it's psychological).<br><br>Do you have any knowledge and/or experience of this?</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, witnessing cuts or injuries can actually intensify the amount of pain you feel; just like you'll experience more pain if you expect that something will hurt. </p>		</li>

			<p>But if you're expecting something that will hurt you can also better prepare yourself for it. For example when giving blood the needle going in will hurt less if I don't watch it or am distracted, but I'm much more likely to flinch or react to it. When watching it get put it it will hurt more but I won't have any reaction to it since I know when it is going to start.</p>		</li>

			<p>Question for you, if you'd be able to explain scientifically:<br><br>In the scenario where someone experiences a mild/moderate pain incident (1) and then a few moments afterwards pain incident (2) where (1) and (2) are nearly identical incidents in similar but separate areas, why is (2) often described as being more painful?  Does it have something to do with the same inhibitory neurotransmiters? </p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/farhanfrn" target="_blank">farhanfrn</a>
			<p>My take on it is that it first of all, as beforementioned, takes time for inflammatory mediators (chemicals) to be released and/or produced. Also, it depends on under which circumstances the injury is acquired. If it's in a stressful situation, yes, inhibitory neurotransmittors will be released, and you will not be made aware of pain incident (1). But if further injury is presented, as a result of pain incident (2), your body realizes that it actually is important that you are made aware of the pain, because whatever you're doing, its harming that area repeatedly. It is then perceived as more painful to actually make you realize that the area is being damaged alot, which enables you to take preventative actions from that area being injured again.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Basically what happens when you dont feel pain at the actual time of injury is your body releasing inhibitory neurotransmittors (endorphins (endogenous morphines), GABA, noradrenaline etc) in the spinal cord which inhibits pain signals travelling up to the brain, and hence less, if any, pain signals reach the brain, making you unaware of the pain. <br><br>Makes sense. I skateboard a bit so I sometimes get into the stressful situation of &quot;holy shit you're falling, don't break anything or land on your face.&quot; and I'll catch myself and be like &quot;shit that was close&quot; only for one of my friends to say &quot;hey man, are you okay? your arm is torn up and dripping blood.&quot;, only then do I realise I scraped from my elbow all the way to my hand, and only about 30 minutes later do I start feeling the stinging pain.</p>		</li>

			<p>True. Simply put, all Adrenaline/NA receptors are excitatory mostly except for alpha 2. And that too, alpha 2 is a pre synaptic receptor (which basically means it acts an inhibitor, but really is just a receptor at the wrong end of the synapse). Since the amount of alpha 2 receptors in the body is limited, you can safely call Adr/NA neuroexcitatory. <br><br>Ach of course, as pointed out, can be both. Ach attaching to Gs (stimulatory G protein stimulation will lead to activation) will lead to stimulation, Gi (inhibitory G protein will lead to inhibition) will lead to inhibition. </p>		</li>

			<p>Acetylcholine can be either excitatory or inhibitory based on which G protein the receptor is coupled to. GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the body, but others are serotonin and in certain cases, dopamine.</p>		</li>

			<p>I see, i always thought adrenalin and noradrenalin were sympathetic agonists and acetylcholine only binded to muscarine receptors, making it parasympathetic. So does that mean adrenal hormones bind to other receptors besides beta adrenergic?</p>		</li>

		<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Nashbrosb4hos" target="_blank">Nashbrosb4hos</a>
			<p>I think there's a few different parts to this question, so I'll break it up based on what I think you're asking.<br><br>1) Acetylcholine binds to muscarinic AChRs and nicotinic AChRs. There are multiple isoforms of each. You're correct that muscarinic receptors are parasympathetic, and can be coupled to Gi proteins (which are inhibitory). These mainly result in lower heart rate (M2 receptor) and decreased locomotion in the CNS (M4 receptor). However, they can also be stimulatory and coupled to Gs or Gq proteins. The M3 receptor promotes bronchoconstriction and smooth muscle contraction. The nicotinic receptor, on the other hand, is almost always excitatory as far as I'm aware. Nicotinic AChRs are in the neuromuscular junction, and acetylcholine release is the driving force to activate muscle depolarization (and therefore contraction). There are 17 known isoforms of nicotinic AChRs.<br><br>2) Catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine - or adrenaline and noradrenaline respectively) bind to adrenergic receptors which are B1, B2, B3, a1, and a2. They are almost exclusively excitatory - B1 activation leads to increased heart rate and stroke volume. B2 increases cAMP concentrations to decrease intracellular calcium and increase permeability to potassium - the end result is hyperpolarization which leads to smooth muscle relaxation in blood vessels and airways (leading to vaso and bronchodilation). <br><br>3) I'm not sure what you meant about adrenal hormones - I assume you were referring to adrenaline/noradrenaline, which is why I addressed catecholamines above.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ok, you've got a lot of replies so maybe someone asked this but: I remember as a kid two instances where I was hurt but only registered pain when I noticed it. I was in elementary school running a mile and as I did one of my legs itched so instead of stopping I kicked it with my other foot. They both started to itch so I proceeded to kick myself over and over. These sneakers I was wearing had some sort of plastic hook on them, so each time I kicked myself I was actually cutting myself. Took me a while to wonder why my legs itched so bad and when I looked down I had a network of bleeding cuts on my legs, then the pain happened.<br><br>Another time was similar; I was in my back yard with a friend and noticed my legs itching. I scratched but to no avail. After a minute (or whatever)  looked down and I was standing in a fire ant hill, with them crawling all over and biting me. Again, only then did the pain kick in.<br><br>So my question is: What causes the pain to be not noticed/interpreted as an itch until you visually see the &quot;pain&quot;?</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; As histamine and prostaglandines are released at the site of injury which trigger pain signals (and make the nerves more sensitive to pain).<br><br>Makes me think feeling pain is your bodies way of saying &quot;please don't make this area any worse&quot; and &quot;try to look after it when you have a chance&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>Yup! The inflammatory response lowers the activation threshold of nerves in that area. Pressure that didn't hurt before now hurts a ton more, even though it's the &quot;same&quot; pressure being applied. A simple touch activates the nerves which send up a signal that essentially tells you &quot;don't touch that&quot;.</p>		</li>

			<p>Being able to differentiate between different intensities of pain is really important. If experiencing a second degree burn would hurt just as much as a papercut, your response would be similar to when you get a papercut. A papercut isnt life threatening and therefore you dont act as such, with a burn on the otherhand its important for you to realize that your body is being severely damaged. </p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/[deleted]" target="_blank">[deleted]</a>
			<p>Reason 2 is spot on. <br><br>A small correction. Noradrenaline is not always neuroinhibitory. In fact it's mostly neuroexcitatory. It's only in when it acts on a particular receptor (alpha 2) that it's neuroinhibitory. <br><br>Another reason. Unequal distribution of sensory nerves throughout the body. The back of the body (the dorsal side) is poorly supplied by sensory nerves as compared to the front (the ventral side). As a result, sensations like two point discrimination etc. are significantly poorer on the dorsal side. During a massive injury, the body's initial response is definitely fight or flight. And that response reduces our perception of pain. Once that response subsides, because of poor pain localisation on the back of the body, an injury to the back will cause significantly lower &quot;sharp&quot; pain than the front. So the site of injury is also important as far as pain localisation is concerned. </p>		</li>
