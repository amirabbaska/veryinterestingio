			<p>I've read somewhere, though I can't remember where, that the sight of an injury can make the pain worse. Like, for example, skinning your knuckles working on a car and you don't notice anything until you see some blood running and look, then the pain starts. This is something I've experienced myself so I'm sure there's something to it, I just forget what the mechanism behind it is (or whether it's psychological).<br><br>Do you have any knowledge and/or experience of this?</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, witnessing cuts or injuries can actually intensify the amount of pain you feel; just like you'll experience more pain if you expect that something will hurt. </p>		</li>

			<p>But if you're expecting something that will hurt you can also better prepare yourself for it. For example when giving blood the needle going in will hurt less if I don't watch it or am distracted, but I'm much more likely to flinch or react to it. When watching it get put it it will hurt more but I won't have any reaction to it since I know when it is going to start.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's definitely true from personal experience. Multiple times, I've had small cuts and not noticed until hours later when I accidentally spread the cut open. Most of the time I couldn't even imagine when or where I could have cut myself.</p>		</li>

			<p>How come I don't feel pain until I see the injury sometimes? </p>		</li>

			<p>Is that why some people can take a massive ass beating and not feel much pain and then afterwards it hits them, or is that all adrenaline?</p>		</li>
