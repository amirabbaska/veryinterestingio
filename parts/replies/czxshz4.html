			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that really a thing?</p>
<p>Hear it so often, but I see nothing substantiating it and have never experienced it either.</p>
<p>Are people so not used to fiber that one normal meals gives them stomach problems?</p>
<p>Or is this &quot;spicy food&quot; people are talking about Tacobell and tortilla chips, in which case the hotness is not going to be the culprit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pepper plants themselves aren't piquant, <a href="http://hortsci.ashspublications.org/content/45/2/323.full" target="_blank">just the fruit</a>. It doesn't make sense for a species to protect itself only after it has reproduced, so it's unlikely. </p>
<p>Instead, it's all about reproductive success. Pepper seeds germinate better and faster after going through the short digestive tracts of birds (they have tough seed coats), and they are carried long distances. Mammals, however, are chewers with longer digestive tracts. If mammals ate pepper seeds, they'd be chewed up and might go though a long digestive process (likely to kill the seeds), and then what's left would be deposited near the mother plant. </p>
<p>To protect themselves from herbivory, most pepper plant relatives (family Solanaceae) are bitter and poisonous. Well-known examples include deadly nightshade (belladonna), jimsonweed, mandrake root, tobacco, etc. Even potato and tomato plants are poisonous. <a href="http://www.chrisridley.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Solanum-quitoense-Naranjilla-DSCF1563-120713-C-Ridley.jpg" target="_blank">Many Solanums</a> <a href="https://myeducationofagardener.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/solanum-atropurpureum-spines-fruits-wikimedia1.jpg" target="_blank">are spiny</a> as well. Interestingly, pepper plants didn't need to take either approach (relatively speaking).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that's another theory too. Host specificity for dispersal. That's what u/Norgenigga is saying using different language. Birds make much better dispersers for seeds since they can travel very long distances very quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are two types of seed-bearing fruit that acts on the digestive tract to make you &quot;sick&quot;. Fruits can be seen as poisonous because they give you a quick shit (diarrhea) or a long delay (constipation). Each of these effects benefit the respective plant whose strategy it is to either have its seeds dispersed nearby it have them deposited far away. The effects of berries are usually felt by the birds that eat them and which are otherwise pretty regular poopers. The parent plant seeks to modify their dispersal routine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's debatable.  Even from pepper to pepper or plant to plant, the heat can vary dramatically, and who knows who was breeding what 500 or more years ago.  But Scotch Bonnet and African Bird Peppers are two that come to mind that are similar.  I don't know if ghost chilis were bred selectively, but all of the new superhot varieties like the Trinidad Scorpions or the Carolina Reapers are bred for total insanity.  </p></div>		</li>
