			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't feel any of this. Rain makes me feel sad and depressed. I only like going out early in the morning, after a rainy night, to see the sun reflect in the empty streets made shiny by the water. But cozyness during rain, no... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the opposite, I hate the sunshine and heat and blue skies, etc. Rainy, cold, dark and stormy days are beautiful to me doesn't matter where I am (preferably snug at home though). The smell, the white noise, the cool air.. if there was a place where it rained 365 days a year and stayed permanently night I would move there. I might actually be a vampire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amen. Where I live weâ€™d be lucky to get 10 days of rain a year, it rained for the past three days and I was in heaven. Back to sunny and hot now though sadly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I also have more energy and seem to be in a better mood when it's dark and rainy out. Bonus points for cold. Considering our bodies' need for Vitamin D, this seems a bit counterintuitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>me too. dark cloudy weather with light / heavy rain and a bit of thunder are the best for me. I feel happy, calm, creative and overall positive. too bad those kind of days are rare where I live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not knowing your circumstances, can I ask if you are an otherwise-busy person?</p>
<p>I'm in a career where there's a bit of feast-or-famine, and between-projects is slow but during-projects can be very fast. Downtime is kind of meh when there's not a lot going on at work but priceless when it's been ballistic for a while. </p>
<p>A rainy day to put my feet up with is a wonderful thing when I'm going full tilt, much less so after a couple weeks when there's already been a lot of free time.</p></div>		</li>
