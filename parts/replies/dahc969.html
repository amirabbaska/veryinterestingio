			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember the Russian economy was so pathetic when communism fell that they still had some factories making televisions one at a time by hand. There was no outside injection of ideas and their own market was completely stagnant and lacked the innovation you mentioned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd think so, but it does not always work out that way in practice.</p>
<p>I live on an income sharing commune where labor and resources are distributed according to the principal &quot;from each according to ability,  and to each according to need.&quot;  I don't have to worry about the bills getting paid because our worker-owned business is reasonably successful, there is always more than enough food in the pantry, and sharing resources like cars and housing allows us to have a smaller ecological footprint than what is typical of our geographic region.</p>
<p>Decisions are made by consensus.</p>
<p>We've agreed to a 42 hours/week labor quota, and there are a lot of things that get counted as labor that most people don't get paid for - cooking community meals, washing dishes, childcare, mediated conflict resolution, visiting the doctor, learning new skills, exercising, and pretty much everything else that's arguably beneficial to the community in some way.</p>
<p>The problem arises when creating more efficient systems that increase productivity and reduce labor requirements result in a <em>reduction</em> in quality of life rather than an improvement.  People mostly work in areas that interest them - by innovating to reduce the amount of labor required in those areas, people are forced to find something less desirable to work on to make the 42 hour quota.</p></div>		</li>
