			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Try learning Korean some time.  They have elaborate conjugation to identify the end of a sentence and explicitly state whether they are making a statement, asking a question, giving a command, etc.  And yet even with this, they have adopted Western style punctuation on top of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japanese is similar. They didn't have a periods till western influence.</p>
<p>Also in fact many asian languages were written vertically, starting from the right side of the page (second point is IIRC).</p>
<p>Western influence has made them write horizontally left to right.</p>
<p>Even more so languages like Chinese/Japanese were romanized to be used with keyboards easier. Instead of using complex keyboards they type out the sound and use intelisense (like autocorrect) to choose the correct letter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hindi ends thoughts and questions in the same way, and not with a period. Example (two questions): आप क्यों हँस रहे हैं। क्या मेरी हिंदी इतनी खराब है।</p>
<p>The period, question mark and the like come from the Romance languages of Europe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For some other characters where the concept previously did not exist in the language (like the question mark in Japanese), they just purely imported it from English.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's か and の which can both be used at the end of a sentence to indicate that it's a question. Having said that, when actually exchanging IMs with Japanese people through pen pal apps they very really write these things, much like how you don't write です unless you're being kinda polite and formal. &quot;?&quot; is way more common in my experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was using ですか as it is what's taught in Japanese class.  か by itself is used very often when speaking to ask a question.</p>
<p>I'll take your word for it that the question mark is more common now.  My point was that the concept of using a work or symbol to denote a question being asked did exist in Japanese. </p></div>		</li>
