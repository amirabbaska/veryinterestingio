			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a way to visualize the fourth dimension? When I was in college, my calculus professor said that he used to be able to visualize the fourth dimension. He said you'll have to put away your phone, detach yourself from the society,go to his office hours and he'll teach you how to visualize the fourth dimension. No one really took that offer though. </p></div>		</li>

<p><em>Clicks on link.</em> Cool, I get it so far. I'm doing well here.</p>

<p>Here is (a representation of) a cube, in three dimensions. </p>

<p><em>Clicks on link.</em> Alright, still got it. Not confused at all. That's definitely a cube.</p>

<p><em>Clicks on link.</em> Okay, but... why is it... important? I don't think I'm smart enough to know what I don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A tesseract doesn’t actually look like that, that’s just the closest approximation our feeble 3D brains can understand while looking at it on a 2D representation (your screen).</p>
<p>As for why it’s important, why is a square important? A cube? A tesseract is just the 4D version of a regular shape made up of uniform side lengths and right angles.</p>
<p>Does that help?</p></div>		</li>
