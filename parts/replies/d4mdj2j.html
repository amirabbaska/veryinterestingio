<p>Hardness / softness (I'm thinking malleability) is going to be a function of how strong the atomic bonds are, that is, how much energy do you need to dislocate an atom from the structure? If it's low, then your metal is soft, higher energies would be harder.</p>

<p>This explanation doesn't quite work for metals, which are generally ductile and deform by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation#Dislocations.2C_slip_and_plasticity" target="_blank">dislocation movement</a> (that is, a line defect slipping through the crystal). Gold, for example, is refractory and dense because of its strong atomic bonds, but it deforms easily because it has a face-centered-cubic (FCC) structure that, in part because of symmetry, features 12 close-packed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_\(materials_science\)" target="_blank">slip systems</a> along which dislocations can propagate through short shearing hops. FCC metals such as Cu, Ag, and Au are thus fantastically ductile despite being strongly bonded. In contrast, body-centered-cubic (BCC) and hexagonal-close-packed (HCP) metals contain fewer or no close-packed slip systems and are generally not as ductile, especially at low temperatures at which the shearing hops are too difficult for dislocations to make.</p></div>		</li>
