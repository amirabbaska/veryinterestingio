			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing to add to this is that materials that require this oxidization don't do well in friction scenarios. Think of moving parts and door latches. If I keep on opening up a door, it's going to wear off that oxidized layer with nothing to reoxidize it. Once the grinding surfaces are exposed, they will weld together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The atomic structure has to match. That why you can't weld different types of metal. The oxidization will spread once it's exposed at all. I don't believe it's possible with &quot;uniform/smooth&quot; oxidization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can weld different types of metal, you just have to carefully choose your filler metals and possibly employ other methods like explosion welding. </p>
<p>From a more fundamental perspective in order to get good bonding very little lattice mismatch can be tolerated. You need to match the lattice constants between materials to get strong bonding. Typically this is only an issue for growing things like photonic heterojunctions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Non-oxidized metal wants to bond with other non-oxidized metal because that's how it is inside the metal and how metallic bonding works.  An oxidized surface doesn't want to bond with anything else.  Oxides are chemically stable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it has to do with the fact that metals like steel have crystalline microstructures. If you break a chunk of metal and then realign the pieces without the presence of an oxide barrier, when each atom returns to roughly the same place, adjacent atoms (some from the other material) will attract it by and the atoms will return to their original crystal structure that existed before the break. </p>
<p><del>Based on that hypothesis, I'd guess that the metal oxides--which also have crystalline structures--are weak enough that when you press them together hard enough to get the required atomic attraction, the crystal structures just crumble rather than recombining.</del> Actually u/WhatsThatSkaSong's explanation makes more sense. When you break a chunk of metal and the two pieces oxidize <em>separately</em>, their respective crystal structures won't match and thus won't recombine. </p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: I'm not a materials scientist, so I'm totally spitballing. Take all of this with a grain of salt, because I really don't have a clue what I'm talking about.  </p></div>		</li>
