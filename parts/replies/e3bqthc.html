<p>Insulin dependent diabetics, regardless of whether you're type 1 or type 2, should not have more than 1-2 servings of alcohol, and always have the alcohol with food. Your liver's ability to synthesize glucose from other energy sources is greatly diminished so you run the risk of becoming severely hypoglycemic, especially if you have the drink at dinner time like many of us do. If you do drink more than two drinks or drink on an empty stomach, make sure to check your glucose before bed time and set an alarm for a 2 am check to make sure that you are not running low. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's about right for me, as long as a bottle of wine is one serving.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You don't need to include alcohol when you're figuring up your dose, but you still need to account for anything else in the drink. Beer has carbohydrates, sweetened hard liquors and liqueurs have carbohydrates, but the straight, hard stuff, like whiskey, brandy and vodka have none. Mix your drinks with diet soda, instead of regular, and you should be fine. Basically, treat it like any other food, but ignore the alcohol for purposes of figuring your insulin dosage.</p>
<p>If there's some secondary effect that makes drinking a bad idea for Diabetics, I've not encountered it. Just like anyone else, make sure you get plenty of water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest risk with drinking when Type 1 (I'm type 1 as well) is that when the alcohol is breaking down your liver is busy doing the breakdown INSTEAD of putting a little bit of sugar back into your bloodstream so your blood sugar will actually fall, not rise.  The normal action of the liver putting sugar into the bloodstream is why we take basal doses of insulin, so if you drink remember to temporarily reduce your basal rate!  Of course if you're mixing your vodka with something sweet then of course you have to dose for those additional carbs though...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You treat alcohol like protein, fats, or any other long chained chemical that takes the body a while to break down. Your basal rates account for it if your on a pump, or your long term insulin if you’re shooting up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is the answer from biochemistry standpoint. Your cells go through glycolysis where they uptake sugar and produce ATP, which is the high-energy molecule that stores the energy we need to do just about everything we do. Pyruvate, which Is the end product of glycolysis and oxaloacetate, from TCA cycle  are precursors for other ATP producing pathway called gluconeogenesis, which functions to maintain the blood glucose level in absence of ingested food. When you consume alcohol you throw the metabolism out of wack because when alcohol is metabolized it yields high amount of NADH, which interferes with the gluconeogenic precursors (pyruvate &amp; oxaloacetate) and shifts them away to become lactate and malate and in essence alters the regular metabolic function. This can lead to hypoglycemia since your metabolic pathways get thrown out of wack due to consumption and metabolism of alcohol and high level of NADH, which interferes with metabolic pathways that keep your blood glucose level up. Diabetics are more prone to experiencing hypoglycemia bc of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds about like the ELI5 explanation I've heard, which was that because alcohol is a poison it gets priority treatment and it ties up the same metabolic pathways used for gluconeogenesis.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I read this in a Gary Taubes book.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nutrition was one of the most useful courses I took in college -</p>
<p>4calories per gram carbs protein
7 calories per gram alcohol
9 calories per gram fat</p>
<p>4/7/9 easy to remember but not common knowledge for some reason</p>
<p>so alcohol even without the addition of additional bullshit is already almost double density of protein and carbs per gram calorically speaking.</p>
<p>what this guy is confused about is the literal versus relative comparison- straight gin or vodka is less calories than mixed drinks or beers wine coolers etc with added sugars on top of the alcohol content </p></div>		</li>
