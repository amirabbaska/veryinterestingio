			<div class="markdown"><p>Challenging the idea of avoiding pain, would pet animals like dogs and cats that go through animal abuse be an example of this? That they'll run away and never come back, wouldn't that be &quot;simulating the future,&quot; or is that simply purely instinctual?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those animals seem to not fall under the category of &quot;simple animals&quot; and definitely <em>can</em> perceive both pain and suffering, because we can clearly observe suffering in those more complex animals. Dogs, cats, etc. can learn to wince away from a human's hand if they've been hit before. They yelp and cry if they injure themselves badly. They experience mood changes if they've been inflicted pain. Personally I don't know at what &quot;level&quot; an animal moves from that field into the &quot;simple&quot; category that doesn't experience this, but as far as I can tell it's just a matter of neurological complexity and whether or not they exhibit the capacity to express those experiences in ways we can observe. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Could it have something to do with the distributed ganglia in arthropods, vs the single brain in vertebrates? </p>
<p>With no actual knowledge on the topic, I can imagine that the distributed &quot;brains&quot; of insects can't coordinate well enough to learn, react, and plan accordingly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most insects lack the interpretive media to comprehend pain in the sense of learned experiences; ie. Insects won't form a biased opinion of a specific set of circumstances because of a negative outcome (in the form of pain). Any &quot;pain&quot; avoidance would be based exclusively on evolutionary survival reactions that would be happening, on our level, faster than you would be able to consciously control; such as bracing yourself before impact, or gasping before your head goes underwater. </p>
<p>The bug is reacting to a chemical engagement that its evolution found successful in furthering its species procreation....until one of them has a mutant baby, that has a more efficient chemical response, aka &quot;pain&quot; avoidance....and on and on and on... </p></div>		</li>

<p>Insects can also learn.</p>

<p>Insects also react immediately to injury or negative stimuli (like shocks).</p>

It's been about 4 years since it happened he still is very cautious of it if it moves at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah my dog was curious about a bunch of cows in a field before and walked up to them. Unfortunately there was an electric fence between them and her. She got shocked.   She now associates that pain with cows.  She freaks now whenever she notices a cow. It's been years and she's still afraid of cows.  If I'm walking her anywhere and she notices a cow in the distance (I don't know if it's sight or smell or a combination), she'll tuck her tail and make me turn right around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine use to have a cat when we were kids. The cat used to like hanging halfway over the 2nd floor interior balcony that looked down over the living room. He'd stick his head and half his body through the widely-spaces 'rails' to hang over and watch people.</p>
<p>One day, he slipped and fell with a rather resoundingly loud belly flop. We found him just kind of cowering on the floor looking terrified. Poor thing was fine (they took him to the vet just in case) but seriously scared by the experience - he never hung out over the edge again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but it seems like a pretty blurry and hard to define line. I'd say that anything with the capacity to learn displays predictive behaviour. In order to learn, you have to observe, remember, and then use that information to predict the outcome of future events. Cats and dogs obviously display this behaviour, but goldfish have the capacity to learn and navigate simple obstacles when incentivized with food. </p>
<p>So, my question would be, how far can you extrapolate prediction and suffering? Can a goldfish experience suffering? Are there different degrees of suffering? What of hive/colonial intelligences, bees and ants, that seemingly learn and adapt?</p>
<p>I say the line is blurry, because our understanding of what constitutes human intelligence hasn't reached a full consensus. Let alone an understanding of intelligence in other organisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to help point out for others, consciousness is a gradual &quot;thickening&quot; of experience. It stands well to reason that the elements that comprise or enrich that experience, are also gradual.</p>
<p>As you move up in complexity, so too should you expect things to get increasingly &quot;human&quot;. There's no hard boundary - we used to presume there was, until we found other animals using language, tools, planning, worrying, etc.</p>
<p>What makes us special is the degree, not so much presence, of our abilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes us unique is the degree to which we feel/believe we are special as a species. Bees, spiders, ants...they are remarkably complex, but in ways so different from us that we can't relate or even imagine their subjective experience very well. We just always tend to think we're superior even in the face of what we're doing to our own planet. We may be the most conscious of animals, but we have no way to prove that. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It happens, seems to be uncomfortable, the animal tries to get out of the situation, but they don't seem to develop a lasting &quot;fear&quot; or often even just a strategy to avoid the same situation from happening again. </p>

<p>Through this line of thinking, would you then say that a human who has no short term memory, maybe someone with late stage dementia, cannot suffer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in medicine, we use &quot;conscious sedation&quot; or variants of it for certain procedures that are uncomfortable.  Most of the time its enough to make people not care / not hurt much while we get it done, but sometimes it's not.</p>
<p>When its not we will try to give more medication, but it's not always safe to do so.</p>
<p>Anyway - after its all said and done, much of the time the &quot;amnesiac&quot; effect of the medications kicks in (retrograde amnesia) and the patient won't remember it anyway.</p>
<p>So the question is: did they feel pain?  Pretty sure they did, and would also say your dementia patient will too - which I think is your point.  However, they also probably won't suffer as much as they won't have to relive it?</p></div>		</li>
