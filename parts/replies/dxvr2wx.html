			<div class="markdown"><p>That's funny, because I usually remember the main sounds a word makes.  </p>
<p>Like if I couldn't remember 'Jello', I would remember it has an 'elle' sound in it. I would be like 'lllllllll......yellllow, no, yellow is a different word......' </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I'm a little curious if there's a difference here between folks who had phonics as children and those who didn't. When I can't remember a word, I can name the words before and after it in the dictionary, but the intriguing thing is that they are classed by type: nouns, adjectives, etc. I also do the pattern thing you mention, Mittens = Muffins being my longest example. </p></div>		</li>
