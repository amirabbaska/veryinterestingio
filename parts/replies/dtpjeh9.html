			<div class="markdown"><p>Many people have strong vagus nerve responses to the pen. I have had the pen version exactly once and I lost consciousness and started convulsing. I woke up, threw up, and needed to lay still for a while.</p>
<p>While I've been told the air puff is a bit less precise, it's definitely good enough for my case. I understand why those going to a glaucoma specialist might want higher accuracy. </p>
<p>Last eye exam I had, I asked the technician if their glaucoma test was still the <em>puff</em> one. He said they wouldn't likely change to the pen because too many other clinics also reported that people had passed out afterward.</p>
<p>Ymmv, but don't touch my eyes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, I'm not sure why they've never done that to me. Every time I go in they do a shit ton of tests because I have a large optic nerve (genetic) so they think I have borderline glaucoma. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a hole in my retina and got laser surgery to fix it the second week of January this year and they used the pen thing. They usually use the air thing at regular check ups though. (I really did not like the pen or having numb eyeballs or getting my eyeball lasered) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s an instrument Called I-Care, that takes the same test, but doesn’t do the puff of air.   Rather it has a very light pin, that bounces off the eye.    I’ve seen patients tend to prefer this</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the Amsler Grid, which tests for macular degeneration</p>

<p>As someone who has to stare at this thing on the regular, may I chime in on what they're actually <em>looking</em> for when you look at the grid?</p>
<p>Basically, you're looking for any sign of warping or bending in the lines. When you're looking at the center dot and there's distortion, where precisely it occurs on the grid can pinpoint exactly where the flaw causing the distortion is in your eye. I personally suffer fairly regular macular hemorrhages (exactly what it sounds like, bleeding in the eye) that push on the back of my retina, and this manifests as what I like to refer to as black holes in my field of vision - because everything bends in towards the large blind spot, like it's being sucked into a black hole. The first one I ever had was pretty much dead center and blocked out a good three or four squares in each direction; now I just tend to get small ones that are pretty far off to the side, but I'm so used to keeping an eye (sorry) out for them that I can spot them even before highly sensitive computerized scans can. If they're big enough, too, when my eye doctor looks in my eye with the slit lamp (the really fucking bright thing that then gets magnified into OH MY GOD WHY via going through a large handheld lens) I can actually see them on the...reflection, I suppose you'd call it, of the back of my eye. Giant spots that break up the monotony of what looks very much like some kind of demonic lava field. It's actually kind of fun.</p></div>		</li>
