			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't mean they are popular, I just meant they exist.
I've seen them in a couple hotel rooms and a friend of mine is a contractor who built one for his kid's shower.</p>
<p>Not sure what the Swedish market is like but you can get one for $200-$500 USD in the USA.
Here's a link to one for example:</p>

In houses it depends on how old the house is I guess</p></div>		</li>
