			<div class="markdown"><p>Could it be a way to differentiate people with he same name? I imagine parents weren’t as adventurous with names back then and would stick to pretty standard ones. This probably made it annoying to get a specific person’s attention. This rhyming idea would work well when there were several people with the same name. A single alternative survives because the most common need is for just 1 rhyming option and it ended up being the most liked.</p>
<p>This is a complete guess based on nothing other than the fact that I have a very common first AND last name and it was the first idea to come to mind.</p></div>		</li>
