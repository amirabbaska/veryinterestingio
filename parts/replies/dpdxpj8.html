			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on, 2.6 <em>billion</em> years is still a long amount of time, even on the galactic scale. Our own sun, an average star about midway between the core and the spiral fringes, takes only 230 million years, to orbit the core. 2.6 billion years is ten times that amount of time, to put it in perspective.</p></div>		</li>

Mature galaxies as early as 1.6 billion years after the Big Bang has also bee photographed by Hubble. (don't have a link for those)</p></div>		</li>

<p>this is a tad confusing, that is if i am reading this right. did we change Hubble's orbit to fling it away from Earth or is this just poor word choice?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Layman here. </p>
<p>Could there be any correlation between the mass of the galaxy and the velocity at which the mass actually moved in its early stages? It seems like there could be a sweet spot (mass v. gravitational pull v. velocity) that may prolong development and preserve the integrity of a galaxy's disc-like shape over a larger time frame than, say, a high mass and slow moving galaxy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, galactic velocity curves have been measured.  Surprisingly, they donâ€™t move as predicted and is one of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the existence of dark matter.  For theoretical details and history, google Vera Rubin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it would have collapsed in on itself, but due to collisions/mergers with other galaxies or close flybys many galaxies end up as elliptical galaxies. So the neat spiral shape is only stable as long as no major disturbances happen. I'm not sure if there is evidence that an elliptical galaxy will reorient itself into a spiral shape after enough time has passed or if the spiral shape is an artifact from the formation of the galaxy and will be &quot;forever lost&quot;. I think it was first hypothesized that elliptical galaxies will transform into spiral galaxies, but now the consensus is that elliptical galaxies are &quot;deformed&quot; spiral galaxies and typically much older.  </p>
<p>We assume that the combined Milky Way - Andromeda remnant will consolidate into an elliptical galaxy as well and the beautiful spiral shape of both will be &quot;lost&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
