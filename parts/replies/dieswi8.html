			<div class="markdown"><p>It's basically &quot;What era did this technology come into existance in?&quot;</p>
<p>When broadcast radio and TV were in infancy the country was much more socially conservative. So they regulated them with the social mores of the time. No naughty words when lil'uns might be watching. No nudity ever.</p>
<p>Some decades later they started putting in cable and decided to regulate them too, but the social mores had changed, so the regulations weren't the same. I.E. nudity and cussing, but no porn.</p>
<p>The internet was something else. It's very decentralized and they couldn't nail down the porn websites with regulation before everyone was using them, and if you take away the internet's porn you'll see riots. Also the mores have changed even more, pretty much the only thing a majority of the country hates is child porn (and so it's illegal, even on the net).</p>
<p>Basically it's easier to regulate new things than old things, but once some laws and standards are passed it's also very hard to go back and loosen them up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really because of social norms. Broadcast TV/Radio uses property that belongs to the American people, the airwaves. It's also accessible for free by anyone, including children.  Cable TV is a service you need to subscribe to and it uses infrastructure owned by the cable company, not the American people. The FCC doesn't have authority to control content on a private network like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the argument that the public owns the TV/radio spectrum broadcast content is run on. I want to say this is the foundation for laws that require certain censorship rules be met despite the First Amendment's specific protections from government interference in speech: When &quot;everyone&quot; ostensibly has a say in the content that comes over a certain wavelength or whatever, you have to avoid extremes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, and just to say, they did eventually allow some nudity in documentaries. Because scientists couldn't show how backward and primitive African tribes were without putting them in tee shirts, which really ruined the effect :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is broadcast television and broadcast radio even going to be a thing in a few years? Seems like everyone has broadband or at least a smartphone with high speed radio internet connection, Netflix is already more popular than cable, Apple's digital radio station is already the most listened to radio station on the planet (though they still blank out the cussing). All the TV and radio rules are just going to be something only old people had to deal with soon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're underestimating just how big the gap between broadcast and cable is.  For total viewers, the Walking Dead's ratings (highest by far for cable) were on par with the ratings that got American Idol cancelled.  Similarly, twice as many people watch each episode of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; as watch each episode of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How come the song I Write Sins Not Tragedies censors the word &quot;Whore&quot; and &quot;God damn&quot;, but other songs on the same station (modern art rock) don't censor those words and play even worse language </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some stations have their own censored versions of songs. I've heard the same song in two different stations where one would only 'drop' the swears, and the other would also drop words such as 'damn' or 'whore' (both of which are fine to say on the radio). </p>
<p>What it mostly boils down to is how the station wants to be perceived (IE more conservative, family friendly, or more edgy) versus how much money they make. More popular radio stations can afford to pay a fine every once in a while, whereas smaller, low-power stations would likely go bankrupt after one violation, and thusly err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>I could be wrong, but this was essentially what they told me going through a DJ training course at my college station. </p></div>		</li>
