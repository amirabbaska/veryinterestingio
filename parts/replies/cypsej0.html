			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very good point.  A lot of compressed video (DVD, blu-ray, streaming, etc) uses 4:2:0 chroma sub-sampling.  This means each pixel has it's own brightness level stored but colour is stored at quarter resolution.</p>
<p>When you down scale 4k to 1080p the image is downsized by a quarter..... Now the colour information resolution matches the display resolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4:4:4 chroma subsampling on a video or image means that the image is made up of blocks 4 pixels wide, each of which consists of a row of 4 coloured pixels followed by a row of 4 coloured pixels. So every single pixel has a colour value. </p>
<p>4:2:0 chroma subsampling means that the image is made up of blocks 4 pixels wide where the first row in a block has 2 coloured pixels and the second row has 0. Every uncoloured pixel gets its colour from its nearest coloured neighbour. </p>
<p>So if you have a 1920x1080 image with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling (which you usually do), you can think of it as a 1920x1080 black and white photo with a 960x540 colour photo printed on transparent plastic laid over the top. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Ok followup question: does that mean the 4K scaled to 1080p is a much larger filesize than a full size 1080p now? Like basically undoing the fancy compression algorithm? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Resolution and file size do not have a direct relationship. You can decide their values seperately in the software. You can use 100kbps for 4k video, and 10 000kbps for 1080p.</p>
<p>Think that way&gt; when you are compressing video, you are deciding how many people(bitrate) put in the how big farm(resolution). If you put less people in the farm, you will only have less harvest(quality)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;4k scaled to 1080p&quot; means it's a 4k video, period. &quot;scaled to 1080p&quot; means that <em>when you're playing it back</em> you shrink it, not before.</p>
<p>It's not undoing the fancy compression algorithm, but it's storing the video with much more detail (four times the pixels), so of course it will be larger. Possibly not four times larger (especially since a video file also contains audio), but still larger. Assuming you use the same compression settings, of course - you could also compress a 4k file to shit to make it as small as the 1080p file, but then quality will suffer and the end result may or may not be worse than the 1080p file.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the reason why this happens is a design error in the subsampling. The color resolution of the human eye is much lower, so chroma subsampling shouldn't be very noticeable. The problem is, the brightness values in digital pictures aren't linear, but the coefficients for subsampling were chosen as if they were linear. This means that much of the brightness information ends up encoded in the chroma pixels instead, especially in deep blue/red, and the picture becomes visibly blurred.</p></div>		</li>
