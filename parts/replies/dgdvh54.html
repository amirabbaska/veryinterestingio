			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Warm baths by themselves will reduce soreness, but the only thing that Epsom salt is really good for in baths is making your skin softer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's interesting there's still a lot of love out there for home remedies.  This one is not even the highly desired &quot;all natural&quot; cure, because MgSO4 is manufactured in big chemical factories, the kind that natural medicine people love to hate.</p>
<p>Avon Skin So Soft is good too, as long as you're ok with smelling like tropical flowers and feeling oily for a day or so.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it? It seems pretty simple to me. Placebo or not, they work (at least for a bunch of people) and they're generally pretty easy to pull off at home with simple household ingredients (hence home remedies). It seems logical that if Bob from down the street always heard form his aunt as a kid that [x] helps solve [y] and all you need is some stuff from your cupboard, wouldn't you at least give it a try, especially if it could save you a trip to the pharmacy/physician? That seems like a fairly obvious motivator, especially for poor/immigrant families where these remedies tend to be most popular.</p></div>		</li>
