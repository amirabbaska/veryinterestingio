			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 37 now and I got diagnosed about 4 years ago. Looking back I believe it greatly affected my studies. I struggled to stay awake in all of my classes during college. I slept through a large majority of classes no matter how much sleep I got at night or how much caffeine I got in the morning. I never really knew that there was anything wrong. It was just normal but very frustrating.</p>
<p>Before I was diagnosed I had a hard time staying up past 8pm. If my wife and I were trying to watch something she would be constantly poking me to wake up.  Also very frustrating for both of us.</p>
<p>I finally talked to my doctor about it and he referred my to a sleep specialist. Things have been much better since then. I am able to stay awake all day, finally. But I'm am always sleepy, like you would feel agree being up for a day or two, and it sucks knowing it will probably always be that way. </p></div>		</li>
