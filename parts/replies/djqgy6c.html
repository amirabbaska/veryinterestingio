			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically with videogames, rendering a 4k image and then scaling it down to 1080p (Supersampling) will give you a sharper, clearer image using the 'same' pixels on your monitor, because of details appearing between pixels. </p>
<p>Rendering at 1080p without anti-aliasing will give you jaggy edges where your monitor's pixels show hard edges. Anti-aliasing blurs and softens these edges to some degree, but if you actually render a bigger resolution image and scale it down, those pixels become blended together in a more 'accurate' way.</p>

<p>When you chose 4k instead of 1080p youtube doesn't compress the files as much </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this requires some more explanation. The compression ratio may be the same, but since much of the compression is on neighbouring pixels it's not noticed when 2x2 video pixels are shown on 1 pixel anyway.</p>
<p>I.e. an uncompressed 4K video would show the average of each set of 2x2 pixels on a single pixel on the display. So if there is some smoothing due to compression on those pixels, it is not noticed on the 4K video, while on a FullHD video each pixel is shown on the FullHD display, so the smoothing is noticed.</p>
<p>There is of course more compression going on than just between sets of 2x2 pixels, this is just to illustrate that all compression will not be shown, some still will. While all will be shown on a fullHD video.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation is very, very, wrong. 4K does not inherently &quot;give you more bitrate&quot;. Bitrate requirements are completely irrelevant to picture quality, so long as the pipe is fat enough. Constraining bitrate too low will make any stream look like crap regardless of resolution or codec, but if the minimums are met there are only marginal benefits to excess bitrate. All other things being equal, 4K will require more bitrate because of the additional pixels versus 1080. If anything, 4K is more highly compressed in order to avoid obscene bitrate requirements. To do this, more advanced codecs tend to be used, such as HEVC, but they require significantly more processing on either end of the pipe to encode/decode. For example, a 1080p stream encoded as HEVC requires about 30% less bitrate than the same stream encoded as H264 (MPEG4), and the HEVC will look slightly better as well (higher Perceived Signal to Noise Ratio, PSNR), but will require more processor cycles to achieve this. To conserve &quot;bandwidth&quot;, 4K videos tend to be encoded using HEVC or similar high-efficiency codecs - making them generally more highly compressed than the average 1080 video. They still consume more bitrate than 1080, because there is roughly 4x more data to move, but that overall bitrate has no intrinsic effect on picture quality, and pixel for pixel, the higher efficiency codecs generally means that each individual pixel is consuming roughly 30% less, actually. The fact that you have a 4K image that you have to cram onto a 1080 screen means that you have to downsample. Consumer 4K is an integer multiple of 1080, which means that the downsampling algorithm can be a trivial average of a square block of 4 adjacent pixels (most are going to be more advanced, though). This effectively blurs those 4 pixels together, and if there happens to be a jagged edge passing through the block, it becomes antialiased (blurred) as a result of the downsampling. This is the same benefit the new Xbox One X will have on existing 1080p screens, incidentally. So the perceptual benefits of streaming 4K to a 1080 device potentially include a better codec with a slightly better PSNR, and definitely include the supersampling effect of downsampling 4K to 1080. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are arbitrary limits imposed by YouTube and have absolutely nothing to do with how 4K video works or why 4K looks better on a 1080 screen. Of course YouTube allows more bitrate for 4K - there's 4x as many pixels to stream. </p></div>		</li>
