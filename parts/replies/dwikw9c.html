<p>To find these pockets of interstitial fluid, medical researchers looked at living tissue instead of sampling dead tissue samples. They did this by using a probing technique called confocal laser endomicroscopy. The method entails using a tiny camera probe that takes a microscopic look around a human body. Tissue is lit by the endoscope's lasers and the fluorescent patterns it then reflects are analyzed by sensors.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By accident, like a lot a other important discoveries. A group of doctors were trying out the new endoscope and noticed this fluid filled mesh because they were used to seeing white-pinkish mucosa instead.
It’s not a completely novel concept. We identify first space (space inside cells), second space (space inside blood vessels) and a third space (the space between cells). However we assumed the third space it was just water filling the emptiness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is speculation, but water isn't very compressible, and say we simplify this organ to a balloon filled with water, when you press on a part of the balloon, the other parts will expand, if you have springy tissue around it and one part of it is hit, the water will distribute the force of the impact around to all the tissues, this organ is like billions of those balloons everywhere, below your skin, around organs etc.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically the body has four kinds of tissues : muscular, nervous, epitelial (cover the surface organs) and connective (under the surface of organs giving them resistance and elasticity).</p>
<p>Now each of these tissues is made of cells more or less close together, in the epitlial tissues they are stuck together touching each other with little or almost no space between them, in the connective tissues they are more far apart with various molecules and fibers interposing between each other. This space is called the interstitium.</p>
<p>In any case every cell to work and stay alive needs to exchange water and all sorts of molecules with the ambient the surrounds her (in very much the same way you need to &quot;exchange&quot; matter by eating drinking and pooping), and all this molecules form a liquid substance that circulates around cells in this interstitium: this liquid is created from blood being filtrayed through the wall of (arterial) blood vessels running in the interstitium (like pushing water through a sponge), flows in the interstitium, circulating around the cells, gets absorbed and then pooped back being modified in its composition, and finally gets riassorbed by other (venous and lymphatic) vessels, going back to the blood.</p>
<p>Apparently the interstitium around cells of every organ is connected throughout the body by what seems to be microscopical vessels which can only be seen in vivo.
This is different from how we have studied in school, where we are taught that is only the lymphatic and blood vessels connecting this spaces to the blood flow insted of directly with other organs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do not eat each other's poop, it's more like food and poop are mixed together and cells pick what they want thanks to &quot;sensory organs&quot; on their surface</p>
<p>But this is often not true particularly in epitelial tissues, were cells are usually modeled having different sides of their bodies doing different things (one eating, one pooping, one holding hands with near cells) </p>
<p>Of course we are talking on a molecular level here so the concept of food and poop doesn't really apply... Moreover in the interstitium there are other things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>signaling molecules, that inform the cell on what's happening around her and in other cells even very far away (hormones)</li>
<li>long molecules intertwined like a net  on which cells attacch to stand in place (collagen, ialuronic acid and so many others)</li>
<li>occasionally drugs, toxins, viruses, bacteria</li>
<li>giant moving cells that devour dying cells and bacteria</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all mixed in this labyrinthic fluid filled space called interestitium and every cell is very fine programmed by DNA to know how to interact with it and what to do with everything there is in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok... Is a metaphore ok?</p>
<p>The human body is made of organs made of cells. If we think of the human body as a planet, organs would be groups of islands and cells would be islands. </p>
<p>The interstitium would be a labyrinth of river, lakes and seas between the islands of each group, with the groups being separated from each other in a way that the water that flows in a group doesn't flow in any other.</p>
<p>Inhabitants of every island receive their food from and throw their poop in the water.</p>
<p>However all groups are connected through floating highways to a special central group of islands (the heart), which replenish the food in the water of each group and move away the poop.</p>
<p>Surprise, an adventurer has discovered underwater galleries that connects  each group to the near ones, so the waters are not separated but actually flow from one group to another.</p></div>		</li>
