			<div class="markdown"><p>This question is indeed more a metaphysical and philosophical question rather than a scientific question. </p>
<p>As a mathematician myself, I see Mathematics as a tool invented to read and describe Nature. When you write and solve an equation, you are making an experiment on Nature with your tool. Writing that 2+2 = 4 is actually experimenting it through your representation of numbers and operators. </p>
<p>I know it takes away the natural aspect of Maths, that then appear as a human tool that could not exist outside of the human mind. But even though the mathematical representation of the Nature we built is extremely accurate, it is only a representation that I think does not exist before a human mind formed it. If other animals can do simple operations that looks similar to our mathematical reasoning, it is because their thinking is based on the observation of the same Nature than us, </p>
<p>In this perspective, Newton invented the basic rules of calculus, which happen to be a very efficient tool to describe Nature. </p>
<p>But as Fenring said this question can be answered two ways. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that even such a fundamental idea as the concept of 1 can be, and is, disputed in terms of discovered/invented. Since naming something a unit requires the &quot;fiction&quot; of borders and stability, the argument can be made that even the most fundamental math is made up rather than discovered. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Numbers don't really apply to 'units', they apply to 'concepts', as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege" target="_blank">Frege</a> showed.</p>
<p>An example would be 'moons of Jupiter', or 'apples in the basket'. Compare this with trying to apply numbers to names, and you'll see the discrepancy. If someone said 'there are over a thousand Alberts', they would mean that there are over a thousand <em>people with the name of Albert</em>, another concept in Frege's sense.</p>
<p>If someone said 'this thing is more than three', it would be unintelligible unless, from context, it was clear they were talking about the <em>years it has been alive</em>, for instance. See also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_noun" target="_blank">count nouns</a>.</p>
<p>There is no sense in which a person, for example, is 'one'; unless it is meant that it is <em>one person</em>, or <em>one human</em>, or <em>one woman</em>, or <em>one member of the group</em>, etc. We use numbers to qualify count nouns, which are general, rather than individual names.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just can't help but this that some alien race out there has to have come to the same mathematical conclusions. The words and symbolic representation may be different but I feel like if they are coming up with the exact same concept as we are (velocity is the rate of change of position with respect to time) then how could we have possibly invented it? I guess unless we meet an alien race we won't know but I have a hard time believing they wouldn't come to the same conclusions we did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they have similar objects around them, we will have similar concepts. But you can't really expect both species to have the <em>same</em> understanding of time and space. Because if our cognitive functions differ just a little bit, our perception of nature could be significantly different, which has deep consequences on the way mathematical concepts are formed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To carry this analogy to the animal realm...</p>
<p>It has been shown that some birds can &quot;count&quot;...as opposed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subitize" target="_blank">subitize</a> a small group of objects.</p>
<p>Given your definition, it should follow that counting birds have devised a tool similar to that of Calculus, albeit more primitive. (Perhaps a better analogy would be the different division/multiplication algorithms humans have devised).</p>
<p>Would you agree?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes completely, I actually hesitated to mention animals in my first post. Of course we are not the only specie to have formed mathematical concepts. Many species can obviously distinguish objects and some can do basic operations. I suppose it naturally happens when their brain allows it. They don't have the same perception as us, so they cannot define objects the same way we do, but when you see a spider <a href="http://omgne.ws/check-out-these-unbelievable-spider-webs/" target="_blank">build a web</a>, you know both species share similar  mathematical concepts. And there is no reason not to, as we all build them from interaction with nature. The main difference is, spiders don't have PhDs in mathematics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My initial reaction to OP's question was that inventing something can be defined as discovering a new way to do something. Then I decided that my answer was just a cop-out - defining the problem away. Then I thought about it more and decided that the whole issue is just semantic. That is, if OP were to define what he or she means by &quot;invent&quot; and &quot;discover&quot;, then the question would simply answer itself.</p>
<p>Is my thinking along the lines of what you mean by &quot;philosophy of language&quot;, or are you referring to something else? Does my reasoning make any sense, philosophically?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hello Wittgenstein! </p>
<p>You just summarized ordinary language philosophy pretty much exactly.  Any 100% complete analysis of how a term is used is <em>also</em> a 100% complete analysis of the topic to which the term refers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I think it's &quot;both&quot;: the foundational principles of mathematics are laws of nature, and we discover them. But some of the tools we use in mathematics, such as our notations, are obviously invented and not part of nature. On calculus: obviously, continuity and principles of calculus in general are very much just rules of the universe, but the way we <em>express</em> calculus is often through inventions; for example, the Cartesian plane that we use for visualization is not based in nature, it's just a tool for our own intuitive understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the stance I always take.</p>
<p>there is a separation between the language of mathematics and mathematics itself. the language of mathematics is how we frame relationships between mathematical entities to each other and to ourselves; it's a lens through which we view pure abstracted relationships, and we invented it. sometimes we realize that we've been framing our understanding of mathematics &quot;wrong&quot;, and so we change the language to reflect this new understanding, which often opens doors to even deeper discoveries. for example, a growing understanding of algebra caused us, as a species, to go back and reexamine the way we had framed basic algebraic operators, and in doing so, we exposed deeper truths as to their nature and relationships with the underlaying number systems.<br />
the truth of abstract algebra was always there, but we had to reframe our language to express it.</p>
<p>this of course leads to &quot;mathematical truths which cannot be expressed&quot;.  that's a different bag of worms. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You are just choosing a side here; the question of whether this is the case is the fundamental question to which /u/Fenring refers.</p></div>		</li>
