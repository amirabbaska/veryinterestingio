<p>I looked around keyword scholarly, and I know I've read it, but my search skills and recognition of related science is significantly diminished in that realm. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C44&q=Algae+photosynthesis+production+volume&btnG" target="_blank">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C44&q=Algae+photosynthesis+production+volume&btnG</a>=</p>
<p>If someone wants to point me in the right direction, I'd be grateful.</p>

<p>don't they use the same 3 carbon fixation pathways?
wouldn't 99% of the oxygen be produced in the ocean if algae were really that much more efficient?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is actually the case, although sadly I'll have to speak from memory and without proper citations. But IIRC, algae indeed are the main oxygen providers. Trees do release oxygen, but they also use it up at almost 1:1. Algae are the ones that produce excess oxygen. The great oxygentation so many billion years ago was solely due to the cyanobacteria, which are single cellular algae ancestors,  as there were no trees at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All photosynthesizers fundamentally use the biological mechanisms of cyanobacteria, an ancient species, the originators of photosynthesis, which are still around and are one of the organisms considered part of what's called phytoplankton. </p>
<p>The chloroplasts in plants are cyanobacteria that were incorporated into eukaryotic cells by endosymbiosis. They function as organelles, much like our mitochondria.  </p>
<p>Cyanobacteria are one of the most impactful organisms to inhabit the earth, they single handedly oxygenated our atmosphere and made all aerobic life possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Until they die, the carbon is locked up in living tissue until decay. When buried, it is further locked up for an indeterminate time where it's turned into fossil fuels, and even longer periods absorbed into the mantle via tectonic movement.  This is why *volcanic <del>cosmic</del> activity releases so much co2. </p></div>		</li>
