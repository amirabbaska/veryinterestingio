			<div class="markdown"><p>More or less yeah. Your body, particularly your digestive tract, is not a nice place for common microorganisms to grow and multiply. It takes special kinds to make it through all that and infect you. So while your risk isn't zero, it's pretty small for a freshly killed healthy animal. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know the reason, but it certainly is not that. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If you went out into the forest, killed an animal, and ate it right there and then, you'd be fine. That's gross though, so we don't. We like to prepare and cook food, for obvious reasons. But, if you were like a lion, and ate your food the second you killed it, you'd be fine. </p></div>		</li>
