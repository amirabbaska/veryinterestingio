			<div class="markdown"><p>I have &quot;different&quot; pets. I have two old geriatric house ducks, both who like and understand mirrors. My female duck knows she's looking at herself or me as a reflection in the mirror, not somehow behind the mirror. </p>
<p>My rabbits were freaked out when I first got their attention in a mirror I set down. At first I think they thought there were other bunnies in the mirror, and when they made eye contact with me in the mirror, it freaked them out the first time. They quickly learned that I'm not in the mirror. Now if I make contact with them through the mirror, they've learned to figure out where I am based on their position to the mirror. </p>
<p>Both animals are a <em>lot</em> smarter than they get credit for. </p>
<p>Edited to add: my female duck understands adornment too. She loves any sort of costume,  wearing it proudly,  and checking herself out in the mirror. I'll give her something to out on, and she'll go to the mirror to look, before coming back to say thank-you-do-you-have-anymore? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! My cats and rabbit can gesture and eye-contact me through the mirror, they know its a reflection of real-us. </p>
<p>They don't care about the dot thing, though. And I think it's because they just don't care about a damned dot, and/or they remember me marking on them, not that they don't recognize the dot is on their heads. </p>
<p>Laser pointer through mirrors is a fun game, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read an article about it a while ago and they hypothesized dogs don't pass the mirror test because they rely heavily on smell. So they cannot recognize reflections because there is no smell associated with a reflection.</p>
<p>I'll look for the article and report back momentarily.</p>
<p>Edit: ok, I couldn't find the exact article but there are tons of other articles about the &quot;yellow pee&quot; test or &quot;sniff&quot; test dogs do. Here is an <a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/05/what-does-your-dog-see-when-he-looks-in-the-mirror.html" target="_blank">article</a> about both dog's recognition abilities and sniff test.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Intelligence is a slippery subject. One being the mirror-test for self awareness. From a methodological point of view (and it seems many of the comments here reflect this), one of the main risks in this sort of work is anthropomorphism, the tendency to interpret an animal's behavior in terms of human feelings, thoughts, and motivations. We tend to think of humans at the top of the cognitive ladder, however, rather than using such an arbitrary hierarchy, <strong>it seems more fruitful to understand cognitive capacities as adaptations to differing ecological niches</strong>. </p>
<p>Whether fairly or not, the performance of animals is often compared to that of humans on cognitive tasks. Not surprisingly, our closest biological relatives, the great apes, tend to perform most like humans. Among the birds, corvids and parrots have typically been found to perform well on human-like tasks. Some octopodes have also been shown to exhibit a number of higher-level skills such as tool use.

			<div class="markdown"><p>We simply cannot know.  We do our best with these tests and similar ideas, but the reality is that we have such a poor understanding of even our own consciousness that we cannot even begin to make good guesses about whether other animals have self-awareness.  It's not the exciting answer, but it's the truth.</p></div>		</li>
