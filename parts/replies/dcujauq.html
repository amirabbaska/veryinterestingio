			<div class="markdown"><p>there was a resurgence of this myth due to a badly worded article in Popular Mechanics, Don;t remember when, but I seem to recall sometime in the 70's they printed a warning along the lines of:<br />
&quot;Don't leave your battery on a concrete floor, as it will damage it over time.&quot;<br />
They meant it could damage the concrete, but most everyone went the other way with it. By my reading this is partly responsible for the resurgence of this notion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same way, battery acid leaking out (this was the 70s) onto the concrete would stain/damage it over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Concrete is a fundamentally alkaline material, and if it's reinforced contains reinforcement. Acid causes pitting and spalling of concrete as it chemically reacts with it, and makes it more porus. Water gets to the rebar and it rusts and degrades.</p>
<p>It a similar chemical reaction that occurs in marine structures, giving them a shorter life, and why road salts cause huge damage to building over the years.</p>
<p>Acid and concrete is a bad mix.</p></div>		</li>
