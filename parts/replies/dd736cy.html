<blockquote>
<p>Let 2 := 2 as usual, and let + be division.</p>
<p>Then 2 + 2 = 1</p>
<p>Therefore, 2 + 2 = 1</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, it's more like saying </p>
<p>2 + 2 = 22</p>
<p>As they said, they just defined + as concatenation of the strings. So ya, at that point it's not math because they're not working with the numbers and it's definitely not addition. </p>
<p>Edit: After re-reading your comment I realize that I don't actually disagree with your point lol.</p></div>		</li>
