			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the exact same thing happening in my arm pits, feet and palms. I sweat like crazy when I'm freezing. As soon as I start to put on layers and warm up, the sweating in my arm pits, feet and palms stops. So I don't really think it is a response to my core temperature being too high. Also I don't really sweat when I'm hot (not even in summer). It's just weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can use a shawl-type scarf under your coat instead of a sweater, which would only cover your shoulders, upper arms, back and chest. I do have arm warmers as well though for lower arm coverage. This allows me to wear tank tops under my jacket if I wish. </p>
<p>There's also ski jackets that have zippers in the armpits to allow air flow there. My Firefly coat does this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you tried modern Merino wool? I can easily see how you could hate the old cheap wool, but this stuff is amazing. Its honestly softer than cotton socks in my opinion. Its been years since I've worn cotton on my feet</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are they 100% wool socks? True wool socks will take away moisture while keeping your feet comfortable.</p>
<p>Edit: I guess it doesn't have to be 100% wool but should be a high percentage, if it does not wick moisture it is probably not a high enough percent. Or you got some sweaty ass feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clarification: wool retains heat even when wet so your feet may sweat more but the sweat won't freeze like cotton socks. ProTip: wear a dress sock underneath thick wool socks for extra warmth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good god Merino is the most amazing substance. I bought some from Katmandu when they had a sale and it was discontinued so it was actually affordable.</p>
<p>But my God, it is amazing. Until I got used to it I would simultaneously feel slightly too warm and slightly too cool at the same time, it's like my body wasnt sure how it felt, because it was actually perfect. Middle of winter? No problems go for a run with a long sleeve shirt. Sweaty feet? No problem I will magically keep them cool in summer and warm in winter and I'll smell nice even after two days of not washing me to boot!</p>
<p>Forget drugs kids, fill your wardrobe with Merino wool.</p></div>		</li>
