			<div class="markdown"><p>Lightning requires moist, rising air.  The kind of weather you get in hot weather, like in summer, that generate thunderclouds.  In the winter you don't have that source of moist, rising air under normal conditions.  You can get thundersnow when cold air passes over warm water and you get rising air currents.</p>
<p>I've also read about static charges building up on long wire fences in the plains from snow and dust storms.</p></div>		</li>
