<p>So with your &quot;fork&quot; program, once the computer is out of room or can't open anymore programs. What does it do? Could one just restart the computer? Or can the fork have malevolent intents </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fork bombs are usually DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.</p>
<p>Once your computer is out of CPU and RAM it has no ability to perform tasks and a reboot is necessary. RAM is random access memory, used to store active programs. CPU is how hard your CPU is working, this is the brain and what does most of the actual computing.</p>
<p>When both are maxed, your computer won't even be able to respond to your input, as it is too busy trying to handle everything else.</p>
<p>If I were truly evil, I would set that bomb to run at start up and it would require more work to remove. As everytime you booted the computer, the bomb would go off.</p>
<p>If I was good on the defense I would limit the resources any one user could access so if you were maxed out, I could log on as my account &amp; kill the program. You while userA might be maxed out. userA is only allowed 20% of the total resources. UserB can login and kill the program as it is running under userA, and UseB has lots of free resources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DOS was taught to me with a metaphor; the Cpu and ram are a juggler, and a DOS is like throwing him a near-infinite supply of balls. The juggler will be able to juggle quite a few of them at the same time, but if you force him to keep them all in the air (to keep programs running) and then add a shitload of extra balls... Well he's gonna fumble and drop them all at some point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh the DoS makes perfect sense. Get that set up on a server and boom goes the server right? That so simply evil and genius. </p>
<p>I like the resources thing! I may do that to my computer just for safety! </p>
<p>I take it you work in tech or tech security?</p></div>		</li>
