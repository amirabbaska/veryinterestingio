			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent years 5 - 12 of my life on a 4 acre property in Orange County. It's now like 60 houses. But i can still vividly remember the day I was playing on a hill and digging. Then i hit sand. I kept digging and i found all kinds of seashells. I remember exactly how I felt and can picture those shells ass i write this. We were 35 miles from the beach</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I lived in one of those small cities in the Mojave Desert for much of my childhood. About 100 miles from the ocean and we found shells all the time. After a while it stopped being surprising and we just ignored them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually in all honesty that sounds super interesting, I just had to make a bad joke about someone whose job title is &quot;Mud Engineer&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
