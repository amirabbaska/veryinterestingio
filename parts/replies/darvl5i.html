			<div class="markdown"><p>As a side-note you might find interesting, really old houses (like the one I grew up in that was built in the early 1900s) actually had the walls constructed using rough-cut 2x4s and 4x4s, so the dimensions were actually 2&quot; x 4&quot; and 4&quot; x 4&quot;. We found several that still had some bark on an edge.</p>
<p>That was fun to try to match modern building materials to haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i once attempted to restore a house built from quarry stone in the early 1800s.  The place was so old that the pins (i can't call them nails) were just wooden rods hammered into hand-drilled holes in the wood to hold them together.  You could go into the dirt basement and see the marks on the floor joists made by hand-held tools.  It was one of the most surreal experiences of my life, trying to imagine myself being one of those original builders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just did a complete re-Han on a 1940's house. Yes, lumber was larger dimensions but there were so many way studs that were cut almost all the way through to take out a bow.
That combined with balloon construction, no firestops, and no insulation. Thank god &quot;they don't build them like they used to&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you want to smooth it yourself, most lumberyards will sell you rough cut 2x4's, but I guess over time 99% of people wanted the versions that were pre-finished, so the name was technically 2x4 S4S
which means &quot;2x4 Surfaced four sides&quot; and people just kept calling them 2x4's to save time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe in production, but in actual specification it's just the difference between the &quot;nominal&quot; size and the &quot;actual&quot; size. This isn't limited to wood either, as cinderblocks and even steel beams have differences between the &quot;nominal&quot; size and the &quot;actual&quot; size</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And not to muddy the waters but rough cut hardwoods that are not cut into dimensioned lumber like the rough 2x12 you mentioned are sized in quarter inches of thickness. Before being cut into 2x12's it was rough sawn 8 quarter lumber of various widths and lengths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct in stating that the boards are planed down to the final dimensions, but they don't actually have to take 1/2 inch off to do it.  In the early days a lot of lumber was used &quot;rough cut&quot;, without planing.  Once it dried the dimensions were less than 2 x 4 because of shrinkage.  Also, some mill operators would purposely cut smaller than 2 x 4 to save money.  Then they started to plane it and reduced the dimensions to 1-5/8&quot; x 3-5/8&quot;, taking 3/16&quot; off of each side of the board.  Many structures still have this dimension lumber in them.  Somewhere along the way the industry decided that there should be a standard size and the dimensions were reduced to the now common 1-1/2&quot; x 3-1/2&quot;.  The boards are no longer rough cut to 2 x 4 as the planers are more efficient so the mill gets more boards out of a single log by cutting smaller pieces.</p>
<p>Note: Somewhere in the 60's-70's a better, read thinner, bandsaw blade was developed for mills that allowed far less loss from the saw kerf and yield from each log went up considerably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're 100% right. The dimensional loss is primarily a holdover from old days and from what I've read was a cost saving measure. This &quot;planing 1/4&quot; per side&quot; thing doesn't quite account for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anything beyond a 1x6/2x6 is actually 3/4&quot; narrower (a 2x8 is actually 1.5x7.25) in width</p>
</li>
<li>1x lumber only loses 1/8&quot; per thickness side, i.e. a 1x4 is 0.75&quot;x3.5&quot;</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First time I saw that, I asked in the store why the sizes wasn't correct.</p>
<p>I was given that explanation, adding that they wanted money for all the wood, even if the planed some of it off.</p>
<p>I still have no idea why they would think I care in any way what size it was before they planed it. I want to know the size of the wood I'm buying.</p>
<p>&quot;This 1-gallon milk only contains half a gallon.&quot; - &quot;Yeah, we threw some of it out. But trust me, there has been 1 gallon in there.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>I live in Denmark. We are metric. I haven't checked all kinds of wood, but all the planed ones I've bought have that problem.</p></div>		</li>
