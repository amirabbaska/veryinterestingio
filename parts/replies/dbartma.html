			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the moon cause tidal heating added with the original coagulation heat and what they said in school, radioactive decay heat. This heat energy induces convection.  Over cosmic time the moon gets further away. Many moons ago, it was about 10% of its current distance. Which would cause massive tides and gravitational tugging. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mentioned that, but you're right that it's worth emphasizing again. </p>
<p>The mantle is a solid. It is made of silicate rock. It transmits elastic shear waves. <em>You can melt it</em>. It can experience brittle failure like a solid, albeit only in the lithosphere (the upper layer of the mantle that is rigidly connected to the plates in the crust) and in the downward continuation of subduction faults.</p>
<p>However, the line between solid and liquid is not so simple in nature. If the strain rate is slow enough, rocks will deform by gradual ductile deformation instead of by brittle failure. When the temperature gets closer to the melting point of the rock, the rock gets softer and ductile deformation becomes much faster. At the strain rates and temperatures typical of mantle convection, ductile deformation dominates over brittle deformation to such a degree that the whole thing behaves like a liquid over long timescales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true that the moon does produce tides in the solid earth, and that those tides were stronger in they past, but even back then the tides were never the driving force of plate tectonics.</p></div>		</li>
