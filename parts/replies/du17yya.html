			<div class="markdown"><p>Right.............</p>
<p>I imagined stepping on a nail, then zoomed in with my mind's eye, and imagined a nerve triggered by &quot;pain&quot; sending a signal all the way up the path and system you just described. </p>
<p>And then I imagined dipping my toe in comfortably hot water, and then zoomed in, and imagined a nerve triggered by &quot;hot&quot; sending a signal all the way up the path and system you just described.</p>
<p>And I can't see where the difference between the two scenarios is.</p>
<p>How can the brain tell the difference between the two?</p>
<p>In both cases, all the information the brain seems to be getting is: </p>

<p>&quot;We're getting a nerve signal from the foot&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the pain receptors as shapes..hot = triangle cold = square...etc. when the receptor is stimulated it sends a “ insert shape of signal here” to the brain that then goes my right arm is sending me a lot of “squares” real quickly, my right hand must be really cold I should move it. </p>
<p>So the brain can recognize the type of pain based on what type of receptor was stimulated.  The brain knows what each signal is because after years and years of learning the pattern that “square=cold” any square signals that the brain gets should result in a feeling of cold where the receptor was stimulated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What does your analogy mean, exactly?</p>
<p>What is the difference between a &quot;sending squares&quot; and &quot;sending triangles&quot; in the real world?</p>
<p>Is it a different voltage? Or what? Exactly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except your brain is getting much more information than that. As explained by the previous commenter, you have different, specialized receptors in your body to detect pressure, temperature, pain, etc.  So stepping on a nail and putting your toe in hot water would cause different signals to be sent to your brain and it could easily differentiate the two. </p>
<p>Additionally your brain would use contextual cues to differentiate the two. Things like the sensation of water against your skin, previous experiences, etc. would help the brain decide how to process the afferent input coming from nociceptors throughout your body</p></div>		</li>

<p>How are this signals different? And how can the brain differentiate them?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It has to do with <em>where</em> the signals are sent in the brain, and to some extent how <em>many</em> signals are being sent. Very simply put you can view it as if there is a pain-center, pressure-center etc. If a pain-percieving neuron is activated, the entire row will terminate in part to a center for that body-part which is affected AND to the pain-center. However, if we instead stimulate say a pressure-neuron, it will also terminate at the body-part-center but won't terminate at the pain-center, instead it would terminate to a pressure-center.</p>
<p>In reality, this is significantly more complex and there are still much we don't know yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. Great explanation. This is essentially what I’m learning in neuroscience right now and you described it excellently. </p></div>		</li>
