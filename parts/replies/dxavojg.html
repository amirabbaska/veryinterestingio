			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I remember this as well. And do you remember how it was actually a beta? Like, was basically the finished game, they just tweaked some minor things before release? &quot;Open beta&quot; nowadays is more akin to &quot;alpha&quot; in days gone by.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was just multiplayer and only a couple maps. It was only up for a limited time and it was a significantly before the actual release. I think it was mostly to build hype.</p>
<p>I do remember they altered a pipe or tunnel on one of the maps so you couldn't rush through it with one of the ATVs before you opened the gate. Thats the map. <a href="http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/High_Ground" target="_blank">http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/High_Ground</a>.</p>
<p>Then one time I remember we had a glitch where the game would not end and for some reason only I could not be killed. Somehow I had near unlimited shields you could see them hurt me but it wasn't even close to enough to matter. That was awesome it just turned into messing around and looking for other glitches. We never did find a place to super bounce. <a href="http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Valhalla" target="_blank">http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Valhalla</a></p>
<p>Those might have been the only 2 maps or there was a 3rd can't remember.</p>
<p>Always fun to remember those days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, console games were just released in a completed state. PS2 did have internet, but I don't really remember if they released game patches back then. I feel like PS3/X360 was the first generation that did it a lot, but I might be wrong.</p></div>		</li>
