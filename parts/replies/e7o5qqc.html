<p>i especially love the edit. i have this rule (that i don't always follow, but) which says the third time my mind tells me that something is wrong, I have to fix it - no matter how hard it is to do. and i think it's a direct extension of that idea. when some problem repeats itself - especially over and over - it's much less likely that the problem stems from the world around you, but rather, it stems from the way you are interacting with the world. </p>
<p>and it's humorous to me that the solution is always so obvious once the problem is fixed. it could be something as simple as &quot;do the dishes&quot; and i'm like, but &quot;i'm too sad to do the dishes.&quot; so i don't do them. then more dishes get added. then finally i go &quot;AGGH! I gotta do the dishes no matter what! &gt;:O&quot; and then do the dishes and I actually feel better after doing them. It's like, if I had just done the dishes from the start I would have avoided a shit load of sad, and had less work to do to overcome my sadness.</p></div>		</li>
