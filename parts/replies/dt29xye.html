			<div class="markdown"><p>I have cystic fibrosis and a lot of my friends have had transplants. We often say it’s like trading one disease for another or two. We usually get diabetes because of the steroids and unfortunately cancer pops up a lot. I’m not sure if it is from the complexity and size of lung transplant or it is that common in all types of transplants. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have CF too and had a lung transplant, same with my brother. He did get diabetes from his transplant and I ended up with kidney disease from mine. That being said, he's still going strong 6 years later and I'm hanging in there 4 years after mine. I need a kidney transplant but then I'll be good a little longer. It literally is trading in one disease for another, but hey, I'm alive for now!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow congratulations to the two of you!  You know what I feel the same way!!  Last year my doc thought I needed one and when thinking about it I decided that I’ll be alive for however much longer. Luckily I got better and can hopefully hold out a little longer. I hope you continue to do well and get that new kidney!!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THIS. And sometimes the damage they take is worse than the damage of aging. Most people's lungs will easily last their whole lifetime, but they last 5 years on average after transplantation. Bowel also doesn't last long. The theory is that because lungs and intestines are in contact with the outside world (and all the germs and foreign materials that are in the outside world), the immune system has to pay much closer attention to those organs, to fight off germs before there's a serious infection. That means the body quickly realizes that those organs are foreign and rejects those organs much faster, unfortunately.</p></div>		</li>
