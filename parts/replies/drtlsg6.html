<p>First, it's dark. Then it's red. Then you add orange and then yellow... but the red is still there too. About by the time you start adding green, since you also have red and orange and yellow, the end result is white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something surprisingly non-obvious that seems pretty simple in hindsight I learned in spectroscopy: The black body spectrum of a higher temperature emits more light in all regions of the spectrum than that of a lower temperature. That means that if you heat something up to glow blue hot, it will not only emit more blue light than the red hot object, but also more red light (and everything below, IR and all). </p>
<p>Put differently: the spectral emission curve at a higher temperature never crosses the curve of a lower temperature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>...like many facts that stem from actual understanding, it sounds deceptively simple once stated.  Thanks, that's not something I'd thought/verbalized.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here ya go.  Notice that although the peak shifts with increasing temperature, there is also a broad spectrum emitted surrounding the peak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 3000K graph with 2500, 2000, 1500 etc makes especially clear that the peak shift is small compared to the increasing amplitude.</p>
<p>When the temperature increases from 2500 to 3000, you can barely tell that the peak moves. But the broad spectrum around and below the 3000K peak at the position where the 2500K peak was is still much higher than the 2500K peak!  </p>
<p>It's like shifting the peak of a pile of sand not by pushing the pile to the side but by pouring more on just a fraction to the left.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To nitpick, the color mixing is wrong, but aside from that the general idea is right.</p>
<p>It starts out hot enough to glow red, eventually gets hot enough to glow green as well.  Since it's still glowing red, you get red and green together which makes it look yellowish.</p>
<p>If you keep adding heat, it starts to glow a lot of blue light.  Since it's already glowing in red and green, you see a mix of red and green and blue at that point, which looks white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right! lightning is <em>very</em> blue, even violet. The bolt that you see is air that has experienced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_breakdown?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">dielectric breakdown</a>, and has hence turned into plasma, which reaches temperatures of 30000 K (this is five to six times as hot as the surface of the sun, which is generally considered to be white). </p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Wien's Displacement Law</a>, the lightning plasma emits EM radiation at a <em>peak</em> wavelength of some 96.6 nm (visible light following the order of VIBGYOR is from about 350 nm to about 700 nm). This is well into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ultraviolet?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">extreme ultraviolet range</a>, which is ionising—bad news for living things. Don't worry, however—we won't get bathed in UV and break out in skin cancer if a particularly energetic thunderstorm forms, because EUV radiation is very quickly absorbed by the atmosphere, especially at tropospheric pressures. </p>
<p>If lightning were to look red or orange, it'd have to be a <em>tenth</em> as hot—2000 to 3000 K. The filament in an old incandescent lightbulb gets about this hot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the flash of lightning, while highly energetic, is rather short (tens or hundreds of microseconds), so you'd have to stack a whole bunch of those in one place to make a noticeable impact from the generated UV radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also has to do with the fact that our vision systems evolved to consider black body spectra of approx 5700K to be &quot;perfect white&quot;, whereas actually it peaks somewhere in green. Our very own G2V star is to blame for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nicely put. </p>
<p>The Sun has generally had a surface temperature of 5000–6000 K through its lifetime, and hence output peak EM radiation in the visible spectrum, peaking in the green. So life on Earth has evolved with EM receptors, sensors and chemicals sensitive to that particular range of EM radiation. Just like it so happens that chlorophyll in plants absorb red and blue light. The fact that 'visible light' is 350–700 nm is an entirely arbitrary denomination. </p>
<p>If our star were Sirius, we'd be optically sensitive (and probably immune) to UV radiation, and if it were Proxima Centauri, fires would look <em>very</em> bright to us. </p></div>		</li>
