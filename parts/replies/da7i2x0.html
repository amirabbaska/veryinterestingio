<p>Edit: Scrolled down, saw sone others mentioning it too. Was proud for thinking it for a few glorious moments though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That link shows a quote: &quot;[Gasoline] has a flash point of about -50° F (-65° C). The ignition temperature is about 495° F (232(232° C) [sic], a comparatively low figure.&quot;</p>
<p>All of these are incorrect. 495 °F = 257 °C, while 232 °C = 450 ­°F, and also -50 °F = -46 °C not -65.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would definitely lessen the fatigue life of the aluminum. Meaning it would fail a lot sooner than expected by design. It could lead to a catastrophic failure, but I wouldn't say immediately. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is 232C hot enough for the magnesium to separate from aluminum? I used to weld 5052 aluminum fuel tanks and you have to use  an argon/helium mix to prevent separation. The magnesium would appear as a white film near the sides of the weld if it did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strenghened aluminum alloys rely on very fine (a couple nanometers), homogeneously distributed solute rich precipitates ( copper in structural alloys, not sure whats in the high temperature alloys). When you get hot, you material will over age, the precipitates will grow, eating up the good tiny stuff and forming huge chunks on the crystallite boundaries. With no little precipitates, you material gets harder. With large precipitates, you get crack initiation sites, lowering toughness.</p>
<p>For more, look up precipitation hardening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well from an engineering standpoint, now that the ultimate tensile strength is down, any tensile stress that was lower than the previous yielding stress may now be over it, or worse, that it may be over the ultimate strength. Both of these can lead to failure right away. Small scale yielding might go undetected and lead to long term issues. Like catastrophic failure. </p>
<p>Long story short, both could happen if stresses are now above the new yielding/ultimate tensile strength. </p>
