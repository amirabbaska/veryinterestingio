			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean that real W and Z bosons don't really do anything? Like virtual photons are electromagnetism, but real photons are what light is made out of, so do real W / Z bosons have a &quot;job&quot;? What about the other force carrying bosons?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do the same kinds of things that virtual photons do. The reason they only exist as virtual particles to us is because particles at these energy scales just don't have enough energy to produce real W or Z bosons. But a Z boson acts basically just like a photon except it only talks to left handed particles (particles with a certain chirality); hence it's like a very short-ranged electromagnetism if you'd like to think of it that way. Virtual W bosons can change particle flavors in interactions, such as in beta decay for example, where a down quark emits a virtual W boson and becomes an up quark, while the W boson decays into a real neutrino and real electron.</p>
<p>Gluons can exist as real particles in principle since they are massless, but in practice they'll just hadronize and form jets instead for the most part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I'm still a little confused.  Please bear with me because I know next to nothing about this stuff.  I guess what's confusing me is that I've always read that virtual particles aren't really particles at all, so a real photon is just light but a virtual photon is a way to describe how magnets move in a field without any actual photons being involved. So a real photon does one thing and a virtual photon does something else. </p>
<p>So what I'm trying to work out is if the other force bosons have that distinction between their real and virtual roles? Or have I got it backwards and is light the same thing as the electromagnetic force?</p></div>		</li>
