			<div class="markdown"><p>In Serbia, this is not the case. Because of remaining socialistic bases of our law system, health of a burglar is more important than the assets that are to be stolen. That stretches so far that I have two cases that really marks our system:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the middle of the night, 32 yo man woke up because of the rumble he heard downstairs in his house in Zarkovo, part of Belgrade. He ran downstairs to see what's going on, and realizes that there's a burglar in his house where he lived with his spouse and 2yo baby, burglar attacked him with screwdriver, and the man managed to take over the screwdriver inflicting two stab wounds to the burglar. Keep in mind that the guy didn't have a single tool in his house. Burglar started running, and eventually, dies couple of streets away from the place because of blood loss. Homeowner is currently in jail (for two years now) even though the burglar was &quot;familiar to the police&quot; with couple of felonies (inflicting wounds dangerous to life, countless burglaries, narcotics and so on)</p>
</li>
<li>A guy in the Central Serbia gets woken up by the noise of metal outside of his house. Gets out and sees two burglars taking the (idk english word) rain pipes from his house. He chargea at them, inflicting light wounds to both of them. They sue him for &quot;soul pain&quot; that he did to them even though they were on private property... Needless to say, the first case is the same: entry to private property...</li>
</ol>
<p>And that's the reason why Serbians don't call the cops, because there's a silly rule that says that self defense is &quot;reaction equal and simultaneous to the action&quot;. It goes so far that cop can't shoot you if you turn your back to them even if you still hold a smoking gun and he can shoot you only, by law but thats to silly to be obliged, the exact second you shoot him, not a second before or after.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny thing is, most legal systems have a similar rule - as far as I know, in the UK self-defence must be a proportionate reaction to an imminent threat. From there on, it depends on how the courts choose to interpret and flesh out that rule.
Incidentally, the law for householders changed in the UK recently, to allow a lower standard exactly for cases like you mentioned - people will act more harshly (/less proportionately?) to protect their home. </p>
<p>EDIT: if anyone cares, most of the UK (statutory) law on self defence is in s76 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. Provisions for householder cases were added in 2013, in s76(5A) - it basically says that as long as the force you use is not 'grossly disproportionate', then it is fine. What the hell grossly disproportionate means though, is anyone's guess at the moment...</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The meaning of the words in the legislation are for the courts to decide and set a precedent when the time comes for it to be needed.</p>
<p>On the whole however there are some unspoken rules that I'm sure everyone can agree to.</p>
<p>To give a sort of playground example. Lets say someone shoves you and says something bad about your mother, and you just shoot him on the spot. That's a grossly disproportionate reaction and you would probably be convicted for murder. Whereas if you were to shove him back and say something about his mother, your response was reasonably proportionate to the threat against you.</p>
<p>To give another example. Lets say you disturb a burglar in your property and he flees the scene empty handed. If you chase him down the street and beat him senseless with whatever sporting equipment you had to hand that is also grossly disproportionate. Since he was fleeing the scene and not a threat to you, you are no longer defending your life, family or property so you would be deemed the aggressor. There would be reasonable grounds for you to face prosecution in that instance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My female friend got attacked by a robber\rapist with knife in underground passage in UK. He was unlucky that the friend was a long time krav maga practitioner. He ended up beaten up, with broken arm and fingers, dislocated shoulder, broken nose, jaw and many more. Basically she kicked his ass so hard he ended up in hospital for 3 months. She got sued, him obviously claiming that self defence wasn't proportional to threat. Funny fact was he was perceived as victim by court and she was about to get sentenced up until she said when questioned that by his logic when he tried to rape her she should have used a dildo in defence to make the threat proportional, and sadly she didn't have one, nor a knife, on her at that time so she just kicked punks arse instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first case is very similar to a very well known polish case. A very old man was attacked in his home on the new years eve. Two young men tied him top a chair and tortured him for two hours with hot iron and beating. They wanted him to tell where his money is. He managed to to untie himself and stab one of the attackers with a kitchen knife. Man died.
Old man for sentenced to 15 years prison. Fortunately he was to old to go to prison. Second attacker didn't even go to prison for torture. It caused write an uproar. Nothing was done. </p>
<p>It's very similar situation here. You can use only a weapon similar to attacker weapon to be treated as self defense. Burglars used metal rod and iron. Defender used a knife. He's a murderer.
Not many people have guns in Poland also. You have to check if it's a real gun attacker is aiming at you to use yours. If he points it at you and you fire first you're a murderer. He could use blanks. Doesn't matter he didn't. You didn't check. You're going to jail.</p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>the criminals would go to jail for breaking and entry and all that other stuff</li>
<li>the kid would get off scott free, but...</li>
<li>the kid would go into foster care and the parents would have also have all their other children removed for being negligent parents. </li>
<li>the tarantula would be put down after a 3 hour stand off with police involving tin cans, flamethrowers and slippy ice.</li>

He had shelter, food, water, money, and the parents weren't in any way responsible for the threat provided by the criminals. Now, if he were instead locked outside of the house that winter, that'd do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.  Booby traps are indiscriminate and therefore 100% illegal.  Kevin's little door knob trick could have easily lit the door on fire.  The fire department responds and while clearing the house a firefighter encounters another booby trap, gets knocked out and burned alive.  Kevin's facing murder charges.</p>
<p>The DA would probably not file charges because he's a kid that didn't know better but he could be charged if the DA wanted to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  Booby traps are 100% illegal because they are indescriminate.  Lets say those robbers said fuck this kid lets burn him alive in his house, and torched the place.  The responding police and firefighters could get hurt by those booby traps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>False. No he wasn't. It was done during the middle of the day with no threat to him at all. They could sue, and Kevin would be in serious legal trouble. Though likely not in near as much trouble as the family who left on vacation while a child was neglected at home. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the kid had done it after he knew they were there, the extent of injury resulting from his traps could result in legal issues in some states because unless you know they have either the capability of intent to harm you and not just steal property it could be considered vigilantism. If he set up the traps not knowing anyone was going to rob him in the extremely near future he is basically fucked because it would nearly be treated as a case where a random dude just happened upon the house and got maimed/injured. For instance, the katko v. Briney case ended up punishing a man who set up a shotgun trap for trespassers when an attempted robbery took place. </p></div>		</li>
