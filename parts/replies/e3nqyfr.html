<p>Football fans know that the further out the field goal attempt is, the more chance of being blocked (because the kicker is forced to lower the angle).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fans are wrong, though it's not really their fault. Years of sportscasters saying things without having a clue how it works has made this a &quot;fact&quot; about special teams. Nothing changes from one kick to another no matter how far away it is. </p>
<p>If you see a line drive on a field goal I assure you that it was mishit. Every NFL kicker has the ability to hit field goals from notably farther away than they usually attempt in a game. A big reason for this is that the kicker then has a cushion. If he doesn't hit a perfect ball it'll still probably have enough distance to get through. </p></div>		</li>
