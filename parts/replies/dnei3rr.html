<p>That's not scaremongering, that's stating a very obvious fact. </p>
<p>I've been here for 26 years and lived through Northridge in '94 plus a whole host of smaller ones (there was one this week that I apparently slept thru that everyone in West L.A. felt). We <strong><em>are</em></strong> way overdue for a big quake and because of the fragmentation of traditional media the public is overall not really prepared. They weren't really prepared in '94.</p>
<p>I own a Jeep precisely because I was here for both Northridge &amp; the Rodney King Riots and a big quake will be like both of those things combined. I want to know I can be like Doc Brown: &quot;Roads? Where we're going we don't need any <em>roads</em>.....&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, statistically, the west coast <em>is</em> overdue for a major quake. But nobody can say <em>when exactly</em> it will happen.</p>
<p>And the &quot;We're not as ready as we should be&quot; is true, too, because the area affected by &quot;The Big One&quot; is overpopulated, and only a limited number of buildings there are really capable to withstand a bigger event - and even if, the whole infrastructure all around will be a goner, anyway. Like highways built directly over the San Andreas fault, and similar brilliant ideas.</p></div>		</li>
