			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity, as a bilingual, and with many bilingual or trilingual friends, why does the tone or pitch in voice lightly change when switching from language to language? The difference is very much observable.

			<div class="markdown"><p>One big influence is the environment the second language was acquired.</p>
<p>If the child did not have lots of access to similar peers who spoke the language (e.g. if a kid learned Spanish from his Mom and Grandma and didn't have any Spanish-speaking friends his age), the only exposure to the language is through these select speakers.</p>
<p>That's often why men who's sole exposure to a language is female teachers in school can sound more feminine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Birds have extraordinary control over their voice since they essentially produce 2 voices simultaneously. Their vocal organ, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrinx_(bird_anatomy)" target="_blank">syrinx</a> is located below where the trachea splits into 2 bronchi. This means they have 2 syrinxes instead of the mammals' single larynx. Hope that partly answers how parrots can mimic sounds so well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Riding off this comment, no two people have the same overtones and undertones produced by their cavities in their head and mouth when the air is passed through the vocal folds.</p>
<p>It's why singers have to tune the pitches they sing with each other (assuming it's the same note) because it will be slightly out of tune if they don't focus. Pitches and notes are also different: pitches can vary from the written note to be slightly higher or slightly lower in order to tune chords.</p>
<p>Edit: Overtones are various pitches produced above a fundamental note, which is the base note that is produced when you sing/say something. Overtones have their own order, with the first being a third (so three notes above the fundamental), and then a fifth (fives notes above the fundamental), and then a third, but this one an octave above the previous third, and then a fifth but above the previous fifth, etc. Undertones work in a similar way but are produced below the note, and I'm not sure on the details of their order.</p>
<p>Overtones can be &quot;swallowed&quot; or &quot;brought forward&quot; by raising or lowering the soft pallette (the soft area in the back of the roof of your mouth), lowering and raising the larynx, using more or less air, and putting more emphasis on the nasal cavities and making a brighter sound.</p>
<p>Various techniques exist to sing in overtones, and it's possible to sing undertones via subharmonic bass techniques, Mongolian throat singing, false bass/vocal fry and many others. Notable singers using these techniques include Avi Kaplan (who has done both overtones singing and some false bass techniques), Anna-Maria Hefele (she has wonderful overtones), Geoff Castelluci, and David Larson.</p>
<p>If you decide to practice overtones and some of the false bass techniques, I would be careful because overdoing the practicing can lead to losing your voice and/or permanent vocal damage.</p>
<p>Finally, just as a little note, it's possible to combine both techniques and sing a chord with just your voice alone. I haven't found any videos on this, so I can't link anything to you, apologies.</p>
<p>Source: I sing in a men's chorus, and have messed around with some the above in my spare time.</p></div>		</li>
