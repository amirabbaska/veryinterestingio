			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just the sources, but any continuity they are a part of. If Agent Cardinal dies but his network survives, you don't open up data on Cardinal because now his legacy is in the open. Or in the case of SIGINT or other data gathering bits, you don't say you cracked a 1980 Codebook because that lets the other side know all of that era's mail is suspect if it used that book (and by extension, subsequent books might be vulnerable too). <strong>E</strong>: The code-breakers at Bletchley Park cracked the German ENIGMA cypher; nobody told the Germans about this because they were at war. The same principle applies even during 'peace time' for the intelligence communities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>25, actually. There are exceptions with date-specific time extensions that each agency can choose to make at that 25-year point, and they go up in additional increments of 25. Most stuff gets released, with the exception of nuclear weapons-related information (whose prohibition from release is codified in law, rather than executive order) and intelligence sources and methods.</p></div>		</li>
