			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why you never ever ever ever go anywhere near downed power lines after a storm, or walk into any standing water if you even think there might be wires around in flooded areas. Electrocution is unfortunately a common cause of death after a hurricane blows through. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean a live downed line?</p>
<p>First of all, stay away.</p>
<p>If you you are in a vehicle or equipment touching a live line, stay put until power company can shut off power, unless you are in danger from something else.</p>
<p>If you must get out of that vehicle/equipment, jump off of it, so that at no point are you touching both the ground and the vehicle.  Make sure to land with both feet together.  Move slowly away by using very small shuffle steps.</p>
<p>If you are within 35 feet of a live wire on the ground, move away slowly by using very small shuffle steps.</p>
<p>If you want more information, YouTube has plenty of videos on downed power line safety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ground is a big variable resistor, the voltage will go down the further away you get from the wire. If you stand with your legs far apart the potential difference between them will be higher and thus you get a larger current going through your body.</p></div>		</li>
