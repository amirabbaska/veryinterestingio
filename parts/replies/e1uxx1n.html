			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldnt it be more accurate to say using certain stimulants causes the BBB to be less effective and long term use can put stress on your brain ? The article you linked didnt exactly draw that conclusion but it referenced other articles that may have found that to be true. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking about stimulant psychosis, the hallucinations are generally caused by lack of sleep and food/water after long periods, where the psychotic effects can be brought on without those factors much more readily. I'd take that to mean those occur less from the drugs immediate effects and more from the superhuman ability to not eat or sleep many users of amphetamine experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear mixed responses whether it’s safe to take amphetamine with MAOIs. Would this tyramine-like molecule make the combination unsafe?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the monoamine releasing properties of amphetamines is what makes it unsafe. Without MAO, which MAOIs block, these chemicals (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin) can accumulate into very unsafe levels, each of them causing their own overdose state. Serotonin Syndrome. Noradranergic Storm. Don't know what dopamine's version is but I'm sure it has a name.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks to dopamine ß-hydroxylase, you'd probably call it adrenergic storm.</p>
<p>But the thing to look out for is the crash when the dopamine comes back down. Theoretical increased risk of Neuroleptic Malignancy Syndrome.</p></div>		</li>
