<p>The phones are free to use until you get assigned a cell. </p>

<p>From experience, this is more frustrating than it should be. For example I was in a holding cell with 6-7 others and there was one phone that only worked very occasionally. We had to type our assigned password into the phone to call and it didn't work the majority of the time. But obviously this pales in comparison to being held without trial for weeks or months</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got arrested at home for missing a court date for a misdemeanor sale to minors at my bar (I truly just forgot what date it was). I was super nice and cooperative, one even let me call my boss to tell him I would probably be late that night before putting me in the car. At booking they let me look through my phone and right down anyone I would need to call.</p>
<p>Called the gf to arrange bail, was out in 5 hours and actually got to work on time.</p>
<p>Only time I have been arrested and the cops were super nice about other stuff. I have terrible claustrophobia so they let me have the cuffs on in front of me and cracked a window in the back. </p>
<p>The crazy part is that 5 cars showed up to my house. I asked what this show of force was for in such a light case. They saw I had purchased a gun in the state a few years ago so they always go with a show of force in those situations. Crazy they would do, like I was gonna come out in a hail of bullets with a .22 to escape a charge that I got expunged later on.</p>
<p>Sorry, tangent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that depends on the arresting officer. When i got arrested I was actually very cooperative and nice with the arresting officer, and he in turn was nice to me. They let me write down some numbers from my phone to call so i can get bailed out. As that was happening there was another guy getting booked in and I guess he was not cooperative, he asked if he can check his contacts for numbers to write down and he was declined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can and do depending on who's in command at that specific moment. I remember the phones constantly being shut on and off just to spite a specific inmate who kept pissing off the guards. Naturally we all got fucked in the process and it's not like you can just saying &quot;Hey, stop being a dick&quot; unless you want carried out of the cell for starting a fight.. So you wait, and wait until  someone on shift decides to flip the phones back on. I hated making calls, just a reminder that on the other side of that line someone gets to sit in a comfy chair while you're hanging onto concrete and metal for hours to days just to get a small chance at bail..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the many reasons the justice system is a war on the poor. They have to wait months for the attorney guaranteed to them and in the mean time sit in jail and likely lose their jobs and potentially their families regardless of their guilt. So they plead guilty just to end it.</p>
<p>Civil asset forfeiture is government sponsored theft that requires the aggrieved to invest thousands of dollars in the hopes of getting back their lawful property and tramples all over many of your amendment related rights. </p>
<p>Police can just kill you and claim whatever and then go to work the next day and sit at a desk or take a tax payer funded holiday.</p>
<p>They can lock you in a cell with known violent criminals and not face any responsibility for assault or rape that occurs there. Including any perpetrated by the prison guards.</p>
<p>Private prisons essentially trade humans like goods and want to keep you in prison to increase their profits.</p>
<p>It is outrageous and the only way to not be a victim is to be rich, which is not a viable option for most. </p>

<p>Courts are very backed up but I think a big part of it is they want people desperate enough to get out so they will accept a plea deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, when you get arrested and put in jail, they have 3 days to arraign you. Business days, so don't get arrested on a Thursday or you'll be there a while before you see the judge. </p>
<p>Then when you go to your arraignment, you can request to be released on your own recognizance. This means no bail, and it's a promise that you'll come back to court. If it's a misdemeanor or just a first time charge for something small like drug possession, or maybe shoplifting, if you have no record, 90% of the time they will OR you. Especially if you have a job, an address in town, and are not a flight risk. </p>
<p>Anyways at the arraignment you'll also be appointed a public defender if you don't have your attorney yet, or you can't afford one. The cutoffs for &quot;being able to afford one&quot; are different by state, but they are pretty low. I would strongly suggest saying that you make minimum wage, because although you might make a little more than that, I'm guessing most people don't have 5k sitting around, unless of course you want a private attorney, which is WAY preferable to a PD. </p>
<p>After that, you'll almost always waive your right to a speedy trial. You technically have a right to a trial within something like 20 days, but neither side wants that. Your side needs time to build evidence, and so does theirs. Hardly anyone doesn't waive their right to an expedited trial. </p>
<p>Then they will set your next court appearance a week or two out, and you will go to court a fuck ton of times just to be told to come back in two weeks. It takes forever. </p>
<p>Oh also, you'll always always always plead not guilty preliminarily. You can change your plea or accept a deal at any time. This is why when you see in the news when people do horrific things and they are caught dead to rights on camera, the news says they &quot;plead not guilty,&quot; and everyone flips out and says how could they do that!?! Of course they are guilty!</p>
<p>Sure, and everyone knows it. But it's just a preliminary plea. There are still plea bargains and deals to be worked out, and plus what if something pops up that exonerates you? Why would you plead guilty and ruin all chances of beating the charge?</p>
<p>I've had friends who got arrested for possession long ago that got their charges dropped because someone messed up the chain of custody in evidence, or couldn't get something filed on time with the court, etc etc. </p></div>		</li>
