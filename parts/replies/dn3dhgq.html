			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine an old animal that won't have any healthy children any more, and is too weak to help provide for itself or its community. Evolutionarily speaking, its best move is to kill itself. That will free up resources and improve the lives of its relatives, which will help its genes survive.</p>
<p>Or imagine an animal that's become infected by some parasite. The parasite will feed on the host, then burst out and lay eggs in someone else (killing the original host). The hosts's best move is to kill themself, killing the parasite inside, and preventing them from infecting any more of the host's relatives.</p>
<p>It's possible that suicidal depression is the brain malfunctioning and thinking that it's in one of those situations (or another).</p>
<p>As someone who <strong>is</strong> suicidally depressed, I can tell you that the thoughts you're having probably aren't true. Things will get better, and you will make a positive difference in people's lives. If you're like me, knowing that intellectually won't change how you feel. But knowing that your brain isn't working right might convince you to get medical help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you have an incredibly complex biological computer in your head that doesn't always work as intended, particularly when it's being flooded with hormones.  Many people who have had suicidal thoughts look back on it years later and wonder wtf they they were thinking.    My father committed suicide when I was young.  I had a period of depression where I certainly considered it too.  Looking back on it now I have no idea what I was thinking.  I tend to think my father would have been the same way had he simply pushed through. A shame really. A lifetime lost and nothing gained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes me wonder if depression and anxiety are actually negative side-effects of an adaptive trait. Perhaps in the way that sickle-cell anemia is a negative side effect (caused by inheriting two copies) of a gene that makes the carriers resistant to malaria when heterozygous (when they only have one copy of the gene). </p></div>		</li>

<p>As for anxiety, that's a bit simpler to understand. Fear/anxiety has always been highly adaptive and has saved our asses for ages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't necessarily mean it's an evolutionry trait ofc. But it raises the follow-up questions: Why didn't evolution select <em>against</em> this behavior? And why is the system (in this case mind/brain) susceptible to failing in <em>exactly this way</em> systematically?</p>
<p>I keep linking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_approaches_to_depression" target="_blank">this</a> wiki article (should have made a parent comment) which summarizes possible <em>adaptive</em> functions of depression-related behavior. Good read!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been linking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_approaches_to_depression" target="_blank">this</a> wiki page a lot, which summarizes some theories on how depression-related behavior might actually have been <em>adaptive</em> (i.e. helped people breed) from an evolutionary point of view!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to. You just need to like sex.</p>
<p>Evolution doesn't take into account the fact you can know what sex is, how reproduction works, and take measures to prevent it.</p>
<p>When you think about evolution, you need to think about before humans had technology. We have not been evolving in a very convergent manner since technology, and the more technology we have the worse that is. We are essentially devolving at this point. Just diverging more and more. Though through selective breeding, and some certain instances, there are still factors causing us to evolve in a more traditional way, but WAY less than in our natural state. </p>
<p>You don't see obese zebras, because they'd be slow and delicious and the first to be eaten. You can have obese humans and domestic animals, because it doesn't really affect our ability to survive and reproduce. </p></div>		</li>
