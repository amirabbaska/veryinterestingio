			<div class="markdown"><p>Tiny change.  LD50 refers to the dosage of a chemical that kills (lethal dose) 50% of the test animals and it's scaled up by weight.  It doesn't necessarily relate to probability of it killing a human, that's just a guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on the chemical. It's unethical to feed drugs to people until they die, but some chemicals are so commonly taken and data retrieved that the LD50 is known for human subjects. Alcohol is one of those chemicals. Barbiturates, opiates and a bunch of anaesthetics fall into this category as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the excretion of alcohol is at a constant rate because the metabolic pathways that facilitate its excretion are quickly overwhemed. In contrast, the rate excretion of most drugs is proportional to the concentration of that drug in the body, and gives rise to a half-life parameter. Alcohol has no such halflife constant- it is excreted at a constant rate.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how this affects attempting to scale parameters like LD50 from test species however!</p>
<p>But alcohol is notable how it differs from most other drugs, in this regard. It also means that it is lucky that alcohol consumption tends to be self-limiting (i.e. you get so drunk you can't drink anymore) otherwise it'd be very easy to overdose on alcohol and die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might be a bit misleading, given that it's describing death from direct toxicity, whereas alcohol-related deaths (excepting driving and violence) are overwhelmingly the result of aspirating vomit while unconscious; that can occur far <em>far</em> below a lethal level of intoxication, in that the alcohol itself is not killing you.</p>

<p>This may not be what you're saying, but I'd like to be clear for maximal safety here.  There's not a &quot;minimum&quot; LD50.  The LD50 describes the median of a greater distribution of where people will die.  Shoenice's personal point of death is somewhere in that distribution, with about a 50% chance of being above or below whatever the LD50 is.</p>
<p>93.7% of the way there just means he was at another place in that distribution.  I don't know its exact shape, so let's just say it was slightly lower, perhaps the LD40.</p>
<p>This would imply that 40% of the people doing this will be dead.</p>
<p>It's the case that the guy's playing with his life, and it should not be mistaken for something like &quot;coming within 7%&quot; of the red line of death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just going by what Astrokiwi said was the LD50, 5g - 8g per kg.  5g/kg being the minimal LD50 provided.  I believe the real LD50 for humans to be much lower at around 3.6g/kg.  In other words I suspect even most people his size would die attempting this.</p></div>		</li>
