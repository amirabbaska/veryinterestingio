<p>&quot;the Wycheproof area is known to have its own unique mineral, known as Wycheproofite.  Wycheproofite can be characterised by its pinkish colour and its transparency&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mt. McKinley is only the highest in North America. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He said base to summit &quot;completely above water&quot;. So Mauna Kea wouldn't fit because although its entire height from base to summit is 33,100 feet, only about 13,796 feet is above water. Whereas McKinley at 20,237 feet has a base-to-peak height of 17,000 to 19,000 feet according to Wikipedia, because it is surrounded by plains that are only 1,000 to 3,000 feet above sea level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ask yourself this. If you (Denali) are 6 ft tall and I (Everest) am 5 ft tall but I'm standing on 3 foot tall step stool (Tibetan plateau), am I taller? That's the whole concept and the very thing I said in the beginning. In case your wondering the base of Everest is not at sea level. </p></div>		</li>
