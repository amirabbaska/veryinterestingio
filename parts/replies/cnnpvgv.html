			<p>According to the USGS anything above 1000 feet is a mountain, anything under that is a hill. In the UK I think it's 2000 feet.<br><br>But Hill and Mountain pretty much are arbitrary, you should refer to it by the method of formation. e.g. It's not a hill it's a dome(formed by diapirism).

			<p>Well it's changed a few times. Initially it was based on the british ordnance survey's definition of 1000 feet of elevation (i.e. MSL). But that obviously doesn't work in the US, so the term was reclassified as 1000 feet of local relief. <br><br>We stopped trying to classify these things on height in the 70's, but I think the british still do, I think the official ordnance survey definition is 2000 ft above sea level. <br><br>[Take a look at this,] (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_mountains_and_hills_in_the_British_Isles" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_mountains_and_hills_in_the_British_Isles</a>)</p>		</li>

			<p>Try Mt Tenpou (天保山) in Osaka, Japan: altitude of 4.53m. I made a solo ascent in April last year and captured <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gYNrxuc.jpg" target="_blank">this picture</a> of it. The peak is actually the square tile in the bottom-right corner; I didn't know that at the time, which is why the tile is partially outside the frame. There is actually a Mount Tenpou expedition society located in a nearby café; they will give you an official certificate for 100 yen. Osaka aquarium is nearby, and is worth checking out.</p>		</li>

			<p>He said base to summit &quot;completely above water&quot;. So Mauna Kea wouldn't fit because although its entire height from base to summit is 33,100 feet, only about 13,796 feet is above water. Whereas McKinley at 20,237 feet has a base-to-peak height of 17,000 to 19,000 feet according to Wikipedia, because it is surrounded by plains that are only 1,000 to 3,000 feet above sea level.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ask yourself this. If you (Denali) are 6 ft tall and I (Everest) am 5 ft tall but I'm standing on 3 foot tall step stool (Tibetan plateau), am I taller?

			<p>Sea level is well defined on earth (less so on mars, they use a slightly different measurement there).<br><br>&gt; Sea level is generally used to refer to mean sea level (MSL), an average level for the surface of one or more of Earth's oceans from which heights such as elevations may be measured.<br><br>From wikipedia. So normally when talking about sea level you are not actually talking about vertical distance to the water, even at the coast, as this would change with every wave.</p>		</li>

			<p>Height above sea level or center of the Earth is perfectly fine if you're just looking for numerical geographic extremes. But if you're a mountaineer, you probably care more about topographic prominence. In fact, that's the algorithm I mentioned: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_prominence" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_prominence</a></p>		</li>

			<p>This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_prominence" target="_blank">topographic prominence</a> and is, in fact, commonly used to compare peaks.<br><br>It has a significant effect on the ranking as well. While Everest is clearly still the highest by prominence, the next mountain on the list in that part of the world is Nanga Parbat (1419 km from Everest) at 14th on the list. In comparison, Denali is 3rd on the list and only 621 km from Mount Logan, which is 6th.<br><br>That's not to say that the Alaska or St. Elias Mountains are taller or more challenging to climb than those in the Himalaya's, however, the Himalayas are situated on the Tibetan Plateau which is already at around 14k feet on its own; it's no wonder a lot of Himalayan peaks fall lower down on the list.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's defined this way because it's the most useful definition. Air density, flight laws, even the location of the ionosphere for ham radio operators all follow earths surface. The distance from the centre of the earth only starts to matter several hundred kilometers up while orbiting, and even at that height gravity won't act exactly as if the earth were a point mass. </p>		</li>

			<p>Radius at the Earth's equator is 6371km, whereas it's only 6356km at the poles. This means that a mountain on (or near) the equator will have a major advantage over one away from the equator (like Everest). As for exactly how they do it, I would guess laser trigonometry combined with SAR (synthetic aperture radar) images from InSAR satellites but not sure!</p>		</li>
