			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azeotrope#Pressure_swing_distillation" target="_blank">pressure swing distillation</a>, and it gets used in cases where an entrainer can't be used. (One of my chemE assignments was to simulate one for acrylonitrile separation.)</p>
<p>It's interesting that PSD results in the two components &quot;flipping&quot; their preference for being the bottoms or distillate product. If you applied PSD to the ethanol-water azeoptrope, the water would distill out of the ethanol in the higher pressure column, rather than the reverse like you expect at atmospheric pressure. </p>
<p>Apparently, though, the water-ethanol azeotrope isn't affected very much by pressure, so entrainers like benzene or adsorbents like molecular sieves, modified starches, or dehydrated salts are used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/Odd_nonposter pointed out that it's not a very practical way to purify ethanol/water, so that's probably the main reason. Still probably worth knowing though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's true! The other methods are better for ethanol in practice, but for azeotropes in general pressure swing is a useful concept. </p></div>		</li>
