			<div class="markdown"><p>One way some single-engine rockets can do roll control is if it is an &quot;open cycle staged combustion&quot; rocket.  A little of the fuel is burned to power the fuel pumps, and the exhaust from that bit comes out of a big exhaust pipe on the side.  The exhaust is powerful enough that it is a small rocket engine itself providing non-negligible thrust, so they control where the exhaust pipe points to control roll.</p>
<p>The Falcon 1 is an example of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RCS is about space attitude control: monopropellant's ISP is trash in the atmosphere and the thrusters are really small - they only need to accommodate the probe/orbital stage anyway.</p>
<p>Verniers, on the other hand, are tiny engines that feed from the same tanks as the main engine and provide enough thrust and ISP to meaningfully alter the ascent trajectory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For tracking attitude or correcting it?  Yes for the former, not really for the latter.  Bonus: they also work outside the atmosphere!</p>
<p>Reaction wheels are another similar mechanism that many microsatellites use to adjust attitude once in orbit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even the Redstone did this. When you have an unsupported vertical launch, fins simply won't provide control authority during the beginning of flight, a period crucial to the trajectory of the rocket when your fuel margins are thin.</p>
<p>The only atmospheric rockets/missiles you'll find without gimballed engines are tube-launched or dropped from moving aircraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the main reasons they put fins on rockets that have gimbaled engines, is to reduce the gimbal actuator power. The fins provide some restoring force to keep the rocket going straight. Not just for roll, but to help with countering the aerodynamic forces trying the flip the rocket sideways. As the rocket goes supersonic, there is a very large force trying to flip the rocket sideways. It moves the center of pressure aft on the rocket body. Otherwise the gimbal and engine system would have to supply all that force.  That is why the Saturn V had small fins on them. </p></div>		</li>
