			<div class="markdown"><p>While the turning circle of trains is very large, if the wheels were not conical the train would still derail at speed. At low speeds it might work but only because the wheels would slip. It would be a rough ride and could jam. </p>
<p>The difference in arc lengths between the two rails will apply a force on the axle that will cause it to twist in a way that aims the wheels into the rails. </p>
<p>Some early rail cars used a split axle, another option, but they have other problems. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Pre downvote edit - I know it's not good.. but you can still steer with a spooled rear.</p></div>		</li>
