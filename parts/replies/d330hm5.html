			<div class="markdown"><p>In one of the anecdotes available out there of the famous &quot;house&quot; scene, the photographers mention that the only light available in that scene was from the explosion itself.  It's possible to adjust the camera shutter to make sure the film isn't overexposed.  If you look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqyBzXYZPoM" target="_blank">this</a> video you can see what happens.  There's the flash of light, the heat wave and then the pressure wave from the explosion.  The flash of light only happens momentarily and then the only other source of light is from the mushroom cloud and other fires.  As long as the camera and the film were protected from the heat of the blast and the pressure wave, there's no reason to think that they couldn't survive intact.</p>

<p>Extant videos/pictures of nuclear explosions were all recorded on film, not with a digital camera (although some of the footage from tests the French did in the past 20 years might have digital footage), so there were no real sensors, just lenses, shutters, and film.  Granted, there may have been integral light meters, so I can't speculate on the effect the blast may have had on those.  Most integrated light meters on older cameras were more passive, meaning they estimated whether the settings for a camera would over- or under-expose the film, but they couldn't automatically adjust the settings to match the conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, with photographic film, there's a response curve in terms of exposure. The more exposed a part of the film is, the less sensitive it gets. Which means that even if a shot is extremely overexposed, it can be &quot;saved&quot; during the development process.</p>
<p>With digital, once the sensor maxes out at a given sensitivity, then that's it, you get what are called &quot;blown highlights&quot; where every pixel is the same. Even if you try and lower the exposure in post, any blown highlights will be immediately evident because there's absolutely no detail.</p>
<p>With film, since the sensitivity decreases the more it gets exposed, it's extremely difficult to actually &quot;blow&quot; the highlights. In fact, in the film days, most photographers would error on the side of overexposing, since they knew they could dial the brightness back in post-development if needed to recover highlight detail. In digital, it's the opposite: photographers tend to underexpose so they don't blow the highlights, and digital (depending on the sensor) recovers detail in the shadows much better than film does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's on film so an over exposed frame is just that - a single frame. Unlike a digital camera where sensor damage affects subsequent frames, with physical film so long as you don't break be film strip, each team is completely independent of the last</p></div>		</li>

<p>Technically undetonated fissile material. Radioactive waste would be like contaminated byproducts caused by controlled nuclear reactions and the refining of nuclear material.</p>
<p>Atomic weapons contain far more fissile material than is converted into energy when they detonate, blowing apart a significant portion of the core and in general peppering it about.</p></div>		</li>
