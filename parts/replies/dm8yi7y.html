			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't looked at this particular weather map, but - a cold front typically <em>is</em> a high pressure system. If the storm is mashed between yet another front, it's going to be squeezed and dump rain even faster. </p>
<p>Collisions of warm and cold fronts generally cause storms to form, as it is the cooling of warm, wet (and low pressure) air that causes storms in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
