			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, after reading some of the replies this is what I want the scientists to calculate for me. And may draw a diagram as well.</p>
<p>Basically make an upside down cone in the earth. How large of an opening would we need to get a hole that's say...500,000ft deep in the earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>500,000 feet? That's about 94 and a half miles. The crust on average is 30 miles thick, and can go up to the mid 40s in areas, or more. </p>
<p>At 94 miles you're blasting through the crust and well into the mantle. And you are NOT putting a hole in that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well largest open pit mine in the USA ( Bingham Canyon) has overall 35 degree wall angles in its shallowest stable walls. So let's say that angle was stable for 500,000 feet high wall so you need a hole with 714,000 feet  radius.</p>
<p>Assuming of course that the material you are excavating is solid rock that you could conventionally mine using drill and blast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Achilles heel of this plan is likely to be dewatering. There are large systems of ground water basically everywhere. Deterring is one of the more expensive items when it comes to open pit mining. One reasonably sized open pit mine can have as many as 80 dewatering wells each well pumping thousands of gallons per minute. Pumps that provide that much capacity cost close to a million dollars a a year each in just electricity and maintenance. So unless you can figure out how to mine underwater were screwed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We drill to get minerals and such up. What stuff is so deep down, than is rarer closer to the surface?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not minerals. Fluids and gases. We're talking oil and natural gas. At that depth you have no potential to mine it has to come to you therefore it has to flow therefore Fluids and gases. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And in terms of drilling deeper and deeper for oil and natural gas the answer is twofold - </p>
<p>1) We've already produced from shallow and easy-to-reach reservoirs.</p>
<p>2) Oil and natural gas come from organic-rich source rocks that are buried to a certain depth (which means they are warmed up) in order to breakdown the organic molecules into shorter chain hydrocarbons. Too cold and you don't generate hydrocarbons, too hot and you break them all down.</p>
<p>As such, source rocks are (or were) necessarily at some depth. As hydrocarbons migrate out of those source rocks, they can be trapped in reservoirs nearby (still at depth), or migrate up-dip to shallower reservoirs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could drill deep into a mineral deposit and use solution chemistry to in-situ leach metals out. However you would need to know what was sown there and geological techniques for not invasive (drilling expensive holes to get lucky and find gold) are good enough to be economic. The future of mining will be ultra deep or in-situ solution extraction. Worlds largest gold deposit is dissolved in the ocean. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The geothermal gradient increases at roughly 0.5-1 degree C for ever 100m, so these South African mines send down refrigerated air so workers can even be this deep. Even then it is still hot as heck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if a mine isn't that deep, the air gets hot as: compressing a gas (pushing it underground) makes it hotter; and mining machinery heats up the air.</p>
<p>Also it's generally wet underground, which raises the humidity and limits the ability of sweat to cool you down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think when you say &quot;drill for minerals&quot;, you mean that mining companies will drill holes to find gold in the subsurface, and you're right. However, these tend to be holes that are drilled that tell geologists where the gold is and where they should build/extend their mine.</p>
<p>In terms of rare material being at depth - that's sort of the case for some elements, but I think this explanation might help: It's important to think of valuable orebodies (say some quartz veins with gold in them) as three dimensional objects. Say you find a vein with gold in it that looks something like <a href="http://www.racerocks.com/racerock/abiotic/geology/quartzvein2.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>You can see that it's a relatively linear feature on the surface, but you could excavate back into that hillside (or down, in our example above) to follow the vein and find that it's actually somewhat of a tabular or planar feature that exists in three dimensions.</p>
<p>When companies drill for this gold (or whatever metal), they are more or less taking rock samples from depth and seeing if/where these veins intersect their hole and how they can most strategically continue mining an area. Also important is that around mineralized zones, there is often host rock that is elevated with the metal of interest, but we need to assess how much metal is in those rocks to determine if it's economically feasible to mine that area out.</p>
<p>Note that this is a gross oversimplification of the metals mining process and not all valuable ores occur in veins like this - some are in disseminated through the host rock, some are hosted in layers in cooled magma chambers, some are found in ancient coral reefs, even! It depends on the style of mineralization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading as a kid a SciFi story, where they used a kind of a &quot;mole&quot; which melted the surrounding rock, turning it into in-situ casing.</p>
<p>Could it be done?</p>
<p>Also, what about using &quot;moles&quot;, large self-sufficient platforms travelling down the vertical tunnel they make by the above mentioned method, instead of the traditional drilling systems? Is there any sense in idea like that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is done, using laser drilling.  However, due to the aforementioned pressure issues, it's only good for shallow depths.  Also, the melted-rock casing is not a very good casing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just theoretically here assuming infinite money why not use something like a large TBM? As it digs it could place at first steal then more temperature resistant casings before finally using actively cooled casing that uses internal radiators to transfer all that heat up though a double walled casing. Liquified cryogenic gasses like nitrogen could be pumped down and heat could be pulled out like a chimney. If the environment around the TBM could be manageably cooled what's to stop the brute force approach?</p>
<p>Basically the opposite idea of a Europa mission, where a probe would melt it's way though. Instead you are now making the rock hard so you can dig through it, and using reinforcing walls instead of (or even in addition to, why not both?) high pressure so things don't crunch, using a machine that can laugh at pressure.</p>
<p>If the machine was electric it could even power itself with the temperature differential between it's cutting head and cryogenically cooled butt.</p>
<p>Again assuming infinite budget and a Manhattan project level of commitment to just digging the deepest hole just because with the best tech that exists or could if we wanted it to.</p></div>		</li>
