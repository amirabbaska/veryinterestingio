			<div class="markdown"><p>Similarly, what about hitting the sack when you're exhausted? Bed is amazing when you're bone tired. Finally laying down and relaxing after a big day with nothing but sleep on the agenda? Bedgasm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, I'm confused. First you said the muscles stiffen during sleep and then you said they're relaxed. Does stretching after sleep so quickly change the muscle state from stiff to relaxed in a matter of seconds/minutes and if so wouldn't the same effect of your bed feeling so good be achievable by simply doing a stretch exercise just before bed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Muscles do stiffen during sleep. When you wake up in the morning it the contrast of stretching after not moving for a few hours generally feels really good, so you feel comfortable in any position. it's mostly a perception thing, I think.</p>
<p>And yes I did mention that stretching throughout the day will help your muscles relax and make it easier to fall asleep at night. Unless you're like me and have joint pains that are triggered from slightly too much exertion. </p></div>		</li>
