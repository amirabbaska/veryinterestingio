			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, this is nuclear fusion- over coming the electrostatic repulsive force so that the nuclear strong force could take over. This is why normally for fusion to occur you need incredibly high heat- so hot that the particles get moving fast enough so that their kinetic energy can overcome the electrostatic repulsion. </p>
<p>If you do this for light elements (anything less than iron, on the periodic table), by doing this you will also release energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iron is the 'dividing point' in terms of binding energy. Basically, elements lighter than iron will release energy when their nuclei are fused together, and elements heavier than iron will release energy when their nuclei are split apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key property for iron is that it has the highest <em>binding energy per nucleon</em> of any element. <a href="http://www4.uwsp.edu/physastr/kmenning/images/gc6.30.f.01.mod.gif" target="_blank">This chart</a> illustrates the point well. Note that iron is at the peak. So if you fuse nuclei lighter, or fiss <em>(snicker)</em> nuclei heavier, energy will be released.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nuclear binding energy per nucleon for iron is a maximum if you were to graph that value for all possible atomic configurations from lowest number of nucleons to highest number of nucleons. This is due to in part the packing of the nucleons in iron and the strength of the nuclear forces each nucleon feels. Because potential energy in this case is ultimately negative, a stronger binding energy results in more kinetic energy, thus heat. So when nucleons pack together more closely, they shed energy to their surroundings. This is similar to how gravitational potential energy is negative, with the magnitude increasing towards the center of the gravitational mass. So when a particle comes closer to the Earth, its potential energy increases in the negative direction, so to compensate its kinetic energy must increase. This is because energy is conserved.</p>
<p>In the graph below, you want to move your nuclei towards the top of the curve where iron is. Moving up the curve gives you more net thermal energy per nucleon since the magnitude of the binding energy for each nucleon increases, resulting in lower potential energy and thus higher kinetic energy.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, I made a simplification. </p>
<p>The atoms are normally not going fast enough to overcome the full electrostatic repulsion, but they do still have to be traveling fast enough to get close enough that they can tunnel- since the probability of tunneling decreases rapidly as distance increases. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the resulting element would be more stable than the two elements which made them- and thus the excess energy is released. </p>
<p>To clarify- if you have a collection of particles, they can have two types of energy, kinetic and potential. Kinetic energy is positive, potential energy is negative. If the collection of particles has a net positive energy, they are not bound together- they can separate at will (they have more kinetic energy pushing them apart than potential holding them together). If they have net negative energy, they are considered bound. The more net negative the collection is, the more tightly bound the system is. </p>
<p>When two light atoms combine, the resulting atom is bound together more tightly than the two atoms were independently- thus the combined atom has more negative energy. Since energy cannot be created or destroyed, that means that there must be a release of kinetic energy. In the case of fusion, that energy takes the form of protons, carrying away energy from the system. </p></div>		</li>

<p>So for instance, if a carbon-12 nucleus in your hand somehow fused with a carbon-12 nucleus in your table, you'd have a Mg-24 atom in their place. 24 is its standard weight, so likely that would be the end of it.</p>

<p>Plus a huge amount of energy would be released, something like a thousand times the explosion of the same weight of dynamite as the objects touching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To briefly address 'touch' on quantum scales, subatomic particles jare not 'solid' in the way that we understand solidity.  They're more like tiny clouds that are very dense in the center and rapidly become less dense as distance from the center increases.  The radius of an electron is the radius to a particular density level in the electron cloud.  The cloud itself does extend beyond the radius but the density is so low that we can pretend it is zero (sometimes).</p>
<p>If we assume that the extremely powerful repulsives force between two fundamental particles did not exist, then their 'touching' would be when the clouds partially overlap.</p>
<p>This is a drastic oversimplification but it should give some idea of how nebulous 'touch' is on quantum scales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nebulous… quite.</p>
<p>Density of what, by the way? Electron stuff? Just solid bits spread about like dust in a cloud? That would be solid enough for our purposes… when some of one electron's solid stuff is separated from some of another electron's electron solid stuff by no space at all. Pretty sure none of this is right though, right?</p></div>		</li>
