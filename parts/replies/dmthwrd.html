			<div class="markdown"><p>I can really blow your mind.  </p>
<p>In an attempt to make the Imperial system sane, they decided to give it a derived unit called a pound mass and rename pound to pound force.  Thus 1 lbm * 1g= 1 lbf.  Thus, when we say density, we really mean lbm/in^3, which is a really a weight based density.  Not to be outdone, the French (the creators of the metric system) created the kilogram-force</p>
<p>That wasn't good enough for some people because they don't want to say 1g, they want to say 9.81 m/s^2 = 32.2 ft/s^2, so we invented the slug.  Thus, 1 slug*1 ft/s^2 =1 lbf.</p>
<p>That's fine, except engineers really like to work in inches, so we get 1 slinch *386 in/s^2 =1 lbf.  Slinch is also called blob, snail, and slugette.</p>
<p>So now to convert from slugs to slinches, we multiply by 1 inch/12 ft.   </p></div>		</li>
