<p>c banking is work days is that the systems the banks use were designed and built when electronic banking first kicked off a few decades ago. They're shit and only understand workdays. We've got a shiny new system that banks 24/7 and payments made to other customers are in real time. But we can't exchange payment information with other banks because there simply isn't the infrastructure for it. APCA/BECS set what the banks minimum requirements are here. It's in serious news of an overhaul here. And that's where NPP will bring some relief. Just don't believe the hype. It's VERY expensive area to play and he banks won't spend that kind of money lightly. Basically unless made to by the the governing body. One of the major banks spent billions upgrading their system from the decades old mainframe system to one now capable of real time payments</p>
<p>most, if not all, banks have 24/7 monitoring and system support. So, there's always someone around for approvals, support and job monitoring. So staff availability is NOT why. And we don't whore your money over the weekends for profit :/</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer!</p>
<p>I'm still not convinced on the business case for NPP, or how much the Australian public really cares about it. It's a nice to have sure, but how many would opt in if the industry decided to slap 2% on every transfer. Do people REALLY care about getting money in 6 seconds instead of a few days?</p>
<p>I understand that this is just the start and the real benefits will be seen in further overlay services for the public and industry intra-bank functionalities but who knows how long those will take to come into play.</p>
<p>Whilst the existing methods may be shit and incredibly dated for 2017 the reality is the batch system does a job and does it reasonably well to the point where if it weren't for the regulators which bank would have the appetite for putting up the huge funds to change it. </p>
<p>One thing people need to understand as well is its not just about a computer program or technological infrastructure. There's a huge amount of business processes wrapped around it that need changing as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Change is certainly long overdue, and given the amount of time it took for this overhaul I think they are trying to future proof it, knowing it will be a LONG LONG time before it will be done again. If ever. </p>
<p>The banks have been given quite a few years to plan and execute the various stages. Biggest benefit will be to business. </p>
<p>People LOVE getting money quickly. I love being able to transfer money to friends in real time when a restaurant won't split bills and we don't have the cash on us. And not having to wait 3 days if people transfer you money on weekends. It's brilliant in that respect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I was reading a lot of other answers and was hoping someone would actually bring up mainframes. I was a student in the very last mainframe course my college offered and it was the only course I did well in lol. </p></div>		</li>
