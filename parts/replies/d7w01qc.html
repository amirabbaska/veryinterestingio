			<p>This is a great point! The point of a battery is to shift energy produced at one time and location to another time or location.<br><br>If you need the heat only at night, charging the battery during the day may make sense, but if you just want heat in the room, working out on the bike will do it just as efficiently and for lower cost.<br><br>All the energy that goes into cycling gets turned into heat directly through friction on the trainer or exercise machine.<br><br>If the room is getting too cold and you don't have a larger source of energy than your exercise, you need to upgrade your insulation -- work on keeping heat from leaving if you can't produce more heat directly.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; All the energy that goes into cycling gets turned into heat directly through friction on the trainer or exercise machine.<br><br>Only about 20% of the energy that goes into cycling is even making it to moving your legs... but in this case, that 80% &quot;waste heat&quot; is actually useful.  The 100 watts or so you might capture with a generator is peanuts compared to the 400 watts or so of waste heat you'll be putting out while making 100 watts at the pedals.  Cycling doesn't usually measure this part of it, because your <em>output</em> is all that matters for making the bike go fast-- but if what you want is heat, there's far more of it coming off of you from just doing the work than there is as a result of the work.</p>		</li>

			<p>Heat gain/loss calculations for a room or building deal with square footage, insulation, infiltration and fenestration. Those are the variables. This means, to minimize heat loss, you can use any combination of decreasing square footage, eliminating drafts (infiltration), increasing insulation and minimizing Windows/doors ( fenestration).</p>		</li>

			<p>Yep. I will typically average about 250W 'useful' energy on a wind trainer (indoor bike setup). At an optimistic 25% efficiency that's a heat output of 1000W. So it's roughly equal to a 1kW space heater. Smells more though, and it's noisier too.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ventilation is wise and highly recommended, unfortunately many families run their fossil fuel heaters without any ventilation. In my case growing up we had enough wind coming in through the gaps in the structure of the house that it wasn't a big deal, but if you run a fuel heater in a newer house overnight you're gonna have a bad time. </p>		</li>

			<p>I would recommend a heavy comforter. Sleeping bags don't breathe, and reflect heat like a plastic bag instead of holding it like air pockets do. The comfortable temperature range is narrow, and you can't scrunch up more blanket if your legs are hot but your feet are cold.<br><br>If you're set on a sleeping bag, get a big fluffy one. I slept in a lightweight touring bag a while, and if I zipped it up and the temperature didn't keep dropping, I'd wake up a couple hours later in a pool of sweat, even with a moisture-wicking liner. It's hard to fix short of opening the bag like a blanket, but in winter it's too cold for that.</p>		</li>

			<p>Also, you could open your curtains during the day.  Sunlight is about 1000 Watt per square meter.   <br>You have to multiply it by the cosine of the angle between the light rays and the normal of the window. (Look straight out of the window, and then to the sun. Take the cosine of the angle between those directions)<br>Then you still have about 10% loss of fresnel reflections.<br><br>But on average let's say about 500 Watt of sunlight enters your room for every square meter of window. As long as you don't reflect all the light back outside with a mirror, it will be converted to heat.<br><br><br><br>(Also, if you live in a well isolated house and you have nice big windows to get lots of light, you will need some serious airconditioning in the summer.  Lots of people here don't take in account that all the sunlight that enters their houses is converted into heat.   They complain about the temperatures in the summer, but they have several square meter of windows facing south and no sunshades. That's easily 1000-2000 Watt of heat generated troughout the day in an isolated house.  And where I live, airconditioning isn't really a thing.)</p>		</li>

			<p>I've never fully understood the curtain logic; the curtains themselves are inside the room, albeit creating a partition of sorts around the window. Dark coloured curtains may in fact be counter productive as they could actually reduce the total level of heat reflected back out the window. It would be interesting to see some controlled tests on this. <br><br>Some warmer Mediterranean countries make use of external shutters for this purpose, keeping the heat entirely outside. </p>		</li>

			<p>This why most curtains designed for thermal purposes have white backing, if it is sunny outside, the white layer will reflect much of the energy outside. <br><br>Also houses with eves will keep the sun off the windows when the sun is high, but in winter, when the sun angle is low, sun can shine in the windows.</p>		</li>

			<p>The curtains are close enough to the window that a lot of the energy would be reflected and radiated back outside.  Even with black curtains, you'll still see this effect.<br><br>The space between the curtain and the window will heat up, but if the curtains are of a good insulating material, little of that energy would pass through them.</p>		</li>
