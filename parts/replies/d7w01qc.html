			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great point! The point of a battery is to shift energy produced at one time and location to another time or location.</p>
<p>If you need the heat only at night, charging the battery during the day may make sense, but if you just want heat in the room, working out on the bike will do it just as efficiently and for lower cost.</p>
<p>All the energy that goes into cycling gets turned into heat directly through friction on the trainer or exercise machine.</p>
<p>If the room is getting too cold and you don't have a larger source of energy than your exercise, you need to upgrade your insulation -- work on keeping heat from leaving if you can't produce more heat directly.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Only about 20% of the energy that goes into cycling is even making it to moving your legs... but in this case, that 80% &quot;waste heat&quot; is actually useful.  The 100 watts or so you might capture with a generator is peanuts compared to the 400 watts or so of waste heat you'll be putting out while making 100 watts at the pedals.  Cycling doesn't usually measure this part of it, because your <em>output</em> is all that matters for making the bike go fast-- but if what you want is heat, there's far more of it coming off of you from just doing the work than there is as a result of the work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a straight comparison, propane is going to win.</p>
<p>But there's a lot of complicating factors.  For example... you have to exercise to be healthy anyway.  If the choice is between &quot;exercising and burning propane&quot; vs. &quot;just exercising,&quot; doing the workout in a way that also heats the house beats the alternative.</p>
<p>This is similar to how biking to work saves me time even though it takes longer than driving.  It takes less time than driving and then later <em>also</em> doing a workout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, you could open your curtains during the day.  Sunlight is about 1000 Watt per square meter.<br />
You have to multiply it by the cosine of the angle between the light rays and the normal of the window. (Look straight out of the window, and then to the sun. Take the cosine of the angle between those directions)
Then you still have about 10% loss of fresnel reflections.</p>
<p>But on average let's say about 500 Watt of sunlight enters your room for every square meter of window. As long as you don't reflect all the light back outside with a mirror, it will be converted to heat.</p>
<p>(Also, if you live in a well isolated house and you have nice big windows to get lots of light, you will need some serious airconditioning in the summer.  Lots of people here don't take in account that all the sunlight that enters their houses is converted into heat.   They complain about the temperatures in the summer, but they have several square meter of windows facing south and no sunshades. That's easily 1000-2000 Watt of heat generated troughout the day in an isolated house.  And where I live, airconditioning isn't really a thing.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you take it into account, there's some interesting design features you can use.</p>
<p><a href="http://vermontpassive.com/sites/default/files/images/solar-overhang.png" target="_blank">For example, you design the overhang of your roof so it shades the windows in the summer, but lets in direct sunlight in the winter when the sun is lower in the sky.</a>  That way, your house is heated by the sun in the winter, without being a solar oven in the summer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never fully understood the curtain logic; the curtains themselves are inside the room, albeit creating a partition of sorts around the window. Dark coloured curtains may in fact be counter productive as they could actually reduce the total level of heat reflected back out the window. It would be interesting to see some controlled tests on this. </p>
<p>Some warmer Mediterranean countries make use of external shutters for this purpose, keeping the heat entirely outside. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This why most curtains designed for thermal purposes have white backing, if it is sunny outside, the white layer will reflect much of the energy outside. </p>
<p>Also houses with eves will keep the sun off the windows when the sun is high, but in winter, when the sun angle is low, sun can shine in the windows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The curtains are close enough to the window that a lot of the energy would be reflected and radiated back outside.  Even with black curtains, you'll still see this effect.</p>
<p>The space between the curtain and the window will heat up, but if the curtains are of a good insulating material, little of that energy would pass through them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Less effective than light-colored curtains, but still more effective than nothing.  And easier to install-- you get both the radiative blocking and an increase in window r-value from something that even an apartment renter with no handyman skill can install quickly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>1000 Watt per square meter.</p>

<p>This number represents an ideal value. Actual potential insolation is highly variable and dependent on a number of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>latitude</li>
<li>elevation</li>
<li>Earth's distance from the sun</li>
<li>atmospheric conditions</li>
<li>time of year</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the contiguous 48 states, best case in the desert southwest at the peak of summer is 550-650 W/m^2. Worst case in the Pacific Northwest and around the Great Lakes in the dead of winter: upper limit of 200 W/m^2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 1000 W is with the sun at the zenit.</p>
<p>The point still stands  that it's a surprising amount of energy.<br />
In the case of your winter case of 200W/m², the rays will be quite perpendicular to the ground so they will enter windows very well.   Certainly that the average suburban house has multiple square meter of windows. </p></div>		</li>
