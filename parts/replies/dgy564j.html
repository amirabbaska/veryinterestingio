			<div class="markdown"><p>This works but not because they jump straight up, if that were the case then slapping down onto the table would be just as effective. No, it works because flies go forwards when they take off, not up. The best method is actually to get a hand in front and a hand behind the fly and then clap them together. You'll get the fly every time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its all in the set up. Next time you see a fly on an open flat surface, try it. Slowly put one hand about a foot in front, and one a foot behind, then clap your hands together keeping them on the surface. I guarantee you'll get the fly if it doesn't fly off before you start the clap. As you get better you can do it in tighter and tighter spaces. </p></div>		</li>
