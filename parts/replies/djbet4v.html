			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah chronic hyperventilation. My trick to manage it is to consciously breathe out for a few counts longer than my in breath for a couple of minutes. Alternatively take a breath in and then say OM or hum continuously until you cannot any more without taking another breath. This helps to calm my anxiety or whatever has set it off and resets my breathing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I thought it was something serious too but the Dr brushed it off and an ECG showed no issues so I took to the internet. I started to do the hum or Om after going to a lecture on something completely unrelated and learning about music therapy for helping people with quadriplegia to strengthen and control their breathing. I tried it and it seems to work well. </p>
<p>If you suffer from anxiety I can recommend (keeping in mind I am not a Dr and you should totally seek help if you are severely affected) taking 5 minutes a day to just sit and breathe, some kind of meditation. Taking a break from sugar and processed foods also helped alleviate my anxiety immensely. Check out Whole30 if you're interested in trying something like that, relief from anxiety was a huge and unexpected benefit of doing it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See my reply to Quazarman above.  I have no tips other than what I have posted here, I literally just try to empty my lungs before taking another breath in. Using humming or saying Om helps, in my experience, to focus my mind on something other than breathing. With regards to my anxiety I have found that regulating my sugar and processed foods intake helps immensely. Whether this will work for anyone else I have legit no clue but I hope you find what works for you. </p>
<p>Big thing to remember is that it's something that can be overcome with practice and recognising it for what it is robs it of some of its power to scare. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I felt like I was crazy for having that happen randomly. It normally is when I'm extra anxious about something</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that sounds weirdly appropriate. I havent been able to complete a yawn for over a decade, with absolutely no idea why. It's incredibly frustrating and basically means i spent large parts of every day mildly wishing to yawn. Plus side it has basically cured me of the yawn reflex when its discussed or seen. </p>
<p>But i do have plenty of anxiety problems and that might explain it. Does nothing for the fact the inability to yawn is both a long term irritant/source of anxiety however :p. But thanks for potentially explaining why i havent been able to in so long</p></div>		</li>
