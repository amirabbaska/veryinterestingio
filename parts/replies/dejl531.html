			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't know it was test based. In Finland we have tests, but then in the end there is 1 big test which tells the score. And that's when the little tests don't matter at all.</p>
<p>I'm getting (in HS) every test number of 10,10- or 9.5 Which in scale all means A in USA. In every subject, but do you have any tests other than the &quot;small&quot; tests you do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your cumulative grade in a class in the American high school system is based on a variety of assignments that depends on each independent class and are given weights. Usual categories include: quizzes, homework, laboratory (for empirical sciences), projects, tests, final exams, state mandated standardized tests. That cumulative grade is what's used to calculated GPA, but then we get into weights. Sometimes, schools add points to AP or honors classes to account for rigor. But whether or not they do depends on the University you apply to. So your GPA depends on who's considering it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We (unlike most of Europe) have separated those &quot;big&quot; test scores (like the GCSEs in Great Britain, I THINK) and grades in classes. So you take math and English and what have you and get a grade in each of those. You take final exams in each of those individual subjects every year, which are a substantial (maybe 30%-60%) of the final grade. All of those grades become your GPA.</p>
<p>We also have two main &quot;big&quot; tests, the SAT and ACT. Just about every college wants at least one of those two. Those are graded comparatively, so your score is compared to everyone else's and then you get a number. (The SAT is out of 1600 now, and the ACT is out of 36.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like that's not entirely fair. It seems unfair to the kid who picks himself up towards the end of the year, or the kid who has problems at home and forgets to do his homework but does really well on tests.</p>
<p>I don't know, but I personally would've been fucked in America. I have ADHD, which was undiagnosed back then. I never did my homework, I never said anything in class, my tests were full of doodles instead of answers. I got E's and F's throughout each year, and then went and got A's and B's on all my finals because I was always picking up on what was being said. I just couldn't concentrate for an entire school day, plus homework. I would probably just pass my GPA as the A's and B's would cancel out the E's and F's, but count only my finals and you'd get an entirely different picture of me, which is more accurate of what I know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did they go back to the 1600 pt. system? When I took it in 2007 they had just integrated an 800 pt. &quot;essay/writing&quot; component which changed the overall to x/2400 pts. It was new enough then that most universities didn't really weigh in the new scoring system though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read his last sentence and read my comment.  if he had a class that had a midterm that he got 89% on and a final he got 100% on, he'd get an A in that class because the average of the two tests was greater than 90 percent even though one test was below 90 percent.  Looks like you didn't get the A in reading.</p></div>		</li>
