			<div class="markdown"><p>In large part yes, they are tracked by NORAD for sure and likely whatever Russian and Chinese agencies fill that function. </p>
<p>The public can track them as well because there is essentially nowhere to hide them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. No point in hiding them; any knowledgeable amateur astronomer with a hobby telescope could track them easily. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. They can't hide that it's there, but they can hide what it does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, but there has been at least one secret stealth satelite. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prowler_(satellite\)" target="_blank">Prowler</a> was launched in 1990; since a rocket launch itself cannot be hidden, it was put as a secret second satellite on a military space shuttle launch. It apparently used radar and optical stealth features (details yet unknown), then in 1998 it became visible (probably it ran out of fuel and started to tumble), so it was spotted by amateur astronomers as a new unknown object. Around 2010 people were able to put the pieces together and realize that was launched by that space shuttle mission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely. They just don't release what they actually do with the satellite you can easily track with a telescope won at a Dave &amp; Busters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if we just consider the volume of space at orbital altitudes, space is so big compared to the size of satellites that I didn't figure there was much of a chance a collision would ever happen. But I also didn't think they would leave it to chance. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
