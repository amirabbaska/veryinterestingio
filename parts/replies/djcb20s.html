			<div class="markdown"><p>Two things: firstly, water consumption is highly variable person to person and by circumstance. Someone living outdoors in a hot climate might need 4-8 litres per day consumed over 10-20 different instances, or even more if they're very active. Someone living in a climate controlled environment who eats lots of fresh foods and isn't physically active might need less than a litre, possibly taken in a single instance. So there really isn't really a precedent for humans needing to drink water multiple times per day, though that's probably typical on average.</p>
<p>Secondly, I guess it depends on what we define as &quot;human&quot;. If you mean <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em>, then probably always. If you include earlier Homo or even Australopithecus ancestors, then it's hard to say - but multiple drinking episodes during the day were still probably typical if access to water was good. I think looking at the habits of our closest ancestors that are omnivorous might be very helpful (i.e. <em>Pan sp.</em>: bonobos, chimpanzees). It's not a topic I'm very familiar with, so I can't comment more on this.</p></div>		</li>
