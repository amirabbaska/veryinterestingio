			<div class="markdown"><p>Also if the Ethiopian lake is in a cooler area (such as higher altitude) and/or with moister air, evaporation will be lower.  Lake Nasser is a lake in a hot sandy desert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it doesnt raise the level of the river, no, because the lake is higher volume to surface area reservoir that slows evaporation for the volume it contains. At any steep sided container, as you add depth your surface area only slightly increases while your volume very quickly increases, so you have more water being contained per exposed surface area, slowing the overall rate of evaporation. Also, the deeper the water gets the longer it takes to heat it to the point of evaporation as there's more thermal mass per area exposed the the heating element (the sun), slowing warming of the water and further slowing evaporation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which doesn't increase flow rate though which is what the claim is.  As per your own explanation as well evaporation up stream for Egypt would increase as a result of the new lake and thus the expectation would be flow to decrease due to lower supply.</p>
<p>Also it would only help decrease total evaporation if it were replacing Lake Nassar on Egypt side, which it is not.  Egypt still needs that lake for their Aswan Dam it feeds.</p>
<p>So there's really no way it's increasing either flow or decreasing evaporation.  Unless they are cutting off flow from river to other locations.</p></div>		</li>
