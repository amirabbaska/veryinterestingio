<p>Unless OP states otherwise, assume no knowledge beyond a typical secondary education program. Avoid unexplained technical terms. Don't condescend; &quot;like I'm five&quot; is a figure of speech meaning &quot;keep it clear and simple.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get my milk from High Lawn Farm. </p>
<p>About three years back they started really overfilling the jugs, which did great things for the freshness, but the amount of dried milk on the threads meant you had to open it over a sink to catch all the flakes, and then wipe it clean.</p>
<p>They have gotten progressively better at filling over the last three years. Nowadays it is full to the brim, with rarely any milk crust. </p>
<p>I always tip my milk glass to an imagined perfectionist at their plant who has worked on tuning the filling process for years.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Chocolate milk is full-fat, and very good flavor as well. yummmm.</p></div>		</li>
