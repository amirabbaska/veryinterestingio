			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it was discovered last year that a type of worm called the wax worm (the larvae of the wax moth) has the ability to break down polyethylene (PE). PE accounts for around 40&#37; of global plastics. </p>
<p>PE is largely non-degradable, but there have been a couple of previous instances where particular bacteria or fungi have been able to break it down at <em>very, very</em> slow rates. This latest discovery of the wax worm, however, showed faster rates of breakdown (although still slow). The researchers left 100 wax worms on a PE plastic bag for 12 hours and measured a 92 milligram breakdown of the plastic (about 3&#37; of the plastic bag).</p>
<p>These rates are of course very slow, and at a tiny scale. I don't think the plan would ever be to scale-up the use of wax worms for plastic degradation (we'd need an incredible number of them), but this discovery could be very useful in allowing us to identify a particular enzyme which breaks down plastics. The authors suggest that wax worms break down the carbon-carbon bonds in PE either from the organism itself, or from the generation of a particular enzyme from its flora. If it's the latter then there is potential that we could industrially produce this enzyme at scale, and use it for this purpose.</p>
<p>If you're interested, here is the scientific paper of this discovery: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217302312" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217302312" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217302312</a></a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Or just produce bacteria that make the enzyme, purifying the enzyme might be completely unnecessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been reading up on the waxworm trying to find an answer, but I can't. <a href="https://medium.economist.com/plastic-eating-caterpillars-could-save-the-planet-580074eb9a30" target="_blank">This article</a> by The Economist says that whether or not they gain nutrition from plastic hasn't been determined.</p>
<p>While that may seem disappointing, we must remember:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea isn't to release millions of worms for a feeding frenzy at a dump. [...] The best scenario, she says, would be to isolate the molecule responsible and &quot;produce it in large scale in a lab in vitro, and then distribute the molecule in large scale.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not. Polyolefins might be fragmented but not totally. In addition, the amounts of plastics which can be fragmented per worm are very small. And plastic is not the preferable food. They do not live in the sea and hence cannot solve marine plastic litter pollution. </p></div>		</li>
