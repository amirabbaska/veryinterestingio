			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a vehicle like that. My understanding is that the transfer case uses a clutch and in the Auto position will put a small preload on the front axle.   Once the computer sees enough difference between front and rear driveshafts it will snap that clutch instantly making a 50/50 split.</p>
<p>I hate it and  try to avoid using it.  When it cuts in if I'm turning or something I feel that it upsets the control of the vehicle.  And especially in icy conditions surprises aren't helpful.</p>
<p>It does work good if you're in city traffic with snow and ice on the ground going pretty much straight down the road in stop and go with varying road conditions as you go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like AWD TBH. My old (automatic) impreza was a 90/10 split always. When the computer detected slippage it engaged the center diff to a 40/60 torque split.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No that's wrong. its a variable system with a chain in the transfer case. There is a dash readout of the amount of power split between the front and rear axle. I like it here in MT when the road is interment ice and clear pavement.</p></div>		</li>

<p>so at all times 1 front and 1 rear wheel have to rotate at the same speed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not believe this is 100% correct. I do believe it is the average speed of the two front wheels that must equal the average speed of the two back wheels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is much closer to the truth - generally what separates an AWD vehicle from a 4WD vehicle is the ability to make this happen, i.e. having a <em>locking</em> centre differential.</p>
<p>It is important to have a centre diff in both vehicles because this greatly improves the turning circle by reducing wind-up - where wheels are trying to turn in opposite directions relative to each other. 4WDs have a locking centre diff so that power can be transferred to the front and back equally at the cost of worse turning circle (which matters less on dirt because the wheels can slip) and but with increased traction because you don’t end up with a wheel that’s in the air spinning while all the ones in the ground have no power going to them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually I'm pretty sure all AWD and 4wd systems have a locking/lockable centre diff, otherwise it would only spin the rear axle OR the front axle. Because you still have 2 more diffs, each wheel can still spin at its own rate but depending on the state of the centre diff you can have torque delivered to both the front and the rear axle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think sum is a better word than average here. The sum of the front wheels speed must be equal to the sum of the rear wheels speed. E.g. 30+29 = 31+28.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also viscous and clutch based AWD.  Where one end is powered ask the time and the other receives power as required. </p>
<p>Nissan Atessa and VW haldex use this.</p></div>		</li>
