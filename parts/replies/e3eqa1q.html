			<div class="markdown"><p>There's about 300 types of varieties of peaches just in the US.</p>
<p>Clingstone and Freestone aren't a variety, they're a type.  Different varieties will go for different prices so you can't really say that clingstone would be cheaper.  If a store sells different varieties, they normally identify them by that, not by &quot;Freestone&quot; or &quot;Cling&quot;.   Otherwise they're just sold as &quot;Peaches&quot; and it's dealer's choice.</p>
<p>Here's a quick list of different varieties, that identifies which are cling and which are freestone.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was raised by old people. :-D... so there was regular sessions of canning, preserving, and pickling growing up.  I learned that one a long time ago.    I still do a fair bit every year as the kids enjoy getting involved.</p>
<p>I still don't know why wax sealing has survived when sealable lids are around though.</p></div>		</li>
