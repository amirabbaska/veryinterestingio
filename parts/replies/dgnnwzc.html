			<div class="markdown"><p>So many ways to kill you. Die from o.d.ing. Novices are at highest risk. They're in the learning phase. College students will slam drinks (not that adults won't) and they pass out. They vomit and aspirate it into their lungs. They start having seizures, multiple seizures. No intervention? They die. Withdrawal is also potentially lethal. Aspirin killed more people this last year, than cannabis has for the entire hx. of mankind. My M.D. recommend,berated, and cajoled that I not smoke . No Doc., will recommend smoking anything. He suggested vaporizing or medibles.</p></div>		</li>
