			<p>The problem is that there are lots of people willing to buy mods, and they aren't against buying mods.<br><br>The problem a lot of people have is with the money split.<br><br>The modder gets 25% and Valve/Producers get the other 75%. So if you want to make $0.50 after taxes per download, you have to charge $3 for each thing instead of charging $0.75.<br><br>Imagine if you built birdhouses and sold them for $5 a house, and then Home Depot took $4, not including the money you spent to get the tools and materials.</p>		</li>

			<p>On your first point I have to say, that's life. If more people than not are willing to pay then the minority doesn't get what it wants and that's just democracy in action. That might not sit well with many but really, that's how it works.<br><br>That being said, the community in general could suffer which in the end plays into the hands of those who want them for free because things will once again change but that is a longer path to get what they want.<br><br>I can't say I want to pay for mods, but if I am one of the 1%ers who want sit for free while others pay, then I just have to accept it.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not saying you shouldn't pay for mods. I'm all for it. Having the creator get paid leads to better quality content, look at youtube before and after monetization.<br><br>I'm saying that the creator's cut should be larger so that they can actually continue to do this. If they are still confined to doing this in their off time because they are only making a few bucks, then there is no increase in quality.<br><br>If suddenly you have guys that are essentially making all new games (kind of like minecraft being used as a platform) and able to make a decent amount of money, then everyone wins.<br><br>I'm not against monetization. I just think that Valve and the Producers can't be taking 75% for a product that they had little hand in actually making.</p>		</li>

			<p>But at the same time, why go to home depot and have them take the money when instead you could go to a similarly large place (Elder Scrolls Nexus) give it away for free, get other stuff for free and ask for donations.<br><br>Home Depot has upkeep costs, but at the same time you need to be able to charge the customer a reasonable price for your birdhouse and still make enough money to keep building them.<br><br>If you have to charge $30/birdhouse so you can still buy materials to build them and maintain your tools, then the number of people who are willing to buy them is significantly less than if Home Depot took a smaller slice.</p>		</li>
