			<div class="markdown"><p>That number is too high, oxygen can cause pulmonary damage at lower partial pressures too. 1.6 atmospheres is merely where the damage goes from being mainly pulmonary to being mainly cerebral.</p>
<p>The limit for pulmonary damage is about 0.5 atmospheres.</p>

<p>That still implies we would be fine with up to 50% oxygen in the air, correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a sport diver I can only support that. Thats why even with unlimited air supply there is a maximum depth possible. But to eventually widen the depth range you can use another air mixes e.g. with helium mixed in and reduced oxygen and nitrogen (which gives a frenzy at higher pressure, possibly forcing you to go deeper and die in the endless depths)</p></div>		</li>
