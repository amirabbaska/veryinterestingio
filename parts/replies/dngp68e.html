			<div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed when this happens to me I'm more likely to experience sleep paralysis or those scary loud noises your brain produces when between sleep and slight waking state. It's no fun with the sleep paralysis part (or loud noises for that matter), but hey maybe with more practice I'll get better with getting out of the sleep paralysis part. I actually learned from a movie when I was a kid (some movie with some teens on a boat and it gets into a storm, then ends up in a courtroom- can't find it right now because I'm about to go to sleep) that the trick to getting out of a sleep paralysis dream state is to yell in your head <em>one</em>two*THREE - Screaming 3 and it's worked quite a few times. </p></div>		</li>
