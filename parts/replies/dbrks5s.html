			<div class="markdown"><p>This basically says &quot;we don't know&quot;. When the barometric pressure changes it effectively changes the weight of the air around you. In an area that's been damaged that changing weight affects areas of your body that have been thru trauma more than healthy tissue IMO.
*source I've been a massage therapist for thirty years. After meeting thousands of people who said this was a problem and seeing/feeling the swelling with my long term clients depending on the weather... I have little doubt that it's a real phenomenon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also the least helpful of answers, it does not confirm or deny the plausibility. Unfortunately, after reading many scientific papers, &quot;we don't know, but give us fundings to do a bigger study&quot; seems to be the default conclusion to a huge percentage of the papers, no matter the subject.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a bunch of metal in my back. My college roommate had JRA. One afternoon during a departmental seminar I began squirming big time as I started becoming unusually uncomfortable. I found myself watching the clock counting down to when I could leave, so I know this started around 4:15. At dinner time my roommate came out with her hands wrapped. She said she'd been fine when her 4pm class started but by the middle of the lecture could no longer take notes. </p>
<p>There was no obvious change in the weather, neither of us was prone to abrupt onset of flare ups, and we'd never noticed a correlation between our aches and pains. But this one lined up practically to the minute. </p>
<p>After this it became handy to use each other as a reality check. We didn't always have problems at the same time but it was pretty common for our bad days to line up. And it was nice to be able to confirm that it was real pain, and not a subconscious ploy to avoid working on a term paper or final. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well they also seem to be saying that some patients report pain more with changes in weather. Although they probably didn't test it, they may be implying an effect of weather on some people's state of mind, which would lead to them complaining more. For example: person has old injury, gets in a bad mood because of shitty weather, whines about old injury and therefore feels worse</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are times when people experience pain when they have no idea of what the weather is though. I have a knee (a couple of bad falls in my 20s)  that it's not pain but pressure like a fluid build-up before big storms. It can be sunny out but can have the pressure the day before a big storm. Yesterday when I woke up, I had no idea of what the weather was, but I knew my knee hurt. It rained and then today there was snow. Knee is fine now. </p></div>		</li>
