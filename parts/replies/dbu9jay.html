			<div class="markdown"><p>It was totally unintentional. Yesterday I came back home from a long day and found a letter from the post and (I probably should of elaborated on 'dark') it was light enough that I could open the letter but dark at the same time and because I wasn't bothered to turn the light on just yet, so I opened the envelope to find this cool effect.</p></div>		</li>
