			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're really trying to ask is what does bulk nuclear matter look like?  You wouldn't see any nuclear matter on a cooled neutron star because the surface is made up of ordinary atomic iron and other elements with a few micrometres of atmosphere on top.  You may or may not be able to see through the atmosphere, but if you waited long enough the star would cool to the point where the atmosphere snows out, and if you scraped away the snow the surface might look like rusted iron, or it may be composed of strata of lighter elements with the iron having sunk deeper down, there are a lot of unknowns.</p>
<p>As for what the nuclear matter would look like if you could somehow peer into it, that's a big unknown too.  It probably wouldn't have a colour since all visible photons would be at a similar energy scale relative to nuclear matter and would have a similar strength of interaction with it, so it's appearance will probably be somewhere along the lines of transparent, metallic or black.</p></div>		</li>
