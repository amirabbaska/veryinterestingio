			<div class="markdown"><p>I wear glasses pretty much 24/7 but I can read clearly without them (assuming we're talking about a book or computer screen in front of me). I don't think glasses would make a difference unless you specifically need them for short distance viewing.</p>
<p>For me personally the only time I zone out and don't process the information I've read is when there are external distractions (tv, people talking, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had 20/15 vision my whole life, but I would always get really tired and distracted while reading, so I never read. Went all of high school and most of college without ever picking up a text book. </p>
<p>I went to the eye doctor for the first time at 25 with my girlfriend and thought it might be interesting to get my eyes checked. I found out that, while my vision is still clear, the muscles in my eyes are slightly misaligned and have to strain to align my eyes when I focus on something, leading to eye fatigue. I got a pair of glasses to wear when I work and I've been able to read and focus for hours for the first time in my life. I'm not sure how common this is, but it's amazing how something so subtle has such a huge impact. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes an enormous difference. I have corrective lenses with prisms and while my visual acuity is stopped changing (in my 40s now) the alignment continues to drift.  So I recently updated my lenses and boom. Eye fatigue gone.  Also, even the slightest tension of glasses pressing against your temples will cause low grade, continuous eye strain all day long. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly what happened to me. I was told I had night blindness when I went to Pearl Vision. Three years later, went to a local eye doctor just to update my frames and make sure my (very minor) prescription hadn't changed. I mentioned the &quot;night blindness&quot;, he laughed and said that wasn't a real condition. He asked if I had a hard time parking my car or if other cars see to come very close to my lane a lot. I said &quot;I get honked at a lot&quot;. He immediately started to do that test. My new glasses have a prism and blue light blocker. It's made a huge difference. I never realized how much strain I was putting on my eyes until I put on the new glasses. Looking around feels effortless and I almost never get migraines or head aches now. I still have a hard time concentrating and understanding what I'm reading but that is due to my Narcolepsy. This vision thing has actually come up a lot recently in Narcolepsy support groups. A lot of people w N are starting to notice their vision gets burry when they start to get tired or right before a sleep attack. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What's fascinating is there's even more to it than just clarity at play. Our eyes need to exert effort to focus on things closer; the nearer, the more effort it takes. Focusing closer also signals our eyes to turn inwards (so as to prevent double vision). For some people, this focusing-turning in &quot;ratio&quot; is stronger or weaker than usual, and may therefore experience more strain than usual trying to read up close. As their visual system gets tired after hours and hours of studying (for example), their eyes may struggle to keep the letters both clear and single (i.e. preventing blur vs. preventing double vision). This may occur subconsciously but just be perceived as a headache or eyestrain. All of this can contribute to reduced reading ability.</p>
<p>Of course, that's without even touching faulty eye movements, wherein a person's eyes don't track along a line of text properly - think instead of a jogger running smoothly, he drops his wallet and has to backtrack every few steps to pick it up again. Again, more effort spent on just receiving the visual information, less effort available to actually perceive and interpret it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have near normal vision, but reading with and without glasses is quite the difference. When turning away from the text after reading without glasses I tend to cross-eye for a few seconds (1~3 maybe), with glasses it doesn't happen at all. I think that's part of the inwards focus you described.</p>
<p>It might just be my eye muscle being loose though. I can turn my eyes outwards into different directions at will.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is there a name for that? Or a fix for it other than blocking off text above and below a line?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment has <a href="http://imgur.com/scWlzqG" target="_blank">received a lot of reports</a>.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/about/rules#" target="_blank">Rule #3</a> requires that responses to the Post/OP (called 'top-level comments') be explanations.  </p>
<p>I'm not going to remove this one.  It includes just enough explanation of working memory that I can do the gymnastics I need to to give it a pass.  </p>
<p>It has spurred some good responses so that gives it an extra push over that line.</p>
<p>I could be overruled on this, but for now I am letting this one go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THIS. I got poor grades in college partly due to the fact that I needed prescription glasses but didn't have them. When I got them I realised the reason for my lack of focus - my mental resources were employed almost entirely just trying to decode the slightly blurry retinal image into comprehensible terms.</p></div>		</li>
