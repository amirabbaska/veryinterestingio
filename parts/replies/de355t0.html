			<div class="markdown"><p>Tidally locked planets can indeed have warm atmospheres. The way the atmosphere distributes the heat depends on a number of factors, including the presence or absence of oceans, the optical thickness of the atmosphere, the planet's rotation rate (equal to its orbital period), and the overall intensity of the radiation reaching the planet. So far, our study of such systems is mostly limited to computer models, and the results that you get can vary somewhat depending on how your model is constructed. Atmospheres are rather complex systems (especially when coupled to a hydrosphere) and we don't yet have a lot of empirical data to compare the models to.</p>
<p>Venus is an example of a planet that is nearly tidally locked (we expect that there will be exoplanets which are in the process of becoming tidally locked to their star), as its day is actually longer than its year. It has an extraordinarily thick atmosphere which creates a very even, if scorchingly hot, temperature across the planet. It's an extreme example, but it shows that in an optically thick (i.e., atmosphere very opaque to visible and infrared) case, the heat can be evenly distributed. However, even without such a crushingly heavy atmosphere, <a href="http://newatlas.com/tidally-locked-exoplanets-potentially-habitable/39407/" target="_blank">models suggest that slowly-rotating exoplanets may be able to distribute heat efficiently</a> and thus maintain habitability.</p>
<p>In general, you'll see air on the dayside get heated and rise and then flow in currents (generally east-west rather than north-south) to the nightside, where it cools and then is blown back toward the dayside at lower altitude. The dayside is also expected to see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.5117.pdf" target="_blank">more net evaporation, while the nightside sees more net precipitation</a>, but if temperatures are warm enough to maintain a liquid ocean, this is not a problem as ocean currents will recirculate the water toward the dayside.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What's the difference between east-west and north-shout in tidally locked planet? Rotation of the planet is very slow.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd think even if they aren't warm enough to maintain a liquid ocean on the cold side of the planet, migrating glaciers would still recycle the necessary volatiles, no?</p>
<p>Do we know if planets with significant atmospheres even can become tidally locked though? I recall reading that Venus is thought to be kept just shy of tidally locked to the sun by the friction of its atmosphere on its surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glaciers are pretty slow (much slower than air currents), and it's more than possible to freeze just about all your water into a solid form, making a planet quite inhospitable for life as we know it.</p>
<p>Models do suggest that atmospheres may inhibit tidal locking. I'm not sure if that's a settled question yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may seem like a silly question, but with seven planets that close to each other, what are the chances that they are locked in a resonance with each other, giving them an effective rotation rate?  Or does having that many planets so close together make a resonance less likely (too many tugs from too many directions and cancel each other out). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5vm1i8/trappist1_exoplanets_megathread/de3dc8l/" target="_blank">there's a good comment chain discussing the orbital resonances in this system</a>, basically it looks like they do indeed have nearly integer ratios of orbital periods.</p>
<p>More densely-packed systems are generally <em>more</em> likely to set up orbital resonance chains. They complete more orbits in the same amount of time, and over long timescales they are chaotic, but the instability of non-resonant orbits means that they will spend less time in non-resonant orbits. If you have a resonance chain, for example the 4:2:1 resonance chain of Io, Europa and Ganymede, then the resonances between Io-Europa and Europa-Ganymede serve to stabilize each other, because if for example Io slows down a bit to, say, ~3.8 orbits per orbit of Ganymede and ~1.9 orbits per orbit of Europa, then it'll have <em>two</em> bodies exerting a regular pull on it, which will pull it more quickly back into  the 4:2:1 resonance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trouble with tidally locking goes a bit deeper than that. To be tidally locked, the planet has to be pretty close to the star, and that means that it's going to get a pretty good amount of energy from the star.</p>
<p>So while the close side will be warm enough, there's two questions tied to the atmosphere. The first is the issue of convection, which you bring up, and as a rough approximation, the more atmosphere there is, the more convection is possible. The other big issue, though, is that being tidally locked may mean that the close side of the planet is more liable to lose atmosphere, and that'll thin out the atmosphere and make convection difficult.</p>
<p>I'd add to that, though, that there's been some work that has suggested that planets with atmosphere won't be fully tidally locked. What causes the tidal locking is the tidal interaction on the planet's structure, which is basically the the gravity of the star causes it to bulge towards the star, and the star tries to pull back on that bulge. This slows down the rotation, and is the same interaction that the earth had on the moon to stop the moon's rotation until it was tidally locked. There is, however, another tidal interaction that takes place for atmospheres. In this case, the heat from a star will cause the atmosphere to expand as it's heated, and the net result is that this speeds up the planet's rotation.</p>
<p>This may mean that in systems like this, planets are not fully tidally locked, and even a bit of rotation may help it maintain a convective atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, it's easier to find planets that orbit close to their stars. A planet in a 10 day orbit only needs around 20-30 days of observing to confirm it's periodic. a 10 year orbit would require 20-30 years of observing. Additionally, for transiting planets (like TRAPPIST) the planet is much more likely to transit if it's close to the star.</p>
<p>So it's easier to find planets that are close in, and those are the ones that can be tidally locked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that a planet is tidally locked should not affect satellites at all, but the proximity of the larger body itself would. The fact that these planets are close enough to get tidally locked means that most likely there does not exist an orbit around them stable enough to allow natural satellites for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Sure, it is possible to capture a small body into an orbit around one of these planets, but sooner or later it will be stripped off by the stars gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer: IANAS</p>
<p>I'd imagine any moon(s) would be locked in a geosynchronous orbit at the equator, exactly between the planet's and star's centers of mass. Essentially creating a permanent solar eclipse directly below it.</p>
<p>Which would make for a badass sci-fi setting. The umbra is too dark for photosynthesis; full daylight exposes you to flares and CMEs. But in the penumbra, life can flourish.</p>
<p>As for rings, I figure they'd either be non-existent or very, very lopsided. As in, razor-thin and practically invisible on the night side like Jupiter's; thick and radiant on the day side like Saturn's.</p></div>		</li>
