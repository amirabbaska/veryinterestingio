			<div class="markdown"><p>It always pleases me to see immunoglobulin mentioned, because I suffer from hypogammaglobulinemia; I have an IgG deficiency. This is one of the most common types of immunoglobulin deficiencies, as I understand, and there used to be (and may still be) an issue with doctors misdiagnosing the deficiency in small children, who ended up reaching normal levels on their own.</p>
<p>I have not been quite that lucky, though still extremely lucky compared to some immuno-deficients... I used to get Immunoglobulin transfusions once every three weeks as a child, but eventually got to a point where I could handle going without, as long as I was careful.</p>
<p>I still catch viruses way more easily than most adults, and they hit harder, last longer, and develop faster, but it isn't life-threatening (so far). My body is still capable of fighting infections on its own, but it struggles a lot more than it should.</p>
<p>I got a chest cold last year that lasted a month and left me terrified that I might end up with pleurisy. It was a fairly constant cough while conscious for three weeks straight. The muscle pain even after the cough went away was awful....I could hardly breathe without shooting pain, and I refuse to take narcotics. Never was an addict, but I have an irrational hatred of them anyway...the meds, not addicts.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh yeah, and also, having hypogammaglobulinemia from before you are born really messes with your development and physiology. I cannot stress how lucky I am to be as healthy as I am, and I'm still a mess compared to normal folk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My depth of the knowledge of how an immune system works really is basic plus. I understand the foundation of it pretty well, I could expand on what I said. But things like immunoglobulin differences is over my head. The fact missing only one of the major types causing such an issue is surprising to me, because having the others seems like it covers it. I mean I understand it, but I don't at the same time. </p>
<p>The immune system really is fascinating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IgG makes up the majority of our antibody defenses. Having a small deficiency in the others can lead to more specific ailments, but an IgG deficiency is more general.</p>
<p>Having 10% less IgG means significantly more than missing 10% of IgA. IgD mostly relates to antigens, and IgE to allergens. I have deficiencies in all 5, but the others are within acceptable levels.</p></div>		</li>
