<p>The media was a bit brutal in how they announced this new analysis, but it would be unfair to say that the researchers had done anything improper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I applaud your giving them the benefit of your doubt, but I think it is actually fair to say that they did several improper things and that is why they were so highly criticized.</p>
<p>Using <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=6865" target="_blank">this</a> as a reference but there are a lot of other references out there ...</p>
<p>For one thing, they took preliminary graphs and basically screenshotted them, rescaled them, and used <em>that</em> as the raw data source for their foreground dust analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At lunch, Raphael Flauger (NYU) gave a beautiful talk on foreground uncertainties related to the BICEP2 results. He built his foreground models as did the BICEP2 team by scraping data out of Keynote ™ presentations posted on the web! I have to say that again: The Planck team showed some maps of foregrounds in some Keynote presentations and posted them on the web. Flauger (and also the BICEP2 team before him) grabbed those presentations, scraped them for the all-sky maps, calibrated them using the scale bars, and worked from there. The coolest thing is that Flauger also simulated this whole process to account in his analysis for the digitization (scraping?) noise. Awesome! He concludes that the significance of the BICEP2 results is much lower than stated in the paper, which makes him (and many others) sad: He has been working on inflation models that produce large signals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally they actually ignored captions around the graph which told them what data the chart was showing, and misinterpreted it as something else entirely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, it seems they misinterpreted the Planck results: that map shows the polarization fraction for all foregrounds, not for the galactic dust only (see the “not CIB subtracted” caveat in the slide). Once you correct for that and rescale the Planck results appropriately, some experts claim that the polarized galactic dust emission can account for most of the BICEP signal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So not only did they do some really shoddy analysis, they did it on the wrong data in the first place.  It was a rather profound oversight that you would expect from a procrastinated high school research paper, not the dramatic professional confirmation of inflation and quantum gravity that they made it out to be.</p>
<p>And it's not fair to blame the media either for the upset.  The researchers themselves fed the media ridiculous propaganda -- they started the media fire by repeatedly using the language &quot;smoking gun&quot; and talking about the implications for quantum gravity and how it would prove the existence of gravitons.  Then they fanned the flames even harder when they released that viral video of the project lead going to the &quot;father of inflationary theory&quot;'s house to surprise him with the news.</p>
<p>Frankly the team was just irresponsible across the board on this one and it doesn't do any justice to blame the media or to say that they didn't do anything improper. :(</p>
<p>Edit:  So this illustrates why the peer review process is so important.  LIGO's result <del>will also need peer review, though</del> has already underwent peer review before the announcement, and as I understand it LIGO has a much better reputation when it comes to the quality and honesty of their analysis; they previously published papers about their non-detection due to noise and other factors and have been working to improve their equipment to make this latest measurement.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yikes. Wasn't the Harvard paper peer reviewed? Shouldn't peer review catch improper methods like the ones you listed?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not before they made the announcement, which was around the same time it was published <em>for</em> peer review.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Absolutely -- and it <em>did</em> in this case.  Early in the peer review process, people started pointing out all of the issues with their paper, showing how there were multiple oversights that could all lead to invalidating the paper's conclusion.  The peer review process concluded that dust scattering data sufficient to confirm or rule out the BICEP2 claim did not yet exist, and it took a few months for the Planck team to release an updated map of foreground dust interference.  The new analysis on the updated data showed clearly that the entirety of the signal could be explained by foreground interference, so at that point the paper was pretty much officially discredited.</p>
<p>But by the time all that happened it had already been months since the premature announcement.</p>
<p>In the past I have compared this to the OPERA experiment, to show the difference between the proper publishing/review process.  The OPERA experiment famously concluded that neutrinos travelled faster than light.  Rather than rushing a paper with a sensational conclusion, they spent years searching for every problem with the analysis and detector that they could find, but they found nothing.  When they published, they didn't make any sensational claims, they pretty much said exactly, &quot;It's obvious to us that this result is wrong, but we can't figure out why, and the statistical significance is very high, so we are publishing this for peer review in the hopes that you can help us figure out where the problem is.&quot;  And then a short while later it was determined during that process that there was a wiring flaw in the detector that caused the strange result, and re-analysis brought the neutrino speed back down to consistent with the speed of light.  The OPERA team actually <em>didn't</em> do anything wrong, nor did they hype their result to the media -- it was an excellent example of &quot;science done right&quot; IMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>tldr: Some scientists working with BICEP2 tried to grab all the credit for themselves by being the first to announce gravitational wave detection. In their rush, they did some very shoddy work that turned out to be wrong.</p>
<p>On a related note, I've heard some rumbling amongst LIGO team members that certain people are trying to claim undue credit for the discovery. I guess it's inevitable with such a huge team and the massive media attention.  It makes me grateful that I don't do the kind of research where I have to deal with 1000 collaborators...</p></div>		</li>
