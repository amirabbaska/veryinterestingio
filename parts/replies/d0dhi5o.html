<p>BUT Birds have larger brain size relative to body size</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There seems to be a lot of evidence that at least some birds are quite intelligent. Were there any dinosaurs that also had large brains (relative to size)?</p>
<p>I was wondering if there's any speculation about dinosaur intelligence. I know this would be difficult to determine (the extent of bird intelligence seems to have only recently discovered).</p>
<p>Did <em>any</em> dinosaurs have large brains?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some of the advanced carnivores such as <em>Troodon</em> had brain sizes that were comparable to birds'.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You read about some therapods with &quot;large&quot; brains, but &quot;large&quot; for a dinosaur means about equivalent in brain-body ratio to an opossum or not-particularly-brainy bird</p></div>		</li>
