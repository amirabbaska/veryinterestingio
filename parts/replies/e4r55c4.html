			<div class="markdown"><p>I love blue cheese it's my all time favorite cheese &amp; blue cheese dressing is delicious but so, so hard to find good varieties since most are sugar sweet garbage. I have a signature grilled wing recipe with a home made sauce that everyone loves, I had recently been thinking that making my own blue cheese sauce to go with it would be awesome but, you've successfully convinced me it's not really feasible for my situation and I just need to find a brand I love instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Making blue cheese at home is super tricky. I know some very enthusiastic home cheesemakers that have tried it, but you're better off sampling blue cheeses and experimenting. It would be very difficult to create the ideal conditions for aging blue cheese at home. Stilton and Valdeon are very strong blue cheeses, and Fourme d'Ambert and gorgonzola dolce are lovely sweeter (relatively speaking) blues. There are so many others, but those are the ones that come to mind that are readily available at a decent cheese counter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for all the info I found it all interesting and informative! With your cheese suggestions and a little tweaking I know I can still make a kick ass home made blue cheese sauce to go with it!</p></div>		</li>
