			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually would.  What type of experiments with what end goal? And once it's set up as a checkpoint, is there constant maintenance and/or improvements to the structure?  </p>
<p>Basically if he hasn't already, I would assume Trump is going to all but eliminate funding for space travel and exploration of any kind.  What would he be eliminating?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There actually isn't a plan for the ISS to be used as a checkpoint for further exploration. Most of the experiments performed study how human biology reacts to low gravity environments over long periods of time. There are lots of other experiments performed there covering pretty much every scientific subject that can only be performed in space/microgravity.
As for improvements/maintenance, there is maintenance in the form or repairs and orbit boosting (the orbit decays to to drag from the extremely thin atmosphere). There are no other major planned additions to the ISS, but I am sure there are small things here and there.</p>
<p>Trump has gone on record saying that he wants to defund NASA's Earth Science division (so no studying the Earth's oceans, atmosphere, etc) and move those funds to other US government entities like NOAA. Whether or not he'll actually do that is unknown. Trump also seems to want to further human space travel (there's rumors that he wants the Orion program to do a flyby of the Moon before the end of the administration). But honestly, who knows, it wasn't really a focal point of his campaign or his policies. Our knowledge of his actual agenda is mostly limited to, &quot;We're gonna kick space's ass!&quot; type comments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not only a Trump thing(though he'll take credit), but NASA has been planning to get away from Low Earth Orbit for a while now,  they want to leave the orbit of Earth again but can't afford to do so while also funding the ISS. </p>
<p>So what they are doing, which you'll hear Trump talk about probably, is they will now allow private organizations to mess around in LEO.   Previously, say someone wanted to experiment on how Carbon Nano-tubes(just an example) react in micro-gravity, they would have to pay for it to be done in the ISS.  </p>
<p>So allowing privatization of LEO is like allowing companies to open up for research facilities instead of limiting them to the use of government facilities.  And who knows what amazing things will be discovered when we expand the research of how things react in micro-gravity.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many experiments are conducted in the ISS to study how our body behaves when it is in micro gravity. Plus until recently they were growing vegetables to see if they can be grown (and they can indeed). Those were some that I have knowledge of but there are plenty more. </p>
<p>Actually, the ISS has to be put back in orbit once in a while due to the Earth's gravitational pull. I Would be sure that we would keep maintaining the ISS until it's technology would be obsolete to conduct experiments or we can build something better. And also, I think it is getting a new airlock in the upcoming year</p>
<p>I really do not know the situation about Trump, but from what I have heard I think he wants to go to back to the moon. </p>
<p>Please tell me if you need further clarification</p></div>		</li>

<p>if we want to send a ship to the moon we can send the ship without fuel to the ISS (International Space Station) and then send the fuel tank to refuel the spaceship. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>this is possible, but rather unlikely. rocketry and economics make it more efficient to make giant rockets that can do the job themselves. this is why none of the probes we've sent off into the void have stopped there. there's also little reason to stop at that particular part of space. an orbiting vessel is orbiting wherever you put it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well theoretically as the volume of spacecraft increases, it will become more and more economical to have a stop in orbit to either refuel or board an interstellar shuttle to get to your destination. Of course this is far far in the future, but ideally you would have some spacecraft for going to and from planet surfaces and some spacecraft for the space in between planets. Reuse is the ultimate goal for transportation of people and cargo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would actually be nearly impossible to use the ISS as a jumping off point for pretty much anything in our solar system and that was intentional. </p>
<p>The ISS is in a nearly polar orbit making it an enormous waste of energy to take off near the equator, make a 90 degree turn, get to the ISS and then take off from there making another 90 degree turn. this was done to prevent the Russians from using it to get to the moon. Planning for the station started in the 80s the cold war hadn't quite ended yet. There are other benefits to it being in a polar orbit as well but as I understand it, that was a big factor.</p>
<p>Correction 51.26 degrees which can be more or less depending on the season. Still, not ideal for getting anywhere else.</p></div>		</li>
