			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm... So, you'd have it add a ton of additional things, more methane, or tons of hydrogen, or other stuff.</p>
<p>Too bad.</p>
<p>Thanks for the answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could remove nitrogen, but not methane and make it work, but that’s really hard, even for planetary engineering. There has to be a better way.</p>
<p>Ligeia Mare, one of the great methane/ethane seas in the northern polar region is about 125,000 km^2, and 100 m deep. That’s about 7.5e15 kg of methane and ethane. There’s probably 3x that much in Kraken Mare. Titans atmospheric pressure is 1.5x Earth and it’s radius is 2575 km, with a gravity of 1.35 m/s^2. That gives an atmosphere of around 9e18 kg. So it would seem that evaporating the lakes wouldn’t be enough to increase the methane/ethane fraction. BUT, near the surface, methane concentration levels out at 4.9%. </p>
<p>Sooo, if you evaporate the lakes with nuclear fire and dump enough oxygen into the atmosphere from hydrolyzing Enceladus, you might just be able to set off a global firestorm in the lower troposphere. Obviously, this would be a Bad Idea (TM). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I boil the methane oceans and dump a gazillion tons of oxygen into the atmosphere, but I'm still stuck with the nitrogen problem and all I get is a low-level burn.</p>
<p>What if I dump an immense amount of hydroxide (OH) into the atmosphere ?  <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1070427211030372" target="_blank">Oshurko 2011</a> suggests that would get me nitrous oxide (flammable) &amp; imidogen: N2 + OH → NO + NH.</p>
<p>Imidogen is highly reactive, but, hypothetically, could the boiled methane and the nitous oxide be burned quickly enough to get a full planetary burn rather than a low-level one?</p>
<p>Looks like whatever is done Enceladus has to be broken down for raw materials...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Freezing point of nitrogen is -210C; the average temp of Titan is -179C according to my in depth analysis - these are probably at 1atm. Doesn't seem like a very big step to just freeze the Nitrogen out of the atmosphere - this is probably already happening to some extent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What about a less ambitious goal in your life? Would you like burning Jupiter instead?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, with that much effort being put into changing an atmosphere into a flammable state you may as well just eliminate the travelling part. Just do it to earth, you're already here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are. Also the surface is a mix of solid (at that temperature) hydrocarbons like benzene. It might be easier to burn that than to try to light the atmosphere. </p></div>		</li>
