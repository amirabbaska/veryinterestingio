<p>None of the authority figures either at work or school knew this so he never got in trouble for it. It was great hearing him call something bullshit when the rest of us were thinking it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Building on this, some of us have the ability to obscure or &quot;warp&quot; those phonal tics, so that people can't tell what we are saying.  The initial thought could be profanity, but the end result is not easily identifiable as such. See also: how i avoided getting kicked out of school at a time when no one knew what TS was. It can be a shitty childhood when you are the only one who knows you aren't nuts. </p></div>		</li>
