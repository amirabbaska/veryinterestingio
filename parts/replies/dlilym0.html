			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for a company that manufactures heaters for said process equipment.  Requirements from customers are insane because any fluctuations in heat above/below a degree could turn your 100 million dollar chip wafer into a 1 million dollar chip wafer. There is a lot of different factors but that is a big one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;5nm process&quot; means that the transistors are 5 nanometres across. This is about 25 silicon atoms across. When you're building things that are so tiny and precise, the tiniest errors and defects - just one atom being out of place - will affect the way it functions. </p>
<p>When processors have defects, they're not thrown away - they're &quot;binned&quot; into a lower tier of processor. You might already be familiar with this. Purely as a hypothetical example, Intel could release a new line if i5 chips with several different processor speeds. In reality, they only make one kind of processor, and the ones with defects are used for the slower models in the line. That's what he means by making a $100m wafer into a $1m dollar wafer, because a wafer with defects will be sold for much less, as cheaper processors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should check out Ben Eaters youtube channel, he's an engineer that is building a SAP-1 computer (Simple as possible. There are 3 of them from an book made in the 70s) that really fleshes out the basics of how processors work. Super interesting channel. Build each piece per videos and is almost done I think. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically the idea is this: </p>
<p>you have AND gates where if BOTH inputs are 1 (high) then the output is 1, otherwise the output is 0</p>
<p>You have OR gates where if EITHER input is 1, then the output is 1.  If both inputs are 0, then the output is 0.</p>
<p>You have NOR gates where if BOTH inputs are 0, then the output is 1.  If either, or both, inputs are 1, then the output is zero.</p>
<p>You have XOR gates, where if ONE input is 1, then the output is 1.  If both outputs are 0, or if both outputs are 1, then the output is 0.</p>
<p>using those building blocks, you can create systems which can compute any type of arithmetic.  It's important to note that these Boolean operations exist independent of their implementation in semiconductors; you can actually implement Boolean algebra in pneumatic, hydraulic, or mechanical systems.  It's just that semiconductors allow you to create billions of these gates on something the size of your fingernail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in engineering chips, variation of any kind is loss of money and that is why there are such strict controls on it in place.  Now as far as temperature goes, have you ever made a soufflè? It is challenging for experienced cooks and requires steps to be taken in a certain order at a certain time while managing the environment it is in. Failure to do so can ruin the dessert.  Now let's do that on the same scale that we make nano transistors and you can start to see the difficulties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PDF Solutions has something they market as <a href="https://www.pdf.com/press-releases/PDF_Solutions_Launches_New_Design-for-Inspection_Solution" target="_blank">&quot;design for inspection&quot;</a> where they have their customers insert a proprietary circuit on the die that can be used to find defects. Is something like that a replacement for the microsopic inspection, a complement to it, or would it be part of a later phase of verification?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are simulations that have to be done to model the effects of heat / electromagnetic / quantum properties of the system. Then you need to simulate the data flow, which has to be done on an multi-million-dollar programmable circuit (FPGA). When the circuit is etched, logic analysers will be put on all data pins to verify their integrity. A JTAG only tells you programming errors and needs the chip to work physically and logically because its correct functioning is needed to display the debug information</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that's just process. Engineer in semiconductor capital equipment here. I've worked on at least four distinct types of tools. They all struggle to get down to finer resolutions with tighter uniformity (and micro uniformity) and tighter particle control. The hardware to go smaller is probably the biggest bottleneck. I haven't yet been cursed enough to work in lithography but last I heard we were pushing the limits there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was combing through to find this point. It takes so many different types of equipment to make a single processor (litho, etch, both metal and dielectric dep, etc), and every one of those realms have have to overcome hurdles among a gambit of processes to make a node shift successful from an industry standpoint. It takes a lot of groups of really smart people within the industry a very long time to work out the kinks at each node.</p></div>		</li>
