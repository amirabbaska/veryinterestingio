			<div class="markdown"><p>Ex proof is more about containing an explosion within the device if one occurs inside of it. It sounds like this operation might be inside of a Zone 0 (flammable gas always present) hazardous area, and few electrical devices are rated as such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking the same. How are you supposed to rig anything in if it's so hazardous you can  even run lights (I.S. or otherwise.) should just take a page out of the U.S.S.R,  and nuke the cavern . </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for that article, that was informative. </p>
<p>Do you (or anyone else here) know why they can't just close the pipe? Or would the gas pressure blow off any lid they could try to put on? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in the industry and blocking the pipe completely off below surface is a common practice. I can't find enough information about why they cant do that here. I believe they may have parted the pipe very far downhole and it is leaking up the cement in multiple places on the backside of the well. That would mean the only way to kill the leak would be to fill the reservoir. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To actually seal the well bore at surface would involve welding. That's not good with gas blowing inches away. </p>
<p>It also seems likely that the pressure leak isn't not immediately at surface. It make have ruptured some number of feet below surface and is venting through the soil- not sure but that seems likely since normal blowout control techniques didn't work - hence the subsurface intersection. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a project manager, this hits way too close to home. For example, my boss recently promised a customer that we could get their project done in 5 days by using 10 of our installers.</p>
<p>Now this is all well and good, but I have two tiny issues. </p>
<p>1) This is a 3-4 man job. Installers 5-10 aren't going to be much good at the job site.</p>
<p>2) I've only got 5 installers on payroll...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Key is the idea that you need people who not only have experience of being pregnant, but that experience has to be current, you CANNOT expect to train up your current staff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could end up burning for years. They tried to flare a gas leak in the USSR in the 70s. It is still burning today. They call it the door to hell because it looks just like that. A massive pit of fire that has been burning nonstop for 40 years.   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article states it is venting at 145,000 lb/hr which is an odd unit to use for gas measurement.  Doing some conversion it works out to 93 MMscfd (million standard cubic feet per day).  Rough math gives us 2.5 years to burn at that rate given the size of the reservoir, but it would be more than that because the rate would decrease as the pressure declines.</p></div>		</li>
