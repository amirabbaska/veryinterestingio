			<div class="markdown"><p>They mean oil like petroleum, which is sometimes called &quot;oil&quot;. After refining and other stuff it is made into oil you pour in your car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll be honest, with the rise of oil in the everyday household, I would doubt that it's going away. I myself use olive oil to pan fry pretty much anything. Hell, I chopped a rutabaga into cubes just last night, covered them in olive oil, with a little bit of salt and pepper, then tossed them in the oven for 40 minutes on 425F. Came out fucking great. We will always need olive oil OP. </p>
<p>I hate myself for even writing this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know how you feel but you're right. It's hard to fry most things without oil. I don't think it's reasonable to expect that we'd just give it up completely. </p></div>		</li>
