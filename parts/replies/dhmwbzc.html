			<div class="markdown"><p>A pretty good answer, but I'd quibble in a couple places. Firstly, under socialism, the results of production aren't necessarily collectively owned. People can still earn a salary, and you still have personal property. Also, I'd probably say that the means of production are democratically owned. This could mean they're owned by the state under a democratic government, but it could also mean you have worker owned cooperatives where the people who work in a factory, say, are all joint owners, and vote for management.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're correct. I overstepped there. </p>

<p>This is what I hoped to cover under &quot;by the community&quot;. There are a lot of different ways that this sort of thing has been enacted and just wanted to focus on how they weren't owned privately. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd hazard a guess and say sort of.</p>
<p>In the same way that every person is a baseball player. Technically everyone falls <em>somewhere</em> on the scale, but most of them aren't very high up there.</p>
<p>Democratic socialism has an undefinable metric of &quot;how much&quot; socialism and democracy are present. In a true democracy, the minority falls under the tyranny of the majority. No modern government truly allows this in an unlimited fashion, so yes, all world governments that are democracies are sort of social democracies.</p></div>		</li>
