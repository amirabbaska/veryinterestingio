			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: No, your core body temperature will heat the stomach back up to a decent temperature, and if it didn't you would have much bigger problems than slowed digestion.</p>
<p>Long answer: Yes, enzymes (which break down food in our case of digestion) work more efficiently at higher temperatures and therefore anything that lowers the temperature will lower the efficiency of the enzymes and thus decrease the rate of digestion. </p>
<p>However due to the fact that the body very effectively self-regulates temperature this temporary temperature drop will not have a noticeable impact upon digestion efficiency.  Enzymes are also not damaged by lower temperatures and so when returned from a lower back to normal temperature will still function perfectly fine. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically if you drink too much cold water it would lower your core temperature and make digestion much harder. However the reason I say &quot;theoretically&quot; is because we have a protection mechanism built in to prevent this from happen, lovingly referred to as 'brain freeze'.</p></div>		</li>
