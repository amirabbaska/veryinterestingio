			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially the amount of force imparted on a struck target DECREASES with the velocity of the round instead of increases (up to a point) - for example, the 5.56 round was found to lack enough velocity for full penetration, and often would tumble once and ricochet inside the body of a target, as opposed to a 7.62 battle rifle round which would punch a hole straight through the target. Having two wounded organs in a militant beats having one, from a military perspective.</p>
<p>Basically a lighter, slower round was less likely to overpenetrate (i.e. go through the body completely) and bounce around ruining everything it hits. This leads to a 9mm round having ballistics more similar to a 5.56 than a 7.62, but toes the line between having TOO LITTLE mass and velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's exactly why they swapped to 5.56, as an intermediate cartridge it had less weight but a higher wounding factor, and a higher chance of incapacitating someone rather than leaving them as walking wounded.</p></div>		</li>
