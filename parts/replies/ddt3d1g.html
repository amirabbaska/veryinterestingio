<p>It will heat up much faster if there is less overall mass and mass of water being heated up.</p>
<p>More overall mass and water mass means it will take a lot longer to heat up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is due to dielectric heating, and not resonance. From the wiki:</p>
<p>Many molecules (such as those of water) are electric dipoles, meaning that they have a partial positive charge at one end and a partial negative charge at the other, and therefore rotate as they try to align themselves with the alternating electric field of the microwaves. Rotating molecules hit other molecules and put them into motion, thus dispersing energy. This energy, when dispersed as molecular vibration in solids and liquids (i.e. as both potential energy and kinetic energy of atoms), is heat. Sometimes, microwave heating is explained as a resonance of water molecules, but this is incorrect;[20] such resonances occur only at above 1 terahertz (THz)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why commercial microwaves (those designed to heat entire pallets of food) operate at UHF frequencies, so around 440MHz rather than 2.4GHz used in consumer units. 2.4GHz is convenience because the components are reasonably small, it has sufficient penetration depth for most things a consumer would want to cook, and it's in the ISM band. 440MHz is less efficient, but will more evenly cook an entire pallet of food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even water vapour absorbs most of the microwave spectrum, so it would be well beyond the boilling point. It would probably continue until the pressure vessel failed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a made-for-the-microwave pressure cooker: heavy phenolic-feeling plastic, vinyl seal ring, weighted safety valve. It'll cook two cups of dry kidney or turtle beans in about 15-20 min, so I imagine it raises the temp to at least 250F in order to process them in that time. Don't see any reason why, if the vessel was filled with water and completely sealed, both pressure and temp wouldn't continue to increase until the limit of the vessel was breached (most likely scenario) or until equilibrium was reached, and the vessel began radiating an equivalent amount of heat energy to the microwave energy absorbed (least likely).</p></div>		</li>
