			<div class="markdown"><p>We can get the bends if we dive to deep to quick to often. Basically not giving your body the time to recover between dives. It's not something that's really experienced by recreational divers but pros and those who dive for a living(pearl diving, ect.) can suffer from minor decompression sickness if they push themselves to hard. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gas can dissolve in liquid, same as solids can, like salt.  For example, fish &quot;breathe&quot; the oxygen that is dissolved in the water they live in.  The are areas of lakes and the ocean that have very little oxygen dissolved in them, and fish and other marine life can't live in it.</p>
<p>Same goes for other gases in your blood.  Nitrogen dissolves in your blood during normal respiration.  I suppose some oxygen does, too, but your red blood cells are so efficient at grabbing as much of it as they can and stuffing it into their hemoglobin that it's really a very small amount (commercial divers who dive REALLY deep have to use very low-oxygen gas mixes, otherwise their blood cells won't be able to pull it all out of the gas mix and it'll start to dissolve into their blood.  Oxygen in blood cells = good.  Oxygen dissolved in blood = very, very bad.  Oxygen toxicity and all that).</p>
<p>I'm going to digress for a second to (briefly) explain how SCUBA systems work, because it's relevant.  In short, the way they work is that they sense the ambient water pressure around you, and then deliver the gas to your mouthpiece at that pressure, so that you're able to breathe it in.  If you were, for instance, sixty feet down, the pressure is triple what it is at the surface, and if a scuba system supplied air to you at surface pressure, you'd never be able to breathe it in.</p>
<p>So, with all instances of things being dissolved in other things, there are a few factors that affect just how much of a thing (solute) can be dissolved in another thing (solvent).  With gases, a big determinant is the ambient pressure of the gas.  If the gas is higher pressure, more of it can be dissolved in the liquid.</p>
<p>This means that, when you're diving, more nitrogen is dissolved in your bloodstream than at the surface, and if you're diving deep, a LOT more.  This doesn't happen instantaneously, of course, there's a sport where people ride a sort of elevator down to 300 or more feet, doing nothing but holding their breath, and then they come right back up, usually with very little ill effect if they know what they're doing.</p>
<p>Dissolving the gas in your blood, therefore, takes time.  And over time, it starts to dissolve out of your blood, into your other tissues.  If I recall correctly, nitrogen (and maybe other gases) tend to prefer fatty tissues, like body fat, bone marrow, nervous tissue, etc.</p>
<p>Okay, so what happens if you change the ambient pressure?  Well, if it goes up (you go deeper), no problem.  More gas is able to dissolve into your blood and other tissues.</p>
<p>But if it goes DOWN (you go shallower), that's when things get weird.  If it goes down slowly, the gas can precipitate out of your tissues in a slow and orderly manner, and your lungs expel it normally.</p>
<p>If ambient pressure goes down rapidly (you make a rapid ascent) bad shit happens.  The gas doesn't have a chance to precipitate out of your tissues in an orderly manner.  It just starts precipitating in place, forming bubbles in your tissues.  This is called decompression sickness or syndrome.  Aka, the bends.  For some reason that, as far as I know, is unknown to physics or medicine, this phenomenon tends to cause an undue amount of pain and soreness in the joints, causing the sufferer to want to curl up, hence the name, or so I'm told.</p>
<p>Mild decompression sickness is merely uncomfortable.  More severe decompression sickness can cause gas embolisms, and really bad decompression sickness can even cause fat embolisms, by some mechanism that isn't clear to me, and can destroy all kinds of delicate tissues that you really rather need, and as a result, can kill you (even the mildly bad decompression sickness can kill you if you get a gas embolism in the wrong spot).</p>
<p>The way you avoid decompression sickness is by decompressing in stages.  If you've been diving at, say, 120 feet, then you go up to some depth like 90 feet, stay there for some time, then go up to 60 feet, stay there, then 30, then you're okay to surface (this is not an actual decompression scheme).</p>
<p>The way you know what schedule on which to decompress is that there are charts and tables that will tell you.  If you've been at depth X for time Y, then decompress for time A at depth B, and so on and so on.</p>
<p>As an interesting aside, the first of these tables were developed by a guy named John S. Haldane, around the turn of the 20th century.  Decompression sickness had been known for a long time by then (it was called caisson disease), and Haldane was trying to understand exactly what it was and how it affected people, so he did most of his experimentation on himself and his teenage son (which was not as horrible as you might think, as his son, J.B.S Haldane, was a genius and a full partner in the research) in a homebuilt pressure chamber.  And as if that wasn't enough, he got his wife in on it, too.  Very romantic.  Haldane and his son were, in the words of Bill Bryson, eccentric even by the demanding standards of English gentleman-scientists  (Haldane was the guy who introduced the use of canaries as gas detectors in mines).  Anyhow, the tables these guys produced remained in common use until the 1960s, when the US Navy started updating them.  I think they're up to revision 7 by now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that divers today tend to use dive computers instead of tables (although tables are still used), which will tell you your no-decompression limits, and keep track of your safety stop. The biggest advantage with a dive computer versus a table, is that tables overestimate the amount of amount of nitrogen you've taken in (for obvious reasons), based on the lowest depth you hit and the length of the dive, which fall into ranged buckets on the table. So with a dive computer, you can safely dive deeper and longer, and with shorter surface intervals. Though of course as a diver, you still need to be able to use tables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good post.  The topic of oxygen in blood deserves further comment and definition.  It is correct that oxygen in blood exists as that bound to hemoglobin and that dissolved in the blood.  Regarding dissolved oxygen in blood (i.e., dissolved in the serum), the partial pressure of O2 in the serum is in equilibrium with that on the hemoglobin (that is, they have the same partial pressure); it's just that the O2 carrying capacity of serum is extremely low.  And it's true that once all four O2 binding sites on hemoglobin are filled, raising the O2 partial pressure will result in more O2 dissolved within the serum.    However, it is the partial pressure of the O2, not whether it is attached to hemoglobin or dissolved in serum, that drives its entry into tissues.  When one dives to a significant depth, breathing a 21% O2 mixture results in very high O2 partial pressures, which is why they have special gas mixtures for those depths, as high O2 partial pressures are toxic (oxygen free radical formation, oxidation of tissues).</p>
<p>Which Bill Bryson book, BTW?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the easiest way to describe it is to analogize it to a soda. When you dive down deep, your body experiences high pressures. At these high pressures more gas can be solved into your blood. This is like how in a soda, you can have a huge amount of co2 disolved into the soda, but it doesn't bubble out beacuse of the high pressures. When you open the bottle, the pressure drops and the co2 bubbles out of the liquid. You breath compressed air under high pressures for a while and the same thing happens to you, you disolved a lot of gas in your blood, and when you come to the surface it all bubbles out. </p></div>		</li>
