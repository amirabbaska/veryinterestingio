			<div class="markdown"><p>Luckily, the recent trend seems to be optimisation for Performance instead of lazily using more resources. At least Microsoft's Software has become a lot more responsive and resource-friendly recently.</p>
<p>[edit] I have used Microsoft as an example here because Their Software is the only Software I have used consistently over many Versions. other Software makers probably do the same, but I have no comparison there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is mostly due to mobile technologies becoming more and more popular. They don't have the computing power like a desktop, nor the storage space, so developers have to start slimming things down.</p>
<p>As mobile devices get more powerful, then software will bulk up again as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People actually used to recommend reinstalling Windows every six months. Various software cruft leads to decreased performance, so a clean wipe and reinstall can help. I don't know if recent versions of Windows have made strides to combat this or not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This problem has basically disappeared with Windows Vista... although that version of Windows was so slow to begin with that few people really noticed the improvement. With Windows 7 onwards, what was known colloquialy as the &quot;winrot&quot; has more or less disappeared if you don't let it bloat with crapwares (bundled toolbars and whatnot).</p></div>		</li>
