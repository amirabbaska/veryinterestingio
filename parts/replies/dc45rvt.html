			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good explanation, but I have always wondered why the answer isn't infinity instead of undefined, since as the result gets larger as the number you divide by gets smaller. I.e. You would have an infinite number of pieces of chocolate if you divided one pound into zero size pieces. </p>
<p>Or are they the same in this context?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not quite the same, and the reason is limits and number systems. </p>
<p>The reason it's not infinity is because there we're dealing with the Real numbers, and the Real numbers don't include infinity. It's just not something we can work with.  </p>
<p>There are numbers called the Extended Real numbers, which is just the Reals with positive and negative infinity. In order to get infinity, though, we need limits. Limits are just a fancy way of saying we're going to let this number x get really close to another number. For instance, the limit of x as x approaches infinity is infinity. The limit of x^2 as x approaches 2 is 4. </p>
<p>Now back to division by 0. Let's look at the function 1/x. What happens as x approaches 0? Intuitively, it goes off to infinity. <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=1%2Fx&amp;oq=1%2Fx" target="_blank">However, take a look at the plot.</a> It only approaches infinity if we approach 0 from the right. If we approach from the left, then it's negative infinity. Since we don't get a straight answer, we abstain from choosing. (The rule is that if you approach a number from different directions and get different results, then the limit does not exist.)</p>
<p>There are even other situations where dividing by 0 gives you numbers other than infinity (e.g. the absolute value of x divided by x - it's going to be plus or minus 1, but x=0 doesn't really work so we still say it's undefined). And again, the Reals don't have infinity, so if we're just talking about numbers we come across every day (without taking limits) then dividing by 0 doesn't have a single answer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because infinity isn't a number, but a mathematical concept. You can only <em>approach</em> infinity, but you can't be at infinity, which is also why infinity only shows up when you deal with limit functions. So, in this case;</p>
<p>lim (4/x), as x approaches 0 (from the positive side), is infinity, but</p>
<p>4/0 is undefined.</p>
<p>In addition;</p>
<p>lim (4/x), as x approaches 0 from the <em>negative</em> side is negative infinity.</p>
<p>The limit isn't distinct in this case, although at the same time it doesn't really make sense to divide into negative groups in this specific example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You have a 1 pound chocolate bar, but you owe Charles 1/2 a chocolate bar.</p>
<p>How much chocolate do you give him?</p>
<p>16 OZ bar divided by -2 = -8 OZ. You have to give Charles 8 OZ of the chocolate bar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If 1/0 = infinity, then 0 * infinity = 1. </p>
<p>This would mean that 0 + 0 + 0 + 0... = 1. But that doesn't happen. If you keep adding 0 to itself it doesn't get any closer to 1, even if you did it infinitely. </p></div>		</li>
