			<div class="markdown"><p>This is completely anecdotal, but I am chronically low on vitamin D (I usually test about an 8) and if I forget to take my supplement, the next day I get occasional little stinging pains in various body parts.  When I take it, within usually about 12 hours the pains go away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just curious what dosage of vitamin D you take? You still test at 8 even with the supplement? I tested 16 once and they put me on 50,000 iu once a week for 6 weeks which got me up to 32. But I have to take 11,000 iu's daily to get me to 48. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on 10,000 iu daily for the past four months, two months to go.  I first tested at a 6.  It has taken four months to get to an 8.  My doctor thinks my body just does a terrible job holding on to vitamin D.  She has me on relatively lower dose because I'm gonna need to take it for a couple years, probably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Myself and one other person I have met have experienced a phantom pain where it feels like some one in fact tries to voodoo doll dildo our ass, I know there are more people out there that know exactly what I'm talking about. It lasts like a tenth of a second and doesn't hurt at all after. </p>
<p>Lots of people have that thing where a random breath like once a year fucks up, feels like you get stabbed in the lung and the next breaths don't hurt at all, but it is very scary to try to breath deep again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a classic joke. Girl gets a voodoo dildo. Works by saying &quot;voodoo dildo wherever&quot;.  It's great at first but the girl doesn't know how to get it  to stop so she speeds to the hospital. Cop pulls her over, she tells him about the voodoo dildo, cop doesn't believe her, says &quot;yeah yeah, voodoo dildo my ass&quot; </p></div>		</li>
