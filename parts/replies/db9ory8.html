			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I agree this is a good answer. Additionally, there is the idea that &quot;nature abhors a vacuum&quot;.  In ecology, the concept is that a vacant <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche" target="_blank">ecological niche</a> will not stay empty for a long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A related example, New World and Old world vultures look nearly identical. But the Old World vultures evolved from Hawks while the New World ones evolved from Pellicans.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the introduction of genetic testing that we realized how distantly related they actually were. Both evolved into a very similar creature, despite having notably different starting points.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That first bit of info is pretty outdated. It's now thought that Condors are a sister group to the clade containing the hawks, eagles, and old world vultures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They had to breathe air, and keeping in mind that we've never actually seen them in action, it is believed they would jump out of the water to breathe. They would at least have to get the head out, in view of their nostrils being in front of the eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They wouldn't need to jump out, all they'd need to do is poke their heads out, a behavior we see in all sorts of marine animals, including ones that don't breath air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to genetic research cited by Richard Dawkins in &quot;The Ancestor's Tale,&quot; that's because cetaceans (dolphins and whales) are evolved from a land mammal line, probably via something like hippos. So the &quot;up-and-down&quot; tail movement comes from a quadruped 's running gait. That shit blows my mind.</p></div>		</li>
