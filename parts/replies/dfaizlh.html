			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really really simplified view of AV software; it was true 15 years ago, but isn't really true today.</p>
<p>Today's AV software generally has a number of real-time protections, which can include matching code fragments whenever a file is written to and/or read from disk, can have behavioural triggers that fire off a selected or full memory scan, monitor specific API calls and trigger more intensive memory/disk scans if certain combinations are triggered, and monitor your computer's log files as they are written for any odd looking behavior.</p>
<p>Also, modern AV usually includes a cloud lookup feature where files that fit certain profiles that haven't run before are looked up in an online reputation database-- often by checksum, which means a SHA256 or similar is run against the file and that's sent to some remote server for matching.</p>
<p>On top of all that, the AV software is always running in the background reading and writing it's own records and logs.</p>
<p>With all the stuff modern AV software does, it's amazing that computers run as well as they do.</p>
<p>One of the software types that slows down the most when AV is running is Java software, because some Java requires unzipping and loading hundreds if class files.  This means that the AV software must first unzip and scan all of those files before it lets the Java runtime load them -- twice the unzipping at a minimum, and a LOT of extra file read/writes as each file is looked up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure we know know a little more  than your cynical reply would give us in the security industry credit for. Disk IO is only a part of AV performance and really only applies to on demand scans or times of high disk IO. Yes AV has a performance impact but your reply is a generic statement from 1995. So cybersecurity engineer AV truther, can you please impart some additional knowledge as to what are the actual reasons why AV effects system performance? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll admit to being cynical, and I suppose my statement regarding AV software engineers not being as smart as they think they are was not in the true spirit of explaining the issue in an unbiased way.  I'll go off and consider my life choices.</p>
<p>And yes, OK, there are a large number of complexities in the world of endpoint security that I'm glossing over, but remember I was aiming for an actual ELI5.  Having said that, after investigating a large number of performance related problems on a wide variety of endpoints over the years (user workstations and servers alike) I can categorically conclude that the vast majority of these issues can be traced back to contentious disk I/O during a scheduled file system scan.  I wasn't in the industry in 1995, but was shortly after - and unfortunately I must inform that not much has changed in this regard in all those years. Just last month I was working a short contract for a government department and my standard PC would, at 2pm each day, become essentially unusable for around 30 minutes while the McAfee binary fired up and churned through the filesystem using every spin of the system's sad little 5400RPM drive. Perhaps the blame in this case lies not only with McAfee insisting on using up as much I/O as possible but also with the incompetence of IT purchasing officers and the true cost of that inefficient component. How many staff members become unproductive for 30 minutes each day so we could save $40 on a hard drive?</p>
<p>My jab at AV software engineers was more like a plea; for the love of all things holy, please introduce some kind of I/O control mechanism people!  Your software already has all the right system access; maybe just check the disk queue and see if any other binaries have requests piling up, and then back off for a while until they clear the queue? That would solve things nicely. But no, it's the year 2017 and your software still just tries to drink the ocean every time.</p>
<p>In the minority of cases, in particular where there is heavy load on the system already, transactional operations of the endpoint security system (usually related to real-time scanning) can impede the performance of the system and cause a noticeable delay to a user.  Essentially, this is because the endpoint security software intercepts a subset of objects as they enter the memory of the computer system and runs a comparison operation against well known malicious software, usually using a hashing algorithm. It can't possibly match all the bad software ever, so it uses a heuristic approach, but even then, the comparison operation takes time, so you have to wait while it is done before your application can access the memory. If the comparison operation takes a long time, your application will kind of hang while it waits - after all, it was probably designed with fast disk loads into memory as a parameter. </p>
<p>But this is, as I said, the minority. The majority of cases I encounter are just greedy AV scanners thrashing the disk while your application requests pile up in the queue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A problem I had with Mcaffe when I used it about a decade ago. When it decided to perform a scan PC performance was garbage.
I've since switched to Norton, and it runs much better. It performs lots of tasks when I'm not using the computer, like it will do a quick scan while I take a break from gaming and the like.</p></div>		</li>
