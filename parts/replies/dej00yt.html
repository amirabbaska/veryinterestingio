			<div class="markdown"><p>A better way to put it would probably be that it will orient in whatever magnetic field it feels from all the surrounding sources at your current position. You could in principle have two weak fields adding up to something stronger, or even two strong fields cancelling each other. It won't just latch onto the source of the closest, strongest field.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is just a floating magnet, you're making it too complicated for ELI5.</p>
<p>Compass is a floating magnet. If you stick iron next to a compass it points to or from the metal. If you put another magnet near the compass it is affected by the magnetic field.</p>
<p>A magnet in space will be affected by whatever magnetic fields are nearby, both from planets if any, and from the metals and magnetic fields of the space ship they're in, or whatever other magnetic fields they happen to be exposed to.</p>
<p>On earth while away from any other strong magnets, a compass works because the earth's magnetic field is the strongest thing around. As the magnet settles down the compass magnet aligns with the earth's magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mars isn't special because it doesn't have a magnetic field, Earth is special because it does.  Just being a huge rock is not enough to generate a magnetic field.  Earth has a molten metal core that flows and rotates, generating our magnetic field.  Mars' core is solid and unmoving, so it does not generate a magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Ah yes, Mars does have a molten core, it just doesn't have the dynamo that Earth does to create a strong enough magnetic field. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a few caveats to add to this: mercury, while it does have a magnetic field, its strength is only about 1% of the strength of earth's, so its unlikely anything but a very sensitive compass with a very lightweight needle would be able to detect it. and even then, electrically induced magnetic fields in the spacecraft you're travelling in will almost certainly be stronger.</p>
<p>also the magnetic pole doesnt always align with the rotational pole, in uranus' case, the two are offset by almost 60 degrees. Also &quot;north&quot; can mean two things, either the South magnetic pole of a planet (yes, earth's &quot;north pole&quot; is a south magnetic pole, since the north pole of a magnet points towards it) OR it can mean the pole of a planet that is oriented in the same direction as earth's north pole, relative to the solar system's plane of orbit. For example despite Mar's having no magnetic field, we still define its &quot;north pole&quot; as being the pole of rotation that is pointing &quot;up&quot; relative to earth. (a third definition has to do with the direction of the rotation of the planet relative to each pole) </p>
<p>I believe all celestial bodies in the solar system that have magnetic fields have north-south poles that are oriented in the same direction as earth's, but that could be total coincidence, theres nothing stopping a planet from having its north pole be &quot;upside down&quot; compared to Earths (indeed, Earth's poles have flipped many times over the course of geological history, and will continue to do so.)</p>
<p>also the sun's magnetic field is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/march_14-picturing_magnetic_field_lines_2.jpg?itok=xvD1mTEg" target="_blank">a bit of a mess</a> so your compass wouldnt necessarily point to the north pole of the sun. And the sun's north pole &quot;flips&quot; about once every 11 years.</p></div>		</li>
