			<div class="markdown"><p>I totally buy this explanation - thank you - but what i'm wondering is this: what about pimples on my ass?</p>
<p>Not trying to be gross, or funny; every so often i'll get a common pimple right in the middle of my ass cheek, and it's tough to stretch and bend and hurts like an absolute son of a bitch to pop, but it's unbearable to sit on or have my underwear/pants rub against all day. So, I do a bit of stretching, grit my teeth, and do the thing.</p>
<p>But the question is: I don't have the glutes of David, so why does it hurt so bad? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read about pilonidal cysts and make sure that’s not what you’re experiencing. Also, if you are hirsute, make sure you exfoliate and dry off really well. Don’t sit around in sweaty clothes or sit for too long in one position. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, but I am actually quite bare-assed, and these guys I’m talking about are usually right on the middle of the cheek, or possibly near the ass/upper leg crevice. As stated before, they’re painful and in a typically fatty area of the body, so it seems like it may not jive with your assessment of why nasal pimples hurt so much. </p>
<p>Anyway, it’s no big medical mystery. Don’t stay up nights pondering.</p></div>		</li>
