			<div class="markdown"><p>Had to do this a lot during my PhD. The first few times are a little difficult, but it gets easier. One main point is that killing the test subjects is not just kill-and-be-done-with-it, you have to maintain a lot of precision during the process to ensure that the brains/organs are dissected and preserved correctly, to make sure you don't waste reagents and tissues, and to minimize pain and stress for the animal being sacrificed. So, there is very little room for thought during the process and you are so focused on getting things right in the moment that the act of killing takes up much less mindspace. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked as a scientist for a drug discovery company and did what is known as &quot;pre-clinical&quot; research- before any promising compound is trialled in humans it is tested in mice and rat models. For depression, learned helplessness is a valid test. There are committees that perform ethical review to reduce and re-use animals but scientists do need to look at the brains for depression research.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insurance pricing. I now build statistical financial models using machine learning techniques (an over-used term for sure), so try and accurately assess the risk and severity of insurance claims based upon information provided. I then tweak those prices based on optimisation models I build against our competitors.</p>
<p>I think that my scientific training really helps me in my career, and I think that scientists and engineers are far better suited to the work than pure statisticians or even actuaries.</p>
<p>But I still love neuroscience and try to keep up with all the latest findings. It's a hugely rewarding discipline, and one that I would recommend to anyone (not all jobs are with animals).</p></div>		</li>
