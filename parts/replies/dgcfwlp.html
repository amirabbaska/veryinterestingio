<p>About 92% of opioid users that complete a detox-only level of care, without residential treatment, intensive outpatient treatment, etc., end up using again within one year... using problematically</p>

<p>This is why the direction for SUD treatment is going in a very corrupt and ineffective direction. Drug medi-cal coupled with ASAM criteria had made &quot;most restrictive level of care&quot; the &quot;evidenced-based treatment&quot; model to follow. The result, outpatient and intensive outpatient instead of residential, drastically lowering success rates, redefining &quot;relapse&quot; to include &quot;lapse&quot; so the metrics change so they can report better treatment outcomes, meanwhile using medication assisted therapy as the go to. Keeps suffering clients on the hamster wheel of the &quot;continuum of care&quot;, relapse after relapse, outpatient, detox, outpatient, detox etc... all the while big pharma, insurance companies, and for profit treatment centers laugh all the way to the bank, and tax payers paying into medical/medicare pay the bill for all these unlimited treatment episodes  </p>
<p>SUD treatment in california is a disgrace at best, toxic at worst</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why sober housing is an amazing product. I've seen places do a terrible job with it, providing residents with poorly managed dirty houses and low accountability. I've also seen it done incredibly well. </p>
<p>I'm posting this from a sober house, 7 months clean and I have seen people around me have about a 70% success rate in reaching  6 months sobriety (anecdotal, I know). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the end of the day, it's almost always gonna be anecdotal. It's hard to get empirical longitudinal studies with many substances. Of course 12step programs lead to seeing those make it who make it within the program and a ton of survivorship bias, at the end of the day accountability counts for a ton.  </p>
<p>Thanks, keep doing the next right thing.</p></div>		</li>
