			<div class="markdown"><p>Pro tip: if you have 5 gallons of water a day being pulled out in your basement, especially if your home is air conditioned, you probably have a sump pump. </p>
<p>Make darned sure that you have a wet floor detector if you run a line to your sump well. </p>
<p>One of these days that pump is going to stop and you don't want the dehumidifier slowly flooding your basement.</p>
<p>I may or may not have slowly flooded my basement due to a pump quietly failing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, true. </p>
<p>That helps as long as the pump can still move water and the drain line isn't emptying into a block of ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since the dehumidifier is passing air over a cold coil, does that have a significant cooling effect on a room?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because the air then goes over the 'warm' side of the equipment, and picks that heat right back up. (Plus a little, because the machine itself creates a little heat.)</p>
<p>An air-conditioner works similarly, but separates the hot and cold sides, venting the cold air in, and the hot air out. That's why AC's drip water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Heat has to go somewhere so the heat from the coil is actually extracted to the air in the room, making it warmer. Also, the heat from the water vapor as it condenses is transferred to the coil which must then be cooled more, which means that's more heat transferring to the air. </p>
<p>Hope that helped!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because the coil is cooled by allowing a fluid inside the coil to change state from liquid to gas, by basically being in a low pressure environment.  This pulls the heat out of the air and into the fluid.</p>
<p>There's another coil that the gas is compressed and turned back into a liquid, releasing its heat energy back into the air.  the liquid then heads to the cold coil to evaporate again, completing the loop.  The dehumidifier has these 2 coils one after the other, so the air is cooled (and water is pulled out) and then immediately reheated.</p>
<p>FYI, this process is exactly how an air conditioner works, except the cold coil is inside and the hot coil is outside, moving heat from inside your home to outside it.  Same with a fridge too.</p></div>		</li>
