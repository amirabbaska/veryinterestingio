			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this point, a large part of the difference in contact comes down to game mechanics. In football, a play stops when you stop the ball carrier, whereas in rugby, play continues. So in football, a single hard contact is the aim of the tackle to ensure the abrupt end to a scrimmage, whereas in rugby, exerting a full force contact does relatively little to stop play if the offense is set properly and can form a ruck and reset the line. You've got much more motivation in football to take an opponent down with hard contact, whereas in rugby your aim is to stop the ball carrier and immediately get yourself back into a position to defend further forward progress or begin to take up an offensive position. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>God damn that game sounds difficult. Like not just the rules, I understand most of those since my roommate played for a year and I went to watch a few games, but just always moving. It's full contact soccer basically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a reason the full name of the sport is &quot;Rugby Football&quot;. If I remember correctly back in the 1800's different towns/schools in the UK had small different rules/variations as for how soccer was played. The school in the town of Rugby has the variations where players could pick up the ball and run with it, and the sport evolved into its own thing from there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes a lot of fitness, that's for sure. I played 2 years in high school and 2 years of men's league. I was a back row forward, so we're expected to be a compromise between size and fitness... and yeah, it's exhausting. Make a hit, roll away, get back on your feet, get ready to hit the next guy. It's pretty much 40 minutes of jogging interspersed with occasional sprints and also having to hit dudes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've played both. Albeit at a very amateur level.   Lots of people have asked me &quot;isn't rugby physically brutal and violent?&quot;  I tell them football is much more so. In rugby you don't have pads. So for every &quot;hit&quot; you make on someone, there is an equal and opposite impact on you. So in rugby you tend to do more actual tackling versus hitting. And when you do hit, you use the hardest parts of your body like hips, shoulders, or elbows (but elbows can be dangerous, so you tend to keep those in). Sure your head is hard, but your neck and brain are not. You quickly realize that you have to protect your head and neck.  </p>
<p>In football you are covered in hard passing. And you get a great sense of invincibility, which is when people get hurt. </p>
<p>If you ask me how to solve the head injury issue in football, is 100% say ... remove their helmets and should pads, and you'll see the incident rate for head injuries plummet!  Of course is would be a totally different game though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also played both, and football is always violent and brutal. Bad amateur rugby can be violent, but is usually slow. Good amateur rugby is a bloodbath (at least where I'm from), because we were all young, all played football or hockey, and were physically fit. We destroyed eachother on the pitch. When rugby become very high level, the focus is more on tactics and strategy, and longevity of play. Pro rugby has some huge hits but mostly good tackles. U20 provincial or national rugby is like the longest yard in my personal experience.</p>
<p>Edit: I played in rural Canada, where the hockey is also also overly violent and You're a &quot;pussy&quot; if it's not, so I may be skewing the data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah.  I played rugby in high school in suburban Ontario. We were pretty violent. Really unnecessarily so. But I think that is just an artifact of been teenage males full of testosterone. </p>
<p>Ah the memories: broken collar bones, broken noses, a broken jaw or two. Not me mind you. I got out relatively unscathed. Just got stomped on my legs with 1&quot; metal cleats and a few punches.  I really can't complain. </p>
<p>But players in their early 20's are a lot less violent, definitely. That's around when I stopped playing.  I found that our club spent more time in the bar than on the pitch practicing. But good times all around still. Miss it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is much the same as when they introduced gloves to boxing. You can only punch someone in the skull so hard bare knuckled without breaking your own hand. Put a glove on and you are free to wallop him as hard as you want over and over again.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I honestly wonder if you couldn't solve a lot of the problems with football by removing shoulder pads, and tweaking the helmets to be disposable...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CTE is typically considered worse in small repeated head impacts, contrary to the belief that huge impacts cause more symptoms of CTE. There is research showing how boxers compare with football players with CTE for example. It's shown that small repeated impacts to the head can actually cause more of the onset symptoms of CTE and at an earlier age, which can be caused by things such as repeated jabs to the head. Football players definitely ecperience these symptoms. But from what I've read small repeated trauma is considered worse in the long run, as opposed to fewer, major hits. There is a lot of research to be done on the matter though, and no one is fully certain why TAU aggregates in certain parts of the brain from impacts. But yes, football pads and gear definitely cause more CTE overall.
But overall in my exoerience ive seen more brain damaged boxers than football players. </p></div>		</li>
