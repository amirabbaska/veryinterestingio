			<div class="markdown"><p>Helium-4 doesn't &quot;become&quot; a boson, it <em>is</em> a boson. And the answer is that in real world everything is above zero kelvin and thus has quite a bit of energy. Reaching very low energy states requires some ingenious cooling techniques. But if you do it, you'll find that helium-4 forms a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate" target="_blank">Bose-Einstein condensate</a> exactly because it's a boson.</p></div>		</li>
