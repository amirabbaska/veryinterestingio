			<div class="markdown"><p>Yours is the first answer I found that had any decent explanation in it.  Would it be safe to say that after 6765 flips we would have the probability within +/- 1%?  So for example 4000 heads would mean a very high degree of confidence for a p between 58.1% and 60.1%?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The calculation that gives N = 6765 is under the following two assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>You know that one coin is fair and the other has p = 0.51, you just don't know which is which.</li>
<li>You want to distinguish the coins to within 5% error. That is, roughly speaking, there is less than a 5% chance we actually have the fair coin <em>and</em> more than a 95% chance we actually have the biased coin. You can also set the tolerance to be different for each required condition.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, note that this is for distinguishing between a fair coin and a biased coin with <em>known bias</em>. You are not trying to estimate the bias of the biased coin. You know the other coin has a 51% chance of heads. You just need to figure out how many flips you need to say whether you have been flipping the fair or the biased coin this whole time.</p>
<p>This does not mean that if you just so happened to flip a coin 6765 times and got 4000 heads you could say with some confidence that you have a certain value of <em>p</em>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a question - that's the number of flips required to make sure that the coin you are flipping is either the biased or unbiased coin, correct? All of that testing hinges on only interacting with the singular coin. If you were to involve the second coin in experiments, would you still require an additional 6765 flips with the second coin to determine the new coin is what it should be, or does involving the second coin in distribution testing allows you to reduce the number of flips in total?</p>
<p>I get that you don't actually have to involve the second coin to determine which is which, since you already know how biased they are and that there are only two - testing one to 95% certainty means you know the other coin's identity just as well. I'm mostly curious if there's a way to shorten the testing and give you about the same result with less work, if you were able to flip both coins.</p></div>		</li>
