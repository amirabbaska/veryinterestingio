			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.</p>
<p>In the most limited interpretation, I don't know anything about how cetaceans hear each other. In a forest, a distress call by one species will trigger others to go on alert (monkeys and birds, so forth). Do whales/dolphins/porpoises respond to each other in this way? If humpbacks are gathering because there's good eating, do right whales show up to feast as well? Are they all shouting in a similar range or is their hearing fine-tuned enough that they're not overly bothered by other species at different frequencies?</p>
<p>And of course, any hint of actual communication or interaction between species would be fascinating to learn about.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to tack a complementary question to your first one:</p>
<p>In the event where there is some degree of cross species communication, is some of that communication deceitfull? For instance, might a whale deliberately give a false alarm to scare off other whales and get priviledged access to choice feeding opportunities?</p>
<p>I refer to studies such as that of Flower et al (2014) &quot;<em>Deception by flexible alarm mimicry in an African bird</em>&quot;, Science 2 May 2014, Vol. 344 no. 6183 pp. 513-516.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to Jon Young in &quot;What the Robin Knows,&quot; Bluejays will sometimes mimic the call of a hawk to frighten other birds, then immediately make the normal Bluejay alarm call that means &quot;Oh shit, I saw a hawk!&quot; It then immediately attends the bird feeder, which is now devoid of other birds. So there's an example of what you're talking about (one species using alarm calls to confuse another), but with a bit of extra deviousness thrown in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I'm reading it as, and I'd love to hear an answer to that.  Clearly different species communicate in some ways (dogs growling seem to be understood by most other animals that have been exposed to them), but this would seem to require something a fair bit more complex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not expert but, I'd imagine that the size of the whales play a factor in this. Like a deeper sound (from a blue whale) heard by a grey whale might be a warning sign? Or would they communicate back? </p></div>		</li>
