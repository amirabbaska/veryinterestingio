			<div class="markdown"><p>I made a joke up. It's pretty funny and you can tell it to your friends if you want.</p>
<p>Why did the dog quit his job as an astronaut?</p>
<p>Because dogs hate vacuums.</p>
<p>Ha ha ha, oh boy, vacuums! I hope you thought it was funny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK so Einstein, Newton and Pascal are playing hide 'n' seek in Heaven.</p>
<p>Einstein's it, so he starts counting... <em>one, two , three, four ...</em></p>
<p>Pascal runs off and hides in some nearby bushes, and Newton picks up a small rock, draws a 1 meter by 1 meter box, and stands inside.</p>
<p>Einstein has finally finished his counting <em>nine, ten</em> &quot;Ready or not!&quot; He announces.</p>
<p>When he looks up, he sees Newton and shouts, &quot;Aha Newton, I have found you!&quot;</p>
<p>Newton replies simply, &quot;No, you've found one Newton per sq. meter, you've found Pascal!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like someone would have engineered noise cancelling modules that work like in headphones and have a speaker with a sensor and it launches the opposite sound wave out to cancel it. Guess not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The noise cancelling effect of the additional speakers would only work if your head was always in the desired position though. The sound waves of the vacuum and the inverted canceling waves only destroy each other at specific points in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, they at one point &quot;solved&quot; the problem with the introduction of house vacs. The vacuum itself is somewhere else (like the garage) and they connect via pipes in the walls to little outlet-like panels spaced around the house that you lift up for suction. This just leaves the noise of suction.</p></div>		</li>
