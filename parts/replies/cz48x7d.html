Why would they have been satisfied with black and white pictures and movies instead of realistic depictions of color?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even the ability to take black and white pictures and film was hugely useful.  People experimented with making color film while black and white was used, but that takes time.  Why would they reject a new technology for not being even better?  They didn't just make black and white film and say &quot;well this is perfect, we're done.&quot;  People tried to make better version, but they needed to create new chemicals and methods of development.  </p>
<p>Why would you ever be satisfied with a 2D movie?  It's fully immersive and interactive 3D VR or nothing!  It doesn't matter if it might take decades to actually be invented, 2D isn't perfect.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because no color is better than no picture. Imagine that, you live in the 19th century, and here's a box that can paint a scene by itself! That's a fucking miracle by 19th century standards. You don't complain that your miracle isn't the right color, you keep staring at it dumbfounded at the fact that you just took an image of real life in mere minutes, with a freaking box. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because, the chemical they used simply reacted the same way to any light. It couldn't distinguish between different colors of light. So they couldn't do color right away because they didn't know how.</p></div>		</li>
