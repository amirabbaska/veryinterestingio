			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine being an ottoman during the battle of Vienna and looking up to see the Polish winged hussars slowly emerging from the trees at 4pm. They slowly gather 20000 strong, no one has seen this large a calvary ever before and never will again. Then the moment comes, it's 6 pm and you hear the roar of hooves, the calvary is charging and it is deafening, the wings on the poles helmets create an eerie whistle that causes the horses to panic, they are now in a stampede and there is nothing to stop them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think it would be very interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly a lot of cavalry charges were made with the intent of breaking the line through fear. If the line they were charging at remained braced and didn't flee they would just wheel away rather than charge straight into a thicket of spears</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes the stories of mercenaries who won many battles despite inferior numbers more believable. War professionals would know that and remain braced, which is not something conscripted peasants would do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually happened at the battle of Waterloo - marshal Ney thought the British were retreating, so he ordered a cavalry charge. However, Wellington had merely withdrawn his troops over the ridge line, and had formed squares, which is where the soldiers form a square shape facing outwards with their bayonets sticking out and up.</p>
<p>Horses will not charge into sharp pointy things, however hard you make them try, so the French cavalry was destroyed by fire from the squares without being able to fight back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's scary. Especially when you can't escape because you're kettled.</p>
<p>That said, horses are very clever and careful with their feet, so it's less dangerous than it feels, even if people have died in this manner before. </p></div>		</li>
