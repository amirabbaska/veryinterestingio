			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep hormones are high, minimal movement, your body is starting the sleep process on the couch. Then you decide to get up, and a big red button is pressed that fires some cortisol for alertness and slows/stops the process. You’re waking yourself up, and thus the process restarts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incidentally, I’ve read somewhere that when you wake up in the middle of the night and can’t seem to fall back to sleep, taking a walk around the house (minimal lights, no phone) and returning to bed can help one fall back to sleep. Ever heard of that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wanted to know if this is the case with everyone? I heard people complaining about it but could never really believe that they can't fall asleep because..you know..they wanna sleep don't they?
In other words: I think I can sleep whenever I want to. I get up at 6 to get ready for work, drink 2 cups of coffee, work is cancelled - of course I can fall asleep again in under 30 mins.
I was sleepless exactly 3 nights in my life, and that was when I was severely ill.
Am I just lucky or is this kinda not normal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A question about core body temperature when sleeping. I was thinking about this yesterday, my family and I were watching a movie. As usual I fell asleep and stayed asleep for about an hour. When I woke up I was very hot and a bit sweaty, but as soon as I woke I felt like I started cooling off. My question is: when does your core body temperature drop? Is it during a certain phase of sleep? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Also cats specifically sleep more than humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans are strictly diurnal, meaning we are awake during the day and asleep at night. Cats are crepuscular which means they tend to be active around dusk and dawn and sleep inbetween times. This means they don't require a solid 8 hours sleep a night like we do, and can more easily nap throughout the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would your sleep patterns be like if you didn’t have any work or errands to do and someone else prepared all of your meals? Add in a complete lack of time based activities (watching a tv show at XPM or meeting a friend at YAM). Also, nothing you do requires additional light. And every surface is potentially a bed. </p>
<p>I don’t know that you would end up sleeping like a car, but I very much doubt you’d end up sleeping like the average person. </p></div>		</li>
