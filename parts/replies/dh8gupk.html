			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but when I was 9 my teacher humiliated me as, along with the rest of my class, I could not spell &quot;obvious&quot;. Motherfucker screamed and shouted at me (it was the 70s) and made me start again each time I stuttered &quot;O...V..&quot;. Eventually called me stupid and told me to sit down. He broke a stick of chalk while trying to indent the letter B into the blackboard. So that shit isn't going to evolve. There is a B in obvious. It's fucking obvious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to hear. To be fair, whenever I speak or hear the word obvious,  there is a slight emphasis on the B.  It's always be...  ob-vious to me</p>
<p>But I get where your coming from,  teachers could be scary af back in the day,  not like teachers today who get fired for looking at a student the wrong way. </p></div>		</li>
