<p>Yes-most overdoses happen in an unfamiliar environment. Your mind learns your pattern of behaviour, so starts to prepare your body for drugs before they are even taken. This is a partial reason why someone addicted to drugs has to increase their dose over time (although a vast majority of tolerance is due to developing a physical tolerance). Still, this is a large enough effect that in a new environment where your body doesn't get the early warning signals to prepare ahead of time, that it can lead to an overdose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I read /u/CyclicNature 's post I was about to call bullshit but it really did click with both of you saying it. The expectation of being high (in the usual environment) probably does cause a flood of dopamine and 'excitement' that allows them to use their usual amount. Then at a new friend's house, that <em>same</em> anticipatory flood isn't there and they're in respiratory arrest upon injecting the same amount. Just from that initial ritual being broken. Amazing scientifically but sad :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This &quot;psychological phenomenon&quot; actually occurs everywhere. Which is why it is recommended to only sleep in your bedroom i.e. not keep your PC, console or TV in your bedroom. So when you go to bed you will actually be &quot;primed&quot; to sleep instead of watching TV or gaming or any other things. But it happens everywhere, your kitchen, living room, work, restaurants that you often go to, liquor store etc etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna need some sources on this.  I totally agree with your brain priming you when you walk in somewhere, but I don't agree with drugs getting physically stronger to the point where you would be able to metabolize it and handle it in one place but not another.  Most fatal overdoses happen after a period of abstinence, during a relapse when the body cannot physically metabolize fast enough to keep you alive.  That, or disgusting Fent cuts with street drugs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More likely that because that anticipatory flood as you call it isn't there, the person takes a higher dose to compensate for it.</p>
<p>Taking the same amount of the same purity stuff shouldn't cause a huge difference in effects just from a change in environment. Not unless they have been abstinent for some time and their tolerance has dropped back to baseline levels. </p>
<p>More than likely the change in environment just leads to more risk taking. Like I said, the lack of anticipatory flood and excitement meaning the person feels like they have to take a higher dose than they normally would (risky) and that higher dose causing them to OD.</p>
<p>I've done similar things wth other drugs and not just due to the environment either -- e.g. taking a higher dose of sleeping meds if I've had a really stressful day because I just assume I'll find it harder to sleep that night so will need the higher dose, or taking a higher amount of anti-anxiety drugs when I have something stressful ahead and I'm anticipating the anxiety and nervousness in advance. I'm sure we all do stuff like this, the phenomenon isn't just related to our environment or heroin, I think it's all about humans trying to compensate for certain factors or perceived factors and an attempt to achieve this perfect balance and doing whatever we think is necessary to achieve it (even if in hindsight it means taking a risk and taking more drugs etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry but unless you have a very juicy and good source on this, I will have to call bullshit on the claim that <strong>Just shooting up in a new environment can cause respiratory depression</strong>! Sorry but that makes no sense as someone who has done more than a few opiates yet never experienced anything close to that despite doing drugs in the weirdest of situations. </p>
<p>Also, why aren't patients on morphine/oxy etc. warned about this if its true? </p>
<p>Probably because its not true at all. </p>
<p>Most heroine overdoses happen either because people mix with other drugs or because they have a lowered tolerance after extended period with no drugs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I have a better explanation above for what comment OP means/proposes, if I do say so myself. </p>
<p>I don't think a change in environment leads to respiratory depression, more that a change in environment --&gt; taking a higher dose --&gt; ODing. My full explanation is in my previous comment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You bring up a very interesting point about environmental cues. I don't have the sources with me but theres some interesting research around Vietnam vets who would take regularly take heroin whilst deployed but faced very little withdrawal or ongoing dependence issues, provided they returned to a strong support system. The ones that came back and continued were ones that returned to environments that would suggest a susceptibility to drug use in the broader population (poverty, instability etc). It's a bit of a simplification, but the psychological aspect definitely cannot be discounted. </p>
<p>The heroin vs environment effect that you mentioned is also very interesting. It's been a while since I studied this but I remember a proposed explanation was an equilibrium type model. The body wants to maintain balance, however environmental cues cause a physiological effect that pushes you below this equilibrium and <em>prime</em> you for taking the drug. This imbalance leads to cravings and <em>pushes</em> back against the drug to act as a tolerance. It was proposed that the new environment didn't elicit these physiological effects, and when heroin users would take their regular dosage, the lack of this <em>pushback</em> from their body lead them to overdose. </p>
<p>Now in terms of interpreting this, a couple of caveats. At best it is a very high level abstraction of a much more complicated problem. Secondly this is based on memory (notoriously unreliable) of something I studied roughly 6 years ago. Nonetheless, it's a thought provoking way of looking at the issue that can open people's perspective of the interplay between environment and physiology with respect to dependence and tolerance. </p></div>		</li>
