<blockquote>
<p>... several sections of this blog category could just as accurately be called Things That Suddenly Want To Turn Back Into Elemental Nitrogen. And thermodynamically, there aren’t many gently sloping paths down to nitrogen gas, unfortunately. Both enthalpy and entropy tilt things pretty sharply. A molecule may be tamed because it just can’t find a way down the big slide, but if it can, well, it’s time to put on the armor, insert the earplugs, and get ready to watch the free energy equation do its thing right in front of your eyes. Your heavily shielded eyes, that is, if you have any sense at all.
Nitro groups are just the kind of bad company I mean, since they both bring their own oxygens to the party and pull electrons around in delightfully destabilizing ways. </p>

<p>From: <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/11/15/things_i_wont_work_with_nitrotetrazole_oxides" target="_blank">http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/11/15/things_i_wont_work_with_nitrotetrazole_oxides</a></p>
<p>Also it has this enjoyable quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The paper mentions that <em>“Introducing N-oxides onto the tetrazole ring may . . . push the limits of well-explored tetrazole chemistry into a new, unexplored, dimension.”</em>, but (of more immediate importance) it may also push pieces of your lab equipment into unexplored parts of the far wall.</p>
