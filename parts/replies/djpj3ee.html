			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. I've got an advanced degree from a small mid western university with a great reputation it the state I'm from, but when I left the state and moved one state over, my job opportunities shriveled. My wife went to an Ivy, and she's a thousand miles from home but has a much stronger network here than I do. It's working to my advantage now, and it is amazing, but I don't think either of us would say that her education was necessarily better than mine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This annoys me. I'd much prefer that you based your decision on MERIT and ABILITY over where someone gets their piece of paper from. You're unfairly biased view of the person results in an otherwise worthy and suitable candidate getting looked over because they couldn't afford to attend Big Name Uni, despite the fact that they have the requisite qualifications and said qualifications should have at minimum the same base level knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>This is why a national qualifications framework like that in Australia works well. At the very minimum you can expect that someone with a degree has the required knowledge and skills to be an engineer or lawyer etc regardless of institution they obtained it at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well this is a silly thing to say. That is exactly what they are doing. They dont know you so they cant base hiring you on merit. Just a bunch of stuff you wrote down on a piece of paper. For all they know your degree came from a degree mill in the middle of nowhere. However, John Smith applying with a degree from the same Ivy League school as me must have taken professors X, Y, and Z whom are all very good. I can vouch for his education so I am going to hire him instead of podunk billy with the degree from the diploma mill. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't have a national qualification framework, I can see how that would be helpful.  In USA, it's up to every state and it depends on the field - if you're a lawyer and want to relocate, you have to pass &quot;the bar&quot; in the new state.  But, with lawyers, it's always best to hire whoever has the best reputation unless it's basic contract work.  I have no idea where my IP lawyer went to school, only that he's litigated and won a bunch of high profile cases plus declined to represent a couple very high profile cases for ethical reasons, so he is well respected by all the judges.  It's interesting how business is done differently in different countries.</p></div>		</li>
