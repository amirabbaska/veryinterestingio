<p>In case the couple had an inter caste wedding then the kid is considered to be of the caste that his father belongs to!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how they did originally. You would change your power by winning a war or growing rich by trading. With the advent of british , this system was codified and ossified and now it is very rare for a community to change their purchasing power. For example, my community was a low caste in the 13th century (not sure before that), then we got power via agricultural land and then won some bunch of wars to become a ruling land owner class.But now there are no wars to win and India has no economic growth until recently, so new groups are not coming up.</p></div>		</li>
