			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm asking how they sync the clocks of both detectors with one another so precisely. </p>
<p>How do you get two clocks that are 2000 miles apart to start at the exact same moment, enabling such precise differences in times between the two to be measured?</p>
<p>Also thanks, I'm having trouble putting my question into words haha</p></div>		</li>
