			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true. There have been simplified variants of Chinese characters for as long as there have been Chinese characters (i.e. dating back to oracle bone script), along with official pushes to standardise and simplify characters, the first major one being the implementation of Small Seal script (小篆) in the Qin dynasty. </p>
<p>Modern simplified characters aren't something 'duh commies' pulled out of thin air, and for the ones they did 'invent' (and I use that term very loosely), they are either based on their cursive counterparts (草书), follow the same logic that has been used throughout Chinese history (for brevity, for lack of a dictionary or lack of standardised characters)  of replacing the complex phonetic component with a simpler one that has the same—or similar—sound, or just omitting parts of the character altogether. In any case, it wasn’t some newfangled invention of the CCP. However, they did originally want to take things a step <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_round_of_simplified_Chinese_characters" target="_blank">further</a> and really bastardise the language, which failed, thank the heavens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s true that they weren’t invented by the communists, but still the communist government first officially adopted the simplification scheme. </p>
<p>The second round was at least better than the Latinization schemes…</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d argue the first simplification scheme was adopted by the Qin dynasty, and in fact the changes from large seal to small seal were arguably greater than Traditional -&gt; Simplified. In any case, it’s not an unprecedented phenomenon unique to the CCP.</p>
<p>You’re definitely right about the Latinisation schemes though, which were originally planned to be the ultimate goal after the second round of simplification. They even toyed with the idea of inventing their own alphabet loosely based on Cyrillic before the Sino-Soviet split. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The above is a quote attributed to someone. The quotation marks are just used to give the phrase emphasis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quotation marks can be used for emphasis. It is called a Scare Quote and is used to express especially skepticism or derision concerning the use of the enclosed word or phrase. </p>
<p>My grammar is terrible so i googled to see if you could do that and turns out you can. Always double check before you get condescending. </p></div>		</li>
