			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question. We focus on taking diagnostics that now happen by specialists - including retinal specialists like myself - and moving that expertise to where the patients are - primary care, family care, general practitioners, retail and pharmacy clinics. The primacy is still on human interaction - essentially giving diagnostic superpowers to these primary care providers. In this model, the specialists do more treatment and less diagnosis. </p>
<p>Another consideration is that AI really is ideally suited for the more prevalent diseases - the less prevalent, the harder it is to prove safety in a clinical trial - and the less bang for your buck.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So for the near future, I see more of this shift from specialty to primary in narrowly defined, highly prevalent diseases. </p>

<p>Farther in the future, the risk you describe exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for a great answer!  This is all
promising, and Iâ€™m glad to hear that the focus remains on freeing up time so docs can enhance their key function: treatment and advancing treatment methodology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In regards to being reliant on the AI, I've been able to see it small scale.</p>
<p>I work in a similar capacity as an EMT and notably one of the people I work with normally does work in clinics and hospitals so he has had access to machines to take vital signs for his entire medical career. I came from a unit where we were taught not to rely on machines because they break when you need them most and in training we have experienced equipment failure and within seconds someone was handing us the blood pressure cuff and stethoscope to do it manually. Long story short he couldn't get a blood pressure on a patient because he didn't remember how to manually.</p>
<p>Reliance on technology to complete even the basic of tasks is a real risk that would have to be mitigated with proper training and experience.</p></div>		</li>
