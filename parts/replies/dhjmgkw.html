			<div class="markdown"><p>You should always try to keep bowel movements as relaxing as possible. Aggressive movements can have some pretty nasty side effects, from the development of hemorrhoids to an anal fissure. Hemorrhoids are quite common as it is, but it is best to avoid them. Anal fissures though are a tear in your lower rectum which can be extremely painful and can take a long time to heal. For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqsXe2tDLHg" target="_blank">Kevin Smith talks about his experience with one</a>, and it sounds like a nightmare. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I have 1 externalized but have had fissure (1 one year, treated, then 2 the next year, treated).  Dr prefers treatment to reduce over operating.</p>
<p>My question is, if fiber is to soften stool, why/how does it work to &quot;solidify&quot; overly soft stool?  (I'm getting too much blood.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this true for fibre too? I've read on the internets about excessiveâ€‹ fibre dependence and constipation. Is there any truth to it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While not a pure &quot;reverse peristalsis&quot;, intestinal obstruction can cause a reversed flow of contents. Think of it like a clogged drain: if you have a clog in your sink, the sink will overflow. If you have a clog somewhere further down the tubing, everything you've sent down the drain is coming right back up... including feces:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also something referred to as a 'mass movement' that the large intestine can undergo. Peristalsis is a big part of digestion, but in the intestine there is also a lot of something called 'segmentation.' Segmentation is the grinding up of food by the intestinal smooth muscle to allow for it to sit long enough for absorption. This occurs in  the small intestine as well. In fact, in your ascending colon, the combined movements of peristalsis and segmentation actually work to move food backwards somewhat, while the transverse and descending colon move it forwards, so you're generally just having food move around in the intestine with some peristaltic pushing here and there. This really allows for maximal absorption, especially of water! Finally, these 'mass movements' act as a sweep of muscular contraction from the cecum to the rectum that pushes all of your intestinal byproducts towards expulsion. Then the urge to defecate comes along and it's all great fun from there!  </p>
