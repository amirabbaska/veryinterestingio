			<div class="markdown"><p>I refuse to use ups due to living in Canada and them charging bogus brokerage fees for things coming from the US. If I order something and the only option for shipping is UPS, I call the shipper and ask if they can send it USPS instead. 2/3 of the time they will do this, even if the option isn't listed on their site. The other times I inform them I won't be purchasing from them because I refuse to deal with UPS.</p>
<p>UPS would change if enough people did this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>UPS is not, so Customs agencies are more of a pain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would they?  I've been doing that for years, and I can assure you others have too.  UPS doesn't know how much business they're losing, and they probably don't care, as cross-border shipping is less profitable to them than domestic US shipping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can promise you they are losing business over this and is a very good reason for them to pursue. The question is how much and whether they realise how much, as companies will not take action unless they see sufficient proof of potential business.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think it's this. For some reason OP thinks doing this to him means that it happens millions of times a day to all their customers.</p></div>		</li>
