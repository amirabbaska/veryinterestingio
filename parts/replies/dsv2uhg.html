			<div class="markdown"><p>Ironically, the original Charles Ponzi had a legitimate way to make money. He had discovered that postal reply coupons could be bought at a discount in Europe, but redeemed at full value back in the US.
It was just never going to sustain the huge levels of &quot;investment&quot; in his scheme.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Charles Ponzi's story is quite interesting. He found that he could make a 400% return on buying postal coupons from Italy which could be exchanged for US stamps. He tried to get money from everywhere to finance this, but got turned down so he went public. He promised wild returns to try to get money for this, and it worked. He got a small group of investors in, and he was so appreciative, he paid them back in a month using the next month's investor money. This of course spurred on a bunch of investors to join in. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, in order to pay back the money he promised, he'd never be able to buy enough of these coupons, and he never had an actual way of selling the stamps. But money was coming in, so he just kept doing his thing. Eventually a financial writer called him out for his clear bullshit but the libel laws were so strong at the time that he actually sued the writer and won $500,000 1920 dollars, so it shut most people up. People saw their accounts constantly going up, so they just left the money in.</p>
<p>He was raking in so much cash that he actually bought a large stake in a bank and was loaning money to his own accounts to keep things afloat. </p>
<p>Finally, someone did some real digging into the financials and the post office also announced that no real buying of the coupons was happening anywhere at all. Ponzi had long realized he'd have to buy tens of millions of these things, bring them in, and sell them somehow. This caused a mass panic of people coming to the office and withdrawing their money, but Ponzi's charming demeanor actually convinced a large amount of people to keep their money in, but $2 million was still withdrawn.</p>
<p>It all came crashing down when a paper had exposed his previous fraud in Montreal, and that doomed him. People wanted out, and of course the money was long gone. He only had a few million and his accounts from the previous run were already getting overdrafted. People were left with about 30 cents on every dollar they had put in, which is incredibly tragic since some people were remortgaging their homes to get those juicy gains.</p>
<p>He of course got arrested and put in federal prison. After serving his sentence, he was tried by Massachusetts. He argued he was being tried for double jeopardy and he had also made a plea deal and sued. This actually went all the way to the Supreme Court, where they ruled that the plea deal was for a federal crime and had no weight in state court. Additionally his federal crime was mail fraud, while the state was charging him with larceny.</p>
<p>Being penniless, he represented himself in court for 10 of 22 counts of larceny and actually won. The jury was indecisive on his second trial, but he was convicted in a third trial.</p>
<p>He headed for Florida out on bail to try a new scam based around land, but of course got exposed pretty quickly. He tried to hop out of the country to Italy, but the ship he was on made one last stop in New Orleans where he was caught again. He went back to MA and served his sentence. </p>
<p>He was then deported to Italy and his wife divorced him. His health failed and he suffered a heart attack and paralysis. He died in a charity hospital in poverty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like a lot of Ponzi schemes start out as trying to make a go of being legit. Then things sort of homey out of control.</p>
<p>We had a con artist take us for a bit of money and valuables and later discovered he’d been working our whole community. The interesting part was that I got to know him pretty well over a period of about 2 years and can say he truly was a generous and big hearted person. Inside I think he knew that and maybe felt he “deserved” the graft he was taking from people because he was so kind and thoughtful. It’s made me duly suspicious of overly nice people, but I’m sort of midwestern that way anyhow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in my garage, just bought this new Lamborghini here. It’s fun to drive up here in the Hollywood hills. But you know what I like more than materialistic things? Knowledge. In fact, I’m a lot more proud of these seven new bookshelves that I had to get installed to hold two thousand new books that I bought. It’s like the billionaire Warren Buffett says, “the more you learn, the more you earn.”</p>
<p>Now maybe you’ve seen my TEDx talk where I talk about how I read a book a day. You know, I read a book a day not to show off it’s again about the knowledge. In fact, the real reason I keep this Lamborghini here is that it’s a reminder. A reminder that dreams are still possible, because it wasn’t that long ago that I was in a little town across the country sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only forty seven dollars in my bank account. I didn’t have a college degree, I had no opportunities.</p>
<p>But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a mentor. And another mentor. And a few more mentors. I found five mentors. And they showed me what they did to become multimillionaires. Again, it’s not just about money, it’s about the good life; health, wealth, love and happiness. </p></div>		</li>
