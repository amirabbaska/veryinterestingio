			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh no, it's a bigger issue than that. If a 'hacker' (hate the word) gains physical access to your car, it's not difficult to make the car randomly stop or start, hit the gas more, speed up, etc. Remotely. A senior thesis group demonstrated it at my university</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really an avenue of attack. Most modern cars have cellular links for a variety of reasons, including downloading software updates. That's where most vulnerabilities lie and that's beyond your control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. I mean, maybe they'll try it eventually, but at least with Android Auto, it's actually a little smarter than that: The car entertainment system is basically just a remote display for your phone, 100% of the software is running on your phone.</p>
<p>Which is important -- the longest Android devices get even security updates (let alone software updates) is 3 years or so, and a 10-year-old PC is a really fucking old PC, but cars last decades. So if the Android Auto standard can actually last that long, you could keep swapping out the brains of your entertainment system every couple years when you upgrade your phone, instead of having to rip out and replace the entire dashboard.</p></div>		</li>
