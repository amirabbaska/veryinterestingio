			<div class="markdown"><p>While Faraday's cage is the safest bet, this also <em>might</em> apply, yes. An EMP is nothing else as a strong electric field, which can be characterized how big the voltage difference is divided by a distance of two points in space, e.g. 50V/m. This field induces the harmful current which kills the electronics. So the shorter all your cables/connections are, the smaller the voltage and the smaller the currents. As soon as you disconnect all equipment you should be left with the device's length as the biggest distance that applies to voltage calculation.<em>  </em> If you have spools inside your device they may be influenced as well, but I don't know how big their influence is on the resulting damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least for solar storm EMP I think the effect does not come from electric field but instead suddenly changing magnetic field (earth's magnetic field bulging around). The power grid acts as a massive coil where current forms.</p></div>		</li>
