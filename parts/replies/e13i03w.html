			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this.  People should also keep mind that added antibacterial agents can do more harm than good in the long run because it causes evolutionary selection to favor bacteria who possess antibiotic resistance genes.  Some people do not wash things properly; if washing with antibiotics, this means that any bacteria still alive after the attempt is likely resistant to whatever was used.</p>
<p>Total sterilization is needed in some settings, such as hospitals, but not everywhere.  Plain soap and sufficiently good washing techniques are generally good enough.</p>
<p>This is also why some products sold as “germ-killing” are scams.  They either kill “99.9%” of germs and leave that 0.1% to happily reproduce with its competition gone, or they are simply unnecessary thanks to the use of soaps and detergents.  For example, that new-ish Lysol product for laundry to be used alongside detergent is basically just adding more chemicals to your sewer or septic system.</p>
<p>Edit: Fixed an error; I had written &quot;possess antibiotics&quot; instead of &quot;possess antibiotic resistance genes&quot;. /facepalm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An addition I would like to make is that this property of soap making the two miscible is the reason that soaps are anti-bacterial. It actually bonds with parts of the cell wall and break them apart, killing the bacteria. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not OP but im pretty sure he means wall. Bacteria have both a cell wall AND a membrane. The cell wall is vital to them. It basically resists pressure (so they can become turgid or bulge without breaking or popping) and acts like, well... a wall. It protects it from outside forces wishing harm to it. </p>
<p>The cell wall is mostly made of sugar and contains different molecules which help make It sturdier. In some bacteria, the cell wall can even make them extremely resistant to things like anti-biotics ( if youre a TB bacteria for example). In the case of TB i believe its mycolic acid that makes the wall so resistant but im not sure. </p>
<p>So basically, soap helps merge the cell wall, membrane and intracellular matrix into one giant bacteria slurry that will wash away. The process of merging or destroying the cell wall also kills the bacteria since it no longer has its extra capsule of protection against outside stuff.</p></div>		</li>
