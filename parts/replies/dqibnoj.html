			<div class="markdown"><p>So CJD is thought to be caused by prions, or misfolded proteins that catalyze the misfolding of other proteins. These prions can enter the body through things like dura grafts or corneal transplants. They can also enter through the consumption of meat containing these prions. How exactly consumed prions cross the BBB is a subject of current research, but we do know that they do indeed cross.    </p>
