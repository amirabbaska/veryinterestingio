			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this
Is totally does it justice, the fibers are strong because they are formed from stiff crystalline segments and non crystalline flexible segments of beta sheets formed of proteine polymers. Interestingly some post processing is done in the spiders abdomen before it is excreted so it cannot be produced recombinantly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To come correct, it IS now being made through a fermentation process into a material called Spiber.  North Face made a freaky spider parka already, and Patagonia are getting their silk from a different company called Bolt Threads.  Fools used to have to extract it from recombinant goat milk but now they've taught microbes to make it, which is nice.  </p>
<p>Dude was right about the crystallinity of the beta sheets.  It's like imagine strong hemp rope pieced together by rubber bands that just loosen and absorb shock before recoiling.</p>
<p>Still a long way from an organ that shoots the stuff out of our wrists instantaneously.  Baby steps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a quick correction, the beta sheet crystals are part of the crystalline domain, which is considered to contribute to the strength of the fibers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They genetically engineer yeast to produce silk proteins instead of alcohol. Then they run a brewing process just like you would for beer. Science is crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have always wondered how great it would be to genetically modify cotton plants or something to produce spider silk. Then you have field of this stuff to be collected.
I do remember hearing they did something similar with goat milk maybe. Engineered it so the milk produced silk as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We already do this kind of thing with silk worms, which make similar fibers. It's just much more difficult with spiders because they are much more mobile, and produce string at different rates and will only use it given the proper circumstances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention genetically modified goats. Their milk contains the proteins produced in the silk and can be harvested in larger quantities. I've got several friends at my university who work with them in labs and they're adorable if you don't think about the mutant spider genes buried inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the worms leave the silk inside nice packages (when we murder them for it) allowing for easy collection. Spider webs on the other hand are not as easy to collect.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I recall correctly a guy made a shot of armor out of spider webs. But at the cost of thousands of man hours.</p>
<p>I will edit this and post a link if I find it.</p></div>		</li>
