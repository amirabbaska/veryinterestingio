			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree on the stability and power factors, but helicopters cannot &quot;do more&quot; than a quad, except for lift capacity/efficiency.  Quads (Freestyle, at least) are faster, more responsive, and capable of all the same maneuvers of a helicopter, if not more.  Are they easier to control?  That's really a personal opinion, not an objective fact.  Some people can kill it with LOS helicopters, and some people can hit gaps at insane speeds through an FPV cam.  It's all their preference.</p></div>		</li>
