			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate, mirror neurons start firing when they recognize a particular physical action, whether that is an action someone else performs or you perform - it's almost as if they don't distinguish between yourself and others. (These are separate from the neurons which actually <em>trigger</em> or perform the movement.)</p>
<p>This is part of why humans can learn to mimic each other (to an extent) simply by watching. This is also hypothesized to be part of our ability to empathize and recognize emotion in others, but the research on that front isn't particularly extensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate further, there is actually a small signal that actually propagates its way down the pathway of replicating the movement, and which can be picked up by EMGs (electrodes that pick up electrical activity on muscles).  The body normally suppresses this signal, but sometimes the suppression is incomplete and you physically replicate a small version of the action that you see.  This is why you don't fully punch when you see a punch, but why you can have the small twitch.</p></div>		</li>
