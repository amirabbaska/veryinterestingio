			<div class="markdown"><p>I often think about it. I've tried to do smooth panning shots every couple days for years now.  I've gotten pretty good at the movement, but I can't focus on anything while I'm doing it.  Similar to you, I basically have to forget about the actual vision part of it and only focus on conscious control of the muscles themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A way I train myself to do this is during a long car ride (not driving of course) by trying to look straight out into the moving background without having my eyes focus on one thing and making sure not to lose overall focus. Its sort if like forcing your eyes to learn to move smoothly, still hard though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same, no problem. What I can't do (smoothly at least) is going up-down/down-up.</p></div>		</li>
