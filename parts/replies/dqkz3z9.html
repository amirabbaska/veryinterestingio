this example implies that if you go in a straight line in our universe you eventually end up where you started, nobodoy knows if thats true</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would have a shape, but us existing as 2d beings in this example would cause us to be unable to realistically measure the shape. Imagine existing in a painting on the wall, you can't fully understand the picture unless you can step outside the frame. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could say that about any object in 2D. The shapes of objects in 2D would still be valuable information for anyone existing in 2D. They say that maybe there are more dimensions in our universe than we can perceive but the 3D shape of objects here are still important. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer to that is that the universe probably does have a shape, but only in some weirdly higher number of dimensions, I think 12 of them according to String Theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure everything has a different shape in 12D. But I think adding all this speak of unknowable extra dimensions(while super interesting!) doesn't actually help to explain the question at hand. Unless those extra dimensions have a causal relationship on the shape of the universe in 3D.</p>
<p>Like if I ask what's the shape of an unknown object in a box. Talking about  it's 4th-12th dimensions doesn't help describe what's in the box unless they somehow affect what's in there or make what's in the box unknowable or some such thing.</p></div>		</li>
