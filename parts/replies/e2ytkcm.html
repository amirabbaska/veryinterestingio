			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only real answer. Many top comments explain it as if vinegar alone cannot dissolve iron oxide but this is not true. We can talk about (iron oxide + aluminium ion = iron ion + aluminium oxide) equation all day but in the end, it does not answer the question without the word equilibrium.</p>
<p>Vinegar does not require aluminium in order to dissolve iron oxide into its respective ions. It does that on its own, it just reaches equilibrium before any significant amount is dissolved. Adding the aluminium continuously displaces the dissolved particles and allows the process to continue without reaching equilibrium.</p></div>		</li>
