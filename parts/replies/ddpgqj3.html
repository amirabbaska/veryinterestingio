			<div class="markdown"><p>'Kokoretsi' is a greek delicacy served in Easter time.
It's basically kidneys,heart,liver wrapped by sheep's intestines.
But to prepare it, housewives buy the intestines and turn them inside out in order to clean them.
Needless to say, the whole house then smells like total crap.
But the taste of them when grilled over a fire is amazing!</p></div>		</li>
