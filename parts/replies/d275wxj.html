<p>It says most mirrors are &quot;faintly green&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: It's the glass I guess, not the actual &quot;mirror&quot; part</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct, most glass has iron oxide impurities that cause a green tint (especially if you look at the side of a pane). You can get low-iron glass which will be more clear, but expect it to cost extra.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it is because the glass, but in the end, it affects the mirror itself, sinde the reflecion of the greens are better than the rest of colors, try to put a mirror in front of the otrher mirror, and in the end the reflection will be more greenish for each cicle.-</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true.  A good way to see this is to stand between two mirrors.  It'll look like the mirrors go on forever and each time they do, they'll get more and more green looking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because the glass does not transmit all optical frequencies equally, green is absorbed less than other colours, so everything seems slightly green, and the thicker the glass, the more green it seems, which is why looking down the side of a pane seems more green than looking through the face. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Common household mirrors are a thin layout of silver on the back of a pane of glass</p>

<p>I think it's notable that silver isn't used in most mirrors today, only high end stuff, most likely only lab equipment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you are right, since silver reacts with oxygen over time and turns dark, making the mirror useless. aluminium is less sensitive to oxygen, just look at your bike, it doesnt give a fuck about water or air or anything really.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really correct. Aluminum oxidizes, but once an aluminum oxide coating has formed it doesn't react further like iron oxide does. Aluminum oxide is also transparent without impurities (sapphire and ruby are crystalline forms of aluminum oxide, and only have color because of impurities) so the oxide layer would actually protect the aluminum mirror from further corrosion. </p>
<p>Also, a lot of aluminum bike frames are probably anodized, which when you deposit an intentional aluminum oxide layer (usually a fairly thick one) to prevent corrosion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fuck are you on about. The only reason aluminium doesn't corrode like a motherfucker is it forms a layer of oxide that prevents it, which is very much not shiny. It does it really quick, too.</p></div>		</li>
