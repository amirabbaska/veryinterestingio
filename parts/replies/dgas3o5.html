			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate that you broke the question down into the following postulate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You read about other people in strange situations &gt; this helps extend your suspension of disbelief &gt; this expands your imagination &gt; this allows you to easier accept real world situations that are otherwise different than yours </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think going off of this, the question starts moving towards the social sciences for the reasons you stated (how do you measure empathy?). </p>
<p>And if we look at a couple of the social theories that are out there, a lot of them can be applied to this question. </p>
<p><strong>Social Cognitive Theory</strong>: posits that an individual’s knowledge acquisition can be directly related to observing others in the context of social interactions, experiences, and outside media influences. Individuals will observe a model performing a certain behavior, and then use that information to guide their subsequent behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li>We could probably make a case for a fiction novel to be used as a model for behavior, which can thus change a person's behavior/empathy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Theory of normative social behavior</strong>: posits that there are  three mechanisms—injunctive norms, outcome expectations, and group identity—that are hypothesized to moderate the influence of descriptive norms on behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li>This theory is most known for <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093650205275385" target="_blank">testing college students' alcohol consumption based on perceived normative behaviors.</a> We could also make a case for reading literary fiction as a form of feedback to change what someone perceives is the norm. </li>
</ul>
<p>So while this isn't quite hard science, the social sciences might be able to shed a little bit of light into possibilities of how literary fiction can affect someone's behaviors (and potentially empathy).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Aristotle's <em>Poetics,</em> one of the powers he ascribes to tragedy occurs in the communal situation of seeing/watching the tragedy - an individual is not only engaging in <em>catharsis</em> (the purgation of powerful emotions like pity and fear), but also adusting/fine tuning affective, emotional response in relation to the audience, the reactions of the witnessing characters, and those involved  the tragedy itself. </p>
<p>This means that tragedy, for Aristotle, held a socially important function in helping individuals to socialize (and learn to regulate their emotions, like empathy) through the communal experience of watching tragedy on stage.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's quite interesting, I actually would have thought the logic might flow like this:</p>
<p>you read about other people in strange situations &gt; you read about their thoughts, motivations, interactions, and reactions &gt; this augments your mental database of how and why other people's logic/emotions may differ or may be similar to your own, perhaps even why on the surface it may differ but deep down the roots are similar &gt; you are better able to understand the thoughts and feelings of real people you encounter</p>
<p>I think the questions you pose are interesting, and I'd add on: is it the process of reading or is it the character-driven narrative? Are there similar effects in different mediums (tv, movies, music)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I don't think it has to exclusively be books.  Any medium that asks you to identify and empathize with people who are different than you.  Whether it's movies, videogames, music, etc.  </p>
<p>Video games are especially interesting because you're often given a form of agency, which means you can decide how relationships play out.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That same path of logic could flow completely opposite as well:</p>
<p>you read exclusively about people like you &gt; you read about their thoughts, motivations, interactions, and reactions and realize how similar they are to yourself &gt; this reinforces your own beliefs and makes it harder for you to accept others' experiences &gt; you see everyone else's life experience as exaggerated with the intent to make your own experience less valid &gt; you work against others trying to tell others about their personal experience and trying to get people to understand others outside their own nationality/religion/race/gender/age/socio-economic status</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could be a reason why literary fiction specifically has this effect, since (very broadly speaking) it tends to be more focused on challenging the reader's beliefs and morals than other genres. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure if you strapped someone up to a EEG and got them to feel empathic while you were monitoring them then you could prove if someone was truly more or less empathic.</p></div>		</li>
