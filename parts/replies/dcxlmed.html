			<div class="markdown"><p>My family is Chinese, but I was born in the US so my Chinese is really bad. I just have a quick question: Sometimes, my parents will tell me to get &quot;两个&quot; of something, and then when I bring them two they get annoyed and say they want more. Can &quot;两&quot; mean just &quot;some&quot; or &quot;several&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In formal/written Chinese, 两 refers to exactly two of something, but in casual/spoken Chinese, 两 can also be used to mean &quot;a few&quot;, &quot;some&quot;, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they're asking you to get 两个 of something, it should only mean two.</p>
<p>I'm in a very similar situation as you. I was born in the US but my parents are both Chinese natives. I can speak somewhat fluently but I could barely read or write it until I picked up Chinese as an elective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japanese has a similar number thing, I think--the number for people (and for certain other things) is different from the numeral. I sort of learned most of my (numeral) numbers, at least through the thousands (spoken, not written)...that's as much as anyone was getting out of me. :-) Fortunately, holding up fingers is tremendously effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because Japanese borrowed Chinese numbering system entirely for numbers (called 漢数字) but still use its original 和文 for counting people. Originally, there were 和文 numbers as well but not used in modern day Japanese anymore. For example, number 2 as a number is に which is a borrowed word of 二 in Chinese (In southern China, 二 is still pronounced as &quot;ni&quot; similar to Japanese). But two people is ふたり in which ふた is &quot;two&quot; in 和文. When you say twenty-two in Japanese, it is に じゅう に which is actually Chinese. The 和文 twenty-two would be  はたち (twenty) あまり (the rest) ふたつ (two). Some of the 和文 forms of counting numbers are so archaic that there is no way to actually prove how they were actually counted (especially those larger numbers that were rarely used in the ancient time). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Japanese does have something similar. They're called counter words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using the wrong measure word is actually a fairly common mistake that children or new speakers make, because specific nouns require specific measure words (sort of like how we say 'a gaggle of geese' versus a 'herd of cows'). For instance, to build on Mingly's examples, when referring to people you'd say 几个人, but if referring to cars, you wouldn't use 个 as the measure word. You'd use &quot;liang&quot; or 辆 which is a vehicle-specific measure word.</p></div>		</li>
