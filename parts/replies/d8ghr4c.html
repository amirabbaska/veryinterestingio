			<div class="markdown"><p>Milk drunkard here, not the raw type but regular store bought. I think people drinking raw milk does it because of the bacteria present in unpasteurised, unboiled milk. Live and dead bacteria, and pretty much anything else. Think probiotics.</p>
<p>On a related note, it's a fact that for centuries every family that could afford at least a cow, drinked the raw milk of its cow(s) with little to no problem. All members get their immune system trained to assimilate and keep the complex bacterial flora from the milk at safe levels. A biological equilibrium was reached. This is not possible when the milk of many cows is mixed in large scale plants, and it's why isn't safe to drink raw milk of dubious origin for sensitive people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These naturalist arguments ignore the fact that people used to die at insane rates from disease. Just because your grandma drank raw milk as a kid does not mean it's safe, even with consistent, long-term exposure. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Have you ever even been near an actual farm, and seen the milking of cows? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have seen commercial dairies.  Those cows are just covered in their own shit.  Like knee deep.  The farms that produce this &quot;raw milk&quot; usually have like 1-10 cows.  So the poop problem isn't that big of a problem.  The grass fed aspect produces a different type of gut bacteria in the cow and so the milk has different stuff in it too.  Not super sure about the diet compared to corn fed cows in relation to amount or type of bacteria though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could you be more specific exactly what bacteria are bad that are more common in corn-fed than in grass-fed cows? Please cite scientific studies.</p></div>		</li>
