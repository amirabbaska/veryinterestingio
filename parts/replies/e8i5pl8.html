			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read that this effect was big enough in some rotary engine planes of the era that if pilots weren't properly trained on how to handle it, they would actually be at risk of losing control of their aircraft. I also read that they exploited the effect as part of their strategy during dogfights, playing to the fact that they could use the engine's gyroscopic effect to enhance handling during some maneuvers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gyroscopic effect isn't the size of the engine, it's the mass that is rotating.  As /u/Coomb points out, the rotary engines were real bastards of this.  Unlike other engines, the crankshaft is stationary and the rest of the engine rotates.  Plus, many of those old planes had big wooden propellers spinning up front.  The gyroscopic effect didn't go away as engines got more powerful, the props on WW2 fighters were heavy and a fighter pilot who jammed on the power too quickly could find himself out of control very quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also related to how far out the mass is from the center of rotation, the engine mass is farther out than the crankshaft so it takes less mass to get the same effect there as it does in the crankshaft, for example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you quickly pitch up with a high power setting, the airplane will yaw left (90 degrees to the axis of the pitch rotation. Same as happens when you rotate a gyroscope.</p></div>		</li>

<p>From the perspective of the pilot, the propeller is spinning clockwise, which makes the plane want to roll to the left.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general terms, propeller torque causes the aircraft to roll in the opposite direction as the propeller is spinning.</p>
<p>On ground, this causes a weight transfer to one side landing gear, which means it will have more rolling resistance, and induces a slight yaw towards that side. Once the aircraft becomes airborne, however, propeller torque itself only affects the aircraft on roll axis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also the fact that because of the relative motion of the plane and prop in the air, the downward part of the propeller's cycle (i.e., the right side) moves more air than the upward (left) part. This makes the plane want to yaw left.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is called P-factor, and it's actually closely related to what in helicopters causes retreating blade stall.</p>
<p>If the propeller's axis is completely aligned with the airspeed vector, then the blades of the propeller produce the same amount of lift everywhere during their rotation.</p>
<p>However, if you have some angle of attack (or significant slip angle), then the propeller disc is tilted relative to the airflow. This means that at one side, the propeller blades are <em>advancing</em> and on the other side they're <em>retreating</em>. The <em>advancing</em> propeller blades thus have <em>higher airspeed</em>, which causes them to produce more lift than the <em>retreating</em> propeller blades, causing the blades to have more or less thrust depending on what direction they're moving.</p>
<p>In negative AoA situations, the P-factor is actually reversed. And in high slip angle situations, the P-factor can cause pitch-up or pitch-down moments, although this is usually not significant for conventional aircraft because slip angles on yaw axis are relatively small compared to the angle of attack on pitch axis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the turbulent air flow off the prop affects the tail more strongly on the left than the right, also making the plane want to yaw left.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The propeller produces airflow, which turns helically around the fuselage of the aircraft. For conventional aircraft this means that there's a kind of &quot;wind&quot; pushing on the side of the vertical stabilizer, which causes some yaw tendency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of these are corrected with a bit of right trim in the ailerons and rudder, or compensated for manually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On certain aircraft, compensation is already built into the aircraft's design through some asymmetric aerodynamics - though usually only aircraft with extremely powerful engines on very small airframes require this. I know for a fact that the Messerschmitt Bf 109 had its vertical stabilizer slightly tilted to one side to negate some of the yaw tendencies, and the Macchi C.200, C.202 and C.205 series aircraft actually had one wing slightly longer than the other.</p>
<p>But yeah, the usual method of correcting roll and yaw tendencies is by aileron and rudder trims, respectively.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought it had more to do with the difference in angle of attack between the prop blades. Advancing and retreating blades are more applicable to rotary wing aircraft. In a climb a prop driven aircraft's nose is angled up. The angle of the prop blades, however, remains constant relative to one another no matter the pitch attitude of the aircraft. That means in a climb the descending blade (on the right for clockwise prop rotation) takes a bigger bite of air than the ascending blade, creating more thrust on the right side than the left. This pulls the nose to the left. Extreme yaw angle has the same effect on pitch; yaw to the left and blade at the top takes a bigger bite causing a pitch down, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Here's a good graphic to aid in understanding:</p>

<p>It is, but the difference in angle of attack between advancing and retreating propeller blades is <em>caused</em> by their speed difference relative to the airflow.</p>
<p>The way I see it, the AoA difference and airspeed difference between the blades are connected, and depending on whether the propeller blade disc is more &quot;vertical&quot; or more &quot;horizontal&quot; relative to the airflow, you can <em>simplify</em> it as being <em>more</em> related to the AoA (vertical disc of aircraft propeller) or <em>more</em> related to the airspeed difference (horizontal disc of a helicopter propeller). But there's no strictly defined &quot;boundary&quot; where one thing becomes the other - they are manifestations of the same thing, that being asymmetric disc loading.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't understand the graphic one bit.</p>
<p>And after reading your reply to the other person I can't figure-out if you are agreeing or disagreeing.  It also sounds like you are over-complicating things somehow.</p>
<p>Also, ascending / descending isn't necessarily a function of the aircraft pitch angle, as evidenced by the fact that the less power you put to the engines the more likely you are to drift down (e.g. when landing), although this then affects wind flow on the tail making it want to tilt the aircraft.  Similarly with climbing where the plane can be flat yet have enough airflow to create lift.</p>
<p>So, what I believe the previous poster was saying was much like landing situations where the craft is relatively level yet gliding down causing air to flow over the prop blades at an angle which creates situations helicopters are familiar with... advancing and retreating blades creating imbalanced thrust making the prop want to pull to one side.</p></div>		</li>
