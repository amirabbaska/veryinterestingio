			<div class="markdown"><p>The approximately 24 hour day that we know is called a solar day, and the 4 minute shorter day is called a stellar day.</p>
<p>edit:  Just as a ball park calculation to see why it's four minutes shorter: with respect to the sun, in 365 days, the Earth rotates 366 times (365 times around its own axis, and once due to its orbit). With respect to itself, the Earth rotates 365 times in that time. So the following two ratios should be about the same:</p>
<p>366/(24*60) = 0.254166...</p>
<p>365/(24*60-4) = 0.254178...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why the night sky changes throughout the year. Each day, the stars have moved about 4 minutes to the West when viewed at the same time of night. Not coincidentally, 4 X 365 / 60 = 365.333... That .333 is why we need leap years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. After one solar year, the earth has made 366.25 rotations relative to the universe. But since the earth is rotating around the sun in the same direction, we experience only 365.25 sunsets each year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>put a chair in the middle of the room. look at the chair. spin yourself in a circle (pirouette) and end looking at the chair again.  Thats 360 degrees. </p>
<p>Now spin yourself in a circle, while simultaneously taking a step around the room, and still end up facing the chair. Because you moved around the room you have to turn further than 360 degrees to end up facing the chair again.   (If you walk around the room the &quot;wrong&quot; way, it will be less than 360 degrees, if you walk around it the &quot;right&quot; way, it will be more than 360 degrees)</p>
<p>So if you keep spinning and going around you could count two things</p>
<p>1) How many times did I look straight at the chair. (solar day)
2) How many times did I spin in a complete circle (360 degrees)</p>
<p>Those are two different numbers. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Grab two identical coins and lay them side by side on a table. Hold one of them in place and rotate the other around it so their surfaces are always in contact. </p>
<p>Notice how one full revolution around the stationary coin is two full rotations of the coin you're moving? It's like that.  Try it with differently sized coins. Imagine the coin you're rotating is earth and that the top of it is where you live. It's noon when the top of the coin faces the sun and midnight at the bottom. </p>
<p>About half a year from now, the sun will be on the other side of the earth. At that point, if we have done an whole number of full rotations (these are the 23h56m periods mentioned in the post), it will be night where it used to be day. The extra 4 minutes is the time it takes earth's rotation to catch up to the sun's new position in the sky. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Put yourself in the &quot;north&quot; side of earth looking down on the planet. It spins counter clockwise. Now zoom out and you will see it orbits*(edit from rotates) around the sun counter clockwise. So it is like a tire rolling in the same direction it is moving. So in the end the earth would have rotated around itself approx. 366 times. But one of them is not felt because it is &quot;spread out&quot; all around the entire year orbit. Making us feel 365. More or less. I think. Don't know if that helped. Happy Friday!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. <em>Around</em> the axis, <em>relative to</em> the universe. </p>
<p>In order to know that the Earth has made a full rotation, you need to place a dot on the Earth, place a dot on some other object that you call &quot;stationary&quot;, note the relative positions of the two dots at some moment, and wait until they return to the same position. The moment when the dots return to the same relative position marks one rotation of Earth <em>relative</em> to the other object with a dot.</p>
<p>A dot on the Earth is simple, stick a telescope in the ground, that would be your dot. The other dot would be a distant star. Pick a nice bright one. You place the telescope such that its field of view is centred directly at the star, and lock it in place. Notice the current time. Now wait until the star comes to the centre of the telescope field of view again. Notice the time again. What will be the interval between the two time marks?</p>
<p>Earth's axis of rotation is an imaginary line, and even if you could mark a dot on it, it wouldn't ever change its position relative to your telescope. So it doesn't make sense to talk about rotations &quot;relative&quot; to the axis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, this is handled by leap seconds rather than leap years.</p>
<p>Leap seconds adjust the daytime so sunrise isn't eventually at 2PM.</p>
<p>Leap years adjust the seasons so spring isn't eventually in September (in the northern hemisphere).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Leap years handle the discrepancy between the solar year and solar days, with a complete solar year being 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 46 seconds. That's 365.242199074 days, which means that the solar/tropical year isn't in line with an even number of solar days, causing the calendar to drift relative to the seasons.<br />
I could cover all the complicated rules and maths involved, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkt_wmRKYNQ" target="_blank">[this video]</a> handles it pretty well, explaining the history of leap years and how we <em>could</em> do better.<br />
edit: My numbers are different from the video (by about 800ms) because I asked Google instead of referencing the video for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, that's why a leap year is cancelled every century. But that's not quite accurate either, so we bring one back every 400 years. I learn this before Google when I ran into an example in the old classic c programming book by Kernighan and Ritchie. Didn't know leap year does that and the equation puzzle me for a bit. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Moons in a retrograde or a very low orbit will instead be moved closer to the planet, and eventually collide with it. Phobos may hit Mars within the next hundred millions years, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there are also shorter-term variations in how fast Earth rotates. On the scale of decades, the rotation can easily speed up, as indeed it has - it hit a low point in the early 70s and then a peak around 2003. Now it seems to be slowing down again, making leap seconds more common.</p></div>		</li>
