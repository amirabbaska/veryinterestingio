<p>...In the early days of accelerator-based radiotherapy there were some accidents where a machine accidentally delivered a dose ~100Ã— higher and faster than intended...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thought of this incident when I saw the topic.  If I remember right the malfunction was due to a simple machine programming error, and ended up being the reason behind regulation for why machinery had to be designed with mechanical safeguards that would make it difficult, if not impossible, to accidentally operate in a dangerous manner.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it was a sad case.  It was one of the first fully computer-controlled therapy machines, and back then people apparently had huge amounts of faith in computers being flawless so they removed many simple electrical/mechanical safety features in favor of letting the computer supervise everything and handle safety.  Their code was ill-conceived and riddled with massive bugs.</p>
<p>Now we know to only trust software so far, and machines are built as much as is possible to be physically incapable of making errors like that one.  Software also goes through <em>extensive</em> QA processes.  We also do tons of end-to-end tests to catch potential (rare) errors before they reach a patient.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Actually, the code was problematic in several ways, but not especially buggy.  It was cut and pasted from other systems, but the other systems had hardware interlocks that masked problems with the code.  Therac did not have hardware interlocks, so only the code interlocks were used.</p>
<p>Ultimately the problem with the machine wasn't the code itself, it was the engineering and validation processes around the production and use of the machine.</p>

<p>The system noticed that something was wrong and halted the X-ray beam, but merely displayed the word &quot;MALFUNCTION&quot; followed by a number from 1 to 64. The user manual did not explain or even address the error codes, so the operator pressed the P key to override the warning and proceed anyway.</p>

<p>If that doesn't show liability on part of the companies part then I don't know what does.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A lethal dose only adds as much heat to a body as drinking a cup of coffee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not the radiation therapy expert, but I'm pretty sure you're off by a couple of orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>A 1 dl cup of coffee, consumed at 30 K above body temperature, would add 12.6 kJ of heat energy.</p>
<p>That same amount of energy in the form of X-rays delivered to an 80 kg body, would result in 157 Sv. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a guess: they would likely immediately be unconscious and dead within minutes, if not immediately. We don't have much data except in animal models beyond 54 Sv in a short period of time. Boris Korchilov on the Soviet sub K-19 received that dose, you can look him up for more info. Anything higher, and you might want to check animal test case studies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brain cancer patient here, you know when the radiation is turned on. My tumor bed is in my occipital and parietal lobe. When the radiation was being dosed by the IMRT machine I saw bright flashes of light in my affected visual sector and the world smelled like ozone. It wasn't pleasant, but the stereotypical radiation sickness didn't kick in untill much later like you would expect. The vision stuff and ozone smell are pretty common side effects and I tested it once with the nurses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ER nurse here. Never been zapped by radiation directly, but I've always thought the area around the machines, especially near MRI and CT machines, had an unusual smell--kind of like ozone or something. Maybe it's just me. I always notice it when I wheel patients back to be scanned, though.</p></div>		</li>
