			<div class="markdown"><p>It might hold heat very well, but I still don't see how somebody would be able to survive in sub-freezing temperatures wearing nothing but deer hair &amp; skin (keeping in mind, deer don't have any underwear or multiple layers like people normally wear). Even an incredibly fat guy would freeze after a couple weeks of exposure without without wearing layers (assuming no shelter, fire, etc). Maybe I'm wrong, but I assume there must be some other bio mechanisms at play. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brown fat content is the major difference. It's my bedtime, but if you google that you can see how some smaller creatures living in Arctic environments can maintain a body core temperature that is energy intensive. Generally speaking it's much more efficient to grow bigger as you go colder, but some rodents just get more brown fat instead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just think of their coat+fat as a bunch of layers. Except the coat is a biologically made, extremely efficient coat comparable to wearing a waterproof jacket with a insulating jacket on the inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention in a colder climate they'd have a bit extra fat to keep the heat in. It's more than just the fur/hair.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At OP: The other big thing aside from deerskin being warm for us (warmer than you'd think) is that while alive, deer can do the equivalent of goose bumps. They can slightly adjust the 'angle' of each hair from &quot;all laying flat like a carpet&quot; to &quot;all slightly raised, creating more like bubble wrap&quot;. All those little air pockets (each hair has one around it, literally) can be 'held' at several degrees warmer than surrounding atmosphere and reduce the amount of energy a deer needs to produce to fight heat loss; something in the same way that wearing a knit cap can keep your ears warmer than simply pulling up a hood on a jacket/hoodie. Lots of small air pockets are much more effective than one big one!</p></div>		</li>
