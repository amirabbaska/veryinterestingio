			<p>It might hold heat very well, but I still don't see how somebody would be able to survive in sub-freezing temperatures wearing nothing but deer hair &amp; skin (keeping in mind, deer don't have any underwear or multiple layers like people normally wear). Even an incredibly fat guy would freeze after a couple weeks of exposure without without wearing layers (assuming no shelter, fire, etc). Maybe I'm wrong, but I assume there must be some other bio mechanisms at play. </p>		</li>

			<p>Brown fat content is the major difference. It's my bedtime, but if you google that you can see how some smaller creatures living in Arctic environments can maintain a body core temperature that is energy intensive. Generally speaking it's much more efficient to grow bigger as you go colder, but some rodents just get more brown fat instead. </p>		</li>

			<p>Just think of their coat+fat as a bunch of layers. Except the coat is a biologically made, extremely efficient coat comparable to wearing a waterproof jacket with a insulating jacket on the inside.</p>		</li>

			<p>Actually deer, like huskies, prefer cooler temperatures than humans. If it is too hot in the winter, deer will avoid moving to stay cool, but will move once it cools down. That's why this hunting season wasn't to good for me.</p>		</li>
