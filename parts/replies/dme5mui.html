<p>For example, carnivores will eat organs and entrails, while most of the time humans throw these out. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a relatively recent thing though. In first world countries our grandparents or great-grandparents still used to eat almost all parts of a slaughtered animal. There also were a lot of cooking recipes about those.</p>
<p>This was even more prevalent in areas that tended to be 'poor' and struggling and where meat was rare and precious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In México is fairly common to eat pork lungs, guts, skin, stomach, testicles, matrix, intestines, etc. We call it &quot;Carnitas&quot; (little meats). At least in Monterrey, we cook the entire pig in a closed grill, is called &quot;Lechón al Ataúd&quot; (pig to the coffin). We are not struggling at all and meat is the most common food in the region, we just love to grill.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So it's still out there, and not just poor food, but people like me need to learn to appreciate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add that most animals that we consider to be plant eaters are in reality opportunistic omnivores. Deer for example eat small birds as well as the intestine and organs of other animals and even deer (so they show cannibalistic behavior as well) that is left behind by hunters. True vegans and carnivores are very rare in the animal kingdom. </p></div>		</li>

<p>To give people an idea of how rare this is, I tried to create a short list of obligate carnivores for this post, but I'm having a hard time finding any obligate carnivores other than felids and snakes that live on land. They're almost exclusively aquatic.</p></div>		</li>

In the European country I come from, liver, kidney and lungs are considered especially suited to children and I had them all the time as a kid, still do, in fact. Brain, heart and intestines are less common, but still widely eaten.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Croatia we eat lamb (small intestine) and beef (parts of stomach) tripe, lamb, beef, pork, chicken livers, chicken gizzards (stomachs), even anglerfish tripe in some expensive restaurants. </p>
<p>Any time we spit roast a lamb, we eat the kidneys and brain too, and grill the liver and lungs while we're waiting for the lamb to finish roasting. Some people also eat the testicles, or as they are called &quot;white kidneys&quot;. I was always squeamish so I never tried it, but I wouldn't be opposed to try it now.  </p>
<p>Veal &quot;whitebreads&quot; too, which is the thymus gland, and is deep fried. Tastes similar to brain, it's very nice.</p>
<p>These are not everyday foods for most people, except liver probably, which is the most common I think, but I like all of it, and often make tripe stew, chicken gizzard stew, liver, etc. </p>
<p>I think some of the best foods in the world are made from offal. I'm just dying to try authentic Haggis some day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>also the tongue is a delicacy (to me, it's just the bomb), served usually with <a href="http://i.imgur.com/V9tLX7k.jpg" target="_blank">bagnetto verde</a> (a mostly garlic, parsley and oil sauce)</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/zfTvzUu.jpg" target="_blank">trippa</a> (stomach) is very common in many regions</p>
<p>liver I don't even think should be included in the list, it's widely used and delicious on its own and when slow cooked with onions it's just the end of the world</p>
<p>of course blood too is used for many many things, from desserts to sausages</p>
<p>there are many more but I have a short memory </p></div>		</li>
