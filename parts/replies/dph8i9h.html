			<div class="markdown"><p>I know I'm asking the obvious answer here,but ...aren't they fundamentally the same? The culvature of space and time ?One is relatively stationary the other is a &quot;hop&quot; in said waves like the sea waves?One being a constant force the other being an &quot;updown&quot; change in that force-stream of gravity ?I just realized I don't know why are gravity waves are caused from black hole collisions ..</p></div>		</li>
