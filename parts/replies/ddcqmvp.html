			<div class="markdown"><p>It is important to point out that the model s production line was hugely inefficient. Elon Musk has apparently been hitting himself for not realising the importance of optimizing the production line earlier. The model 3 production line is probably going to be an order of magnitude quicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Programming as a whole will take quite a while until it is fully automated, as that needs essentially human level general intelligence and we don't have anything close to that. What we have in AI right now is essentially replicating the human sensory system, we have AI that can identify objects in pictures or words in sound sequences, but we don't have anything with a general understanding of the world that puts all those sensory perceptions together.</p>
<p>When you look at the broader field of IT however things are already getting automated away, not due to AI, but due to software-as-a-service and the cloud. 15 years ago you needed to rent a physical server and administer it manually, these days you can rent computing power and virtual disk space as a service. The underlying physical hardware has been mostly abstracted away and in turn the jobs that used to maintain those hardware have been made obsolete.</p>
<p>This isn't exactly leading to a shortage on IT jobs just yet, as IT as a field is growing and compensating for those losses. But to understand that IT won't be a job provider forever you just have to look at something like WhatsApp, you have a company valued at almost $20 billions, serving one billion customer, yet they employ a total of only around 50 people. Software and hardware has become so scalable that it just doesn't need a whole lot of people to kept it running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that it will take quite a while until programming has been fully automated, but programming is a constantly improving field. We get better languages (suited for specific jobs or &quot;easier&quot; general purpose languages), better IDEs, more predeveloped tools and components. One programmer today can do more than entire programming teams years ago.</p>
<p>Another factor today is the move to machine learning, which can make &quot;understanding&quot; data and utilizing it possible in a much shorter time, and without any significant domain knowledge. Tasks that would previously take huge amounts of domain knowledge and data analysis can now be achieved in realistic time frames with relatively small teams of programmers. </p>
<p>Automation isn't really always about full automation (like with the self-driving car), but is just as often about making the job more efficient by automating or decreasing the complexity of certain tasks. Yes, there's still a deficit, we're still not educating enough people in most IT segments, but that's not bound to continue being that way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real benefit from software as a service comes from integrating machine learning with short-term service usage, especially when it comes to devops.</p>
<p>For example, say part of your operation includes mining product data from thousands of online retailers. You have a scraper look at a catalog page like &quot;t-shirts&quot; and then check a database to see if anything new is there. You can quickly build a machine learning model to determine what times the retailers typically add products to their website and automatically adjust the time range and frequency at which you scrape each site, thereby substantially reducing the cost because you no longer need to have as many container instances running.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the same provider that you are running your operation on will also offer various machine learning services that integrate well with the data that you already have stored somewhere else in their platform and it is way cheaper to use than buying the $4000 video cards that would be required to do in-house.</p></div>		</li>
