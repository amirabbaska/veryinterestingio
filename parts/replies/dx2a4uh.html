			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an official source, but used to work there, and we did have access to everything, as far as I could tell, and we were encouraged to look through it to find how to do things. Might be some things off limits, but  you could access a ton of things that you weren't directly involved in. Checked out things like the internal API DeepMind used to interface with StarCraft 2, even though I was in Ads, gmail, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Googler, this is basically true. I can see 99% of the code to Google Search, Ads, Gmail, GSuite, you name it.</p>
<p>Some Google-X projects, some super sensitive parts of Google Search, and a few other things like that are restricted. Android is a bit restricted but that's because it includes secret drivers licensed from other companies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I kind of wondering how many of these people making comments about how big companies  handle code assess actually worked at a large company.</p>
<p>I worked for one of the largest.   I had access to the entire e business suite source.  I however  could only make changes to my product, not others.  These access policies had more to do with teams wanting complete control over what was changed, not security.</p>
<p>Code reviews, if done, were for ensuring code was written well.  We'd never be looking for someone intentionally placing malicious code.  We would however look for common security vulnerabilities - like improper handling of SQL parameters to create a SQL injection holes.</p>
<p>General companies rely on the integrity of their engineers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most accurate I've seen. I worked for a large financial company for years and the biggest defense is no engineer wants to risk their salary and benefits by leaking something. Plus it would really screw over the rest of the team.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your SIEM may find the developer who did a git pull on all projects but it will be hard to detect that he put it on an usb disk to home. Sure, plenty of things are possible, but I've seen very little development shops do real actions to protect against source code leakage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SIEM doesn't predict, SIEM reacts, late.</p>
<p>DLP reacts immediately.  I have never dealt with large scale software development, so no idea if any of them take it to that level.</p>
<p>Most places that care about data loss prevention disable external drives or require they be encrypted with keys that don't exist outside their network so they can't be used elsewhere.</p>
<p>Email DLP can prevent source code from leaving the MTA
HTTP(S) DLP can prevent source code from being moved through a browser
(S)FTP(S) can/should be blocked at the firewall/router.  Non-standard outbound ports should be blocked at the firewall/router.</p>
<p>It's fairly &quot;simple&quot; (not quick) to block the easiest ways for source code to leave an entity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds way too restrictive for developers to work effectively and gives you a false sense of security. For example, what's stopping someone from making an encrypted zip file and uploading it to dropbox? Or just using a different browser?</p></div>		</li>
