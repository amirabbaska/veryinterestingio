			<div class="markdown"><p>The nuclear winter idea in the West clearly originated separate from any serious Soviet influence (it has its own intellectual trajectory), and the work that has been done on it since then has been largely independent of Soviet theories and data (the originators of the theory were appropriately wary of relying on anything coming out the USSR). </p>
<p>Did the Soviets use it as a facet of their propaganda? Sure. They also used Civil Rights as part of their propaganda as well, but that doesn't undermine the reality of it. Both the USA and USSR promoted theories or arguments that promoted their overall diplomatic/ideological goals during the Cold War, often through clandestine sources. One should not confuse promotion with creation, or let it by itself &quot;taint&quot; the underlying work.</p>
<p>You should be aware that the &quot;nuclear winter is Soviet propaganda&quot; argument is itself a holdover of propaganda from people who were resisting the argument that nuclear winter implied that the desired arms build-ups in the 1980s were suicidal. (So you're engaging with another form of propaganda in repeating it, ironically.)</p>
<p>There have been many nuclear winter studies over the last 30 years, by many different groups, using many different models, and many different assumptions. They get different results, like all scientific modeling of complex phenomena. Some suggest nuclear winter effects are likely, some indicate they are not. It may be that everybody involved has some political stake in the results (it's hard not to), but the idea that it's some kind of cheap conspiracy is about as plausible as the similar ideas propagated by climate change denialists.  The initial TTAPS work was rather crude compared to the full climate simulations that people (both pro and con) are using today. Science marches on, though the scale of the problem is large enough that total certainty is likely to remain elusive for a long time yet.</p>
<p>For a very good history of nuclear winter by a serious historian of science, see Lawrence Badash, <em>A Nuclear Winter's Tale</em>. Please also be aware that former Soviet intelligence agents <em>love</em> to inflate their role in things, and all such accounts need to be read with a grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any sources for this claim? As far as I can recall, the concept of a nuclear winter was first articulated by Carl Sagan et al in 1983, at a time when the peace movement was significantly smaller than in the 60s and 70s. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it was substantiated by a defected Soviet intelligence officer named Sergei Tretyakov in the 2000s in his book <em>Comrade J: The Untold Secrets of Russia's Master Spy in America After the End of the Cold War</em>. TIME magazine was running <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070930040755/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,960025,00.html" target="_blank">articles alluding to</a> such things back in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The Sagan stuff was part of the supposed influence that the Soviets had over the, at the time nascent peace movement in the late 1940s and 1950s, from which Sagan came out. From my reading of these events, the idea was to cause a rift between the scientific community and the burgeoning national labs which were focused on nuclear weapons development and required a large deal of cooperation with the physics community to keep the research going.</p>
<p>I came across a lot of this information when I was studying nuclear proliferation and other issues in college. I've thought more about it now, as it shows that there was a historical precedence to the alleged events surrounding the 2016 election.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it had the effect of reducing investment in civil defence measures as it was commonly seen as &quot;pointless&quot; (see Redditors in the present day scoffing at duck and cover drills)</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the USSR much greater measures were taken and in times of heightened tension this would give the Soviets more room to maneuver while the West less so.</p></div>		</li>
