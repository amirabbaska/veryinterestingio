			<div class="markdown"><p>The natural followup to this would be, wouldn't some very power-sensitive applications need it? I'm remembering the scene in <em>Apollo 13</em> where they were trying to run a space craft on the same amperage needed to run a coffee maker, and thinking 'maybe the power draw might matter on, say, a Mars mission?'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Apollo spacecraft didn't store power.  They generated it using fuel cells.  The Apollo 13 accident took out the fuel cells, leaving only the batteries.  An accident aboard a Mars mission could take out the solar power or RTGs just as easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In those cases use a mechanical watch instead if now power is a problem.  </p>
<p>We need a matrix of 7 led diodes to display
Now a red food need ~2-3v current to glow. </p>
<p>Now worst case scenario is an 8 and that's all 7 on
Each need 20mA.   </p>
<p>The amount of power is almost ignorable.   </p>
<p>Now I remember when I was testing cellphones 8years ago there was a secondary led screen for 5icons and a clock and date and according to spec. That one was run on an internal battery and was not expected to be replaced in phone lifetime (2y).<br />
However Its backlight was off untill you pressed a button.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the purpose. If he's using the LED for illumination - like a signal light for aircraft, then sure.</p>
<p>But if it's a blinker for showing if a device is on or off, then this kind of circuit could last for weeks/months on a AA battery</p></div>		</li>
