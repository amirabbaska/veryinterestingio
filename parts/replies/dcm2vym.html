			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of voltage like the height of a staircase. You drop a ball (electron) at the top and it naturally rolls downward because of gravity (electrical attraction). </p>
<p>Resistance is analogous to the width (or inverse of the width) of a staircase. A wide staircase can allow more balls to roll down it. </p>
<p>If you have two staircases side-by-side and you drop a whole bunch of balls at the top, more will naturally traverse the wider staircase (with lower resistance). </p>
<p>In the end, the balls always start and end up at the same place. </p>
<p>If two resistors are in parallel, they (by definition) have the same starting and ending points. The voltage across them is by definition the same. The current through them (number of balls falling) with differ however. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speed is proportional to the pressure i.e. the height of the water. </p>
<p>If you increase the total height (I.e. voltage) you would get more flow through both canals (more current through the resistors). However, the one with a lower resistance will always have a higher flow at the SAME pressure. </p>
<p>If you could increase the pressure of the smaller canal relative to the larger canal, then that would be akin to having two different heights of water, i.e two different voltages, which requires the two systems to be disconnected. The point of the water analogy is that the water level feeding both canals must be at the same height. </p></div>		</li>
