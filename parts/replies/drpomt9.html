DD = stillborn? Or do you mean a DD zygote is physically impossible to create? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's <strong>probably</strong> due to The Founder Effect.</p>
<p>The Founder Effect is a little <em>quirk</em> of genetic probability that likes to rear its head whenever a small breeding population exists. This generally pops up when a species colonizes a new region, but it can also happen as a result of population collapse.</p>
<p>Imagine that you have a population of one hundred things. <strong>One</strong> of them carries a trait that is uncommon in the general population of their species. The probability of that trait being passed on to their offspring is ~0.5. That means the chance of that creature's offspring carrying the trait is equivalent to a coin-flip coming up heads.</p>
<p>Thus, there are three factors that can result in The Founder Effect popping up:</p>
<p>1) A creature can be unusually successful in reproduction, causing its Genes to become dominant in a small gene-pool.</p>
<p>2) Through random chance, produce significantly more offspring that carry the trait than those who don't. Basically, that coin-flip can have a run of five tails in a row.</p>
<p>3) Through random chance, provided the trait has no effect on survival, carriers of the trait may just die less than those who don't.</p>
<p>In a large population, any individual breeding-pair won't affect the gene pool in a significant way. As you probably know from Statistics, larger populations have rates closer to the <em>actual</em> probability of something occurring than smaller populations. The Statistical Abnormalities will counter each-other out in a large enough group.</p>
<p>However, in a small population a single breeding pair <strong>can</strong> affect the Gene-Pool. Imagine that our one carrier managed to both be unusually successful, and for the majority of its offspring to have carried the rare gene.</p>
<p>Let us assume that 300 of the second generation of our <em>thing</em> managed to reproduce. Of these 300, six carry the rare gene. We've gone from a 1/100 proportion to a 1/50. Now, as each generation grows this proportion becomes harder to change. However, we've already doubled the size of the proportion in the first generation. Random Chance can cause it to <em>continue</em> to grow for a few generations, until the population gets large enough that the statistical anomalies can counter each-other out.</p>
<p>The textbook example of this in <em>Humans</em> is Red Hair in Ireland.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh, so the O people that reproduce with people with a dominant type will pass on the trait 100% of the time, and people with the trait will also pas it on 50% of the time so it’s just about how the blood groups were divided amongst the ancestors of everyone in West Europe right?</p></div>		</li>
