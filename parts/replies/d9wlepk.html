			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing that I'd like to address is the concept of caching. Caches let Youtube store more popular videos closer to the &quot;access point of a network&quot; drastically reducing initial load time. imgur to my knowledge doesn't support multi-level caching and any image is roughly the same &quot;distance&quot; as any other</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, ISPs will prioritize traffic differently based on the content, meaning that things like video chat and streaming videos avoid lag/buffering and things that are less important like normal webpages might take just a bit longer. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_shaping" target="_blank">traffic shaping</a>.</p></div>		</li>
