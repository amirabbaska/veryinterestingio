<p>Permanent tissues - these never undergo cell replication (at least not after embryological development) - e.g. the brain and heart.</p>

<p>How does this work when an infant's heart and brain (not to mention an embryo) are much smaller than an adult's?  I am aware that an infant's brain is considerably larger in proportion to the rest of the body compared to an adult, but it still does grow larger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a very oversimplified answer.</p>
<p>Some neuronal cells of the brain actually do undergo limited cell division after embryonic development, but that's not the reason why the brain changes in size.</p>
<p>While you're born with pretty much all the cortical neurons you're ever going to have, all the synaptic connections between them haven't been established yet - the cells might not divide anymore, but they can still physically grow, axons can get thicker, longer, branch, etc. The fine details of the &quot;wiring&quot; connecting the various processing centers are mostly established after birth.</p>
<p>You also have a LOT of other cells in the brain that support the neuronal circuitry in various ways - oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia - and they are very much capable of division, even in adulthood. (not all types of them, and not all the time, but broadly speaking...) Myelination - the wrapping of &quot;insulation&quot; around axons by oligodenrocytes, which significantly increases the size of the various white matter tracts - is not 100% finished in humans until early adulthood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I kept my answer simple, this is a another whole topic :)
Basically, if you lose a piece of your brain, it will (almost) never grow back, but the brain can make alternative pathways which may preserve the function of the lost tissue. The neurons themselves are capable of some degree of elongation, but cannot replicate themselves, they do not poses the tools for mitosis (cell replication). BUT much of what we know about the brain is being rethought every year and we are making many new discoveries.
The cells that support the nerves (neuroglia) are capable of mitosis, but they don't contain and &quot;information&quot; and do not transmit signals, just like the pericardial fat (fat surrounding the heart) can increase in size (hypertrophy) and number of cells (hyperplasia)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even in a bone marrow transplant (one that is not autologous - not a self transplant) will result in the production of donor blood cell. This is the reason that an organ transplant also includes a lifetime of immunosuppresant drugs, resulting in an increased risk of infection for the patient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to nitpick, bone marrow transplants (more accurately stem cell transplant) don't include a lifetime immunosuppressant drugs (if the donor was a good match and there aren't complications), eventually you're able to wean off of them, my ex weaned off of his Tacrolimus 3 years after his transplant. </p></div>		</li>
