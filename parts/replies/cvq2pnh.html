			<p>Exactly. This is why old metallic coins often have a strong &quot;musty&quot; odor, whereas clean metal doesn't have any particular smell at all. The actual smell of the coins does not come from the metal itself, but rather from the oils of your skin and the compounds dissolved in them, which become concentrated and oxidized by the metal in the coins. There was an interesting study looking at the details of this process not too long ago, as summarized in this <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/061023/full/news061023-7.html" target="_blank">news write-up</a> and fully described in the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200602100/abstract" target="_blank">original paper</a>.<br><br>To quote that paper:<br>&gt; Ironically, the iron odor on skin contact is a type of human body odor<br><br>The biggest culprit appears to be a compound called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oct-1-en-3-one" target="_blank">1-octen-3-one</a>, which humans are very sensitive to, and which has a mushroom-like odor, which many people tend to describe as &quot;metallic&quot; by association.</p>		</li>

			<p>A catalyst is a substance which speeds up a reaction, but is chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction. When the reaction has finished, you would have exactly the same mass of catalyst as you had at the beginning.</p>		</li>

			<p>It is a part of it, it's just that by the end of the reaction it's been returned to it's original form.<br><br>A catalyst can sometimes move electrons between atoms, switch out certain 'functional groups' between molecules, and stuff like that.

			<p>You're completely right. It's not about the metal being reactive, but a good catalyst.  It could be that Pt and Pd don't catalyze the particular oxidation reactions that lead to metallic smell, but that has nothing to do with them being more or less reactive.</p>		</li>

			<p>You kind of answered your own question.<br><br>Platinum catalysts are preferred in certain catalytic reactions because of their low reactivity to poisons, high recyclability and high melting point (low sintering). Furthermore, they are used in very specific cases. For example, their reactivity towards certain elementary reactions (i.e. dissociation of O2) is utilized.</p>		</li>

			<p>you missed the very most important point (but almost hit it by mentioning sintering), size! Bulk platinum metal is inert but tiny platinum particles are reactive (to very reactive), largely because they really want to become bulk platinum but can't figure out how. This comes down to poor thermodynamic stability in atoms that sit on an edge or corner of a crystal, and bulk metal has basically no edges or corners compared to how many atoms are buried in the middle.</p>		</li>

			<p>But if the metal reacts with those molecules it's still a part of the metal that I am breathing in, right? So it would mean it expulses matter.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/2-CI" target="_blank">2-CI</a>
			<p>That's because the reaction is a redox reaction that involves a conversion of ferrous iron into ferric iron, and the less reactive metals won't undergo a reaction under such mild conditions.</p>		</li>

			<p>Taste is complicated, and a lot of things that we think of as &quot;taste&quot; are actually smell.<br><br>So this in part may play a role in &quot;taste&quot; sensations, but once you put a metal in an aqueous environment, other things can happen, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenton's_reagent" target="_blank">Fenton reaction</a> which generates peroxides, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_acids_and_bases" target="_blank">Lewis base</a> activity, which absorbs acids and makes alkali substances, and freed metal ions themselves, which could be detected. <br><br>So to answer: Yes, it might play a role, but other things are going on as well.</p>		</li>

			<p>Good point, it might be a bad example. There'll be about as much as that present in any biological fluid, perhaps a little more due to direct exposure to the aerobic environment. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20846484" target="_blank">Salivary superoxide dismutase</a> will make H2O2 as a byproduct, and it could also be a byproduct of various other breakdown products.</p>		</li>

			<p>The metals act as a catalyst, providing an easier way of combining the atoms together. The reaction is already spontaneous, but happens extremely slowly without a catalyst. Mechanisms at play include adsorption effects, partial activation of molecules by coordination to metal ions, or direct participation and regeneration of metal ions in the reaction.</p>		</li>
