			<p>Exactly. This is why old metallic coins often have a strong &quot;musty&quot; odor, whereas clean metal doesn't have any particular smell at all. The actual smell of the coins does not come from the metal itself, but rather from the oils of your skin and the compounds dissolved in them, which become concentrated and oxidized by the metal in the coins. There was an interesting study looking at the details of this process not too long ago, as summarized in this <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/061023/full/news061023-7.html" target="_blank">news write-up</a> and fully described in the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200602100/abstract" target="_blank">original paper</a>.<br><br>To quote that paper:<br>&gt; Ironically, the iron odor on skin contact is a type of human body odor<br><br>The biggest culprit appears to be a compound called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oct-1-en-3-one" target="_blank">1-octen-3-one</a>, which humans are very sensitive to, and which has a mushroom-like odor, which many people tend to describe as &quot;metallic&quot; by association.</p>		</li>

			<p>Heat is the transfer of thermal energy from one region to another.  Objects don't possess 'heat', heat is the actual movement of energy.<br><br>The thing to remember about catalysts is that they don't affect the thermodynamics of the reaction.  What you are talking about is the temperature dependence of reactions, which happen to be described by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhenius_equation" target="_blank">Arrhenius equation</a>.</p>		</li>

			<p>&quot;Heat&quot; isn't just used to describe the movement of this energy, it's also used to describe its presence. An object at a non-(absolute)-zero temperature absolutely can be said to &quot;contain&quot; heat.

						<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/[deleted]" target="_blank">[deleted]</a>
			<p>So heat and catalysis have common effects in certain if you consider how you quantify success in your reaction. Let's define it as number of species A converted to B in a certain amount of time. A minimum amount of energy is necessary to perform this conversion, which is the activation energy. At any given temperature, if it is high enough  to overcome the AE, a certain percentage will make the conversion (some of the species have enough energy, some don't ). Adding heat can supply more of the molecules the necessary energy to overcome this barrier. Catalysts, on the other hand, do something very different. They lower the amount of activation energy necessary to convert. More are converted at our starting  temperature, not because the molecules are more energized but instead the barrier is smaller.  Its important to note all of this occurs as a distribution, or a broad range of success and failure. I'm on mobile, but check out reaction coordinate graphs and activation energy for more info.</p>		</li>

			<p>Really, it's all based on collision theory. For a reaction to take place, two atoms must collide, they must collide with sufficient energy (activation energy), and they must collide with the proper alignment. Catalysts make these conditions easier to meet.<br><br>One type of catalyst lowers the activation energy required, so more collisions meet the cutoff. My memory is fuzzy on how exactly this is accomplished, however. <br><br>Much of the pace of a reaction is determined by how frequently the geometry of the reactants align. Another type of catalyst fixes the orientation of these reactants to create a higher frequency of successful collisions.<br><br>So, while not necessarily being a product or reactant, catalysts accelerate the reaction process. </p>		</li>

			<p>With a catalyst, it is part of the reaction. The starting compound will be reacted in such a way that a bond with a catalyst will be formed. Once this bond is formed, a second compound will be reacted with the catalyst bonded compound. During this second reaction, the catalyst is replaced by the second compound. Then you're left with the catalyst and a new compound. <br><br>So say that A and B are compounds and X is a catalyst, a basic catalytic reaction would look like this: <br><br>A + X --&gt; AX<br><br>AX + B --&gt; AB +X <br><br>X, the catalyst, is exactly the same when the reaction is finished as when it began. </p>		</li>

Bulk platinum metal is inert but tiny platinum particles are reactive (to very reactive), largely because they really want to become bulk platinum but can't figure out how.

			<p>Platinum and palladium are used as heterogeneous catalysts. In that role, they do not directly participate in the reaction itself. Typically what they do is to provide a surface onto which gas-phase reactants can adsorb. Vapors dissolve into the outermost surface of the metal, and the interaction between the electron density there and the adsorbed molecules weakens their bonds so that the reaction can proceed at a faster rate under more favorable conditions. <br><br>This is different from homogeneous catalysis, where the catalyst is in the same phase and participates directly in the reaction mechanism. </p>		</li>

Assuming you've taken a high school chemistry class, you may remember the number of electrons on an atom is a good indicator of what other atoms it can bond to.

			<p>is this why I heard that if your swimming pool smells like &quot;chlorine&quot; is probably needs more? because there is a lot of material to oxidize in the pool?</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, unfortunately the &quot;chlorine smell&quot; we associate with pools is not directly due to bleach or other chlorine based disinfectants, but from the byproducts of this &quot;disinfection&quot; process. <a href="http://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Chloramines-Understanding-Pool-Smell" target="_blank">This article</a> gives a nice overview of the details, but the gist is that when bleach containing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochlorite" target="_blank">the hypochlorite ion</a> comes into contact with nitrogen containing species, it forms a series of compounds known as chloramines, which have that distinctive pungent odor we often think of as &quot;pool smell.&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>Similar.  &quot;Chlorine&quot; smell comes from chloramine, which is created when chlorine reacts with bio-matter.  What you are smelling is the chloramine leaving the pool, which means it is no longer in the pool doing it's job.</p>		</li>

			<p>No, that is not true...Cl2 is a perfectly volatile gas and will escape from a pool, your tap water, or any other source of water if you leave it for a couple days.  Get a pool testing kit; adding chlorine by smell is a horrible idea (especially if your measure of whether or not to add more chlorine is if you already smell chlorine- how would you know when to stop?).</p>		</li>

			<p>Actually, while it is true that Cl2 is a volatile gas that has a strong smell, it's not actually the cause of the &quot;chlorine smell&quot; in pools. This is a very good thing, considering that chlorine gas can be used as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine#Use_as_a_weapon" target="_blank">toxic chemical weapon</a>! When you add chlorine based disinfectants to a pool, most of the chlorine is not present as free chlorine (Cl2) but is trapped in other species such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochlorite" target="_blank">hypochlorite ion</a>. When these chlorine containing species react with other compounds in the water, they produce very smelly byproducts, such as chloramines, which is the main odor we smell in pools.<br><br>So in some sense, we only the smell the &quot;chlorine smell,&quot; when there was something for the chlorine species in the disinfectant to react with, which also depletes the available active chlorine. In this sense /u/TheSov is right that a strong smell of chloramines indicates that some active chlorine species may have been depleted and need to be topped up. But you are right of course that you should use an actual test kit in order to maintain the proper level of active chlorine species (called the free available chlorine (FAC)).</p>		</li>

			<p>Had a pool guy.. left the lid loose on my chlorine tablets.  Opened the lid to add chlorine, caught a whiff, and ran up wind PDQ.  Lost a whole vegetable garden and part of the lawn to the chlorine gas.<br><br>Not sure what the little pucks contained other than chlorine, or reaction was, but between the water and heat from the sun it made a fair amount of gas and left some crystals inside the bucket.<br><br>(I fired pool guy)</p>		</li>

			<p>Taste is complicated, and a lot of things that we think of as &quot;taste&quot; are actually smell.<br><br>So this in part may play a role in &quot;taste&quot; sensations, but once you put a metal in an aqueous environment, other things can happen, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenton's_reagent" target="_blank">Fenton reaction</a> which generates peroxides, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_acids_and_bases" target="_blank">Lewis base</a> activity, which absorbs acids and makes alkali substances, and freed metal ions themselves, which could be detected. <br><br>So to answer: Yes, it might play a role, but other things are going on as well.</p>		</li>

			<p>Good point, it might be a bad example. There'll be about as much as that present in any biological fluid, perhaps a little more due to direct exposure to the aerobic environment. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20846484" target="_blank">Salivary superoxide dismutase</a> will make H2O2 as a byproduct, and it could also be a byproduct of various other breakdown products.</p>		</li>

			<p>The metals act as a catalyst, providing an easier way of combining the atoms together. The reaction is already spontaneous, but happens extremely slowly without a catalyst. Mechanisms at play include adsorption effects, partial activation of molecules by coordination to metal ions, or direct participation and regeneration of metal ions in the reaction.</p>		</li>
