			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. This is why old metallic coins often have a strong &quot;musty&quot; odor, whereas clean metal doesn't have any particular smell at all. The actual smell of the coins does not come from the metal itself, but rather from the oils of your skin and the compounds dissolved in them, which become concentrated and oxidized by the metal in the coins. There was an interesting study looking at the details of this process not too long ago, as summarized in this <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/061023/full/news061023-7.html" target="_blank">news write-up</a> and fully described in the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200602100/abstract" target="_blank">original paper</a>.</p>
<p>To quote that paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ironically, the iron odor on skin contact is a type of human body odor</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The biggest culprit appears to be a compound called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oct-1-en-3-one" target="_blank">1-octen-3-one</a>, which humans are very sensitive to, and which has a mushroom-like odor, which many people tend to describe as &quot;metallic&quot; by association.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if the metal reacts with those molecules it's still a part of the metal that I am breathing in, right? So it would mean it expulses matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because the reaction is a redox reaction that involves a conversion of ferrous iron into ferric iron, and the less reactive metals won't undergo a reaction under such mild conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about welding? Fresh weld got quite a strong smell, but electrodes are pure metal (with no finger grease hopefully).</p>
<p>Could it be something like nitrogen oxide forming in the electric ark?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taste is complicated, and a lot of things that we think of as &quot;taste&quot; are actually smell.</p>
<p>So this in part may play a role in &quot;taste&quot; sensations, but once you put a metal in an aqueous environment, other things can happen, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenton's_reagent" target="_blank">Fenton reaction</a> which generates peroxides, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_acids_and_bases" target="_blank">Lewis base</a> activity, which absorbs acids and makes alkali substances, and freed metal ions themselves, which could be detected. </p>
<p>So to answer: Yes, it might play a role, but other things are going on as well.</p></div>		</li>
