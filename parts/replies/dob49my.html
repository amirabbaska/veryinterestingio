			<div class="markdown"><p>Similarly, if you remove the nucleus from an egg and fertilize it with two sperm, it will only grow a placenta that is very good at invading the maternal host (a mole, that can turn into cancer). If you combine two egg nuclei in an egg and force it to begin to divide, it will only develop fetal parts and no placenta and won't be able to develop.</p>
<p>This is because of imprinting, an epigenetic marker applied to certain genes to prevent them from being expressed and which are differentially turned on or off if they are in a sperm or egg. The same thing is true of chromosome 15 for Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes.</p>
<p>A father has a pressure to produce a baby that will suck everything it can from its mother in order to grow a large brain and become reproductively fit itself; he can do just fine impregnating a handful of other mothers and still pass on plenty of genes even if one of these placentas kills the mother. A mother has a pressure to produce a baby that will not kill her before the baby can be born or before she can have more babies, and has a pressure to have a uterus that can stand up to the invasive potential of a normal placenta. We clearly have ended up somewhere between the extremes of polygyny and one baby ever, and the amount of parental investment it takes to finally make the huge-brained premature, useless, immobile baby to the point it is also fit probably plays a role in keeping dads around as much as they do in humans.</p>
<p>The invasive ability of our placentas gives us the huge brains that start becoming too big and too energy hungry to stay in the uterus as long as similar mammals, and which give us, like, society and airplanes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm so excited about this because I just learned it in class. To add on, scientists did an experiment testing whether a wider pelvis affects the mother's energy required to walk or run, which was the older theory as to what limited the baby's development inside the womb. Results showed that it didn't. So the mother probably could have evolved a wider pelvis to birth a baby with a bigger head and more developed brain, equivalent to those of our primate relatives that are born more developed. Why didn't this happen then? There must be another factor at play - the energy problem that was mentioned above.</p>
<p>The mother can only support the baby up to a certain point, which is at around 38 weeks. Then, she is really working at her peak metabolism (2.0-2.5x that of her normal metabolic rate) but the baby is continuously demanding a higher energy rate as it grows (mostly for its brain). If this continues, the baby will have to dip into its own fat storage to support its growth. This has been shown in postterm babies who are born with less body fat. This energy theory says that this is why human babies are born at that stage of development. There's a lot more evidence supporting this - obese mothers are more likely to have postterm births, undernourished mother are more likely to have preterm births, twins are born more premature (more energy strain with TWO fetuses), and this is just a few of a supporting body of evidence. </p>
<p>How does the mother support the baby after birth, if she can't even increase her metabolism to support the baby inside the womb? Wouldn't she still be responsible for feeding the baby via breast milk after birth? It turns out, breast milk can provide much more fat, which is energy dense, than the placenta can. Fat doesn't cross the placenta very well.</p>
<p>Just to point out, these are still theories that need more experimentation. Perhaps the pelvis theory is still valid. Even if the amount of energy to walk doesn't change with pelvis size, a larger pelvis could still negatively affect other factors (e.g. the pelvis may be more vulnerable to injury). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I don’t understand about evolutionary biology that perhaps you could answer: Why is it that we seem to expect every aspect of biology to have a rational reason? Of course traits that survive tend to be the result of natural selection but shouldn’t there by extension be many traits that are simply neutral from a survival standpoint, or even which are negative but “get through” because they are paired with an advantageous trait?</p>
<p>Come to think of it, the latter would seem to really apply here, in a sense; being helpless for longer periods than other animals certainly lacks a direct evolutionary advantage, but is probably more than offset by the other factors that require it (larger brain etc). But couldn’t some aspects of our biological makeup simply exist because no particular force happened to select a better option? And isn’t it also possible that we aren’t yet at the pinnacle of evolution, such that many of our traits are in fact sub-optimal? I would expect that should apply not just to us but to most plants and animals as well. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, and this is an important part that is often overlooked. Many things in nature are simply the result <em>of chance</em> and are not necessarily efficient, and a good many things are hold overs from previous times. I can't place the source right now, but if I remember correctly, whales and people share remarkable similar nerve patterns for certain critical systems (breathing?) despite the face that such a setup is optimal for humans and very sub-optimal for whales (as they spend large amounts of time underwater).</p>
<p>In the more general sense, there are cases where maladaptive traits succeed simply because of chance. Given the very long and very competitive nature of, well, nature, many (if not most) maladaptive traits don't stick around unless there's some other benefit paired with the trait and/or a chance in the environment makes such an trait desirable.</p>
<p>E: updated for clarity about whales/humans - the two share similar nervous systems due to a common ancestor, and the once beneficial structure is now a hindrance that hasn't been evolved out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no pinnacle. You can't be the best at everything forever. You can only evolve as quick as you can for the current environment.</p>
<p>Even if the human body someone reaches 'perfectly evolved' for a second, in the next second the world is different, with new challenges and changing landscapes. </p>
<p>There's no pinnacle, no end, no path in evolution. Humans feel &quot;very evolved&quot; and &quot;top&quot; now, but just a slight temperature change could knock us to the bottom, and then our big brains and high energy consumption become a liability. </p>
<p>So, y'know, stay on your toes :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People are pointing out SCA and a breathing mechanism in whales.</p>
<p>The definitive example of inefficient evolution is the Laryngeal nerve, or cranial nerve #10 in humans, which controls the throat.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO1a1Ek-HD0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO1a1Ek-HD0</a></p>
<p>TL;DR nerve which goes from brain to 'gills' in sub-vertebrates and fish, goes around aorta.  This nerve is following the shortest path from brain, near heart, to gills, which is the shortest path in fish.</p>
<p>As vertebrates enlongated the neck, the nerve is still looped around the aorta.  In humans, the nerve goes from the brain, down the neck into the thoracic cavity, back to the throat.</p>
<p>The extreme example is the giraffe.  The nerve descends 7 feet from the brain, around the aorta, ascends 7 feet, back to the throat of the giraffe.</p>
<p>No circumstance has selected a new route for the nerve.  Giraffes aren't singing operas, and in humans the path is inefficient yet still workable for complex vocalization.</p>
<p>Laryngeal Nerve is a great example of 'leftover', or 'accidental', or 'non-de-selected' evolution.</p>
<p>Evolution is an accident which results in remarkable efficiency over millions of iterations and vast spans of time.</p></div>		</li>
