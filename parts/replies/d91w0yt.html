			<p>Yeah this is the other half of what I was asking really. I get that with sufficient fuel, fire was more likely to break out due to the relative abundance of oxygen. I was just wondering whether the there would have been any difference in the bolts themselves given the atmosphere they were forming in &amp; moving through. <br><br>Thunder is the sound of the shockwave formed from superheated air, right? Would there have been any noticeable difference on this front?</p>		</li>

			<p>This is one of the most interesting questions I've seen in awhile thanks for asking it.</p>		</li>

			<p>I doubt it would sound very different to a human. O2 and N2 have similar energetic properties when it comes to sound propogation. There is a difference between them but most likely would not be a significant difference listening to it.</p>		</li>

			<p>considering that the difference in oxygen concentrations between then and now is only 14%, and the fact that the speed of sound through nitrogen is pretty close to the speed of sound in oxygen. (316m/s vs 354m/s at 0C) thunder would be pretty much the same</p>		</li>

			<p>lower breakdown voltage means the discharge would happen more easily, thus less powerful...</p>		</li>

			<p>This would also imply more frequent strikes, correct? And if so, any idea as to just how much more frequent strikes would be (relative to current period)?</p>		</li>

			<p>Wouldn't it be more at the same voltage because it provides less resistance?</p>		</li>

			<p>Given equal voltages, it would be higher current due to less resistance. That said, one can't really assume equal voltage in this sort of scenario.<br><br>A difference of potential is what needs to develop before any strike can occur. The strike will happen once the voltage is high enough to travel across the resistance of the air.<br><br>Because of this, lightning would be more frequent, yet also lower voltage (resulting in the same current).</p>		</li>

			<p>Interesting point. However if lightning were catalyzed more easily,  the average lightning strike might be weaker but there might also be many more stronger and weaker strikes as well.</p>		</li>

			<p>It should also be noted that 35% oxygen is a pretty contentious estimate. A lot of people working on Carboniferous climates think it is more likely in the 25-30% range. The truth is, proxies for oxygen are not very precise. Atmospheric oxygen is difficult to estimate.</p>		</li>
