			<div class="markdown"><p>Appreciate your enthusiasm and detailed answer. Took me 1.5 tries but your response, as I interpret it, is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turkey has a lower production cost overall.</li>
<li>Turkey demand (and profit) spikes during the holiday, so producers need to have steady demand during the rest of the year to efficiently meet that spike.</li>
</ol>
<p>To turn the OP's question around, is there any reason why turkey isn't suitable for popular derivative snacks like nuggets, i.e. why doesn't McDonalds make turkey mcnuggets? Is the cooking time for a deep fryer (or how ever they produce nugget meat) that substantially different? </p>
<p>Also, is there such a thing as premium turkey? e.g. the way that free-range and fancy-feed chickens command a higher price and ostensibly taste better?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still waiting for the answer to this unless I missed it.  If this is true:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turkey is a lower cost protien to make than chicken</p>
</blockquote>
<p>then I would expect Turkey to be the more popular protein unless there is some reason why all the chicken products can't be made from Turkey.  Did /u/crawtators ever answer this somewhere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i am googling through USDA to find this..the stat we always used was turkey was about 1 % better feed conversion on saleable product.  Chickens might actually make better conversion the more i google it but i think its due to the fat and skin which is usually cut off and sold as dog food/biofuel/cosmetics.  i will keep looking and get back to you...but usda lists chicken as a slightly higher FCR so maybe i am wrong on conversion.  I HAVE BEEN LIED TO MY WHOLE LIFE!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen a reply yet so I'll take a stab at it. My take is on the industrial side of farming. </p>
<p>There's a few reasons why is less &quot;popular.&quot;  Turkeys take much longer to &quot;grow-out&quot; than chickens to get to market weight, so they are not as readily available. You're looking 28 weeks for turkeys and 5 weeks for chickens. Turkeys also need more room; bigger bird, more space. Can't get as many in a house. Also, cultural reasons, holidays mostly. </p>
<p>As for cost, here is my analysis(I could get down to the nitty-gritty on some other things that impact costs but I'll just do the basics). On average, it cost ~$3 USD to hatch, grow-out and process a chicken, with a five pound average bird weight. Turkeys cost ~$20 USD to do the same with a 35 pound average. </p>
<p>$3/5 lbs. = $.60 per pound.
$20/35 lbs. = $.57 per pound. </p>
<p>With millions of pounds being moved, the pennies really add up. </p></div>		</li>

<p>From a sales side, sure, but from a buyer's side, preference is going to win out over a tiny price margin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in Australia we have a fairly robust poultry industry and a marginalized turkey industry (by comparison).</p>
<p>Our delis always have cold cuts off chicken and rarely do you see turkey.</p>
<p>We just don't ready turkey like the Yanks do. Our Xmas protein is normally either roast lamb\pork or seafood. We don't have Thanksgiving...</p>
<p>So what you're saying stacks up down under.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that's because turkeys are only native to the Americas ...and the particular species we think of as &quot;turkey&quot;  is only native from northern Mexico through southern Canada. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the first questions a new friend down under asked me was if I had ever had fried turkey- I now host an annual turkey feast and invite mostly Aussies. American food in general is a huge topic- having a work s'mores party because that's another big topic of curiosity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As delicious as deep fried turkey is (my uncle is from Kentucky, so I get it) here in Australia most people would think that sounds gross and really unhealthy.</p>
<p>Turkey is seen as a lean &quot;healthy&quot; meat and the thought of deep frying it seems counter-intuitive to most.</p>
<p>I guess we just don't have quite the same love of deep frying as our Yankee cousins. Especially in the home. We will go out to eat deep fried food but I would guess a much lower percentage of home cooked meals are deep fried.</p>
<p>I'm kinda happy about this. I can't imagine how fat I'd be if I had to resist normal american cuisine on a daily basis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I eat it as often as I can.. I quite enjoy it.</p>
<p>The main issue with it is that its very low in fat so that makes it difficult to know how to cook properly, its easy to overcook and make it dry and chewy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question for you! When you say that turkeys are a little more efficient than chickens, does that take into account the eggs you get from chickens? Why don't we eat turkey eggs? I'm a big fan of turkey, just had some turkey burgers a few minutes ago. </p>
<p>On that note, I dunno if you've got influence at Jenni-o, but I'd like to see them step up their game on turkey patties. Butterball's got em beat by a mile by my tongue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Turkeys dont' produce eggs as fast as chickens and the size is much larger...so they aren't an effective commercial product and therefore not popular.  a turkey egg is roughly 3 times the size of a chicken egg and would cost more than triple...people buy whats cheap and easy...and today thats chicken eggs.  you can usually find turkey eggs at farmers markets.  they taste the same but i think they are a little richer/fattier.  I don't work for either of them.  MY COMPANY MAKES BETTER STUFF SO GO BUY A DIFFERENT BRAND! most of what we actually make is private label...we don't really have a brand name but our burgers are AMAZING!!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never thought of it til right now but I watch cooking shows and I see things done with all kinds of eggs, not just chicken eggs but quail and even ostrich eggs, but I have never ever seen anyone do anything at all with a turkey egg. </p></div>		</li>
