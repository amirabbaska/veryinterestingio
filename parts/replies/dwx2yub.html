			<div class="markdown"><p>Waste-to-energy is really interesting. It's not talked about more because it's kind of a NIMBY situation; nobody wants a giant trash burner in their neighborhood. IIRC, in Staten Island they almost got a WtE station built, but there was an outcry from the Jewish community there that said it would remind them of the Holocaust...So that didn't happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a history with an energy supplier, it wasn't something we even talked about much. I think everyone wants to get rid of it (and that will happen) but its good to have some WtE solutions in case of emergencies. </p>
<p>While we want to move to 90% wind and solar, we always need solutions that can provide power in the event of some global disaster. Ideally, that would be more nuclear plants and no natural gas, coal or waste plants but the amount of regulation around nuclear makes it nearly impossible.</p>
<p>We could easily move to 100% non carbon solutions but nuclear needs to be in that cornerstone somewhere (80% renewable, 20% nuclear, or something to that effect).</p>
<p>Power generation is really a fascinating space and it becomes ever more interesting when human interest, health and politics intertwine with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I agree that it's ludicrous what a bad rap nuclear gets. Like, do you wanna move away from fossil fuels or not, people?</p>
<p>I have family in hydro and that industry seems to be in a bad way right now. A lot of projects that were built in the 80's are now up for re-licensing, and oh boy, the amount of regulations and shit states require now vs. then is a big difference. And that's not all bad, but some of the wildlife studies that agencies are starting to require seem a bit extreme to me. &quot;You're an energy company, therefore you're rich, therefore you can afford to just pay for all sorts of research&quot; the governments seem to think, not realizing many of these hydro operators are small businesses on the brink of just packing it up. Then we'll have a bunch of dams sitting around with nobody to manage them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Natural gas plant should still exist. they aren't very dirty, and can spin up pretty quick. Perfect for backup power during disasters. While agree nuclear is the best &quot;non renewable&quot; but the logistics of getting new fuel would be cumbersome during a national crisis. While natural gas is just a pipeline from sources and refineries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Waste plants aren't just producing energy, though.  In burning waste, they break it down, reducing the need for landfills and the like.  Not everything is recyclable.</p>
<p>Also, many folks don't want mainly wind and solar.  It's stupidly varying in its production (windy days vs calm days, sunny summer day vs cloudy winter day), causing a reliance on either ridiculous battery capacity and overcapacity designs (to save up for the bad days) or keeping the non-hippie power plants around to fill in the gaps when the ones you seem to like have a bad weather day/week/season.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They have all of my sympathy and more should be done to educate and remind the rest of people about the holocaust...  but this situation is so dissimilar that it smacks of using a reason that can't sensitively be argued rather than just worrying about air pollution or dropping property values.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! A town near me built a waste-to-energy plant right smack in the middle of town in the 80s, what could possibly go wrong?! Right away when they started it up they forgot some piece of the smokestack emission system and everything got coated in soot. They fixed that, but then the smell! On warm summer days would spread all through the area, such a rich and pungent smell, really sickening. </p>
<p>Finally a few years ago the town actually bought the plant back so they could close it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at one of these plants, but in a different state. I understand some people see the steam escaping from the tower, but with the amount of epa regulation it's no different than the amount of pollution from cars and such. I believe these plants are good for the areas, because it drastically reduced garbage put in landfills (my plant does an average of 4000 tons a day of garbage) and the byproducts (ash, metal recovery) is recycled and used in other areas</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never understood why WtE was such a bad thing. Landfills take up huge swathes of land, require millions of dollars to maintain safely and minimizing environmental impact, and can impact an area for miles around with the smell (just drive through Louisville, KY on a hot day). </p>
<p>Are waste-powered plants really more ecologically harmful than landfills, or is the whole controversy just because &quot;I dont like them&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially in the West, there's a trend to have large regional landfills which take waste from much of the state and have a landfill gas to energy system.  The argument is that they don't pollute the air as much as a waste to energy plant would and are located in areas where groundwater pollution is not a significant factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a WtE facility in Florida, and ours reduces every 7 tons of incoming waste to 1 ton of commingled ash, that is used for daily cover at the county landfill, which as expensive as landfills are to create/maintain, will extend our landfill designed for 10 years to now 70 years. That energy created from burning waste is sold to the local power grid, and we sort out metals in the ash and is sold to scrapers for reuse. And our plant is tested every 6 months for emissions and passes with flying colors every year, and is cleaner than a clean coal plant. The only reason I believe people are against this technology is they haven't researched it enough.</p></div>		</li>
