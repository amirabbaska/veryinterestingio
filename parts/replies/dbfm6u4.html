<p>This means that asking what happened &quot;before&quot; the big bang isn't a well defined question in the same way that asking what is &quot;north&quot; from the north pole isn't a well defined question. When you're standing at the north pole then every direction on Earth is south from you, and when you're standing during the big bang than every &quot;when&quot; in the universe is after that moment.</p>
<p>That isn't to say that it's not possible that the universe never actually was so compressed where the concept of time completely fell apart - it is possible that there was some event in the universe that caused it to heat and compress to the point where our ability to see past it was destroyed, but not so far that all the physical laws broke down. Unfortunately AFAIK there's no current theories on how we would see back in time farther than we can now by examining the cosmic background radiation, since that is the point when the universe became transparent to light.</p></div>		</li>
