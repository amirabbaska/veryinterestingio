			<div class="markdown"><p>You can even find radioactive isotopes of many elements (e.g. phosphorus, calcium, iodine) in all long-living animals' bones and fatty tissue. Not to mention plants. It's pervasive - a minute amount, probably not very significant to the health and lifespan of animals and plants - but it's everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some scientists have pointed out that it is becoming significantly harder to use radiological dating due to nuclear weapons testing and from the burning of coal. Coal actually releases a lot of nuclear isotopes as well. These things filter through the environment and impact everything. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The release of carbon from burning of coal (and other fossil fuels) messes with the C-14 concentration in the atmosphere because it introduces large amounts of stable C-12 and C-13 rather than radioactive carbon.  Fossil fuel carbon is old enough that it is almost completely depleted in C-14.</p>
<p>By contrast, nuclear weapons testing introduced more C-14.  So, modern concentrations are all over the place depending upon where you measure it and how slowly or quickly those locations are tapping into the atmospheric reservoir.  C-14 spiked higher during testing and is pushed the other way by all the C-14-depleted &quot;old&quot; carbon introduced from burning.  It makes for a complicated &quot;modern&quot; C-isotope history.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup. You can also tell when groundwater infiltrated by how much tritium is in it.</p>
