			<p>Not only did many not learn a work ethic, many believe they are entitled to the things others have created or earned, simply because they exist. Thusly the Entitled Generation is born. <br><br>What did idiotic patents expect when everyone gets a trophy when only a minority actually earned them? The lesson is clear. You should get equal things in life even though you didn't earn it. After all, simply showing up is the same as working and winning. Shameful parents have ruined a generation. This, even though many spoke out saying exactly this stupidity would occur. No, cried these parents. Its important they get everything they demand, never having earned anything. Never having developed a work ethic.<br></p>		</li>
