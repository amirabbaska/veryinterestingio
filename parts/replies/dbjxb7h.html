			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite a famous recent example with MRI brain scans and dead salmon I think.</p>
<p>iirc that was down to something like people basically trawling for collorations that applied at a given p value rather than setting a specific hypothesis before the experiment.</p>
<p>Hence they redid it using a dead, frozen salmon and found its 'brain activity' reacting to pictures ;) They gave it a wonderfully dead pan write up in the paper too.</p>
<p>I get the impression that that sort of thing is one quite popular way to abuse this sort of test.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was about the dangers of not using multiple test corrections in fMRI.</p>
<p>The methodology section is also quite amusing.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a direct example right now. But the american statistical association felt the need to release <a href="http://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/P-ValueStatement.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> statement this year.<br />
I guess part of the issue is the arbitrary p=0.05 limit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no example in my head right now. It was a discussion brought by the Nature group. There are some articles the editorial group made last year or in the beginning of this year. But then I wasn't too aware of it and I don't understand statistics very well, so it was never clear in my head.</p></div>		</li>
