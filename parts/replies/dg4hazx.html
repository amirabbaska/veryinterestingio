			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I figured it was something along these lines but, in this case at least, shouldn't they have just had those employees wait rather than risking an incident like this? What if the person selected <em>had</em> to get home or else they'd miss a court appointment, the birth/death of a loved one or some other important life event. There's too many variables - this system only works if they catch their error in time. I realize that this almost never happens but some common sense should have prevailed. Couldn't the employees have waited for the next flight out? They're on the clock. They could care less. A paying customer who is going to have his schedule/life screwed up will raise hell. Sure, other flights would have been short staffed in the meantime but, hey, people call out sick right? This should be no different.</p>
<p>Anyway, correct me if I'm wrong. I'm just giving my opinion here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not an ELI5 question. That's regarding a certain incident. And I can't answer that especially with all the details given. And you're asking a deeper question of &quot;Do you kick four people off a plane to allow another plane to take a couple hundred home.&quot; </p></div>		</li>
