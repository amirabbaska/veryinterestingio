			<div class="markdown"><p>Dont wanna be a dick here but, from his explanation this would also happen when pressure is applied over a very short time. </p>
<p>He forgot to mention (ely5) that the skin always needs blood and wants it really badly when it has not enough of it. Thats why the kapilaries (smallest of blood vessels) release NO to widen the kapilaries to the maximum so that as much blood as possible can fit in them securing the oxygen supply. If pressure is relieved the bloodvessels are still widened and therefore can fit way more blood in them. This turns the skin red until the body realises that NO is not needed anymore. Without NO the vessels reach normal size again and there is no red spot in the skin anymore. (Sorry for bad english)</p></div>		</li>
