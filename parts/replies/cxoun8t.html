			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, sneaky drinkin' at the movies. The trick is to put the whole bottle of booze inside the cup and drop the straw through the middle. The other trick is to not fall asleep halfway through Inception and wake up to an usher shining a light on you and a manager asking you to leave. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, once while at the church all you can eat spaghetti dinner, while getting my mother a coffee, I accidentally poured it into one of the juice cups for children from like McDonalds, instead of a Styrofoam one. Shit was instantly destroyed. </p>
<p>On the other hand I learned that if your cup is made of Styrofoam it is good for hot or cold drinks! </p></div>		</li>
