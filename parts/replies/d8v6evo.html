			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this: Air is a poor conductor. Conduction with the ground (direct contact) will transfer heat (from your body to the floor) considerably faster. So when you have nothing to isolate your feet (no socks) then you will lose heat considerably faster through your feet than through the rest of your body (at minimum per surface area). That's why it's common for homeless to use card board or similar things when they're sleeping on the ground. The heat they lose through the air isn't particularly significant, but without some sort of isolation from the ground, the ground will basically suck the heat out right from them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great addition right here.</p>
<p>While I was up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFS_Alert" target="_blank">north</a> I found I could stay much warmer depending on the boots I was wearing. Even though both were designed for working in the cold, the <a href="http://www.herooutdoors.com/canadian-military-issue-arctic-mukluks-used/" target="_blank">mukluks</a> keep your feet from directly contacting the soles of the boots. </p>
<p>Good addition amigo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems to also explain the &quot;one leg in one leg out&quot; strategy of sleeping that drives my girlfriend crazy. Just poke one foot out of the covers and bam. Perfect temp. </p>
<p>I also concur on the scarves. I have about 7 scarves and rock them all through the winter. </p></div>		</li>
