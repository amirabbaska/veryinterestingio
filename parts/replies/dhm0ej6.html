			<div class="markdown"><p>I have esophageal achalasia- my vagus nerve was damaged heavily four years ago, and the cause is unknown. I would say that it changed my personality to some degree, because I experience stress differently. For starters, before achalasia I would feel stress by &quot;pit of the stomach&quot; feelings and anger would make my arms feel like they had high blood pressure. My mind would think of fighting words or escape scenarios. Now, after my vagus nerve was damaged, I experience that much less, or sort of garbled. Like, if something very extreme is happening, I do feel stomach tightness and think fight or flight thoughts, but the threshold is much higher than it was before. Also, when something very stressful happens, I may not have stressed out thoughts but I will have acid reflux, which I figure is the malfunction of the &quot;pit of stomach&quot; feeling&quot;. So, my body still attempts it, and partially pulls it off, but it is weak and dysfunctional in comparison to what it was before my vagal nerve damage.
Conversely, I think all of this gave me an understanding of what is going on when people have &quot;overactive vagus nerve&quot; and do things like fall unconcious in extreme stress. &quot;Fainting upon hearing bad news&quot; or &quot;fainting at the sight of blood&quot;has been proposed as a culture-bound behavior in the American South, but I think it is based on the folklore of real people with overactive vagus nerves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is really fascinating. It almost sounds like a mild-lobotomy. Probably related to the James-Lange theory regarding emotional response.</p>
<p>I work on implanted medical devices and we're starting to do some vagus nerve stimulation in the treatment for heart disease (it's also being done for rheumatoid arthritis) because the vagus nerve is involved in a lot of those autoinflammatory type diseases. I wonder what some of the long term subtle side effects are going to be after reading this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it seems extreme for me to characterize it as a &quot;mild lobotomy&quot;, I will say that one of the hardships of sufferring the vagal nerve damage is that life suddenly seemed a little less colorful, a little less interesting than before. I actually think that the natural progress of aging feels that way, but this sort of speeded up the process. I mean, I am mostly the same person I was before, but less of a nervous Nelly and more willing to &quot;Go with the Flow&quot;. The downside is a bit of flattened affect, and a bit of lessening of passion/ excitement. Interestingly, I've had two friends who have have had their thyroids removed, and they seem to relate to what I say about the ways that I feel changed.
But I'm glad that you find this fascinating. Because I do still continue to be fascinated by many things (the burgeoning cryptocurrency bubble! Springtime bluebells! Northern Renaissance painting!)
and that is important to my happiness. And in the words of Human League: &quot;Keep Feeling Fascination&quot;: </p>
<p>&quot;Keep feeling fascination,
Passion burning,
Love so strong.
Keep feeling fascination,
Looking, learning,
Moving on.&quot;</p>
<p>That was a favorite song from my childhood and I can still remember how and why I liked it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but I know the vagus nerve triggers the flight/fight/freeze feeling, which can translate to panic attacks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a really interesting question. My dad had a vagotomy, around 30 years ago I think. I'm gonna see him next week - I'll have to ask him about this!</p></div>		</li>
