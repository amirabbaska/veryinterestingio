<p>What is the process for it? Say you found a potential way to cure HIV. Where does that research go after your findings?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HIV Vaccine researcher here. </p>
<p>When you have a new drug you think will be valuable, you test it. Usually in cell culture, then in animal models. If its an HIV vaccine, it is commonly tested in Rhesus Macaques because there aren't great HIV infection models in mice. Most drugs fail to produce promising results.</p>
<p>If the drug does show promising results, a proposal for human testing is written and a clinical trial is scheduled. This must be approved by the FDA (governmental) as well as an Institutional Review Board (which is typically a University panel comprised of scientists, non-scientists, and representatives from the target population.) </p>
<p>If approvals are granted, the drug enters Phase 1 clinical trials, where we assess the tolerability and safety of the drug. This is usually limited to a couple dozen people, who are closely monitored for any safety concerns. Most drugs fail at this step.</p>
<p>If the drug is safe, then the FDA and IRB will grant approval for Phase 2. For vaccines, these are immunogenicity and safety trials: Making sure the vaccine creates the desired antibodies, and is still safe. USually as many as a couple hundred people. Most drugs fail at this step. </p>
<p>If the drug is immunogenic and still safe, approval is sought for Phase 3. Phase 3 is a double blind placebo control efficacy study, and can include thousands of people. For one HIV vaccine trial (the only one to show efficacy to date,) about 7000 people got the experimental vaccine and another 7000 got a placebo. The vaccine group had around 50 cases of HIV 3 years later, while the placebo group got around 70 cases. The final efficacy was published at 31.2% efficacy, because vaccine reduces HIV incidence by that much.</p>
<p>We are now continuing to test this vaccine regimen in other Phase 3 trials, because it must be verified in multiple trials to be confirmed. </p>
<p>Edit: Once confirmed and the drug is commercially available, the effects continue to be monitored through so-called &quot;Phase 4&quot; trials, which we use to continuously monitor the drugs to ensure they continue to work. The goals of Phase 4 trials are generally to see if improvements can be made to the drug. We also often shift from Placebo-Control trials to &quot;Standard vs Experimental&quot; drug testing, where a new vaccine formulation is compared with the standard formulation to see if an improvement can be achieved, often in a subpopulation. For example, a high-dose flu vaccine was shown to be more immunogenic in elderly patients, compared with a regular dose. (This was not shown to be more efficacious, however, and is falling out of favor.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once a drug has demonstrated efficacy, usually on a cell culture or similar, animal models are next (e.g. the pigs mentioned above). If drugs aren't yet totally thrown out the window, then it's on to clinical trials. And if by some miracle a drug makes it out of clinical trials, in America, it would be subject to FDA approval for widespread production and sales</p>
<p>I'm emphasizing here that the amount of drugs that make it all the way through to FDA approval compared to the amount of drugs that are &quot;discovered&quot; in the first place is <em>incredibly</em> small</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I'm not a medical professional, but the amount of misinformation about bringing. New drug to market is ridiculous.</p>
<p>People see &quot;cancer cells completely destroyed during in-vitro trials&quot; and think some sort of cure is right around the corner. Nope, that is pretty much the first stage of testing, if it doesn't kill the pig or have crazy side effects, and somehow makes it to clinical trials, you are still years away from potential FDA approval. Shit takes time, and it's not necessarily a process you want to rush through (especially for cancer meds that are literally trying to selectively destroy certain parts of your body.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a biomedical engineer and I'm glad other people are out there explaining this.</p>
<p>I won't make excuses for the US medical system because our whole pricing system is definitely broken for the end consumer, but medical development really is expensive.</p>
<p>People say &quot;well, that pill only costs
$1 to make, why does it sell for $50 a pill!&quot;</p>
<p>The answer is that it took millions of dollars to get that pill to market. And there were 5 other drugs in development that had millions of dollars spent on them that failed in clinical trials and those costs have to be recouped.</p>
<p>A pill may cost a dollar to make, but the FIRST pill cost millions, so the cost is spread out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't blame people though, I'm UK based, so slightly different. Our budget for equipment servicing and calibration (only in R&amp;D, not including manufacturing) is 20million GBP. Drop a pipette? That'll need re-serviced and calibrated, so there's £1500. Costs trickle down from other contractors, but people think all of it ends up in our pockets. They don't understand how expensive it is to run a facility like this.</p>
<p>I'm glad you can also appreciate where I'm coming from, being in a very similar industry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that but they only have a relatively small window to recoup those costs. After their patent is up every rival company can start making their drug and sell it for that dollar </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! Im happy paying the premium price because I know its for  recoupinh costs of making the drug and I am very grategul that people invent drugs for all type of things and il support the effort by helping to make it profitable by buying only from the orginal drug producer even if its the exact same as generic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That made for an interesting read. May I ask why the cost to run a trial on the 3 pigs cost 1.8million? I'm just curious to know what specifically is incurring a huge cost. </p>
<p>Are there any safeguards into preventing ridiculous profits to companies/organisations involved in these trials that exist? Are there any that could be introduced to reduce these costs and speed-up research/internal politics? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, obviously it’s a very dumbed down version. But you get the general overview of it. </p>
<p>The cost of that came from specifically bred animals, a trained surgical staff, a site for the trial and then the cost of submission. Keep in mind, this trial was run due to a question from the FDA on a previous submission. This was just one regulatory body that asked for this study. We deal with multiple bodies as we sell internationally. </p>
<p>The safeguard is competition; along with the legal side of price fixing, I imagine. But I’m not involved in legal in any way, shape, or form. We’re a world leader in our field, but we still need to market competitively. As I said in another post, on initial product release/revamp, we have a policy that we will incur profits not exceeding 55% of manufacturing cost. Once research/submission for approval costs are recouped, we drop that to 30% for the remainder of the product life-cycle.</p>
<p>You’re opening a can of worms with that last question, but I’ll try answer it without completely boring you. In a word, YES. The red tape and paperwork required is utterly mind boggling. Now, that’s part and parcel of the field I work in. But we get spot-audited, so all paperwork must be absolutely ON POINT. And due to ISO regulations, the paperwork is semi-standardised. And it’s absolute overkill. For example, I’m in the process of writing a new experimental procedure to check for residual formaldehyde in one of our products. The research into the method and writing the protocol has taken about 2 weeks. But now, I need to ‘validate’ the method with 3 people carrying out the test over 3 days. Then the results of this test get scrutinised by people in other departments that have absolutely no scientific knowledge or experience with the equipment in our lab. This can take months, purely because they don’t understand the terminology or method. All because our policies say senior members in other departments must sign off on a research test method. Waste of time and money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue with this article was that it doesn't break down what marketing money was spent on pharmaceutical drugs and what was spent marketing consumer products.  They assume if marketing was directed at doctors then it was prescription.  Johnson and Johnson makes baby shampoo and bandaid as well as Tylenol, Zyrtec, Imodium and benedryl.  They also don't explain what was spent at physician vs dentist: get a free listerine at the dentist? Johnson and Johnson.   Or eye doctor: got a trial pair of Accuvue contacts?  Johnson and Johnson.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main protection is that generic copies will come out a few years after the product is put on the market, and, since it is a new product, people aren't losing anything by an absurdly expensive drug coming onto the market, they just won't gain from it.  </p>
<p>So, after a few years, the price will come down due to competition and the fact that the initial company no longer has the ability to charge anything they want and stiff the consumers involved.  </p>
<p>Additionally, a lot of governments will actually state what they will pay for a drug for their citizens, which places a soft cap on how expensive the drug can be, as people from other nations can purchase the drug there and ship it home.  </p>
<p>This time, between release and generics, is when the parent company that produced the drug will usually attempt to recoup some of their R&amp;D costs, so prices are generally higher than market clearing, which means that they are set high enough that people who need it won't be able to get it, which is suboptimal but sort of necessary to allow the business to continue to develop and test new drugs.    </p>
<p>Obviously, there are market failures, and this is an idealized scenario, but it illustrates some of the process for drugs to enter the market and decrease in price.  </p>
<p>With regard to speeding up R&amp;D, sort of.  Basically the FDA doesn't want to let ineffective/dangerous drugs enter the market, so everything must go through a large battery of tests.  Each time you reduce the number/complexity of the tests, you are risking the lives/quality of life of everyone who uses that drug.  </p>
<p>The process could certainly be simplified, but doing it in a way that maintains the stringent protections that the American consumer wants is very difficult.  We still have massive lawsuits because a test didn't catch a major flaw in a small subset of the population, even with years of careful testing.</p></div>		</li>
