			<div class="markdown"><p>a very common tactic when river fishing for salmon, particularly farther upstream, is to bait with salmon eggs instead of regular food bait. this works because the salmon don't want to eat, but will still go out of their way to destroy nests of competing salmon eggs in order to better the survival chance of their own offspring. </p></div>		</li>
