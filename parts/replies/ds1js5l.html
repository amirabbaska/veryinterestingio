<p>Quick question though. For Accel + Optical, if you launched it in an already moving car, wouldnt it work correctly then? An accelerometer won't register as moving if the car is steadily going in a straight line, and the optical would agree because it only sees the car, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was poorly worded, you're 100% correct. I meant the computer will get mad if the vehicle accelerates, the combo will work exceptionally well in an already moving vehicle. I've edited my post to clear it up.</p></div>		</li>
