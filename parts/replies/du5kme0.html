			<div class="markdown"><p>Narcoleptic here: where does the role of hypocretin/orexin (two names for the same neurotransmitter) factor into this? The reason for my narcolepsy is due to my lack/deficiency of hypocretin, which is the neurotransmitter that controls the sleep/wake cycle. I feel like that has to be pretty important here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypocretin is basically the opposite of adenosine. It is the hormone that regulates wakefulness. In people with narcolepsy, the immune system destroys the brain cells responsible for generating hypocretin. Because of the lack of hypocretin telling you that you are awake, your brain occasionally decides not to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Type 1 narcolepsy is pretty clearly linked to destruction of hypocretin producing cells in the hypothalamus, probably by the immune system. It is likely a gene-environment interaction that leads to this error by the immune system: more people with T1N have the HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele. This is a gene that relates to how your own body's cells signal to your immune system that they belong and should not be destroyed. <a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HLA-DQB1#conditions" target="_blank">Other versions of the HLA-DQB1 gene are linked other autoimmune disorders</a>.</p>
<p>Hypocretin (also known as Orexin) is a wake-promoting neurotransmitter, along with serotonin, norepinephrine, histamine, and glutamate. Beyond just promoting wakefulness, hypocretin plays a role in stabilizing sleep/wake transitions, leading to disturbed sleep in narcolepsy in addition to excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and other symptoms.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is quite true that we know a whole lot less about type 2 narcolepsy and the related condition known as idiopathic hypersomnia.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Too much bright light like computer screens late in the evening reset your Circadian rhythms and trick your brain into thinking it's earlier than it is, making the C factor not push enough to let you fall asleep when you want.</p>

<p>huh... I guess that explains why, when I really get in to a game, I can easily play all night and not feel tired at all until I finally stop.   any more, my contact lenses force me to stop before any feeling of fatigue does... when I've been wearing them all day and in to the night my eyes start burning bad... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are like me and love playing games but only have time late at night, you could try buying some amber tinted glasses.  I would have trouble being tired, getting to sleep once I was in bed, and then I would be pretty restless at night and always wake up a couple times per night to toss or turn.  I downloaded some programs like f.lux to adjust the blue light in my monitors, but I didn't like that it not only used up resources on my PC, but it drastically changed the color of my games which really annoyed me.  I finally gave some gamer glasses a try, the ones with the amber-tinted lens.  I have really noticed a difference in my sleep.  I fall asleep much quicker once I go to bed and I feel more rested in the morning as well.  It may be a placebo effect, but I keep wearing them.  They don't seem to affect the color of my games as much.  Maybe give them a try.  I recommend Gunnar but I really don't have any other experience with other brands except what I've heard from friends that have said not to buy cheap gamer glasses as they are flimsy and will break.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yesterday I watched the shark tank with Gunnar and thought it was an absolute scam since it is like $70 for something f.lux does for free. I was so ticked off the entire time as the guy was arrogant and that what he did was like so great. Is Gunnar honestly better?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>some modern monitors also have a setting that removes most of the blue spectrum as well. I haven't used it but it could be helpful if this is a problem. On mine it's called &quot;eye saver mode&quot; I think.</p></div>		</li>
