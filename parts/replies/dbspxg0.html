			<div class="markdown"><p>Those types of phase diagrams are 2D projections of more complicated 3D surfaces.  Each phase has an associated free energy (chemical potential) of formation which takes into account entropy, bond strength between atoms/molecules, etc.  The free energy of each phase will be a function of the pressure and temperature.  The phase with the lowest free energy for a given temperature and pressure is the one the system &quot;wants&quot; to be in, however a transformation could be inhibited by the kinetics or something like nucleation barriers.  The phase diagram is just a map in P,T space of what surface has the lowest free energy and the boundaries are the point of intersection.  Sublimation occurs because the liquid free energy surface lies above (at higher energy) the intersection of solid and gas surfaces. </p></div>		</li>
