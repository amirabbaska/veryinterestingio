			<div class="markdown"><p>We do in the US as well.  Cardiohelp ECMO systems are mobile and many large ECMO programs in the US also have an ECMO outreach.  This includes in the field and at other small rural hospitals that do not have ECMO capability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lungs do not need to &quot;breathe&quot; but we do like to keep them expanded with positive pressure. If a patient is fully supported on ECMO, the CO2 is already being removed outside of the body so the brain isn't receiving the signal to breathe.</p>
<p>I have seen a patient on ECMO, fully supported, on a ventilator, however the mode is just CPAP or continuous positive airway pressure to keep the lungs open as opposed to shriveled and collapsed in the chest. Very rarely does this patient actually have respirations where the chest is expanding and retracting. When sleeping, all lung volumes and respirations and other ventilatory measurements read 0. </p></div>		</li>
