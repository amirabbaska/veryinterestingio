<p>If I stare enough at something (e.g structure of an efferent neurone) on the board, it gets into my head pretty quick, but I have shitty short term memory (What did she ask me to do?). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What disability? Because that sounds exactly like me. Shitty handwriting + shitty short-term memory (actually more like shitty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory" target="_blank">working memory</a> and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions" target="_blank">executive functions</a> which I assume is what you meant if you actually aced tests) which I self-diagnosed as ADHD. My reasoning skills are excellent but my task management is horrible, which leads me to believe it isn't actually a memory, but an interference-based problem.</p></div>		</li>
