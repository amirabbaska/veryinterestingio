<p>The duplication of effort in running multiple lines to everybodys house people on any side of the issue agree is a giant waste, just like electricity and water. </p>
<p>Utilities act as functional monopolies with government oversight, or the government itself owns the actual pipes with set wholesale prices for any private or public company to retail them to customers, ensuring competition.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Out of curiosity can you prove that &quot;natural monopolies&quot; are a real thing?  I recognize that there are Econ books out there that talk about them and I even had books that used telecomms as an example, even though after AT&amp;T's monopoly rights, as enforced by the government, expired there was a huge surge in competition and they lost 1/2 of their market shares within a decade or two.  I'm just curious if you have any hard line data that shows that there are actual markets where it's impossible for competition to come about once a company has taken hold of a market share.  I've yet to find one and all the examples people give me we can find examples where it's not true throughout American history or through other countries without regulations that prevented competition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't prove anything myself as I'm just studying it at a relatively beginner level (high school/first year college) but it does make sense that because society wants the most efficient combination of resources etc you wouldn't waste your time and money building a second set of infrastructure. I do recall there might have been some British examples as we use an English textbook - I'll have a look. </p></div>		</li>
