<p>Personally I'm torn. To answer this question, we have to weigh the probability that the relevant technologies will be available, practical, and utilized effectively, as well as whether or not the popular support for space travel will be there, and all of these questions are really complicated individually, let alone combined like this.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we've seen such huge technological advances in the last fifty years that it seems very plausible we could figure out answers to the current problems of space travel (propulsion being a key one), and colonization. And it's also possible that the public support will allow these technologies to be used quickly enough that we will see space travel become common.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there's so many things that will affect space travel (especially to other planets in our solar system), that it's very hard to predict. What happens if governments can't agree on how to regulate space travel in-practice? What happens if other social problems get in the way of focusing on developing an entirely new section of infrastructure?</p>
<p>Overall, personally I think it's up in the air and we'll just have to see what happens.</p>
