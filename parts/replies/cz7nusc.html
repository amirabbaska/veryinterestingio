			<div class="markdown"><p>It took a shit load of reading to find someone who knew what they were talking about. </p>
<p>The army and marines were the only branches with snipers. The marines basically discontinued that specialty after WW2 and hathcock was instrumental in bringing it back. However, the army and marines do not philosophically agree on how anything is done.</p>
<p>The army (we are army) sniper program used a m14 platform for their snipers specifically for the reasons that a semi auto was advantageous and for a number of years smirked at the &quot;marine way&quot;. The marines (I am a marine) chose the bolt action for its advantages (and in no small part because hathcock and his CO were leading the charge in Vietnam to show the value to the program.)</p>
<p>When we look at the modern sniper in popular tv/movies/books the program that we look at is the marines sniper program. That program is designed to focus on a two man team with an engagement range of 1000 yards as a covert mission. Not all sniper programs are created with the same mission design in mind. </p>
<p>Law enforcement is designed for tight(er) urban combat and shots for law enforcement are taken (generally) within 300 yards. They have a much more regulated firing program (specific authorization for engagement is given at the moment via comms) and bolt action makes perfect sense when you are authorized for a single shot. </p>
<p>Military is trained for 300+ yards. As I understand it the army program is designed to not ignore the possibility of multiple target engagement and as a defensive or support position a large percentage of the time. In the 1960's the army also chose to be more in the forefront of technology with the sniper program and add early night vision to their test program for snipers. If multiple targets and 600-900 yards is the range that you are designing target encounters for then a semi auto has serious advantages. </p>
<p>It is also worth nothing that the army had moved away from the designated marksman as a squad position as they thought that all future wars would be close up things in mostly urban settings (not completely, mostly) and had phased out the m14 platform for most use. Afghanistan changed that as it would be much more routine to be engaged by the enemy at much greater distances, so there was a call to &quot;beef up&quot; the designated marksman program and bring back the m14. (I fully realize the DM is not a sniper, it was anecdotal and not supportive, just something I found interesting.)</p>
<p>I found a reply on another site that provides an additional answer that I found relevant:</p>
<p>&quot;The function is much broader in the Marines. Marines don't have snipers, they have scout/snipers. The Army sniper school is a 5 week program while the Marine scout/sniper receive 9 weeks of specialized training. </p>
<p>I'll explain the sniper role first, this will give you a view of what both Marine and Army snipers do. They don't operate like WWII or Vietnam snipers operated. Today's snipers are placed in positions to add firepower to ongoing operations. They can confuse the enemy by placing well-aimed rounds into enemy positions. Previously, snipers were not typically used directly as part of a battle. Today, they impact the battle. </p>
<p>A scout/sniper can be placed in the role of a sniper. He can also provide intelligence to the commanders of an operation. An important duty of the Marine scout/sniper is to observe and provide imformation to impact the outcome of the battle. </p>
<p>This is somewhat similar to what MACV-SOG did in Vietnam. MACV-SOG was known, by those who had no idea, in Vietnam as special operations group. The CIA allowed people to make this misinformed use of the name because it suited their purposes. SOG in MACV-SOG actually meant Studies and Observation Group, not special operations group. Their purpose was to observe the enemy and provide intelligence to affect the outcome of the war. MACV-SOG was the Green Beret. They had support from several air support teams including my Marine Corps squadron. </p>
<p>So, the reason the Marines provide 9 weeks training versus the 5 weeks training provided by the Army is simply because the Marine scout/sniper has a responsibility for more tasks and he receives more marksmanship training than an Army sniper. The Marine Corps is big on marksmanship. </p>
<p>And Marine snipers are not trained in an Army program. The person who said that is probably thinking of Marine Recon who receive their paratrooper training, a very small part of their training, with the Army at Ft. BenninG, GA.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
