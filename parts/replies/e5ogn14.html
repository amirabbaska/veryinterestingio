			<div class="markdown"><p>I have only ever used it once and I felt like the baddie. It was a massive spider, it was on my bed and I was home alone. Iâ€™m terrified of spiders. I got the spray and it died in what looked like the most horrific way. I was definitely the bad guy. Sorry spider. I never used it again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insecticides almost always contain organophosphates, which are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, related to nerve gasses like sarin, and novichok. These cause nerves to remain in a permanently triggered state, resulting in muscles contracting violently, and at random at first. The victim, be it insect or mammal, dies of suffocation, as the diaphragm can no longer breathe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Organophosphates are mainly used in agricultural application, not insecticidal sprays for home use. We have a few for gardening application but that stuff doesn't get used in the house. </p>
<p>Fun fact: Farmers have a tendency to appear in the emergency room in cholinergic crisis when they're exposed to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for which the antidote is atropine and intubation until the muscle paralysis resolves.</p></div>		</li>
