			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, modern humans have lived in Europe since 35000-40000 years ago. Some even migrated into for example scandinavia alongside the retraction of the glaciers. </p>
<p>H. Sapiens existed before the latest glaciation began 100,000 years ago. But then only in smaller regions of Africa. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because we are very possibly pushing things too fast.</p>
<p>Imagine the climate is a swing that is swinging back and forth. Natural processes keep it going at the natural frequency, but human effects are giving it a surprisingly effective push to speed it up. Either we push it at the right time and make the swings more extreme, or we push it at the wrong time and dampen them. We could also never stop pushing and stop the swing entirely.</p>
<p>The natural assumption is that the Earth and space and history is too damn big for us to affect it, which is why that's such a compelling argument, but the data seems to contradict that assumption or at least cast very real doubt that warrants extensive reevaluation. Originally these findings were very surprising, but it took people challenging their assumptions to look into it further so that we know as much as we do. It is still easy to fall back to seemingly obvious assumptions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, at the moment we only have effective means to push the &quot;swing&quot; in one direction. We have no energy effective means of sequestering greenhouse gasses. So there is a risk to find ourselves in a situation that we have no control over. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The climate change we see now in the last hundred years has nothing to do with the glaciation and inter-glaciation periods. These happens on a much larger time scale. The anthropogenic climate change we've caused is an outcry because it seriously jeopardizes our possibility to conduct civilisation and agriculture on this planet in the coming centuries starting a few decades ago.</p></div>		</li>
