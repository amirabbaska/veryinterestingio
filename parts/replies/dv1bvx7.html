			<div class="markdown"><p>So is it technically possible for an astronomical event to create an element even more heavy than Uranium? </p>
<p>For as example Ununoctium is the heaviest element till date right? But it's synthetic. So is it possible for an element like this to be created naturally if suitable conditions are present? Also, would that element be stable at all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a tricky question. Elements heavier than uranium are <em>definitely</em> created by such events, but perhaps not <em>superheavy</em> elements (Z~120). As you pointed out, they aren't stable anyway. During the r-process, you might create elements at Z=110, but they may only be present for a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>Currently, some simulations show that the superheavy region (near Z=120) <em>cannot</em> be populated naturally, mostly because nuclei fission before they would get that heavy. But we have so little data in that region, we really can't say for sure. One research group says superheavy elements can be created naturally, another group says they can't... Either way, they'll decay too quickly for us to observe them.</p>
<p>(Sorry, Z=atomic number)</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Of course. We are not creating them &quot;unnaturally&quot; in any way. We can only create conditions under which such processes spontaneously occur. On Earth, those conditions are hard to create and contain, but the energy scale of stellar processes dwarfs anything on Earth, so those conditions are much more easily created.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, would that element be stable at all?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While individual atoms would probably be even less stable than on Earth, there would certainly be a steady state total mass of such elements which might last for considerable periods of time (seconds or longer).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here’s one for ya that I’ve always wondered...  is there a theoretical limit to the “largest” (by atomic number) element?  For instance, is there any reason to believe that if half the known universe crashed into the other half of the known universe some very long time from now... perhaps an element of atomic number 119... or 1000 even might be created?</p>
<p>Maybe that’s silly, but I’ve just never heard whether there is a known limit. </p></div>		</li>

<p>One interesting school of thought is element 137: Richard Feynman theorized that the electrons orbiting the nucleus would have to travel faster than the speed of light. The element is colloquially dubbed feynmanium in his honor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a very good question, and to answer that we have to rely on theoretical models of nuclear masses. The problem is, there are a lot of theories out there explaining masses of nuclei, but they wildly disagree! I'm sorry <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/860811/files/Figure42.png" target="_blank">this plot</a> is so small, but basically, it shows how much these models disagree. Each colored line is a different theoretical model. The flat area is compared to masses of nuclei that have already been measured. It seems obvious that they all agree because there is data that you can fit your model to. But as soon as you go to heavier masses where we don't have measurements, and there's a huge difference! And this is for an element we know (just a really heavy isotope of that element). Nuclear mass models are pretty bad at predicting things.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if any nuclear mass models predict a <em>largest</em> element, but many of them don't bother to provide data for masses above A~300. Which begs the question: what defines the largest element? <em>I think</em> (correct me if I'm wrong) that the heaviest elements were discovered by observing alpha (Z,N=2,2) decay into slightly lighter elements. If you observe alpha+(Z,N), you must have started with (Z+2,N+2). This means that the nucleus (Z+2,N+2) existed. There are certainty theoretical alpha decay half-lives for heavy nuclei, but does that mean the theories predict that it exists? It's a hairy question, but a good one.</p>

<p>You must be doing some really cool work in this area, any chance there’s publicly available info about what you’re doing that you’d care to share?  I’d love to read up on it. </p>
