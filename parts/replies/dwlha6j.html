			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically this. Much psychology, habit forming tools, manipulation, and mental gymnastics are employed by platform owners to get you addicted, to get you to tell your friends to join, to get you to click on ads, to get you to do what they want. </p>
<p>Their job is to have you on the app for as long as possible and as often as possible and to come back as often as possible... </p>
<p>Their job is to basically get you hooked by manipulating things down to colors, placements of buttons, how to share, why to share, how to give you shots of serotonin by getting likes or advancing to the next round in games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple types of ads, not all require clicks to be useful. </p>
<p>One fork involves simply seeing a brand or business commonly associated with something. So you may see an ad for a random product you never would need, but over time you begin to subtly become more familiar with the brand. Next time you're in the market for something that brand makes or sells - but let's say you don't know much about - , you're drastically more likely to choose something from that brand almost completely subliminally because it feels familiar. </p>
<p>I think the last statistics I read said it only takes seeing an ad of that style about 4-5 times before if imprints on you enough to effect your impulsive preference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It definitely boosted how much time I spent in the app in the short term. Long term though I barely use it anymore because it got too annoying. </p>
<p>I feel like they frequently go for short term gains over long term. </p></div>		</li>
