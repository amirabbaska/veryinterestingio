			<div class="markdown"><p>i never liked (i) this example to be honest.  Gas never seems to wait to shoot up whenever something happens but for some reason as soon as the barrel of oils price goes down suddenly there are all these reasons why it doesn't go down as quick as it went up.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there is a sudden spike in prices, gas stations will immediately raise their price because they don't want to sell at a loss. If there is a sudden drop in prices, it's much less urgent to lower prices. Their profit per gallon will increase but they will slowly lose customers to competitors if they leave it high for too long. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are three primary reasons why California traditionally has higher gas prices.</p>
<p>1) California has <a href="http://www.api.org/~/media/primer-images/high-res/gasoline-taxes.jpg?la=en" target="_blank">one of the highest combined gasoline taxes in the USA.</a>  Combined federal, state, and local taxes leaves the average tax around $0.65.  California's used to be <em>the</em> highest combined tax, but it was recently passed by Pennsylvania.  Compared to places like Oklahoma and Texas, you're paying around 30 cents more for a single gallon of gasoline before any other factors come into play.</p>
<p>2) California is the only state in the nation that requires an additive called CARBOB to be blended into the gasoline.  Due to certain properties of the additive, crude oil must be further refined in order to pass certain legal requirements; in addition, the additive itself is not cheap.  All of this significantly increases the cost of gasoline.</p>
<p>3) Gasoline sold in California must be refined in California.  This means that gasoline refined outside of the state cannot be brought in if there is a shortage in California.  The state also receives no benefit if there is a surplus of gasoline elsewhere.</p>
<p>These three facts - along with the difficulty in new creating new midstream infrastructure (e.g. pipelines, rail, trucks, etc.) and <a href="http://www.propublica.org/images/ngen/gypsy_big_image/pipeline_line_map-630x420.gif" target="_blank">California's lack of current infrastructure</a> - results in a strange market that consistently has higher prices than anywhere else in the country.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had no idea about that additive until this thread. How long  has that been going on? I also had no idea it had to be refined here. I figured the high price was purely because tax. Huh TIL. Going to have to educate myself on this more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another large issue is that California mandates two different blends for the year: one for summer, and one for winter. This drives cost up and makes it difficult for refineries to keep prices lower. </p>
<p>Edit: I forgot to mention that the two different blends are to adjust for differences in volatility (the propensity for the gasoline to become vapor) during the colder and hotter months.</p></div>		</li>
