			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's probably because you're playing a video game. The game is providing the stimulus you're looking for and sometimes you're even directly interacting with the person you're talking to at the time and can see them in game.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These ones make sense but I was specifically looking for the ones where we don't play the same game together. </p>

<p>So what about</p>

<p>makes it particularly easier when it's not the same game? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there are a couple things there. You mention a headset, but then you mention Skype. If you're Skyping, then the reason you can sit still is because you have those visual cues there.</p>
<p>For the headset, most people wear a headset because they are doing something else while on the phone. Are you sitting still while ONLY using the headset to take a call? Or are you using a headset AND doing something else (like using a computer, writing, typing, w.e)?</p>
<p>This question specifies walking, but really any distracting physical activity takes the place of the visual cue we are denied over the phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to spend hours just talking to my friends on Xbox using the headset. Instead of pacing around the room I would aimlessly wander around in whatever game I was playing or we would be playing together. I think any &quot;mindless&quot; distraction can take the place of pacing as long as it's holding your body's attention but not taking you away from the conversation.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Just so you know - a lot of people use the voice-calling feature of skype without the video. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I use Skype there is no visual interaction. I don't use a webcam, I have Skype in the background most of the time. I don't have a smartphone (call me old fashioned). While I sometimes do something while talking with Skype, often as not I just sit and talk - nothing else. </p>
<p>Then again, everyone I know says I can't be put as an example.</p></div>		</li>
