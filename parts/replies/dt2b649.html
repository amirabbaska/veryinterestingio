			<div class="markdown"><p>No, organ recipients are on immunosuppresants forever. But with newer drugs, their immune system mostly comes back. My wife's nephrologist says within a year you're up to about 95% immune capability when it comes to germs.</p>
<p>I know they've done some experimental stuff where they don't need immunosuppresants, like wiping out the recipient's immune system and giving them a bone marrow transplant to convert their immune system to the donor's, but that's pretty cutting-edge stuff.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Um, wouldn't the immune system then attack the rest of the body?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what they do for Lukemia already, isn't it? Do they not do it because it's way too much to put the patient through compared to just using the immunosuppressants afterwards or is it that they don't actually have this down well enough that they know it would work for transplantation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep - we're doing it over here at Stanford. If we can get mixed chimerism in the recipient (when the patient's immune system is consisted of both itself and the donor's), then that's a really good sign that the recipient will have stable tolerance to the transplanted organ, and we can taper off the immunosuppressants accordingly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's permanent. Your immune defense can detect whether a cell belongs in your body or not by looking at some molecules (proteins) on the outside of the cell. You can think of these proteins as a kind of a fingerprint that is <em>sort of</em> unique to each person since it's determined by your DNA.</p>
<p>If you receive an organ transplant, the doctors have to make sure that the donor's fingerprint is as close to the recipients fingerprint as possible. If they're too different, the organ will almost certainly be rejected. But if the donor cells look sort of the same as your own cells, there's a good chance that your immune system can be &quot;tricked&quot; into leaving the donated tissue alone.</p>
<p>But the donated cells still have the original donor's DNA, and even though the individual cells will all eventually die and be replaced by fresh clones, those clones are <em>still</em> made from someone else's DNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If stem cell research gets a bit further, it may be possible to take a donated heart, clear it of everything but the protein structure that is kind of its &quot;skeleton&quot; in a way, then re-seed it with stem cells from the recipient. In theory, this would make it so the recipient's immune system wouldn't attack it and it would be like a brand new heart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also why it's extremely preferable to receive an organ donation from an identical twin. The body's immune system doesn't attack the new organ because it doesn't sense anything being different on a DNA level.</p>
<p>Taking that further, if human cloning ever becomes a ubiquitous, inexpensive endeavor, it could be common practice for all people to have a clone created and kept in stasis so there is always a spare for everything. But that also introduces a whole range of moral issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moral issue #1: Which Ewan McGregor is used to play Obi-Wan in the new Kenobi film? What if they age the clone a bit to reflect 10 years of hermitting on a desert planet with two suns? What if original Ewan decides to live hard from now till filming, then wants a stasis-clone's organs to reset his clock?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds better to come up with a way to artificially grow organs based on your own dna. Maybe just slighly modified to remove the resson you need a new organ, if it was genetic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A much more likely outcome will be either artificial organs or the ability to grow/sustain organs outside a persons body.</p></div>		</li>
