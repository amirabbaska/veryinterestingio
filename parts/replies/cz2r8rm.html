If you wear goggles that invert your vision, after a few days everything starts to look right side up again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have something related to this.
I have been an avid halo player since the days of Halo 3. For years I used the default setting that was in Halo 3. Even when I started playing Halo Reach, I switched to buttons to be very similar to 3's. I also did the same with Halo 4. But when Halo 5 came out I changed the button layout to resemble the Call of Duty style. </p>
<p>Here is the thing. Before this, when I would play Halo, I would instantly be able to start using that button layout and it wouldn't be a problem. The same went for CoD. Within my first game, I was used to the button layout. </p>
<p>When Xbox One made Halo Reach backwards compatible, I decided to play a few games. I figured that I could just play with the button layout that I always played Reach with and it would be fine. </p>
<p>Nope. I really had to think about every sing thing I was doing. What used to be immediate reflex to a situation turned into me extensively thinking what button I needed to push to reload or throw a grenade. Playing Halo 5 in the CoD style for a few months completely broke  the way I played other Halo games for years. It felt quite odd. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the comment section they talked about some goggles that make you see the world upside down and after a few days something 'clicked' and you started seeing things upright again.<br />
I was looking for them and the only ones you can buy online have a really <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJTC_E2Nlgg" target="_blank">narrow fov</a>.  </p>
<p>Does anyone know how to build some that actually allow me to see everything upside down but with a wide fov?</p></div>		</li>
