<p>cross drives were around before phillips. Phillips heads are a specific variation of a cross drive screw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's especially made to torque out instead of break the head off. Problem is it became the standard screw head type and is the worst choice for a lot of applications, like for electronics and general woodworking. Add in making out of cheap soft metals and you have wood screws that strip when hand tightening and fuck you Home Depot and your shit store brand screws. Point being I'm not going to hand tighten a head off a good screw and phillips is not an appropriate choice. For drills or manufacturing when the screw probably won't ever be taken out sure use phillips. Robertson is superior for woodworking but rare in the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Robertson (square) bits actually came before Philips (cross). Ford realized that using Robertson bits instead of flat head, would save them hours of time on each car built. Ford tried to license the design from Robertson but Robertson refused. Philips was perfectly willing to cooperate with Ford and so that is the one that really took off in the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I heard it was that Ford wanted exclusive rights to make/use Robertson screws in the US, but Robertson saw that as the shitty deal that was, so refused. Then Ford did his damnedest to prevent anyone from using them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fun fact</p>
<p>John Thompson invented the &quot;Phillips&quot; but he wasn't a good salesman. He tried and tried to get automakers and other industries to buy into his screw and everyone was like &quot;pfft we've got flat heads that work fine&quot; Henry Phillips bought the idea refined the shape so that a driver would self-center into it and then he patented it and sold it off to car makers. </p>
<p>Phillips rolled on up to the automakers and said &quot;Boy do I have a screw for you.&quot; They said &quot;that Thompson fella already tried, get on outta here ya scalawag.&quot; Phillips said, 'my screw self centers, Thompson's was just a flat X. My screw will increase productivity and efficiency. Any old drunk, blind man or poor eye sighted child with a hook for a hand can throw a screw driver up near the head of the screw and it will find the center and be ready to turn in a jiffy.' </p>
<p>The fine folks at GM said &quot;well sir you've got us sold. That was a mighty fine overture. We respect your idea and we love speed. Here at GM the faster we can get those tiny kids to twist on those screws the faster I can get home to ignore my own children, beat my wive and drink whiskey.  We'll take 45 million of your screws, Mr. Phillips. My secretary has the paper work go on ahead and give her a shout on in here. So I can disrespect her as a woman in a sexual manner.&quot; </p>
<p>Thus the Phillips screw was born.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything is true sans, what was said. Thompson really did invent it and failed to sell it to automakers because it was a flat X. Phillips bought the idea from him. Made it self-centering by adding a deeper hole in the middle of the X so the tip of the screwdriver would self center into it with the combo of the tip hole and the X ridges. Phillips was a better salesman than Thompson and really did sell the screw off to them. Thus the Phillips was born. </p></div>		</li>
