			<div class="markdown"><p>They tried bikes w dual lights, turns out they are even worse. Two head lights close together look like a car much further away. One trick I use is to weave back and forth a bit approaching intersections, stop looking like a car real quick.</p></div>		</li>

Like yellowish for cars and blueish for bikes or something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume that would be a hard thing to standardize until only recently.  My 49cc scooter has a hard enough time to fully light a 35 watt bulb when i'm idling - and when I rev the lights get brighter.  I would assume a lot of motorcycles have the same issue with keeping a steady amperage like a car.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>your eye needs to be able to detect the difference in angle between light leaving (say) the right and left edges of the disc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To put some hard numbers here, <strong>most people will see anything that has an angular size smaller than 1 arc-minute as a point source</strong> (1/60^th of a degree). For planets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At its closest, Jupiter is 0.8 arc-minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saturn: 0.35 arc-minutes, and with rings: 0.8 arc-minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mars: 0.4 arc-minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mercury: 0.2 arc-minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uranus: 0.07 arc-minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neptune: 0.04 arc-minutes</p>
</li>
<li>Venus: 1 arc-minute. Some folks claim they can make out the crescent during the very closest approach, but this is a really difficult observation to make as its very close to the Sun from our point of view.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for stars:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Betelgeuse is the largest, at 0.001 arc-minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>Alpha Centauri: 0.0001 arc-minutes</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does this relate to &quot;power&quot; on binoculars are telescopes.  If a human who can resolve 1 arcminute is using &quot;10x&quot; binoculars, does that mean they should expect to be able to resolve 0.1 arcminute?  Does that comparison even make sense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. An eagle's eye can resolve objects better than a human for sure, but it's only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_eye" target="_blank">four to eight times better</a>. That's not good enough to get parallax on a star. </p>
<p>We can't even do that most of the time by looking at the same star in opposite positions during Earth's orbit. If we could it would be much easier to determine the distance to stars.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Good binoculars and telescopes can see much more.</p></div>		</li>
