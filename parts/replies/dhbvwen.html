<p>It shouldn't be, because he's kind of wrong. First, corporations can't directly donate to politicians. They have to donate to independent corporate entities known as political action committees (commonly called PACs or super PACs) which are unaffiliated with any candidate. </p>
<p>Second, before the Citizens United ruling, groups were prohibited from spending over a certain amount of money on &quot;political speech&quot;. Citizens United was group of people (who had organized themselves into a corporation) that wanted to make a film that was  critical of Hillary Clinton. They sued the government claiming that any restriction on the amount of money they could spend on the film was a restriction of their first amendment free speech rights. The supreme court agreed and lifted the restriction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but on the flip side of the coin, prior to Citizens United, only Unions were allowed to make similar political donations, which was somewhat lopsided, in terms of policy. Often, in southern areas, where a lot of factories were represented by mandatory union representation, the unions would make political contributions from union fees against the wishes of the majority of their members.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't read the whole thing and some are saying fed-soc itself is biased. Regardless, I find a it a little silly to say a group of people such as a corporation have fewer freedoms than an individual.</p>
<p>I think the problem is advertising -- that a corporation can take advantage of voters to influence them to vote a certain way by presenting falsehoods, or some facts while leaving out others, or by manipulative advertising. Of course, it's hard to judge when an advertisement is manipulative. You could say an ad showing a person smiling is manipulative. The law <em>should</em> protect people against manipulation, but it can't due to the ambiguity.</p>
<p>If the electorate was well informed, open-minded, impartial, understood tactics used in advertising, or just avoided advertising, <em>there would be no advertising, no super PACs, and representatives that best align with the country's interests</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He never said it did, just that the effect is the same, if American's for Prosperity are running ads in support of a candidate. Even though they are doing it without coordination with a candidate, the candidate is well aware which PACs are supporting him, and the net effect is the same as a direct contribution. That is, to be used for the same purpose, to run ads by the campaign.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Corporations aren't in the business of giving out jobs as a &quot;thank you.&quot; When they hire a former EU politician, it's because the kind of guy who can get elected to the EU is, by training and now experience, a worldwide expert in EU law and regulation, and if you do banking in the EU, that's really valuable experience to have on the team.</p>
<p>I mean unless your expectation is that politicians will voluntarily float themselves out on icebergs to their deaths after holding office - in which case, why would anyone run for office - then you have to grapple with the fact that by definition a former officeholder is one of that nation's most experienced and talented professionals, and they're going to get hired <em>somewhere</em> doing something that pays pretty well. &quot;Thank yous&quot; have literally nothing to do with that, it's not necessary as an explanation.</p></div>		</li>
