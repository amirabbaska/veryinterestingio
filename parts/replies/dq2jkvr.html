			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yeah. Some CRISPR actions are more risky than others but it's never 100% accurate. Some quick reading about current major gene therapy treatments shows that most of them involve checking for cancer fairly regularly after treatment.</p>
<p>Interestingly CRISPR and gene therapy are also a great tool for TREATING cancer as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most research is around Adeno Associated Viruses currently for systemic effects, lentivirus is used in vitro to modify T cells before reinjecting in the CAR T therapy Novartis just had approved. In either case it's in the 10's of thousands to make a systemically meaningful amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds about right. I actually ran the numbers on knocking down myostatin in a human with morpholinos a couple of years before CRISPR-- it would have run about $2million, and still had no guarantee of working. </p></div>		</li>
