			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, sorry. And it's even higher than that actually. After going through between 2 and 6 pre treatment filters, it passes through a reverse osmosis, RO, system that removes between 90-99% of the remaining impurities. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming his carbon filter is solid, not granulated. If it's granulated, then yeah, a simple backwash puts a different surface in contact with the water and it can be used as normal. Carbon blocks, or capsulated multimedia filters are usually non backwashable. So even if the charcoal has more space for bonds, if you're unable to move it around, it's effectively exhausted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What type of purification method do you guys use? </p>
<p>I went to a water shed your once and they had these noodle like filters. I can't remember what they were called but apparently they were super efficient. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use a method called reverse osmosis.</p>
<p>Normally liquids want to go from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until there is a perfect balance and the system has reached entropy, its lowest energy state.</p>
<p>Reverse Osmosis puts high pressure on the low concentration side, and pushes it up against a membrane that has holes so small that basically only individual molecules, or very small clumps of molecules can get through. </p>
<p>With this high pressure and only one place to go, the H2O molecule passes through with little to no problem, and everything else gets left behind.</p>
<p>And yes, these filters, or membranes as we call them, are long yellow tubes. You might call them noodle-like.</p></div>		</li>
