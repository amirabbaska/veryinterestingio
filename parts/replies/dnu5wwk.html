			<div class="markdown"><p>Danish has a fucktonne of dialect variation. Take the sentence &quot;He is out practicing in the creek&quot;. In københavnsk and sønderjysk (the dialects spoken in Copenhagen and South Jutland respectively):</p>
<p>&quot;Han er ude at øve i åen.&quot;<br />
Vs<br />
&quot;'A' er u' o' ø' i æ å.&quot;</p>
<p>To me sønderjysk is harder to understand than Swedish or Norwegian. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a foreigner living in Denmark that seems like a nightmare to me. I've lived in Aarhus for 3 years and a couple of months in Copenhagen now, I haven't noticed a big difference.</p>
<p>In Sweden, the people that live close to Norway have a really hard time understanding the ones bordering Finland.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Sweden you can tell which village the idiot you’re talking to comes from. So long as you’re from a neighboring village.
So yeah. There is (or rather was as dialects are being diluted these days) at least one dialect per village here. Far more in the bigger cities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aarhus is a reasonably sized city (by Danish standards) so there's a variety of people there meaning the dialects get blended a bit and sound more like the common Danish. It's in all the small places that unintelligible dialects arise</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is greatly overexaggerates for the fun thought that America has so many dialects and something interesting to say in conversation. With a few exceptions of say backwoods hillbillies who have no teeth or Deliverence like characters, everyone in America generally understands what the other person is saying except for some slang or cultural references. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. I have noticed that when I'm with friends, I tend to mumble a bit, or relax my enunciation and grammar. But my friends all understand me just fine. But in other contexts, my pronunciation more closely matches &quot;standard TV American English&quot;, especially if I'm speaking with someone for whom English is not their mother tongue.</p>
<p>So it's more like... Someone from a small town in Texas might have trouble eavesdropping on my personal conversations (and I theirs), but if we were talking directly to each other we'd unconsciously shift language modes to become 99.9% intelligible.</p></div>		</li>
