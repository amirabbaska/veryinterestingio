			<div class="markdown"><p>They're just practicing their hunting as instinct. do you feed them? if they were hungry they would probably eat it. a lot of cats won't even eat a delicious treat if they already ate their normal food and are full. Sometimes they leave kills as gifts for us. either to show appreciation or because they think we're bad hunters.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I love this! I've read several articles saying that cats think we are hairless babies and they're trying to teach us how to hunt when they bring us dead animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsavo_Man-Eaters" target="_blank">These two lions</a> in India in 1898 basically became serial killers. They seemed to thoroughly enjoy what they were doing, and I would say they hunted for sport as much as for food, especially since they hunted as a pair, which lions ordinarily never do.</p>
<p>These lions were so badass they even made a movie about them starring /u/OfficialValKilmer . </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have a bit of a read about big game hunter Jim Corbett. He dealt with a number of similar cases of man eating big cats throughout India and Africa with his trusty Jack Russel terrier.</p>
<p>He found that the big cats seemingly hunting humans were in fact either injured and unable to hunt their usual prey or had old wounds caused by spears/guns. He thought that maybe they were killing out of fear/self preservation and just didn't want humans in their territory.</p>
<p>In the case of the two lions you linked to it is notable that the two male lions were maneless. They were likely shunned by their pride and were unable to make on of their own or, indeed, challenge for one. </p>
<p>So they worked with each other to go after the prey that would be most available to them and would cause them the least issues.</p>
<p>However knowing my own moggy, cats do indeed kill and torture for fun/sport. So it's not out of the question. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have been known to save some for later as well, but they also just abandon their kills on occasion. If you come across a half-eaten corpse covered in branches, you’re probably being watched by a cougar. Leave calmly and don’t let the smallest in your group be in the back. </p></div>		</li>
