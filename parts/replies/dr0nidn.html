<p>AWD is still not nearly as defined. Manufacturers will often implement it differently and the function is very different.</p>

<p>Great example is the new Volkswagen Alltrack. It's AWD functions 99% of the time as FWD. When one of the front wheels slips it transfers power to the rear. Not like typical AWD that will do a 50/50 or 60/40 power distribution.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Idk if that’s true or not, but he wasn’t saying a selectable locking center diff is new tech. </p>
<p>Edit: btw, I didn’t look up what a Haldex was before making this post.  I was just interpreting the meaning behind the other post.  Mistaken assumption on the Haldex part. </p></div>		</li>
