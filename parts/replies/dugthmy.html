<p>If it were to make it worse, hardly anyone would ever risk using it.</p>
<p>Although hair loss could be faster compared to when you originally started, but this would just be because the process of loosing your hair naturally accelerated due to aging.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You worded your information TOTALLY wrong, and you make it seem like you need to apply Rogaine for the rest of your life in order to have the hair you want.</p>
<p>You don't need to apply Rogaine for a shit ton of time. You only need to CONSISTENTLY apply Rogaine/Minoxidil for 12 months - 16 months, and then stop. When you use rogaine, most of your vellus hairs will turn into terminal and will no longer need Rogaine's assistance - and usually to reach an adequate amount of terminal hairs, it takes 12-16 months.</p></div>		</li>
