<p>Easy way to eliminate most of these: use an e-ticket, bring an empty bottle of water to fill at the airport after security, and bring snacks from home in your carry-on with your clothes for the trip (which you will get charged a fee for). </p>
<p>For a 1-3 hour flight, you don't exactly <em>need</em> mountains of drinks &amp; snacks or to choose your own seat.  Even a middle seat is tolerable for short-haul flights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If its rynair you don't pay for the carry on. You are intitled to two bags also. But they do have smaller airplanes so its okay for 1-3 hours more than that would be uncomfortable but they dont do more than that normally so...</p>
<p>I always fly rynair because i am going to the capital of my country so rynair is always cheap and easy and stansted is fine but its 4 hours from Oxford the same as to go to Manchester xD</p>
<p>The times are actually quite regular and on peak they fly at 7am 9am 11am 15pm and then 17pm and 23pm. </p></div>		</li>

<p>To be fair, most major carriers (United, Delta, etc...) are pretty uncomfortable longer than 3 hours too.</p>
<p>I travel light and am self-sufficient (I always bring my own snacks), so I'd <em>love</em> if there were an airline running on the RyanAir model here in the states.  </p>
<p>I'd MUCH rather save $50 off the ticket and not get &quot;free&quot; soda and peanuts than vice versa. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, I'm now beginning to see why this hasn't caught on in America. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shit, I just flew to Europe from NYC and didn't eat any food they provided (I don't eat meat and all they had was chicken or fish), but it wasn't a big deal because I brought some snacks and bought food in the airport ahead of time to eat.</p>
<p>I'd <em>MUCH</em> rather save $50 on a ticket and NOT be provided soda &amp; a shitty &quot;dinner&quot; than vice versa.  I travel light and am self-sufficient.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've never been charged for any of these in any company, including the cheapest tickets on low cost companies.</p>
<p>The rest yes (food and drinks, extra luggage) are all ad-ons, but those are all included in the ticket price.</p>
<p>I'm guessing you're American and this is an American fee?</p>
<p>In Europe, not even the cheapest low cost company tickets charge for those things, only for on-flight meals and non-carry on luggage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ryanair and EasyJet will <strong>definitely</strong> charge you extra if you check in at the airport (around €50-€65) - also around the same if you lost your printed boarding pass and need them to print you one at the check-in desk. Some other airlines might (Vueling, for example, doesn't).</p>
<p>You're right about carry-on though. Afaik, no European airline charges for regular-sized carry-on. Yet...</p></div>		</li>
