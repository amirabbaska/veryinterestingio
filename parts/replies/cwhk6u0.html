<p>that's probably the main point. cars are usually sold cheaper in the united states than in europe. a european car maker not only has to deal with the costs for shipping, changing cars for american regulations, additional advertising and the costs of using a competitor's dealer network, but in the end the cars are also facing lower priced competition than they have in europe. that usually doesn't leave much of a profit margin.</p>
<p>if then the exchange rates shift for the worse, you make losses by default. consequently, most european car makers withdrew from the u.s. market during the 80s or early 90s.</p></div>		</li>
