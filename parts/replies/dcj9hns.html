			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure on the facts. But i began smoking cigarettes and havent had any asthma related issues since.</p>
<p>My theory always being I grew out of my asthma, and being that it was largely environmentally triggered (dust, cold, etc) that i essentially toughened my lungs to it by smoking.</p>
<p>I know that doesnt sound accurate but i googled something along those lines years ago and people had similar anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>I think smoking in general has an affect on your lungs that for some people lessons the incidents of attacks.</p></div>		</li>
