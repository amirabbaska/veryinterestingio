			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I wonder how many internships would suddenly disappear or become paid internships if these laws were actually enforced. Internships in the U.S. are like a horrible sieve that holds back poor and disadvantaged people. Most employers require experience for &quot;entry-level&quot; positions, and the only way to get your foot in the door and gain experience in a lot of fields is with internships. Not everyone can afford to take on an unpaid internship, unless they're lucky enough to live with their parents and have an internship in the same area, or have parents who are wealthy enough to just pay for rent and living expenses, or to have a second job that doesn't interfere with the internship schedule and also provides enough money to live off of. Working for free is very expensive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was a journalism intern in NYC in the 2000s and unpaid internships that clearly were in violation of the legal rules seemed to be very common in the media (especially magazine) industry. I was fortunate to have paid internships, but many of them were not. Conde Nast was sued multiple times by former interns for this and eventually just eliminated its internship programs instead of forking out the few thousand dollars per intern it would've cost to pay minimum wage.</p>

<p>Update: I just remembered a segment John Stossel had done criticizing &quot;freeloaders.&quot; He was criticizing homeless people begging for money but later found himself defending his freeloading use of unpaid interns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are performing activities for the non-profit that are not competing in the market place with for-profit businesses, then a person is legally allowed to volunteer for them. </p>
<p>Otherwise they have to pay their workers. See the case Tony &amp; Susan Alamo Fndn. v. Secretary of Labor</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is I know for a fact we hired an intern at my old job so we wouldn't have to pay as much for full time Dev. Also the intern job description has to work &quot;independently&quot; they were definitely gaining from the the intern.</p>
<p>I'm not saying all interns are slave labor; but I was an intern years ago and I was treated as slave labor.</p></div>		</li>
