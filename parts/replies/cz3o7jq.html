<p>&quot;Corpses of family members were often buried for days then exhumed once the corpses were infested with maggots at which point the corpse would be dismembered and served with the maggots as a side dish.&quot;</p>

<p>Sounds delish. The side of maggots is a nice touch</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mad Cow Disease was a thing partly because the food the cows were being served was mixed with processing wastes from the cattle factories, including blood, bones, fat, and... brains.</p>
<p>I did a presentation over that in high school.  I was a metal kid so I tried to find the most brutal topic on the list we were given.  Tons of source pictures of holes in brains and rows of cattle burning...  pretty metal.   </p></div>		</li>
