			<div class="markdown"><p>Opportunity cost is not, however, a fungible construct.  It is not permitted to be used in contracts, selling contracts, accounting models, and the like.  It's completely conceptual in nature.</p>
<p>The tangible metric to use is Time Value of Money.  This is the equation most central to all of finance.</p>
<p>In a financial transaction, the winning side of the TVM equation is to be a lender:  Giving up a dollar now in exchange for a dollar plus a premium in the future.</p>
<p>But when you give up x dollars to the bank in advance, you have given up a dollar in exchange for a greater partial interest in equity that you still do not own, equity that appreciates historically at a rate the fraction of which the bank will now collect on the lump sum you gave them.</p>
<p>This is just as true when money is costly to borrow as when it is cheap.... the only question is how shrewd of an investor you are. And, actually, you don't have to be all that shrewd.</p>
<p>At an interest rate of 7%, you will pay more in interest than the home is presently worth over the life of the loan.</p>
<p>However, if you'd invested whatever downpayment you were advancing the bank in an S&amp;P index fund over the last thirty years, you would, given the historical compound annual growth rate of the S&amp;P, multiply that balance 14-15 times.</p>
<p>Your house is not going to appreciate 1500% in that period of time... Over the past 100 years, the inflation adjusted CAGR of the housing market is 0.7%.</p>
<p>Clearly you can approach this in one of several ways, one of which includes buying a cheaper house...  The problem is that people think that when money is cheap, they should just buy proportionately more expensive houses.  The problem with this is that demand for housing is not infinite... it is constrained by the fluctuating market of qualified borrowers, and when credit crises happen, those esoteric financing vehicles such as interest only loans start to create systemic risk that obliterates the prices that were only temporarily inflated by cheap and abundant access to capital.  Suddenly, that house you thought was a bargain is now sitting in a neighborhood surrounded by foreclosures.</p>
<p>There is every indication across the board that this irresponsible lending behavior, driven by nonbank lenders and brokers, has accelerated since the 2008 financial crisis.</p></div>		</li>
