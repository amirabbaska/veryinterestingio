That's also what I learned during my undergrad in abnormal psych and clinical &amp; counseling psych. You couple the rx for an ssri with talk therapy, which will typically include going over some very tough things, and you can increase the risk even further. I've seen disclaimers at therapists offices that basically read &quot;it's gonna get a lot worse before it gets better, hang in there&quot;. You also get people that have increased suicidality following the reprieve from depression. Once someone gets past a lot of the symptoms, they begin to fear going back. It's a really tough issue. Anti-depressants have done a lot of good bringing people some increased quality of life, but they should definitely be used with close monitoring. </p></div>		</li>
