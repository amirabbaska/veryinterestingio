			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my favorite explanation, half because it was incredibly clear, and half because it truly is appropriate for and ELI5 as opposed to say, r/askscience. Awesome job</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It still doesn't explain where the energy comes from.  A nuclear bomb releases heat light radiation and particles but also massive amounts of kinetic energy.  This isn't from one atom but from 4 moles of uranium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The energy actually comes from the giant star that exploded to produce the Uranium. Check out how Uranium is produced by supernova.</p></div>		</li>
