			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your great answer! This is the reason why I keep coming back to Reddit. Just one question. Do you know something about the advancements being made with carbon nanotubes? They as a lot of futuristic technologies sometimes promise us things the equivalent of flying cars. Is there any merit in these claims? What makes them so special? Sure I could just google it but I like your clear cut answers. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in short the other two stretch a bit, Kevlar does not, though it bends easier it won't snap back like an elastic, and can not be &quot;tensioned&quot; either.? BTW, very good answer, you seem to understand the practical applications, as well as the difference the &quot;glue&quot; makes. Also the construction vacuum bagging vs squeegee might make a diff not just in weight but in the pretension of the end layup. </p></div>		</li>
