			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what you're forgetting, it all started as a compact point. What you're asking is like taking a balloon and blowing it up, noting that any two points you designate on the surface of the balloon begin to race away from each other, then ask, &quot;From which direction? Which center?&quot;</p>
<p>There is no center, they used to be two points that were right next to each other, but now expansion of the metric upon which they're embedded has changed their position. There is no edge, there is no center, although any point is going to look around see themselves at the center, it will be an illusion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, I think I see where I'm struggling. In my mind I've always thought about the compact point as existing within something, though I realise it's wrong it hard to not think about it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But an inflating balloon has an absolute center. This is why the balloon analogy never worked for me. Or the raisin bread. These things have centers. The raisin in the exact center of a spherical raisin bread dough ball does not go <em>anywhere</em> when the dough bakes into bread. Is there a cosmological analog for this -- a point in the universe that is closest to (or still exactly at) the exact location where the Big Bang occurred? If we could travel around and test different points, wouldn't the center be the place with the fastest average perceived expansion from its perspective? This would be what the central raisin would measure in the bread analogy, while the raisins toward the outside of the expanding dough would see a smaller average expansion rate when looking at other  raisins. </p>
<p>Usually, the answer I get to this is &quot;the big bang occurred  everywhere, so everywhere is the center.&quot; If this is true, the balloon or raisin bread analogy does not work. </p>
<p>Every other supermassive thing in the universe that explodes leaves behind some great amount of mass around the point that used to be at center â€“ black holes, neutron stars, etc. Is there some grand ultra-supermassive singularity somewhere, the remains of the stuff that comprised the singularity at the big bang that were, at one point, truly more &quot;inside&quot; everything else that was blasted outward during the event?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes this really hard to wrap the head around, is the fact that its supposed to be related to the big bang, and theoretically, everything should also be heading away from that point. So while everything is moving away from each other, they also should be moving away from the point of the big bang to a lesser degree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Things are not moving away from a center, the big bang wasn't an explosion: if you want to visualize space dilation, imagine the process as if new space is constantly appearing between any two objects.</p>
<p>Let's try a thougth experiment: imagine three spheres inside three adjacent boxes on a table. Now place two new empty boxes between the original three. The objects themselves haven't moved, they still occupy their old box and yet now they are farther away from each other than before. Repeat by inserting new boxes at every junction between the boxes: now you have to insert 4 new boxes. Repeat again and again, you'll see that the farther away are the three spheres from each other, the quicker they appear to &quot;move&quot;. Galaxies are not moving away from something, they are sorta of carried away by spacetime expansion, because new space constantly appears between them.</p>
<p>Invert the process and the logical conclusion is that at some point in time, in the past, there wasn't so much space at all and everything that there was (and is) in the universe, all of matter and energy, was very very close because there wasn't enough space. Actually, going back and back there was a point in time when there was no space or time at all and everything that exists was in a single, dimensionless point (called a &quot;singularity&quot;). Big bang is the moment when time started and space too started appearing, litterally making space between &quot;things&quot;. It was very quick at the start, with lots of new space being &quot;added&quot; to our universe: not an explosion as we intend, just things getting more and more room around themselves, getting carried away from anything and everything. In a sense, the Big Bang happened... Everywhere. There was (and is) so much energy and matter in the universe that it took no less than 400.000 years from that initial moment to have enough room around subatomic particles for pohotons to move freely and for light to be a thing: a great big flash that happened everywhere. Not only we can see the initial process of Big Bang continuing today, by looking at distant galaxies and seeing the &quot;move&quot; away from us in every direction we look, we can even see that primordial flash! Right here, right now: it is called the Cosmic Microwave Background (today, it is just a radio wave).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this one blows my noodle as well. A physics guy I know once got me to it but I can't explain it without sounding dumb. But all parts are moving away from all other parts at the same rate. Not like an explosion like you visualise as in that case there is stuff in the centre that barely moves. It more like something unravelling I think than an explosion. Hopefully someone smart will do this justice. Mainly commenting so I can find this again to keep track, I hope it doesn't get in the way of you understanding it from a good answer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It comes from the notion that all things, including space and time were compacted into a single (lets call it a) point. Everything was compressed, including dimensions. At some point, for some reason, this inflated and then expanded, but it's spacetime itself that's expanding. </p>
<p>So again, although distant ends of the observable universe are... distant... and racing away from each other, they were once crumpled into the same origin point.</p></div>		</li>
