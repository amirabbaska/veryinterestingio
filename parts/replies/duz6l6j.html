			<div class="markdown"><p>Abel invented new mathematics for his proof, while Ruffini, to my (limited) knowledge, used existing techniques.</p>
<p>Abel’s pioneering work is now called group theory and it’s essentially the mathematics of symmetry. Imagine you have a paper square with the corners labelled 1-4 and put your finger on its center. Now rotate the square (either direction). Each time you complete a quarter turn the corners and edges will be in a similar but shifted position. You have to do this four times to return the corners to the original position, so you would say that the center of the square has four-fold rotational symmetry.</p>
<p>Squares also have lines of reflectional symmetry. If you draw a vertical line through the center of the square, the halves on either side of the line are identical but flipped versions of each other.</p>
<p>So that describes the symmetry group of squares. Other shapes will have different symmetries. Abel (and Galois independently in 1832) had the genius idea to treat the roots (zeroes) of polynomials like the corners of a square and consider their symmetries. How can I shuffle the roots around but still preserve their essential nature, like spinning a square about its center?</p>
<p>This lead them to realize that fifth degree (quintic) polynomials were the smallest degree for which there were “bad” symmetry groups of the roots, where “bad” means there’s no formula for calculating them using addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, exponents, and radicals. Fifth degree polynomials somehow have enough “wiggle room” with their roots that they are too complicated to be described with those basic algebraic operations, as opposed to the lovely quadratic formula, for example.</p>
<p>The technical jargon is that the symmetry group of some quintic polynomials is not solvable. This launched the subject of group theory and arguably abstract algebra as a whole, and as an algebraist I’m very happy for that!</p>
<p>Anyway, hopefully this explanation wasn’t too confusing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 1824 proof required a minimum of 494+ fewer pages than the 1799 proof.  You can safely conclude that the essential difference is that it is far simpler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh. I'd rather admit that, rather than reciting the already known discrepency of page counts and the obvious and superficial reason behind that, admit that no one here has most likely even read, much less fully understood, Ruffini's proof. Even Abel had trouble with that...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The first and, if I am not mistaken, the only one who, before me, has sought to prove the impossibility of the algebraic solution of general equations is the mathematician Ruffini. But his memoir is so complicated that it is very difficult to determine the validity of his argument. It seems to me that his argument is not completely satisfying.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we can't describe, especially not in a relatively simple way, what the differences are. Because a simple description requires a deep understanding.</p>
<p>And so, Abel's proof is as far as I can see not an attempt to simplify, improve, or even fully understand Ruffini's (flawed and incomplete) proof, but was Abel's own approach. Hell, Abel didn't even realize that, at the time of writing, a full section of his own proof had already seen a robust, complete proof as part of Ruffini's!</p>
<p>So, the reasoning and mathematics of Abel's proof was simply more suitable for proving the problem at hand.</p></div>		</li>
