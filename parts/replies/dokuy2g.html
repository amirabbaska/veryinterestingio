			<div class="markdown"><p>There is something called an ‘optimal currency area’.  A government wants to be able to respond to its local economy.  If there is a recession, it will want to lower interest rates.  If there is inflation, it will want to raise interest rates.</p>
<p>If the currency area is too large then the government(s) will have trouble when one area needs higher interest rates and one area needs lower interest rates — the “asymmetric shock”.  That is what happened in Europe.  Greece had debt and a major recession/depression and could use stimulus but Germany was worried about inflation.  When two different governments share the same currency, these conflicts can happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not an economist. But to extend things further: </p>
<p>To have a common currency, one needs a mechanism to transfer wealth. </p>
<p>Canada has a complicated transfer payment system (two, general tax revenue and specifically for health care) from the federal government to the provinces. Both Canada and the US deliver services directly from a national government. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be short there's much more legal implications to loan from other countries to fit your needs rather than printing money and putting your own country into debt.</p>
<p>Because you can't just print money as it's gonna lose its value the more you print it. So as a solution a country loans from itself the moment you print money. </p>
<p>This is as far as I understand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people on Reddit stress the wrong thing with this power.  It is not the ability to pay debt with your own currency that is important (many countries can’t do this even with their own currency)</p>
<p>It is the ability to tweak your monetary policy to fit the state of your economy.  You can inject money in the system when you economy is in the dumps and be tight when the economy is over heating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right now the USA has the dollar. If they want they can print more dollars. That makes the dollar worth slightly less so things start to cost a little more for Americans but things get a little cheaper for other countries buying American stuff so trade improves. In this way the American government can control its finances a little. </p>
<p>If there was a universal currency then America couldn't do this. They would be stuck with whatever amount of currency the global bank issues. They would lose control over that particular aspect of their finances. </p>
<p>TL;DR If as a country you owe a whole bunch of money it can be nice to just print a bunch of extra money to pay the debt and living with the fact that your money is worth less can be the lesser evil. It can even bring benefits in exports etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You lose control of the ability to print money (since evidently there would be 1 nation in control of that, whom we all trust)</p>
<p>Printing money (aka Monetary policy) is an effective method of managing the economy such as to stabilize interest rates, inflation rates and currency exchange rates. It also makes people believe in your currency as you can control the supply of it.</p>
<p>As another comment says, there's a sweet spot where enough places use the same currency and it's efficient (you don't wanna be using USD-1 in two states, USD-2 in some other states, etc. it's a pain in the ass and will cost you a lot of fees to convert) AND you have enough flexibility to use monetary policies (Eg: If the west coast is booming but the east coast is in a recession, USD is a poor tool to help both regions)</p></div>		</li>
