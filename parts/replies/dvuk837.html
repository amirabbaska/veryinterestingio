<p>So why is there a sudden drop?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once the material becomes cold enough that thermal fluctuations are reduced the electrons moving through the lattice are able to form Cooper pairs.  These are quasiparticles made of an electron of +1/2 and -1/2, which results in a net spin 0, making them Bosons even though they're composed of two Fermions and allowing them to form a superfluid.</p>
<p>The sudden onset is because this is a thermodynamic process and the electrons in the material switch fromnormal electrons to suddenly superelectrons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The running theory, by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and Robert Schrieffer, is called the BCS theory. If my following explanation doesn't satisfy, which it won't, please take a look at that instead.</p>
<p>When lowering the temperature of a material, we reduce the amount of lattice vibrations, which play a large part in calculating the resistance (see matthiessen rule). When the vibrations are small enough, the vibrating atoms will deliver less energy to an electron when colliding, at which point the electrons are able to enter a more <em>efficient</em> state by pairing up, in cooper pairs. Cooper pairs have some bosonic properties and can turn into a Bose-Einstein condensate. In which a large portion of bosons occupy the lowest quantum state.</p>
<p>A Bose-Einstein Condensate has some weird properties, in which it acts as a whole, and no longer as all particles apart. I might misinterpret this, but this would mean that you'd need enough energy to revert every cooperpair at once, or you're not able to revert any. In other words, since the vibrations can't deliver enough energy to split each pair at once, the pairs just stick together (as long as the temperature remains low enough). And somehow this causes the lattice influence to be as good as non-existant, meaning the resistivity is &quot;zero&quot;, as soon as electrons pair up.</p>
<p>Wikipedia probably does a better job at explaining than me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An electron moving through a conductor will attract nearby positive charges in the lattice. This deformation of the lattice causes another electron, with opposite spin, to move into the region of higher positive charge density. The two electrons then become correlated. Because there are a lot of such electron pairs in a superconductor, these pairs overlap very strongly and form a highly collective condensate. In this &quot;condensed&quot; state, the breaking of one pair will change the energy of the entire condensate - not just a single electron, or a single pair. Thus, the energy required to break any single pair is related to the energy required to break all of the pairs (or more than just two electrons). Because the pairing increases this energy barrier, kicks from oscillating atoms in the conductor (which are small at sufficiently low temperatures) are not enough to affect the condensate as a whole, or any individual &quot;member pair&quot; within the condensate. Thus the electrons stay paired together and resist all kicks, and the electron flow as a whole (the current through the superconductor) will not experience resistance. Thus, the collective behavior of the condensate is a crucial ingredient necessary for superconductivity.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need some mechanism to make electrons form Cooper pairs. In conventional superconductors, the pairing is due to phonons, i.e. lattice distortions. The lattice of positive metal ions is distorted by an electron passing by due to the electrostatic force. Therefore the electron leaves behind a very weak trail of positive charge, which can attract another electron.</p>
<p>In unconventional superconductors, such as the copper-oxide-based and iron-based high temperature superconductors, the pairing mechanism is still unclear, but is probably somehow related to magnetism.</p></div>		</li>
