			<div class="markdown"><p>There is evidence that this comes about when humans started developing bigger brains and bigger heads. Girls that have babies too young aren't physically developed enough to deliver those big-headed babies, killing them and the child or at least causing significant physical trauma (i.e. fistulae, which are not fun now, much less in prehistory). So breasts and wider hips are a cue, hey! She's more likely to survive childbirth so it's probably ok to have sex with her now.</p></div>		</li>

I don't think there's a single reason for the attraction to breasts, and this seems like an interesting theory that could just be one more piece of the puzzle. Thanks for teaching me something new!</p></div>		</li>
