			<div class="markdown"><p>No non-MLB team even has a shot at beating an MLB team in a series. Stats show that the best non-US based league is Japan's, and overall it corresponds to somewhere between US AAA minor league and the majors. But if you get really good over there, a US team will pay to get you here. And you'll do it because you want to make a lot of money, and you want to prove yourself against the best.</p>
<p>Another salient point.... When the first World Series was held, I'm not sure baseball was even being played anywhere else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely World Series works and has stuck because there is truth behind it. </p>
<p>World Series - the best players from around the WORLD play on US based teams. So you can call it World Series because all of the best players come to the MLB. </p>
<p>It's just different format to the World Cup or olympics when it's countries facing each other. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's called &quot;The&quot; premier league.</p>
<p>And Swansea and Cardiff playing the &quot;English football league&quot; or &quot;The&quot; football league as it was until 2015, was because when they were formed, Wales did not have a professional football league.</p>
<p>Football facts are on me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except no because Spanish, French, German, and Italian teams are all on similar competitive level as the Premier league. </p>
<p>It would be like if the EPL started calling themselves the World League 100 years ago, and the closest competitor leagues were all about as good as the MLS in America. If the EPL trashed every other team in the world so reliably that the Football League Championship or the League One Teams were as good as or better than LaLiga teams then only pedantic people would care that they called it the world league.</p></div>		</li>
