			<div class="markdown"><p>On a side note, it's scary how similar this is to a standard computer program. Data can be saved, cached in computer RAM (think short term brain memory) and then the machine can quickly retrieve the data it needs based on metrics comparable to &quot;whatever is repeated most&quot; - scary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you mentioned computer science, I was wondering that if we make a data structure similar to how brain stores data and algorithms similar to how it retrieves it, wouldn't it be super super duper fast?</p></div>		</li>

A dozen or so already exist, they're called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network" target="_blank">artificial neural networks</a> and as you've probably guessed by now, they're indeed part based on a biological brains neurology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hasn't this analogy been basically disproven, in that the brain doesn't function at all like any computer component? There isn't &quot;storage&quot; there isn't a &quot;processor&quot; there isn't &quot;ram&quot; etc?</p></div>		</li>

<p>No itâ€™s not. Brains are asynchronous analog neural networks based on carbon, powered by chemical processes. Computers are synchronous digital circuits based on transistors and silicon powered by electricity.</p>
<p>They can basically do the same things but with totally different principles and strengths and weaknesses. Put in other words they are both Turing Complete so they can emulate each other but the underlying architecture is completely different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hence why I said similar. You say computers are synchronous but we have a variety of asynchronous languages, but your point is right - our limitation is only hardware at this point. </p></div>		</li>

<p>When you remember something, the connections were repeated enough to make so many connections that they'd never be completely undone again in your lifetime.   </p>

<p>Does that mean you can never truly forget a memory, and all that you would need to remember something is to access those neural connections?<br />
If something replaces that path of neurons, is it easier to remember by thinking of the memory that replaced it?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well technically you can forget anything including something as familiar as your own name with conditions that deteriorate your brain like Alzheimer's.   But normally, you could have made too few neural connections that then got &quot;overwritten&quot;. if the neural connections for the thing are intact but connections getting to them were weakened, you could try to get ancillary connections that would have been made at the time such as the room you were in, the song on the radio, the weather when it happened etc, to see if you can get back to the cluster of neural connections that house whatever you're after.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tiny correction, we actually only have <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/suzana_herculano_houzel_what_is_so_special_about_the_human_brain" target="_blank">86,000,000,000 neurons,</a> which is still vastly more than most other animals relative to brain size.</p>
<p>And just to strengthen the above comment, think of your brain like a country. The neurons are the highways between each part of the brain. The more you repeat certain actions, the easier it is to drive those particular highways. So if you practice speaking Mandarin every day, you're strengthening the connections between certain neurons and making those highways easier to drive. On the other hand, if you haven't practiced Mandarin in a year or two, those highways haven't been driven recently, so they're harder to drive. That's why sometimes it takes a moment to recall information. You're having to travel that neural highway that hasn't been travelled in ages, so it takes a little longer to navigate.</p></div>		</li>
