			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, Dr. Leinen, for your time today. Building on @oceanbio75's question, I note that AGU's Organizational Support Policy says “AGU will not accept funding from organizational partners that...fund organizations that publicly promote misinformation of science.” But Exxon funds the National Black Chamber of Commerce (which calls global warming a “myth”), the American Legislative Exchange Council (which says climate change is an “inevitable...historical phenomenon”), and politicians who call the whole thing a “hoax”. </p>
<p>Please forgive the leading question, but doesn't this means AGU has deemed statements from NBCC, ALEC, and politicians like Jim Inhofe to be free of misinformation? And if not, how does AGU reconcile its decision to continue Exxon sponsorship, given Exxon's funding record?</p></div>		</li>

<p>In particular, this passage: As with our members, board members presented various viewpoints and we thoroughly considered all of them. We had detailed discussions about whether ExxonMobil’s current actions are inconsistent with our organizational support policy in two areas: 1) promoting science misinformation and funding groups that are currently promoting misinformation about science, and 2) the potential impact of publicity about investigations into the company on AGU’s reputation. We concluded that it is not possible for us to determine unequivocally whether ExxonMobil is participating in misinformation about science currently, either directly or indirectly, and that AGU’s acceptance of sponsorship of the 2015 Student Breakfast does not constitute a threat to AGU’s reputation. We also discussed a multitude of options for moving forward, ranging from severing all ties with ExxonMobil, to maintaining our engagement with ExxonMobil but no longer accepting their sponsorship, to maintaining the relationship and sponsorship agreement, as well as developing new ways to strengthen our engagement and influence with the energy industry – and everything in-between.</p>

<p>Sorry to be a jerk, but this is insane and there is no way that you or the other members of AGU believe this.  It's clear that you've made this decision from political and financial reasons, not based on the reality of Exxon's actions.  </p>
<p>To be clear, Exxon IS directly and indirectly funding and disseminating misinformation.  If you and AGU truly believe otherwise it makes the validity of your credentials incredibly suspect, and if not it makes your convictions incredibly suspect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, c'mon. I know you have to say that, but do you even feel gross saying it anymore? It can't be about the money. Exxon's donations from 2001-2015, $620k, only total 0.1% of your total revenue. So what's the real reason you continue to lie with pigs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll preface this by saying that I in no way wish to pick a fight. As another AGU member, personally I'm not really sure what AGU should do (and it's a decision especially fraught for those like myself whos subdiscipline(s) see more direct support from oil &amp; gas companies, see our students get jobs at these companies, etc), though I felt like their explanation for their decision could have had more details and <a href="http://insideclimatenews.org/news/26052016/agu-american-geophysical-union-exxon-climate-change-denial-science-sponsorship" target="_blank">complete accounting of their relationship with Exxon also seems similarly lacking</a>. Be that as it may, I do however have two questions for you (or others who feel the same):</p>
<p>1) Are there numbers on what percentage of the AGU membership feels that AGU should cut ties with Exxon-Mobil? Without a doubt the original ~100 signers of the letter to AGU represent a much broader population than their raw numbers indicate, but I've not seen any data on what actual percentage of AGU members support divestment. </p>
<p>2) If AGU were to cut ties with Exxon, shouldn't they cut ties with other organizations that are also supported by Exxon? It's the logical extension of the idea, but it would involve severing relationships with many organizations, e.g. other professional societies like the <a href="http://community.geosociety.org/gsa2016/sponsors/2016" target="_blank">Geological Society of America</a> or the  <a href="http://www.awg.org/" target="_blank">Association for Women Geoscientists</a> along with organizations like the American Geosciences Institute who <a href="http://www.americangeosciences.org/education/k-12-professional-development-programs" target="_blank">accept funding from Exxon for various programs</a> and any countless number of academic departments which receive funding from Exxon in some way shape or form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am in no way trying to pick a comment battle but I gotta ask.... isn't there at the very least a conflict of interest in accepting money from an organization whose lobbying and policies has a direct effect on climate and oceans (climate change) that your organization is supposed to be studying and reporting the data truthfully. Historically speaking when money is involved priorities tend to get skewed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's certainly a reasonable question, though not one that I'm probably equipped to answer as just one member (with no authority other than occasionally signing up to judge posters at the annual conferfence) of an organization with 1000's of members. While there are some questions about what other involvement AGU has with Exxon (e.g. the link in my original comment), it is important to also remember that the primary interaction between AGU and Exxon is in the form of Exxon paying for a student breakfast at AGU's annual meeting. Having attended this once as a graduate student, I remember it as mainly a free meal which had a little bit of a recruitment aspect for Exxon at the beginning. For a conference that attracts a fair number of geoscientists for which (at least until the last few years) oil &amp; gas was a primary career option, this in no way surprising or atypical and is frankly one of the reason people go to conferences (i.e. to try to make connections that may serve us in getting employed after we finish graduate school). The situation with AGU is a little different than many other geoscience professional societies as AGU represents a broader community (e.g. ocean and climate scientists) who are more in the cross hairs of climate-denial groups funded by Exxon. No one (at least that I'm aware of) is clamoring for, say, the Geological Society of America to divest from Exxon, though I suspect there a much larger majority of the membership has more direct ties to Exxon (e.g. they and other oil &amp; gas companies fund lots of graduate student training, research on general geology topics with very limited connection to any actual oil &amp; gas exploration, etc). </p>
<p>That being said, within the context of the AGU question, I understand the feelings of colleagues who's research is the kind being disputed/attacked by Exxon and also understand that from their perspective (and the outside community) that even though the involvement amounts to free pancakes for graduate students that it is more about the symbolism of accepting money from Exxon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AGU has always been a strong advocate for climate research, and a defender of climate science and climate scientists. And we never allow our relationship with a partner or sponsor to influences our actions or policies as an organization. For example: Our position statement on climate change is one of the strongest in the scientific community [<a href="http://sciencepolicy.agu.org/files/2013/07/AGU-Climate-Change-Position-Statement_August-2013.pdf" target="_blank">http://sciencepolicy.agu.org/files/2013/07/AGU-Climate-Change-Position-Statement_August-2013.pdf</a>]. The number of sessions at our Fall Meeting where leading climate science experts present the latest, ground-breaking research grows every year. We worked to disseminate information from the last National Climate Assessment and IPCC reports to broad audiences. We support and/or directly plan and execute skills building workshops designed to make scientists, including climate scientists, better communicators. Every year, we organize an event to take climate scientists to Capitol Hill to talk about their work. We are strong defenders of funding for climate research. When they are under fire, and when they aren’t, we stand up for the academic freedom of scientists, including climate scientists. We endorsed Congressman Chris Gibson’s (R-NY) resolution expressing the commitment of the House of Representatives to conservative environmental stewardship. Nothing about the current situation will change AGU’s stance on or approach to climate change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that funding is not always intended to get skewed results.  I mean sure, yes, that is sometimes (if not often) the case, but sometimes I feel like these O&amp;G companies get a pretty bad rap that they don't deserve.  At the University I'm enrolled in, O&amp;G companies have paid for a variety of buildings and they've funded a bunch of other projects (most recently they're helping fund the reconstruction of an on-site oil lab).  I have a hard time believing the grad students doing research in the lab are providing those companies with skewed studies, mostly I think that the companies are just funding education to keep good relationships with schools they get employees from.</p>
<p>Same thing here I would imagine, they fund a bunch of geology-related programs because they work closely with geologists and people in the geology field.  I would think that the funding is more to keep good ties with large groups of potential/current employees than it is to purposefully get inherently skewed results from those people.</p></div>		</li>
