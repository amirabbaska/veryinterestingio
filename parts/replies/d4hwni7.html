			<p>Thank you, Dr. Leinen, for your time today. Building on @oceanbio75's question, I note that AGU's Organizational Support Policy says “AGU will not accept funding from organizational partners that...fund organizations that publicly promote misinformation of science.” But Exxon funds the National Black Chamber of Commerce (which calls global warming a “myth”), the American Legislative Exchange Council (which says climate change is an “inevitable...historical phenomenon”), and politicians who call the whole thing a “hoax”. <br><br>Please forgive the leading question, but doesn't this means AGU has deemed statements from NBCC, ALEC, and politicians like Jim Inhofe to be free of misinformation? And if not, how does AGU reconcile its decision to continue Exxon sponsorship, given Exxon's funding record?</p>		</li>

If you and AGU truly believe otherwise it makes the validity of your credentials incredibly suspect, and if not it makes your convictions incredibly suspect.</p>		</li>

			<p>Lol, c'mon. I know you have to say that, but do you even feel gross saying it anymore? It can't be about the money. Exxon's donations from 2001-2015, $620k, only total 0.1% of your total revenue. So what's the real reason you continue to lie with pigs?</p>		</li>

			<p>I'll preface this by saying that I in no way wish to pick a fight. As another AGU member, personally I'm not really sure what AGU should do (and it's a decision especially fraught for those like myself whos subdiscipline(s) see more direct support from oil &amp; gas companies, see our students get jobs at these companies, etc), though I felt like their explanation for their decision could have had more details and <a href="http://insideclimatenews.org/news/26052016/agu-american-geophysical-union-exxon-climate-change-denial-science-sponsorship" target="_blank">complete accounting of their relationship with Exxon also seems similarly lacking</a>. Be that as it may, I do however have two questions for you (or others who feel the same):<br><br>1) Are there numbers on what percentage of the AGU membership feels that AGU should cut ties with Exxon-Mobil? Without a doubt the original ~100 signers of the letter to AGU represent a much broader population than their raw numbers indicate, but I've not seen any data on what actual percentage of AGU members support divestment. <br><br>2) If AGU were to cut ties with Exxon, shouldn't they cut ties with other organizations that are also supported by Exxon? It's the logical extension of the idea, but it would involve severing relationships with many organizations, e.g. other professional societies like the <a href="http://community.geosociety.org/gsa2016/sponsors/2016" target="_blank">Geological Society of America</a> or the  <a href="http://www.awg.org/" target="_blank">Association for Women Geoscientists</a> along with organizations like the American Geosciences Institute who <a href="http://www.americangeosciences.org/education/k-12-professional-development-programs" target="_blank">accept funding from Exxon for various programs</a> and any countless number of academic departments which receive funding from Exxon in some way shape or form.</p>		</li>

			<p>I am in no way trying to pick a comment battle but I gotta ask.... isn't there at the very least a conflict of interest in accepting money from an organization whose lobbying and policies has a direct effect on climate and oceans (climate change) that your organization is supposed to be studying and reporting the data truthfully. Historically speaking when money is involved priorities tend to get skewed. </p>		</li>

			<p>It's certainly a reasonable question, though not one that I'm probably equipped to answer as just one member (with no authority other than occasionally signing up to judge posters at the annual conferfence) of an organization with 1000's of members. While there are some questions about what other involvement AGU has with Exxon (e.g. the link in my original comment), it is important to also remember that the primary interaction between AGU and Exxon is in the form of Exxon paying for a student breakfast at AGU's annual meeting. Having attended this once as a graduate student, I remember it as mainly a free meal which had a little bit of a recruitment aspect for Exxon at the beginning. For a conference that attracts a fair number of geoscientists for which (at least until the last few years) oil &amp; gas was a primary career option, this in no way surprising or atypical and is frankly one of the reason people go to conferences (i.e. to try to make connections that may serve us in getting employed after we finish graduate school). The situation with AGU is a little different than many other geoscience professional societies as AGU represents a broader community (e.g. ocean and climate scientists) who are more in the cross hairs of climate-denial groups funded by Exxon. No one (at least that I'm aware of) is clamoring for, say, the Geological Society of America to divest from Exxon, though I suspect there a much larger majority of the membership has more direct ties to Exxon (e.g. they and other oil &amp; gas companies fund lots of graduate student training, research on general geology topics with very limited connection to any actual oil &amp; gas exploration, etc). <br><br>That being said, within the context of the AGU question, I understand the feelings of colleagues who's research is the kind being disputed/attacked by Exxon and also understand that from their perspective (and the outside community) that even though the involvement amounts to free pancakes for graduate students that it is more about the symbolism of accepting money from Exxon. </p>		</li>

			<p>You are correct in noting that the diversity of science represented by AGU’s membership does differentiate us to a degree from other scientific societies. And when it comes to issues like this, there is a significant variety of opinions within our membership on what position(s) AGU should take. In this particular case, we heard a wide range of opinions as to whether or not AGU should engage with ExxonMobil, and what that engagement should look like. However, we have never let that diversity of opinions stop us from being strong advocates for climate science and climate scientists. I note in particular that we have worked to defend scientists whose work has been challenged, including partnering with the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund to connect those scientists with experienced attorneys. As we have said in our previous communications to members on this matter, we feel that the issues raised presented an opportunity to directly engage ExxonMobil and the energy industry more broadly, and to bring into that conversation the representatives of governmental, environmental, economic and related scientific sectors. Societal challenges concerning energy use, population growth, climate change and more require that people and organizations with diverse viewpoints and expertise work together. As an evidence-based organization with roots in both the climate and energy communities, AGU is uniquely situated to create an environment for that kind of dialogue. Facilitating that dialogue is something we feel will be incredibly beneficial to our community, our environment and our society world-wide.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's ok, most people don't realize the money and research O&amp;G operators conduct each year and that they hire more geoscience personnel than just about any other industry. ExxonMobil has vastly more scientific knowledge on many of these subjects than the people who believe Leo DiCaprio and Al Gore when they say the world will end in 10 years...</p>		</li>

			<p>AGU has always been a strong advocate for climate research, and a defender of climate science and climate scientists. And we never allow our relationship with a partner or sponsor to influences our actions or policies as an organization. For example: Our position statement on climate change is one of the strongest in the scientific community [<a href="http://sciencepolicy.agu.org/files/2013/07/AGU-Climate-Change-Position-Statement_August-2013.pdf" target="_blank">http://sciencepolicy.agu.org/files/2013/07/AGU-Climate-Change-Position-Statement_August-2013.pdf</a>]. The number of sessions at our Fall Meeting where leading climate science experts present the latest, ground-breaking research grows every year. We worked to disseminate information from the last National Climate Assessment and IPCC reports to broad audiences. We support and/or directly plan and execute skills building workshops designed to make scientists, including climate scientists, better communicators. Every year, we organize an event to take climate scientists to Capitol Hill to talk about their work. We are strong defenders of funding for climate research. When they are under fire, and when they aren’t, we stand up for the academic freedom of scientists, including climate scientists. We endorsed Congressman Chris Gibson’s (R-NY) resolution expressing the commitment of the House of Representatives to conservative environmental stewardship. Nothing about the current situation will change AGU’s stance on or approach to climate change.</p>		</li>

			<p>Keep in mind that funding is not always intended to get skewed results.  I mean sure, yes, that is sometimes (if not often) the case, but sometimes I feel like these O&amp;G companies get a pretty bad rap that they don't deserve.  At the University I'm enrolled in, O&amp;G companies have paid for a variety of buildings and they've funded a bunch of other projects (most recently they're helping fund the reconstruction of an on-site oil lab).  I have a hard time believing the grad students doing research in the lab are providing those companies with skewed studies, mostly I think that the companies are just funding education to keep good relationships with schools they get employees from.<br><br>Same thing here I would imagine, they fund a bunch of geology-related programs because they work closely with geologists and people in the geology field.  I would think that the funding is more to keep good ties with large groups of potential/current employees than it is to purposefully get inherently skewed results from those people.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is true generally, but to directly address your discussion about the way the funding from O&amp;G corps work is that they pay academics for what will benefit them (i.e. improving hydraulic fracturing processes, engineering devices that mitigate risk, etc.). Or, even less hands-on, they just put their name on a building for PR purposes (ahh, the nostalgia of Exxon Hall... Exxon can't be that bad, right? source: I work in marketing/PR). They do not invest in processes that are likely to result in their criticism, and defund things that do result in criticism. This results in 1) good PR, 2) people who do research refusing to criticize the people who hold their pursestrings because researchers don't want to lose money or they lose their jobs (while not O&amp;G, see the NFL study where they pulled off a person who would have been critical of them), and 3) alumni who have different memories about a corporation than what the corporation does (i.e. smokin' up with your buds in Exxon Hall and not watching lots of death occur off the shore of Alaska because of the Exxon Valdez).</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; people who do research refusing to criticize the people who hold their pursestrings because researchers don't want to lose money or they lose their jobs (while not O&amp;G, see the NFL study where they pulled off a person who would have been critical of them)<br><br>I definitely don't want to get into the position of defending Exxon, Chevron, and other such companies, but what you've written above is just not characteristic of the way it works. You're trying far too hard to make a conspiracy here and a straight line between &quot;give us results we want or suffer the consequences of lost funding.&quot; Trust me, as a full-time academic (which means I go hunting for money <em>a lot</em>) scientist, this is not the norm for any kind of funding.<br><br>The norm in the sciences is that a private foundation, private company, or government agency secures a block of funding and announces a competition through an RFP (request for proposals). They specify what kind of research they expect, the funding parameters, style guidelines, etc. About 23,489 scientists put in proposals for each pool of money, and the funding source has a panel of peer reviewers choose the best (or at least those without spelling and grammar errors) of the bunch. The PIs split their nifty new grant money with their institution (usually they &quot;get&quot; to keep between 40% and 60%), and then they start hiring grad students, postdocs, techs, purchasing equipment and supplies, designing experiments, etc...<br><br>Two or three or four years later, with money from Exxon, NSF, or the Sierra Club, they've pushed a student or two through a MS or PHD program, published half a dozen papers, and they're on to writing the next bunch of grant proposals. Very rarely do you go back to the same source. And very rarely do private companies just do &quot;repeat&quot; funding (or even RFPs). I've heard of people losing grant money mid-process because of malfeasance, shitty reports (i.e., not being able to upload a report), or schlepping off to Chile with the new PhD student and a bag of grant money for a honeymoon (don't do that), but not because a funder didn't like the results...<br><br>I'm sure it's happened on occasion the way you <em>think</em> it happens all the time. But it just isn't the norm: our institutions usually don't pay very well and they almost never pay for grad students, summer salary, equipment, etc. We write grants to fund those things. You can assume that we've all sold our souls to whoever writes the checks, but you'd be wrong. The only case of messing with data I'm personally aware of had nothing to do with pleasing a &quot;paymaster,&quot; but rather to do with wanting to make tenure.<br><br>So careful about your assumptions, and don't assume that what you know about PR applies necessarily to academic science professionals. The scientists I <em>am</em> a bit wary of are those directly employed by a company. If I see a paper with a &quot;^* ExxonMobil&quot; following an author's name, I'm far more likely to be skeptical of the results. But if in the acknowledgements it says that researchers from Somewhere State University had funding from ExxonMobil, I'm not nearly as inclined to doubt the results. Somebody has to pay for research, and it certainly isn't the public at this point.</p>		</li>

			<p>Umm... they don't fund research that could possibly lead to outcomes they very much dislike. Government grants do, etc. Companies do not put out research grants that could disprove their PR strategies. Send me a link to anything that is not gov't/foundation but comes from one of these companies that does that. I'm not disagreeing at all about your point that this research is done at universities. My point was that Exxon will generally hire the * ExxonMobil dudes for the shit they want to keep quiet and externally hire people for things that advance technology (engineering). Why would you even try to disprove this while Exxon is in the middle of getting pwned over being very Big Tobacco-like in their behavior? This happens everywhere. Might you be mistaken about your interpretation of events rather than me? As a former receiver of multiple grants from major polluting industries, I can guarandamntee you that they'll pay for me to teach people how to plant trees, write it off their taxes, and then tell people they're working on conservation-related education programs. Honestly, it kept me in a decent paying job I loved, but it didn't keep me from being a critical and aware consumer of those funds.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; This is true generally, but to directly address your discussion about the way the funding from O&amp;G corps work is that they pay academics for what will benefit them<br><br>From your original post. I'm not trying to defend anyone, I'm just pointing out that your private PR experience is likely different from <em>academic science</em>. Big companies <em>do</em> pay for research, and they don't (always, often, not sure?) ask for results beforehand. It's often worth their time to take a gamble on interesting, cutting-edge research. I'll give you an example:<br><br>--------------------<br><br>The world's major grower of sweet corn seed gave the lab I did my graduate work in enough money over five years to pay for an extensive research staff and project. Greenhouse, field experiments, statistical analysis, three undergrad researchers, two techs, two masters students, and one PhD student. Also they paid summer salary for a postdoc and a full professor (the PI) at a state university. This was about $500,000 or so all told, and was intended to look into the way fungal endophytes might be used to create competitive exclusion of pathogenic fungi. I.e., try to get plants infected with &quot;good&quot; fungi (as seedlings or germinants) so the &quot;bad&quot; fungi can't find a place to set up shop. The lab published about six or seven papers but didn't discover some magic cure for the fungal problem the grower had. <br><br>Most of us who worked in the lab (even on other projects) still have friendly relationships with that company. The company has paid for a postdoc position for one of the former PhD students. They have given more money to the professor for further research. No patents have been generated, and no money has been generated for the corporation. Sometimes private companies give money to academic researchers for good PR, to fund good or exciting science, or for many other inscrutable reasons. A <em>quid pro quo</em> exchange of money for results is not the norm, at least in my field. <br><br>---------------------------<br><br>I'm sorry your experience has been different, but that doesn't mean mine are invalid. Hope the above makes my point clear, although I'm not willing to doxx myself or my former PhD advisor in an effort to convince you that I'm telling the truth. Suffice it to say that although all of my own funding (pre and post PhD) has come from government agencies and NGOs, I've known many other researchers in universities who have not sold their souls by taking corporate money. And I haven't yet heard that a company was angry because they didn't get the results they wanted. Again, I'm sure it's happened, but I don't think it is that common.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;they pay academics for what will benefit them (i.e. improving hydraulic fracturing processes, engineering devices that mitigate risk, etc.)<br><br>That's sort of the point, and honestly, I fail to see how this is a bad thing.  Who loses?  The students get credit, the company gets better/cheaper stuff and the world understands the processes better &amp; hopefully the processes become safer/less risky through the research.<br><br>&gt;They just put their name on a building for PR purposes (ahh, the nostalgia of Exxon Hall... Exxon can't be that bad, right? source: I work in marketing/PR). <br><br>Close enough, yep.<br><br>&gt;They do not invest in processes that are likely to result in their criticism, and defund things that do result in criticism.<br><br>I mean, they're going to fund O&amp;G projects that benefit them whether they result in criticism or not, but I can see why they wouldn't do such things outside of O&amp;G.  I'd think that they're mostly trying to keep PR up within the subset of people that actually help them, I doubt they give two shits about what &quot;Mary from Alaska&quot; thinks about them.<br><br>&gt;people who do research refusing to criticize the people who hold their pursestrings because researchers don't want to lose money or they lose their jobs<br><br>I honestly don't have the perspective necessary to discuss this.  Quite frankly, I doubt you do either.  Sorry for the shitty response.  I'm not going to say you're wrong, but I don't know how right you are, and this is something that varies wildly between researchers and fields of research.  It's a complicated topic that I really can't discuss on reddit right now.  <br><br>&gt; alumni who have different memories about a corporation than what the corporation does<br><br>Oftentimes, what the corporation does (in context of what buildings they're paying for) is to hire students that go through their buildings.  Where I'm at, they paid for a Geology hall and an Engineering technology building (all disciplines).  Obviously the students going through Chevron hall that have their SPE memberships paid for be Chevron would want to work at Chevron.  I can't tell you how effective the PR is for the other random people, but for the prospective employees, the funding is effective.  Is Chevron a flawless company?  Not at all, no oil company is really.  However, that means nothing in the context of professional relationships.  <br><br>Believe me, prospective BP workers are well aware of Deepwater Horizon, but that doesn't mean much to them as working for BP is a great opportunity.<br><br>Anyway, there are my 2 cents in response.</p>		</li>

			<p>The AGU Board is in unanimous agreement that AGU has an opportunity and an obligation to exercise its convening role by bringing together those with diverse views across the science community to engage more directly with the private sector and with ExxonMobil in particular. The objective is to engender a substantial and on-going dialogue about issues of energy, environment and climate change. AGU is committed to creating an environment for dialogue about the roles of the science and business communities in all the sectors where science plays an essential role. We believe both society and AGU would be well served by this endeavor, and would not be served by disengagement.</p>		</li>
