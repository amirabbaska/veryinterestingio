			<div class="markdown"><p>As you dive, your body tissues and the air spaces in your body are compressed.  So, if you had gas in your digestive system at a pressure of 3psi, you'll still have +3psi over ambient pressure at depth.  You can both burp and fart at depth, although with a wetsuit on farting is risky business.  You can also urinate at depth, just in case you were wondering.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. And we divers try to avoid gas producing foods prior to a dive. If you accumulate intestinal gas at one or two atmospheres down (32-64 feet or so), that gas will be two or three times as big when you ascend to surface, making for an uncomfortable tummy. I've never heard of anyone dying, yet.</p></div>		</li>

Pressure increases 1 bar (or 0,1 MPa) every 10 meters in water. (Look at those nice numbers!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should be able to fart at any depth.  As you go deeper, your body will get squished smaller by external pressure, but getting squished smaller will increase the pressure of everything inside of you.  So the positive internal pressure of a fart trying to get out would remain positive (relative to the environment) even if you're under a lot of external pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is false.</p>
<p>The pressure is applied differently to all the different sections of the body. All in proportionate to their density. (Organ tissues, muscle tissues, bone, bodily fluids). For example, this is why your head begins to ache at depths. The pressure is harder on your skull and face.)</p>
<p>Edit; Buoyancy swapped with density</p></div>		</li>

<p>I remember hearing about a crew of oil rig workers who would fart onto their H2S monitors to see how high they could get the ppm count. Legend has it one man produced 1500 ppm.</p></div>		</li>
