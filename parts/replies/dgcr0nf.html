			<div class="markdown"><p>The cold air is the biggest factor for me I think. When I'm nauseous and step outside for a deep breath I can feel it enter my body and I can feel how it instantly makes me feel refreshed and better. The same way a cold glass of water will. Overheating and nausea are closely related too, I never feel nauseous without also feeling overly hot. </p></div>		</li>
