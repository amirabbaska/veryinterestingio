<p>The short version is that the isentropic flow equations (no heat added or viscous effects) creates a relationship between changes in pressure and changes in density. Conservation of momentum creates a relationship between changes in velocity and changes in pressure. Conservation of mass creates a relationship between changes in area, changes in density, and changes in velocity. Combining all of these together gives you a relationship between changes in velocity and changes in area, and that relationship changes signs when Mach number is greater than 1.</p>

<p>I have never specifically studied supersonic flow (you only get fluids 1 in a BSME), but in one paragraph you have explained it to me more than any conceptual approach ever has. A lot of &quot;I'll explain this simply&quot; people neglect to give a high level overview of the what actually goes on, and that context is often times critical. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a couple fun facts I like to tell people who haven't taken classes but are interested in supersonic flow.</p>
<p>1) friction (in the case of a super sonic duct/tube thing) will increase the speed of the flow instead of decrease it. </p>
<p>2) under some circumstances, adding heat energy to a supersonic flow will cause its temperature to decrease. </p></div>		</li>

<p>At the very first read, this did seem counter intuitive. But then thinking about it, a boundary layer effect enhancing the bulk flow make sense.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Thankfully I have enough academic experience with quantum physics and statistical mechanics for this to not be counter intuitive. Though it does seem odd that a supersonic flow can achieve what is considered &quot;absolute hot&quot; for a quantum system.</p></div>		</li>
