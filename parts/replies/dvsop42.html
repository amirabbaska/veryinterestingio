			<div class="markdown"><p>Some things that come to mind: the impact of healthcare systems on the environment (e.g., in driving climate change) and, in reverse, the impact of environmental degradation on human health; the interrelationships between the health of people and the health of animals (sometimes called 'One Health'); violence as a public health issue (including inter-human violence as well as violence against animals). I'd also like to see the discussion about animals extend beyond discussion of animals in biomedical research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the answer! I’m curious to hear more about the bioethical issues regarding the healthcare system. I’m currently in undergrad but I’m pursuing an MD. How much, and what, can an individual physician do to help alleviate the environmental impacts? Or do the impacts result from the overall system instead of individuals?</p></div>		</li>
