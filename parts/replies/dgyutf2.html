			<div class="markdown"><p>Million dollar question. It's not as simple as it sounds. </p>
<p>It's easy to inhibit things in a mouse-model because you can (fairly) easily knockout specific genes. In humans there needs to be an effective pharmacological inhibitor, which currently doesn't really exist to my knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. The reason why no humans are using a myostatin inhibitor is because they don't exist. Humans do exist that naturally don't produce Myostatin, but from what I have read in research so far, they aren't inhibiting their own myostatin, they just aren't producing, so we have to either find a way to block myostatin production, or effect.  Cause it would be extremely hard to knock out genes in a full grown human without other side effects, and it's totally unethical to try and forcefully produce babies that have had genes messed with as a test.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Myostatin acts in an autocrine fashion (meaning it acts on the cell it is secreted from) specific to skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>So, in the end, it really only affects the skeletal muscle. Therefore increased muscle mass seen in myostatin knockouts is likely to affect other organs the way typical increased muscle mass would. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but his makes sense.</p>
<p>Abuse of PED's like test and GH inevitably leads to enlarged organs, particularly GH, prolonged users of which develope an enlarged gut. Dave Polumbo is prob one of the most famous examples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert on this, heard during a lecture, so ymmv:</p>
<p>Tendons are what keep our muscles tensioned, they are very important for keeping your skeletal muscles working correctly, since muscles can really only contract on their own. Unlike muscles, however, tendons don't have the same potential to grow stronger over time. Tendons can become tougher and more flexible, but it's a process entirely separate from muscle growth with a considerably lower ceiling for improvement.</p>
<p>This is why athletes dread injuring tendons like their hamstring or Achilles' tendon, its a single point of failure that they can only do so much about (this is why stretching is so important, it's all about keeping the tendons pliable and less prone to tearing).</p>
<p>A get-ripped-quick scheme like this is going to help a person put on lots of mass, but will do nothing to prepare their tendons for the considerable new stresses these stronger muscles will impose, especially if that person is not particularly concerned with properly stretching before exertion.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Just to nit pick, Static Stretching has been shown to be next to meaningless to prevent injury. To keep tendons pliable, you should be doing dynamic stretches before physical activity. And exercises that increase flexibility, like Yoga, or Calisthenics as more of a routine.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, knockout mouse studies have confirmed not only pretty severe adverse effects on tendons from complete myostatin deficiency, but also positive effects of myostatin on tendons: <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/105/1/388.long" target="_blank">http://www.pnas.org/content/105/1/388.long</a></p>
<p>tl;dr &gt;<em>Treatment of tendon fibroblasts with myostatin activated the p38 MAPK and Smad2/3 signaling cascades, increased cell proliferation, and increased the expression of type I collagen, scleraxis, and tenomodulin. Compared with the tendons of MSTN +/+ mice, the mechanical properties of tibialis anterior tendons from MSTN −/− mice had a greater peak stress, a lower peak strain, and increased stiffness.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Research Intermittent Fasting if you want to use morning fasting as a diet tactic.  The fasting you experience from a regular healthy diet won't significantly boost HGH to any height that significantly boosts muscle mass, and IF diets shouldn't be used long term, but, they exist.  You also should be aware that no type of diet in humans will affect myostatin, so if you read anything that says it does ignore that article.</p></div>		</li>
