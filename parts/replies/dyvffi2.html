<p>This is not the case. Most states have laws concerning public access to bodycam footage. Some states only allow that access to certain people or charge unbelievable amounts of money to view it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Video evidence is not the only evidence in the world. Take that kid for example:</p>
<p>There's the puncture marks from the taser dart. There's evidence of a 9 year old's heart stopping, through a postmortem report. There's evidence of evidence of the kid sitting on the ATV, through some forensic magic. There's also the video abruptly cutting off.  </p>
<p>If a prosecutor really wanted to go after the cop, he can.   </p>
<p>What the other commenter does to get off his clients is really not relevant here.</p>
<p>Edit: I thought kid's age was 9. I'm not sure, but I'm not changing the original comment</p></div>		</li>
