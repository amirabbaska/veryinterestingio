			<div class="markdown"><p>Also too cheap. I work in the clothing industry and there's a strong drive to keep sku count down on anything that's seasonal.</p>
<p>It's not a big deal if 501s come in 4 colors, 6 lengths and 6 waist sizes. Even though that adds up to 144 different skus, mens clothing really doesn't change much from year to year. </p>
<p>Women's clothing, dresses in particular, are hugely seasonal. A dress that comes in 4 colors and 5 sizes only needs 20 skus which is much lower risk for a store to stock. If you add a second size dimension then suddenly you need hundreds which isn't something anyone is going to touch, especially when it'll hit the clearance rack in 3-4 months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So am I. Which is why I never try clothes on. Luckily, I'm a guy and my labels alow me to do this.</p>
<p>Poor girls always have to try clothes on to see if they fit. Then they see themselves in the mirror and it's that much harder to not buy because &quot;these pants look so good!&quot;</p>
<p>Which may be another reason to keep useless sizing labels on clothes. Cuz then they have to try them on.</p>
<p>EDIT: Okay! I'll try the damn clothes on, fuck. Reddit is more persistant then my god damn wife. I guess this is just the real reason some of my pants don't  fit. I was thinking I was just getting fatter. She'll be happy to know that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm a guy and I can't do this. Sure, once I find a model/line of pants, I know what size will fit me. But if I'm getting a different cut, even from the same manufacturer, it's a crapshoot if it will fit. A 36&quot; waist in one cut of Wrangler is perfect, whereas a different cut, also from Wrangler, I need a 38&quot; or even 40&quot; waist. It's not nearly as ambiguous as women's sizing, but I still can't get away with buy-before-you-try.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Excpet they don't.  A lot of companies use vanity sizing or are plain inconsistent with their sizing, even with the same cut and wash.  <em>Glares at Levi's</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would be interesting to know if that's really the case.  Did any company ever try more informational sizing? It seems odd to me that I've heard so many women complain about the inability to know the true size of things, and the inability to get more functionality (pockets, etc), without some company out there somewhere trying it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Some women's jeans are sold by &quot;waist size&quot; allegedly, mostly designers like Paper Denim &amp; Cloth.  Usually those are sizes 24-32 which correspond to US 0-12 women's sizes.  I could swear I've also seen that with some women's Levi's.  At Nordstrom, they have to have a sign &quot;translating&quot; the sizes. </p>
<p>And plenty of stores have short/regular/ tall or petite/regular/tall or &quot;ankle&quot;/regular/ long etc.  Those correspond to 30 inch inseam, 32 inch inseam and 34 inch inseam generally.  (I know Gap has this).  So, you might be a Gap 10 Ankle, or an Paper Denim Cloth 30 long.  </p>
<p>Another element is that women's waist size isn't the biggest difference in women's bodies.  It is Hip size (ass size).  So, fine, it's a 30 inch waist.  But how much junk is in the trunk?  Have your hip bones spread a lot or less? Men have a more standard hip-waist ratio.  Many jean designers have tried to differentiate on this factor.  Sometimes with symbols (Triangle/ Circle/ Square) or with words (Curvy, straight).  Levis has &quot;Curve id.&quot;  Lane Bryant &quot;right fit&quot;.  Lee &quot;Curvy fit&quot;.  This has been around for years for many manufacturers and does seem to be profitable, as they keep doing it. </p>
<p>Pockets are different.  Pockets cost more to put in (more fabric, more seams).  Pockets can interrupt the &quot;line&quot; of the clothing either by a visible pocket line in the front thigh of pants or by requiring a visible pocket entry on the outside of the outfit.  Also, pockets in skirts/ dresses can be weak and require reinforcement if you don't want them to tear and the fabric is lightweight cotton or something.  Many women's pants and skirts DO have pockets.  But, usually those items are more expensive than equivalent items without pockets. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sizes - yes. Many pants are sized by waist size for women. Some (I think Levi's and Gap are included) will have the waist size and dress size, like 26 - 2. It's still hard to shop because women's pants are more fitted, so variance in women's body shapes can affect what size they are regardless of waist measurement.</p>
<p>Pockets - I think that women frankly have a preference for something more flattering. If we want bigger pockets, there's nothing stopping us from purchasing functional women's pants at REI. Nothing except for style preference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except in today's garment manufacturing industry I can expect to wear any size in-between 4 and 11. Do these pants fit? Have to try on every single pair,  every single time.  Even the same style of pants,  by the same brand in the same size won't always fit 2 out of 2 times. This is why we have to spend so much time shopping.  We don't know if this shit will fit unless we try it on first.  And in my case (I have an ass) I can try on 15 pairs of pants and I'll be lucky if one pair fits me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That may be true, but if shopping has taught me anything it is that sizing in women's clothing is completely arbitrary anyway. The size you wear in one brand/store is not the size you might wear in another. It means you have to try almost everything on to see if it fits.</p></div>		</li>
