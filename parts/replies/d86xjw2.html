<p>If you waited for the Earth and Sun to spiral inwards through this process and crash together, you would have to wait more than 1013 times the age of the current universe! </p>

<p>And obviously that's ignoring other effects, such as the Sun losing mass and the Earth's orbit therefore moving outwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tidal effects from other passing stars and from the Sun's orbit around the galaxy as a whole would also be affecting Earth's orbit strongly, though in a less predictable way.</p>
<p>Oh, and there's radiation pressure applying propulsive effect due to different parts of Earth being at different temperatures. Probably also has a bigger effect than gravitational radiation.</p>
<p>Measuring extremely small forces like this can be quite tricky, there are tons of confounding factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have passing familiarity with tidal locking, but I don't understand how locking between the earth and sun would cause the orbit to raise... I mean, if I had to guess, any locking would rob momentum from the system, causing the orbit to actually decay. My intuition is often wrong though.</p>
<p>Just curious, if you have a second, could you explain how tidal locking would cause a raise in our orbit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I've never thought about the sun losing mass (however obvious it seems.)  A quick [google search] (<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/07/14/solar_wind_versus_fusion_how_does_the_sun_lose_mass.html" target="_blank">http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/07/14/solar_wind_versus_fusion_how_does_the_sun_lose_mass.html</a>) turned up that the sun is losing 5-6 million tons of mass per second, which seems like a lot, just not when compared to the mass of the sun.</p>
<p>Thanks for sparking my curiosity!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just added that in, it would take about 10^(23) years, which is roughly 10^(13) times the current age of the universe. Needless to say, we are at least safe on this front :D. </p></div>		</li>
