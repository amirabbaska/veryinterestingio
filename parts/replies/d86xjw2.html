			<p>I have passing familiarity with tidal locking, but I don't understand how locking between the earth and sun would cause the orbit to raise...

			<p>Due to transfer of angular momentum. In an orbital system between objects A and B, as B slows down and loses <em>rotational</em> momentum, it is transferred over to its <em>orbital</em> angular momentum, and in reverse. So by slowing down in rotation the object increases its orbital speed, resulting in increasing orbital distance.<br><br>This works on both objects, but the larger one experiences it less.<br><br>Tidal locking is the reason why Moon is slowly moving away from Earth. Interestingly enough, the same effect (but in reverse) is why Mars's moon Phobos is actually getting closer and will eventually either crash into Mars or break up and form a planetary ring. This is because Phobos orbits Mars faster than Mars rotates around its axis, effectively resulting in transfer of Phobos's orbital momentum into Mars's rotational.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/orlet" target="_blank">orlet</a>
			<p>No, not really. Because the momentum transfer via tidal locking does not &quot;push away&quot; objects in orbit, it gradually increases the orbital speed of involved bodies, resulting in increasing orbital distances due to how orbits work. So in order for this to work your disk should already be in orbit, and, by definition, &quot;levitating&quot; above surface anyway...</p>		</li>

			<p>Technically, they do. But objects in higher orbits have higher potential energy in regard to the object they orbit, and moving closer/further exchanges that with their orbital kinetic energy.<br><br>Let me explain this a bit differently. Ever heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit" target="_blank">Hohmann Transfer</a>? It's a maneuver to transfer from lower distance circular orbit to a higher one. In order to execute it a spacecraft has to accelerate prograde (forward in direction of their orbital velocity vector) to get the elliptical transfer orbit with low point (periapsis) touching the old circular orbit. Then once the spacecraft reaches high point of this elliptical orbit (apoapsis) it has to accelerate prograde once again in order to circularize new orbit. This is because by the time spacecraft reaches the apoapsis of elliptic orbit it has expended most of its kinetic energy into potential and does not have enough velocity to maintain circular orbit at new height.<br><br>Now imagine objects in tidal lock doing infinite amount of hohmann transfers at infinitesmal distances all the time. If the momentum transfer results in velocity increase, the orbit radius will increase as well; and vice versa.<br><br><em>^(I may also have played too much of KSP)</em></p>		</li>

			<p>The tidal forces actually result in the orbiting body &quot;stealing&quot; the rotational momentum of the parent body, and raising in its orbit. This happens because the parent body is deformed slightly by the gravity of the orbiting body (this tidal force is mostly responsible for the tides on Earth, for example) and when that tidal &quot;bulge&quot; rotates ahead of the orbiting body, it drags it along, slowly speeding it up and raising its orbit. The orbiting body doesn't necessarily have to be tidally locked for this effect to occur.<br><br>EDIT: the wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking</a> has a pretty good description and diagram of this effect</p>		</li>

			<p>It's a tiny effect, but also radiation. The warmed side of the planet will emit more light and that will push it.<br><br>There's a cool effect where asteroids tumbling around the sun, spinning in the same direction they rotate, make the newly-heated area rotate behind their path, which gives them a little kick and they tend to spiral outward. Likewise, things tumbling in the opposite direction, take their heated surface and rotate it in front of them, which slows them and makes them fall toward the sun.</p>		</li>

			<p>The Sun loses billions of kilograms each second, and the Sun-Earth system radiates about 200W, so I guess the loss of mass has more impact, though I can't quickly calculate is. (We'd need to consider the conservation of angular momentum, and as the Sun loses mass the centripetal force experienced by the Earth decreases, thus to conserve [orbital] angular momentum the bodies increase the distance (of course each according to their share of combined mass, so even though the Sun loses mass, mostly Earth moves further).)</p>		</li>
