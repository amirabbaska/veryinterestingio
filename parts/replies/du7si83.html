			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! Rice + Water + Button and done in 15-20. I have known those who just can't kitchen for the life of them and they benefit the most from this type of thing. It's the perfect gift for someone going away to college or getting their first apartment</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With a conventional pot you have to actually monitor it and turn it off after the time passes. You risk burning it or overcooking it. With the cooker you just don't have to think about it.</p>
<p>Also it gives you better results more consistently because science (I don't really know, but it just does.). It's a little fluffier and the right amount of moist/dry.</p>
<p>I'll grant you that it is <em>kind of</em> a first world appliance because rice is ultimately not that hard to make, but a little bit more convenience and consistency per batch is worth it if you eat a lot of rice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My method is throw rice/water in pot, bring to boil and then turn off heat and place plate over the pot for 15-20. Which I use nowadays since my ex stole my old rice cooker.</p>
<p>With a cooker you don't need to pay attention to it at all, a light just changes from red to yellow when ready. Which isn't really <em>that</em> much easier I admit, but I've had two roommates who've said they never liked rice until mine. And knowing them they were just over/under cooking it every single time, so it made sense for them to buy one</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you have a gas stove it can be difficult to keep the proper temperature.  i got one at the grocery store and i use it for lentils, brown rice, everything.  it automatically shuts off when its finished, so everything is properly cooked.  </p></div>		</li>
