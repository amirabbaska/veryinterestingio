			<div class="markdown"><p>Dentist here. Nobody gets a 30 day supply for opioids following wisdom tooth removal, 3-7 days max.  Most of the abuse of opioids come from chronic pain management on the medical side.</p>
<p>Edit: 30 pills is not a 30 day supply. A 30 day supply would be somewhere between 120-180 tabs. Any doctor writing for 180 narcotic pills following oral surgery would soon get a visit from the DEA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, I only got about a week's worth of Percocet for my root canal a couple years ago. Only needed about two days though. That said, that's only because I made it a point to switch to Advil ASAP because I just get super sleepy and a bit sick on Percocet.</p>
<p>However, I got three weeks' worth of Vicodin for surgery on a broken ankle and only needed a week. Used it for about a week inconsistently (ranged from two to four pills in a day) and had about thirty left I didn't need. Yeah.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Got my wisdom teeth taken out a month ago. 12 pills. Didn't last all the way through my recovery. Dentist was uncomfortable with my request for 12 more, and I understood, so I didn't push it... but I would have been a lot more comfortable with them. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Prescribing too long. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not just too long, it's that they don't know how long the pain will last so they go on the higher side. I needed 1.5 months for my wisdom teeth out, but the next time I had surgery, I only needed a day's worth.</p>
<p>Both times I was given the same amount (1 month supply), because it's hard to tell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same with my kidney stone.  Got 20 vicodins, but passed the stone the next day and only used 2.  Not the doctor's fault.</p>
<p>That was 3 years ago.  Last month's kidney stone I got a precription for 24 more vicodins.  I only used about 4 over the next week til the damn thing passed.  So I've a couple dozen opiate pills lying around, and neither I nor the docs did anything wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After an emergency open abdominal surgery I was on 40 to 50 mg hydrocodone a day only (10mg every 4 hours). I can't imagine people taking 200mg/day. It hurt when I sat up, stood, breathed, turned, coughed, laughed, etc. 30+ staples. Took 3 weeks to recover. I'm an MD, so it really made me extra sympathetic to when surgical patients say they are in pain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm in no way glad that you had to have that surgery (surgery sucks), but in a way, I am glad that you had an eye-opening experience regarding the pain experienced by some patients.</p>
<p>We still can't measure pain, or show others how bad it makes us feel (which, even if we could measure it, is subjective based on individual pain tolerance), and unfortunately, our government has nosed into the doctor/patient relationship, making it much more difficult to get adequate pain relief.</p>
<p>I just started going to a pain management doctor. I have to go pee in a cup at a lab for him, I had to sign a &quot;pain management contract&quot; that essentially said that I can never ever ever lose any pills (heaven forbid that I drop any, and maybe run them over in my wheelchair trying to pick them up with a grabber), and I'm forced to start at the lowest possible prescription pain relief, having to make an appointment with him every time I need to tell him that a medication isn't working and that we need to try something else.</p></div>		</li>
