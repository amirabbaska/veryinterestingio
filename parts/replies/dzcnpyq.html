<p>Oddly enough the Tony Awards one is probably closer to what live sports is like than the Super Bowl one, because the Super Bowl one is the half time show where they have every single shot planned out in advance - 100% predictable. They are reading shot numbers off a script while literally counting the beat.</p>
<p>By contrast, in the Tony Awards one it looks like they have many shots ready from pre-planning, but they haven't planned every single shot. No doubt this is to allow them the flexibility to capture spontaneous things like celebrities reacting in the audience or in case NPH (or anyone else) starts ad-libbing.</p>
<p>This would be similar to a live sports event where they have many set shots (say, a couple of wide shots, some cameras following particular players or positions, some cameras following the ball and so on), and the everyone knows the roughly what might happen and is skilled enough to follow as it does or adapt if something unusual happens.</p>
<p>You can watch the two Tony Awards ones (one is the output that went to air, the other is the director behind the scenes) <a href="https://youtu.be/FW5ild-H-18" target="_blank">side by side here</a>. He really gets going around <a href="https://youtu.be/FW5ild-H-18?t=49" target="_blank">this point</a> if you want to skip a bit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are co-directors that talk direct to cameras, they guide what shots to take, if the pic needs to tightening or opening up. Since they can see other cameras they can offer shots that are not on any other camera, compositions that are missing at the moment. If there is only cold camera wide shot and all other cameras offer a  zoomed in-your-face shot... that is something that the camera man can't know. It sure is interesting work.</p></div>		</li>
