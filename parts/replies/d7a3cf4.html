			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, sound/vibrations (which travel really well underwater).</p>
<p>Fire off a speargun; all the little fishes (that you haven't shot) disappear, and all the sharks in the general vicinity whiz in to steal whatever you've just shot. (And they are not happy if you don't have something for them.)</p>
<p>A similarly attractive effect can sometimes be produced by splashing about in a manner resembling a distressed fish, but the sound of a speargun being fired is like a dinner bell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but in the context of blood detection, /u/dingoperson2 is right that smelling blood doesn't help with direction. </p>
<p>There are lots of things that help with direction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't actually sound so impressive anymore if we compare it <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odor_detection_threshold" target="_blank">with the human sense of smell</a> that sharks lack. And as we well know, there are animals like dogs that can detect even much fainter smells than we do.</p>
<p>Within the environment of water sharks obviously beat us easily, but if we compare it to our environment it doesn't seem that great.</p></div>		</li>

<p>e: <em>or</em> a ~5.1m by ~5.1m rink of 1.5&quot; thick ice (not accounting for density changes, sorry friends)</p></div>		</li>
