			<div class="markdown"><p>You could interpret any handling of a dead body as honouring it, really. But at what point do you draw the line? Where do you still call it honouring and where is it just disposing of bodies so they don't get in the way? That's just a question that popped into my head, interesting to think about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could also consider the idea of a ritual's initial intention. Some methods (most, if not all, I would argue) could have just started as a means of disposal but eventually came to be considered a form of honour after being adopted as the norm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easy. If there's a rule. &quot;You should do X to your dead to honor them&quot;, regardless of what the rule is, I'd say you're honoring your dead. If there isn't a rule, then maybe you aren't.</p>
<p>So if you just do whatever, leave bodies out to rot or be eaten by vultures, you're probably not honoring your dead, but if there's a rule on how and where to leave the bodies out for the vultures, if there are customs and rituals and a special place to leave the bodies, then yes, they are honoring their dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a Zoroastrian myself. You are right about somethings and not too right about others</p>
<p>As someone pointed out, it was an ancient tradition to lay the bodies atop the Tower of Silence (Dakhma). However it like we just threw them there and left. After death, there is a long process before finally leaving the corpse on the Tower. </p>
<p>This process starts with the cleansing of the body by their family. If the dead person is a man, the male members of the family will lay the body on the washing table (which is usually present at the bottom of the Tower) and then give the corpse its final bath (to wash of the last remnants of this world before moving on to the next world). If the dead person is a woman, the female members of the family do this. The body is then dressed up in a new set of plain white clothes and plain white hat (to symbolize purity). Then the body is carried to the prayer room where the priests (Dastoors) along with the family will pray certain funeral prayers for the dead. </p>
<p>Finally, with the help of pallbearers, the body makes its long arduous journey to the top of the Tower followed by the family and priests. The body is then laid to rest for mainly the vultures to eat. </p>
<p>Although this may seem gruesome to others, the idea behind this whole process is that (as someone already mentioned) that the earth, and fire and all elements of nature are considered pure by us. So a burial or cremation would defile these elements. The other idea is that even in death, we make a final sacrifice to this world so that some lesser animal benefits from our death. I find a certain beauty in this thought. </p>
<p>Lastly, in the modern world, this practice is no longer followed because the vulture and scavenger population has drastically reduced because of biomagnification caused by other reasons. This would cause the bodies to be left out rotting rather than being eaten. Most Zoroastrians now are buried (like my uncle and grandparents) or cremated (my great aunt)  as per their choosing. </p>
<p>Although, we used to leave the dead out in the open, atop a tall tower there was a certain honor in it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. But if earth is considered a pure element of nature, then why would a burial defy the earth element? (assuming the casket disintegrates) </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's <em>defile</em> as in, make unclean or impure.  Placing rotting dead bodies in the earth could be seen as defiling the earth in the same way as placing a rotting dead mouse in your salad could be seen as defiling your salad.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never met a practicing Zoroastrian, and I am quite ignorant of the faith. I didn't realize they were really around in modern times. Can you share a little about your religion and personal connection to it? Is your family Zoroastrian, or did you convert? How does your faith manifest in the modern world?</p></div>		</li>
