			<div class="markdown"><p>A royal flush being dealt on board (or opening with it in five card draw, or flopping it in hold'em, anywhere you have to use exactly five cards) is super rare, but in hold'em it happens kinda often when you have two extra cards to work with. More like 1:40,000. That might seem like a lot of hands, but that's not even a month's worth for an online pro.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true...I was just talking about on the deal in standard, one deck, five card draw...those extra couple of cards or a draw significantly change the odds in your favor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, this reminds me of my first game of poker, I knew the card combinations but forgot to take the colors into account and didn't know you could add the ace to a low straight to make ace-5. We were a few hands in so I thought it was the right time for my first bluff... Well to my regret several people joined so we showed hands when we were all-in and everyone freaked out over my straight flush. Someone had to explain to me why but it was enough of a boost to end up winning the whole game :) </p>
<p>I guess they read that I was bluffing, best tactic ever; just don't know things. </p></div>		</li>
