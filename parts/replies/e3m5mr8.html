			<div class="markdown"><p>Moore's law was actually defeated in 2004 with the creation of the single atom transistor. They made a transistor using a single silver atom embedded in silicon.

<p>But ultimately they found that with transistors this small, when you put a lot of them on a microchip their individual electrons start to interfere with each other.  It's now part of the research into quantum computing.</p>
<p>But as far as size, we've gone as small as we can go. Now, like you said, it's all about the geometry. Rather than arranging them on a single plane you can arrange them in a lattice and take advantage of going 3D to include more in a small area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's quantum computing and it's still being researched. The current quantum computer is the size of a room and no more powerful than your phone. Still lots of research and development to go until it's better than a traditional computer.</p></div>		</li>
