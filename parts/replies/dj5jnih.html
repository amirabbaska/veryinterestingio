			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  The smaller your frame, the more surface area of skin you have to radiate heat in proportion to your innards.  And the less mass there is for your muscles to work at moving around. Large people do less well in heat, while small people do less well in cold.</p>
<p>As body size increases skin area is squared (2-dimensional), but your heat producing innards and weight to heft around are cubed (3-dimensional).  So a large person has less skin in proportion to entire body mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water is WAY better at conducting heat away from your body than air is.  Unless you are swimming in hot water that is a higher temp than your body (unlikely), you won't sweat when swimming.</p></div>		</li>
