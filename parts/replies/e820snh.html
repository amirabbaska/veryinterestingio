			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, another way we detect planets (or at least the presence of planets) is by gravitational forces pulling on astroids and other objects we can see. If a planet or asteroid suddenly changes its orbit or moves differently than we expect, it often means there is a large body pulling on it. </p>
<p>Using this method, astronomers actually believe there IS at least a ninth planet somewhere past Saturn, and that based on its gravitational pull it known as “super Earth” sized, up to ten times larger. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But with those results we can kind of predict its trajectory right? So then we'd at least have an indication of where to look for it? I'm probably oversimplifying things way too much, seems just crazy to me that we cant observe this relatively close thing yet</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do have an indication where to look for it. Large areas of the sky have been ruled out. What's left, unfortunately, mostly overlaps the Milky Way, and it's the part of its orbit when it is dimmest and moving most slowly. This makes it really hard to find. Some of the new giant telescopes coming on line in the next 10 years ought to be able to do it, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, you are absolutely correct. We have a rough idea of the orbit of “planet nine” and it seems to have a large orbit roughly opposite of the other planets orbit, which is why it is harder for us to observe. </p>
<p>As for the observation of it, the light from the Sun “dissipates” rapidly as it travels outward, due to how the sun scatters light rather than sends it out in a straight line. Planets like Pluto and Neptune are actually rather dark, and we use special telescopes to view them, rather than your standard mirror or lens telescope. But these special telescopes need to be pointed at the exact spot, and you need to have a better than rough idea of where the planet is in order to observe it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only way to differentiate, that I know of, would be the orbit. And since a planet’s orbit is less erratic than comets or astroids, it stays in more of an ellipse, like the implied planet is doing now</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A large groups of comets with the same mass as a planet would be <em>much, much</em> easier for use to see. A typical comet is about 5x10^14 kg, while Earth for example is 6x10^24 kg. In other words, an Earth-massing cloud of comets would have 10,000,000,000 comets, and most importantly, tons more surface area than a single body with the same mass would have.</p>
<p>For comparison: Saturn's rings mass roughly 1/10,000,000 the mass of the planet, but are almost exactly as easy to see in a telescope as the planet is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhere past Saturn? So theoretically this thing could be past Saturn but before Uranus, 10 times bigger than Earth, but we can’t find it? If that’s the case how do we know about Pluto, which is way further out, and smaller than Earth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not predicted to be circular orbit, but very elliptical. You might have to wait about 5000 years to make the observation you’re describing. This is a minimum bound though so it’s possible when it swings back around it could still be a few times further out than Pluto. Currently it’s possible this planet is <em>21 times</em> further away than Pluto’s orbit. This means if it is indeed 4 times the diameter of earth and 10 times the mass it would look 21.3 times smaller than Pluto, which we can barely see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pluto is really reflective (has high albedo) - anomalously so, we're learning as we find more KBOs - and Charon even more so. New Horizons presented the opportunity for a lot of hypotheses but from what I understand we still don't have a consensus as to why.</p>
<p>Also, Tombaugh (and we later learned that Lowell had also visualized it, although he didn't recognize Pluto for a KBO) just plain got lucky. I'm on mobile and having trouble with my google-fu, but if memory serves it was 20-30 years before Pluto was imaged again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does this mean we only detect other planets that a) are close to their star (since many orbits are longer than our lifetimes)  and b) have a orbit that is always directly between earth and their star? The alternative is we miss out on an infinite number of planets and or we know there is at least one planet around a star since the dimming could be caused by more than one planet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially this is correct. There is some guessing involved, as we can’t see most solar systems outside of our own using normal telescopes. We have to use waves from the electromagnetic spectrum (specifically infrared and visible light) and other types of radiation to guess where planets and other heavenly bodies are. </p>
<p>Some stars we can outright say do not have planets, because the lifetime of the Star isn’t long enough to support planet formation, but there could be an infinite number of planets out there. Planets that could support life is another matter entirely. </p>
<p>Edited to make my point on electromagnetic radiation clearer. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That isn't true at all. You don't detect planets with radio waves at all. You pretty much always use visible or infrared.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is also not right. Stars live for billions of years. It takes about 10 million years to form a planet. We can tell when stars are just born. These are not the stars typically chosen to search for planets around in this way. However, astronomers do use other methods to try to detect whether planet formation is ongoing for new stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are definitely biased towards massive planets that are close to their star, and to ones with edge-on orbits. This is also the same with radial velocity measurements where we measure the motion of the parent star - it's easiest to measure velocity along the line of sight, so it's easier to detect edge-on orbits again.</p>
<p>Face-on orbits at large separations are easier to see with direct imaging through, because the planets can be more easily separated from the planet. Most of these we've seen have been in very young solar systems, where the planets are still hot and bright. But again, more massive planets are easier to see.</p>
<p>But we definitely know that there is a bias to what we can detect, and the planets we find are not representative of the whole population of planets in the galaxy. As we get more sensitive instruments and watch the skies for longer periods of time we can push this bias down a bit, which is why instruments like Kepler have been able to see some planets down to around Earth mass (although again, in very close orbits). But the vast majority of planets we see are huge and close to their parent star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something that may be worth pointing out is not only are additional planets in our Solar System hard to detect due to them giving off a limited amount of light, but we aren't sure where in their orbits they are. We have plotted the orbits of the other planets principally based on observations of their movement. That we predict another planet in a given orbit exists doesn't tell us where in it's orbit is it right now.</p></div>		</li>
