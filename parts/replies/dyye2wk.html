<p>A good conductor such as metal would match your skin temperature quickly. This is why you can touch aluminum foil that is in a hot oven. The foil is so thin that there is just not enough energy in that mass to burn you. Its the same concept as 1 drop of boiling water not burning you, where a gallon definitely would.</p>
<p>A slide is a bit thicker than foil. So your hand cools the slide's surface, but the core of the slide will keep the surface hot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I agree with you that OP is wrong, I think a lot of confusion comes from the difference between heat and temperature. </p>
<p>Heat is the transfer of thermal energy between two objects, temperature is a measure of the average energy of molecular motion in a substance.</p>
<p>Aluminium will have the same temperature as in the oven, but has a low specific heat, so it holds low thermal energy to burn you with. Water on the other hand, can hold 4 times as much heat than aluminium so one pound of water can burn you faster than one pound of aluminum can.  </p>
<p>Using words like &quot;poor conductor&quot; as the OP stated is kinda confusing, and &quot;heat capacity&quot; will give a more intuitive explanation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking heat refers to a transfer of energy; it's not a property of the system. What you called heat is generally called the internal energy of the system. Heat is similar to work. If works describes the energy transferred by action of a force, then heat describes the transfer of energy in order to bring two systems to the same temperature.</p>
<p>The confusion tends to arise because we talk about heat transfer, which makes it sound like heat is a property of the system (like entropy, enthalpy etc...). It might be clearer to say heat is done on/by a system (like work done), but it sounds unnatural so no one says it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fixed. </p>

<p>This is not really right at all. Temperature is actually a measure of average motion, not the energy involved. This is a big difference.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This isn't really true either. Aluminum provides such a burning hazard indeed because of its conductivity. 200 degree water will burn you, but 200 degree aluminum will burn you faster because of its high conductivity. Something with a high heat capacity that doesn't <em>transmit</em> heat well will not burn you very effectively. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The specific heat of aluminum is one of the highest for metals.  It takes not quite twice the the amount of energy input to raise the temperature  of aluminum 1 degree as for iron.  Conversely, at a temperature aluminum has stored more energy and can conduct it to your skin faster.  You are correct in the comparison with water, but water make a poor playground slide.  I believe playground slides  are mostly stainless steel.  Aluminum corrodes too much and leaves a nasty gray stain on your skin and clothes. <a href="https://www.engineersedge.com/materials/specific_heat_capacity_of_metals_13259.htm" target="_blank">Specific heat chart</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Poor conductors don't feel hot because they're bad at conducting heat. It takes a long time for heat to travel from the inside of the material to the outside, and your skin dissipates heat, which to a degree counteracts the transfer of heat to your skin.</p>
<p>The more heat your skin absorbs, the faster is dissipates heat, so warm and hot objects you hold will feel progressively hotter the longer you hold them up until a certain point, at which point the thing will hold a steady temperature &quot;feeling&quot; until it runs out of heat, at which point the object will start to feel cooler over time.</p>
<p>Side note: Heat transfer rate is also affected by the area of surface in contact. If you wrap your whole hand around a hot object, the object will cool down faster than if you just held your fingertip to it. It won't feel hotter, though, because the nerves in your hand are all feeling the small area of heat around the nerve.</p>
<p>With poor conductors, the object won't feel as hot as it actually is because the object can't carry heat through its own material fast enough to overcome the heat dissipation of your skin. This means both that the object will feel warm even though it contains a lot of energy (heat) <em>and</em> that it will continue to feel warm for a long time, even if you wrap both hands around it and use it as a hand warmer. A good conductor containing the same amount of energy would conversely feel quite hot but would cool down quickly, like when you sip hot tea and feel it rapidly cool down in your mouth (or, conversely, sip cold water and feel it rapidly warm up in your mouth--useful if you've just had your wisdom teeth removed and only have cold water cooler water on hand to make your salt water rinse but aren't supposed to rinse with cold water).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer. I will also add that in direct sunlight, a very large amount of energy is being transferred to an object in view of the sun. Even white objects will heat up given enough exposure. </p></div>		</li>
