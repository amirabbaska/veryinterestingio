			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right. It's called a high speed impact when the kinetic energy of the object is greater than the chemical energy that binds the object together, causing it to explode.</p>
<p>Intercontinental ballistic missiles travel fast enough to cause a high speed impact, which is why those missiles only ever carry nuclear bombs. The speed of the missile gives it more kinetic energy than any conventional bomb would ever have, making it pointless to even fit a bomb onto it. Nukes on the other hand, operate on a much higher energy level, higher than the kinetic energy of the missile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in order to create this the speed threshold would vary depending on the composition of the object?
A chunk of iron would have a greater chemical energy binding it than a chunk of ice of equivalent mass. So the iron would need a higher speed/kinetic energy.
This is fascinating!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So by that logic there is probably a ballistic speed above which you wouldn't want a nuclear bomb on it either. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is misleading and wrong imo.  Yes it is true ICBMs have only ever carried nuclear warheads, but they most certainly can carry and deploy conventional, chemical, and biological weapons as well.  </p>
<p>The reasons for why they haven't are not because of the high speed impact, but realistically several factors that probably play into it.    Yes, velocity is squared in the Kinetic Energy equation but it is also multiplied by mass.  A warhead in an ICBM may only weigh 250lbs.  IMO, its probably more about economics.  </p>
<p>The minuteman 3 costs 7M a piece, and that's probably in 1970 dollars.  Not a cost effective platform for any weapons delivery really.  But when it comes to nukes, it's kind of a last resort thing so who really cares how much it costs.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The explosion is from conservation of energy, that's fine. What about conservation of momentum? If the exploded particles from an angled impact don't have massive preferential direction of motion, where does all the extra momentum go? Into changes of Earth spin &amp; orbit?</p></div>		</li>
