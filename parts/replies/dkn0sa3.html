			<div class="markdown"><p>all those issues could be easily automated away tho, there are a few countries and banking systems that offer 24/7 365 fund mobility (But perhaps the days where the system itself is maintenanced to a different degree)
Here in germany money takes considerably longer to be processed than in many other states and the banking sector and lobbyists who fight laws aimed at harmonizing this deficit cite profits as their main reason to not change it.
The situation with having to pay money for parking it at the EZB ruined it a little for them.
But having access to funds you can utilize to make money with for longer is probably something Banks do like.
No idea if this is really the reason, it's just that here the defense at forcing banks by law to make it more expedient are opposed with ideas of profit gains lost from being forced to process it more quickly.
I wonder if SEPA would have been possible in a time where banks were not punished for parking money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think they tried to gear our bank towards being like &quot;trusting&quot; in the customers  in order to seem more human and less rigid than the typical bank, like some kind of faith system. </p>
<p>That shit died really quick.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's perhaps not the goal, but it's an added bonus. :-)</p>
<p>In my country, Belgium, bank transfers take &quot;up to three days&quot;... but are instant if you're a customer in the same bank as the person you transfer the money to, and quite often are done overnight for most banks. We don't have the same problems as you explain (cash deposits etc) because our cash deposits are automated (i.e. you go to a special ATM that counts the money you insert). As other people explained in this thread, I assume the &quot;three-day window&quot; is to make sure all transfers go on time, even though a lot of those go faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting! Our transfers were instantaneous among mutual customers as well. Even when sending to a different bank it was typically the same day as long as we had it sent before noon. </p>
<p>I've never seen an ATM that counts the cash for you! I do live in a smaller uni city, though. That would have made my life a lot easier, haha. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What country do you live in? I've come to realise, when travelling, that our country was quite &quot;advanced&quot; when it comes to services offered to customers, wrt banking. Granted we can't use our credit cards everywhere like Americans seem to be doing, but there are ATMs everywhere here, they're totally free (no withdrawal fee), and you can use another bank's ATM to get your money as well. Also, the ATMs are not those small machines that Americans have (I've seen a few in the UK as well, in pubs), but <a href="http://s2.lemde.fr/image/2009/12/23/534x267/1284409_3_af24_ill-1284409-8858-distributeurs_a5f9da0ec1ee0af9af513d5efb34b196.jpg" target="_blank">big machines that are built into the wall</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't speak for other banks, but at least the BoA ATM's around here (who I use) take the cash directly (no envelope) and count it.  I just assumed all ATM's did the same thing these days; that's interesting that there are still ones that don't.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most transfers take less than three days, but we're not allowed to complain if they take up to three days. Most (younger) people have apps on their phones now that allow, through the use of a QR code (and an authorisation process from the bank) to transfer money instantly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, I live in Canada, and our bank machines count bills automatically as well. my balance usually reflects the deposit within an hour. possibly instantaneous, but I've never bothered to check so soon after.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are the consequences when a customer does this?</p>
<p>I'd imagine at the minimum:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fee for bounced check</li>
<li>Customer must redeposit the credits within a set time period</li>
<li>Immediate holds for all future deposits</li>
</ol>
<p>What crosses the border of fraud where this would be pursued further?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it's fraudulent the customer typically doesn't ever come back. It was always people with very little money in their accounts to begin with, so they would just take it negative and never come back. We called this a &quot;charge-off&quot;, where it essentially sits with a negative balance and we couldn't(wouldn't) process anymore transactions for you until you paid it back. </p>
<p>It's also important to note that when you open a bank account, they run a kind of credit check on you, and if your social security number pops up that you owe another bank money, we wouldn't open an account for you. Most reputable banks have a similar process, so you'd be hard-pressed to just go to another bank and open a new account. </p>
<p>There are of course the shitty banks you see in Walmart and the like. They don't run your social through their systems, but they typically have really high fees, and the bank I worked at always took extra precaution with checks deposited that were drawn off of those banks, which included putting holds on checks for small amounts because we couldn't verify that funds were readily available. </p>
<p>Police reports can also be filed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that why check cashing businesses exist?</p>
<p>I went into one once to send money via Western Union.  All the people in line looked so desperate.  They certainly didn't look like they could afford the fees they were being charged to cash their paychecks.</p></div>		</li>
