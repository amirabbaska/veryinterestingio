			<div class="markdown"><p>The conjecture lacks connections with existing mathematical theories. To prove it, you have to find these connections by creating new mathematical theories which will certainly be helpful in other domains of mathematics. It may also lead to new concepts and theories in physics. Who knows?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same could've been said for many new mathematical discoveries. For example, the discovery of imaginary numbers. People may have thought that they were useless at the time, but doing any research will show you how useful they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Who knows? But that's not why people do mathematics. Nor why people do any fundamental science. That's why people fund it, but physicists don't solve stuff about quantum physics because it might be useful. I mean they probably hope it will be and everything, but even if it's not they'd still do it anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Computers can generally only solve mathematical problems where humans think they know how to solve it but doing so either requires lots and lots of arithmetic or trivial problem solving to be done over and over again. For computers to be able to solve problems like this will likely require some form of general AI which most researchers think we're around 50 years away from. Once it does get to that level though it appears quite likely that they'll pretty quickly accelerate past human levels and will likely be able to solve problems that're way out of our reach. Although these proofs may be out of the reach of human understanding and the meaningfulness of doing pure mathematics at that point has mostly been eliminated in my opinion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A computer will be better at finding a counter example to some conjecture that will disprove the conjecture. Although some conjectures in the past were disproved by values so large that a computer would never be able to calculate up to there.</p>
<p>To really solve most conjectures requires a lot more creativity (at which computers are currently bad at) compared to computation speed (which computers are really good at).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally math proofs are not in the area of what computers can do.  That will require a true AI but then your at the point where a &quot;computer&quot; can make a better version of itself which leads much more interesting stuff than math proofs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually this is not strictly true. Computers can and have solved theorems on their own. Look up automated theorem proving. Now the theorems they are proving are not necessarily deep and meaningful for mathematicians. But my own research group has used computers to search for algorithms which have implied lower bounds for the size of certain combinatorial structures. Note here that this proof is uncontroversial: the theorem is proven by the exhibition of the combinatorial structure (an error correcting code for example, or a graph that has no special substructure) not by the reasoning of the computer.
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06022" target="_blank">This</a> is a good paper that involves some computer search to prove a theorem, not colleagues of mine but this is a good paper.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The conjecture has not yet been proven, but it is considered to be true because it has been tested for all integer values up to 5Ã—2^60.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you have proof of this? The largest number that can be stored in one Terabyte of storage is 1x10^12</p>
<p>And that is just storing the number, let alone doing any computation with it.</p>
<p>Isn't 5x2^60 some mathematical proof lower / upper bound?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's further links in there linking to the actual 5x2^60  verification.</p>
<p>The following link in particular:</p>

<p>You could follow the link under 'current status' for more information on how they checked it in detail.</p>
<p>Edit: it's all a tad too mathy for me, but it seems there are shortcuts to check wether or not a number will result in the cycle and other techniques to drastically lower the number of integers that need to be checked (resulting in less computation time).</p></div>		</li>
