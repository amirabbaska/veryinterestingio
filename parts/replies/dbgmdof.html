			<div class="markdown"><p>It took about 5 seconds of googling to find very respectable sources like the Journal of Nutrition and JAMA showing vitamins had benefits, specifically a reduction in cancer and cataracts, and heart disease for women.</p>
<p>There are also studies that show no statistical benefit (that is to say, no benefit at the 95% confidence level), but your language is entirely too strong and negative against vitamins in the face of the current research.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been studies on supplements benefiting certain medical conditions, like anemia and some cancers. However, there have <em>also</em> been studies on supplements that show a correlation between supplements and certain medical conditions, like prostate cancer. So, the question is, do the benefits outweigh the risks? The answer appears to be <strong>no</strong>, unless you have an actual deficiency. Numerous studies now have found a strong correlation between people who take supplements and lower mortality. At first, people thought that maybe people who take supplements are just more sickly, which would explain lower mortality. However, more studies have taken other factors into account and still show a correlation with supplement use and an increase in mortality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Replying here with sources I promised below with hopes that it will reach everyone in this subthread. </p>
<p>Here's the uptodate articles on vitamin supplementation (bonus, also included summary on diet research for adults). </p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, UpToDate provides summaries of research for clinicians to use - provides a much better look at research than reviewing individual studies as it reviews them within the context of other literature as well. (More info on levels of evidence/synopses vs. studies here: <a href="http://libguides.mtroyal.ca/c.php?g=172911&p=2943843" target="_blank">http://libguides.mtroyal.ca/c.php?g=172911&p=2943843</a>)</p>
<p>I didn't know where to upload the files so I've added them here:

<p>Please someone let me know if there's a better place to upload these.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a pretty restricted diet - I have to follow the FODMAP diet due to IBS. My doctor recommended I take multivitamins which I have done for about two years. |But I've always wondered - because so many wheat-based foods are fortified with certain vitamins, does that mean I'm not getting enough?</p></div>		</li>
