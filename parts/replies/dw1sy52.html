			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect that one reason is just practical. There's a cap on the number of people who can hold KBEs or DBEs, so making men Knights Bachelor leaves the spaces available for women to be given DBEs.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the orders of chivalry tend to indicate what you got your honour for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Order of the British Empire - the &quot;default&quot; for most honours</li>
<li>Royal Victorian Order - personal service to the monarch</li>
<li>Order of St Michael and St George - mostly diplomats</li>
<li>Order of the Bath - mostly senior military officers and civil servants</li>
</ul>
<p>Technically that list is also in ascending order of prestige, with Knight Bachelor lower than them all, but that makes little real difference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Drummer Ringo Starr came in for particular opprobrium: “And Ringo? Don’t even talk about it.”</p>
<p>Jones recalled arranging Love Is a Many Splendoured Thing for Starr’s 1970 debut solo album Sentimental Journey.</p>
<p>“Ringo had taken three hours for a four-bar thing he was trying to fix on a song. He couldn’t get it. We said: ‘Mate, why don’t you get some lager and lime, some shepherd’s pie, and take an hour-and-a-half and relax a little bit.’”</p>
<p>“Ronnie came in for 15 minutes and tore it up. Ringo comes back and says: ‘George [Martin], can you play it back for me one more time?’</p>
<p>“So George did, and Ringo says: ‘That didn’t sound so bad.’ And I said: ‘Yeah, motherfucker because it ain’t you.’ Great guy, though.”</p></div>		</li>
