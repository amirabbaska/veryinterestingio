			<div class="markdown"><p>You forgot that most commercial semi-trucks get regular preventative maintenance to keep them on the road longer. As were a typical vehicle owner wont seek maintenance until there is a noticeable problem. However, most consumer base Diesel truck buyers/owners will take care of them.</p>
<p>If the average car driver were to maintenance their car motor every 15,000 miles, their motor will outlive them.</p>
<p>I have a hand-me-down '77 Datsun 210(from cousin) with over 700k miles on it. It's in great condition because it has always been well looked after.</p>

<p>Edit^2 - People are asking me how to do preventative maintenance; I learned it from using Google searching the vehicle make and model. Changing brakes are the only maintenance that Google and/or a Haynes/Chilton manual did not teach me, I learned that from my younger brother.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Upvote for maintenance!!  I had a &quot;hand-me-down&quot; '78 Chevy Caprice with 72k miles on it.  I personally put another 400k miles on it before my ex wrecked it.  The only issues I had were the exhaust rusting out (gotta love Michigan winters /s), and those damn vinyl seats.  If I could find another like it, I'd jump at the chance!!</p></div>		</li>

<p>My shitty '97 Sebring is going to be a piece of shit no matter who owns it and no matter what maintenance it gets.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on a good car to pick up (preferably &lt;$20,000) to replace my Sebring?</p>

<p>EDIT: The head gasket problem is all solved for Subarus newer than 09/10 depending on the model. If you buy an older one this is definitely a concern. However, Subarus are pretty affordable and you should be able to get a newer model in your price range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Toyota and Honda are solid.  I'm a little less geeked out on Subaru's because the AWD systems require more attention, and if you get a flat, you have to replace all four tires because they have to match otherwise, even more strain on the diff/transfer case.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First and foremost, oil change, which sadly a majority of people overlook. </p>
<p>It isn't so much <em>changing</em> the oil, which is still very important, as it is <strong>making sure the motor has oil it in.</strong></p>
<p>Checking the quality of the oil is also important. You want to make sure that there isn't a high concentration of metal bits floating around as this is a sign of metal-on-metal grinding. This might tell us that cylinders aren't sleeved properly or cams are rubbing. </p>
<p>Coil packs and spark plugs should be inspected for excess oil residue. </p>
<p>There are a lot of revised versions of parts already installed on your car. These are replaced during Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) work during or after regular scheduled maintenance. Things like the Positive Crankcase Valve (fuck you CA. replace this with a block-off plate) and coil packs need constant replacement.  </p>
<p>Brake pads and rotors should be inspected. Tires should have proper tread depth and appropriate camber, caster, and toe for the type of driving you are doing. </p>
<p>Bits like bushings need to be inspected and replaced, as found in sway bars and suspension components which may be the culprit for a squeaky ride. </p>
<p>Normal fluids should be inspected, topped off, or flushed and changed, e.g., coolant. </p>
<p>Voltage should be tested. </p>
<p>The diaphragms on diverter or blow-off valves on turbocharged cars may show signs of tearing. This may lead to a decrease in fuel economy and performance. </p>
<p>Filters should be inspected and replaced. </p>
<p>There's a lot but in reality it can be done in an hour or so. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as a Honda goes:</p>
<p>Oil every 5,000km</p>
<p>Power Steering fluid 100,000km (sooner if towing)</p>
<p>Brake fluid every 2 years</p>
<p>Transmission fluid every 48,000km</p>
<p>Coolant every 5 years </p>
<p>Timing belt, plugs, valve adjustment every 100,000km or so also. </p>
<p>Obviously these are guidelines. If a fluid is looking really dark or smells burnt then change it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer, but not the whole answer. A heavy truck is somebody's livelihood, a company's profit engine. Not an appliance. It's not treated like your mom's Camry. It gets <em>maintained</em>.  Funny, as soon as you start running the numbers for a business, maintenance moves way up the list. There's also the issue of general build quality. Business buys a heavy truck. It intends to get that million miles out of it in order to make the money back. If it kacks out after 100k miles, that truck maker won't sell another. So the build quality is higher. Has to be. Lastly, there's a lot of &quot;this is my great great granpa's hammer. We've replaced the head and handle though&quot; going on with heavy trucks. Over a million miles, major components get overhauled or replaced entirely. So it ends up lasting much longer. </p>
<p>TLDR- Diesel is oily, but there's a LOT to be said for real, no shit, no playing regular maintenance and highway miles only.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a big thing is being missed in posts like this though. A $200,000 big rig that is expected to run for a million miles is MAINTAINED a lot better than that 12 year old Pontiac Grand AM that some dude bought his daughter for her high school graduation gift. I don't know shit about trucking, but I imagine that there is a strict maintenance schedule and that it's taken seriously. I also would bet that a lot of time and money is invested into keeping diesel fleet trucks running properly etc. </p>
<p>I don't know any of this, but I'm pretty sure it's true. Correct me if I'm wrong anyone who has intimate knowledge of how a typical freight shipping truck is maintained (or not maintained).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't personally do the maintenance but I work for an oilfield company as an E tech.  They are anal about us maintaining the electronics of the pumps used for fracking.  Just imagine how anal they are about the maintenance of the tractors that are used to not only transport these pumps, but also run the entire time they're out on a pad.  Now, our trucks don't usually travel further than a couple hundred miles for a job site.  But one used to transport goods sometimes a thousand miles at a time, you bet your ass they are well maintained.  </p>
<p>I had a previous vehicle with 230,000+ miles that ran like a champ.  I bought it used at 73,000 miles.  I'm sure it is still running today.  Gas engine, even.  All I did was basic maintenance.  It doesn't take much.  </p>
<p>BTW - no I'm not a mechanic.  Just maintain your vehicle.  It's not hard.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My company only repairs my tractor and the trailers as much as they have to and only do that begrudgingly.</p>
<p>It once took 8 hours to get a repair approval on a trailer with running lights at night. It would be illegal to run your trailer like that and it is a guaranteed ticket. There's no getting around that other than by repairing it. But no, they drug their feet approving the repair request.</p>
<p>Repairs are expenses and they don't like expenses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously, this.  I just sold a 97 Acura Integra that I bought in 1998 with 18,000 kms on it.  I sold it with 522,000kms.  In that time I changed the clutch once and brakes, all the other routine stuff.  Original motor, trans and most of the exhaust.  Change the oil, wash it once every couple weeks and take good care of it and any car will last a long time, not just diesel's.  I needed a bigger car and a change after 17 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell even with the strict maintenance schedule our frac pumps find a way to take a shit. Park one right next to the dirt, their air filters clog up- boom, pump starts kicking out.</p>
<p>Our mechanics don't even go near the cummins/detroit diesel engines or transmissions, we just hire professionals to deal with that shit. Hell we used to hire wrench runners just to replace oil filters and shit on our pumps too, now with the prices our EO's have to do it.</p>
<p>I don't know which company you're with but where I am elec techs have the easiest jobs. They just vape and play candy crush or whatever in their vans.</p></div>		</li>

Every time I see each truck. Then there's grease fittings... Today, this concrete mixer had 88. While I'm there I check/adjust the brakes... If the slack adjuster is worn, replace. Any sign of loose ujoint, replace. Gasket leaks? Replace. Tires at 120 psi... Worn? Replace. </p>
<p>They do it every time bc that's the bread winner. Nobody does that on their 99 accord....</p></div>		</li>
