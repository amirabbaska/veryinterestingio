			<div class="markdown"><p>Well for me to act weird I have to drink a lot and fast. I was drinking pretty regularly, but not getting really drunk. Like I could have 10+ shots over a few hours and be fine, not really feeling drunk. But sometimes I wanted to actually feel drunk and I'd accidentally go overboard, like 20 mins from drinking to black out (maybe close to a fifth). I'd only remember the first 2 shots, everything after is gone. Thats when I'd over do it and start acting weird, like yelling at people that weren't there. I think it was just me getting drunk and ranting about stuff, but my parents saw me drunk and thought it was a bit abnormal. They don't drink at all, I'm pretty sure they've been sober their whole lives so seeing me really wasted frightened them.
Another note is that I'd never really sleep, and being passed out from drinking would only last 2 maybe 3 hours. Usually I wouldn't pass out I'd just drink a normal (maybe more than that) amount and not get any sleep. When I was sober I'd act normal, apart from being really tired and really craving alcohol.
All in all it's really embarrassing. But I just couldn't stop drinking. Went to the hospital to clean up and then went to rehab. Now I'm doing so much better. I don't have the need to get intoxicated like that anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got really drunk once (blacked out in like 20 mins) and started ranting about stuff. My parents said it looked like I was yelling at people that weren't there. It's really embarrassing but now I'm doing much better. I left a longer reply to u/cluelessNY in the comments.</p></div>		</li>
