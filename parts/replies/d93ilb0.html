			<div class="markdown"><p>If armpit odor is ultimately a display of fitness that enhances a person's likelihood of having sex and reproducing, why does body odor itself smell so unpleasant? If we smelled as good as roses (i.e. if however we smelled, it smelled as pleasant to members of the opposite sex as that) that would be even more sex-promoting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed a different type of smell too, about towards my late 20's (maybe around 28).  Deodorant worked fine and would last all day, but around that time when my BO changed, my deodorant stopped working around lunch and the BO was much different.  It was much stronger and smelt worse as well.  I also noticed some of my friends has this same smell too.  I think it has something to do w/ certain types of food we eat, because now it isn't as bad.  Also at one point, only my left arm pit was smelling real bad like that.  When looking up this problem, there were many on the web who had this same problem, but the smell was like 10x worse for them.  Said people on the bus or around them would making commits on the horrible smell, not knowing it was them :(.  They also took many showers, so it wasn't dirtyness.  This was ruining some of these peoples lives.  </p>
<p>Also the only thing that I found to really cover the smell is applying baking soda to the pits.  It is the best and cheapest deodorant on the market, and it doubles as a great tooth paste as well (among many other things).  I usually apply a small amount of oil to each pit, then dip two finger tips into the baking soda and rub on, sometimes doing 2 dips per arm pit.  Works really well, but if you put too much oil on, your sweat will run and seem worse.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Fashion too - i.e what may well disgust you was probably not an issue when whatever ancestor of ours evolved to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's probably because fresh sweat smells fine, it's old sweat that is gross. The jersey is probably impregnated with old sweat and getting it wet again makes it smell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People who have a varied MHC system (Major Histomine Compatibility Center); a part of your immune system that has receptors on all your cells and is part of how your body presents antigens to other cells for the production antibodies; are perceived by the opposite sex to have a more attracting smell.  Two people with incredibly varied MHC and thus Adaptive Immune System are more likely to have children with better Immune Systems than their own.  Possible evolutionary reasons could be as a way to prevent incest and thus limit genetic defects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To an extent. I for one like manly smell with all them pheromones.  But if you don't practice good hygiene, the pheromones get overpowered  by bacteria and you're smelling more germy than sexy. </p>
<p>In my own words, there's not much science behind this. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Nitpick, but it matters:</p>
<p>These are <strong>not</strong> pheromones.  It's bacteria waste products, cultured to make us smelly, but they're not actually coming from our bodies and they're not used to communicate.  There has never been a scientific study that could prove the existence of human pheromones.  As far as anyone knows, humans don't have them.</p></div>		</li>
