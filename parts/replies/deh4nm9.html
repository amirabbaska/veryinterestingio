			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: long post will highlight(in bold) important items in it</p>
<p>Edit2: i didn't touch on political issues because that would be a thesis by itself.</p>
<p>I have decided to post as a response to this comment because I would like to counter some of the arguments that you raised. Coming from having an economics background as well as lived in africa for about 17 years(in an area that is known to have developed sickle cell anemia as an adaptive response to malaria), the whole geographical/disease theory pretty much downplays the main reason why Africa does so poorly. </p>
<p>First of all, It's understandable that Africa has a whole range of climates. We range from Mediterranean to an Equatorial climate and there are significant changes as you move towards the equator. At the Equator, its largely warm and changes are relatively +-20 degrees(US scale). One of the main reasons, Europeans could not come to Africa during their voyages was(at the time) their boats could not handle the waves and the presence of diseases. Malaria was a big issue in the 19th and 20th century and in fact it really inflicted loses among kids (hence why Africans tend to have big families). However towards the end of the 20th century malaria medication started becoming relatively cheap. Literally, you could go to the shops and buy a Malariaquin tablet if you suspected that you had malaria(without prescription). </p>
<p>The main problem with geography doesn't lie with diseases or tech. It is mostly 2 things:</p>
<p>1) <strong>A country is landlocked (As you had mentioned before).</strong> Trade is impossible and the country has to proxy out trade through another country. A good example of this is Uganda. Kenya being a neighbour is relatively way weathier than Uganda because they are right next to the indian ocean. For trade to occur in uganda, they have to go through Kenya and even though they have tried creating trade blocks, it's still expensive.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Climate.</strong> This Affects countries that are tropical. Am talking about the North Eastern side(Nigeria, Senegal {most french speaking nations before you get to Algeria, morrocco and the like}). It gets bloody hot and muggy in those nations and honestly sometimes not much -in terms of work- goes on. Am talking about the muggy feeling where if you walk out, your body is covered in sweat within 5 mins. What happens is that most people will often work for 6 hours in a day and the rest of the day they don't do anything because of the heat. A friend ordered a beer from a vendor while visiting nigeria and within a minute the beer was pretty much room temp(from refrigeration).</p>
<p>The problem Africa has is not a Geographical one but more of a socio-political one. Let me just list a few down:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Cultural problems</strong>. Africa has a shit tonne of Tribes. For instance in kenya, i can count atleast 12 different tribes. They are all classified into 3 categories. Bantu, Nilotes and Semites. Here is the problem with this, when you mix in different cultures in a pot trouble is bound to start. One tribe thinks they are the chosen tribe and the other tribe thinks the same thing. In the process you get what i call &quot;soft issues&quot;(Nepotism, Favoritism etc). Nepotism in Africa is a huge problem. Am talking about the issues where someone will be promoted without any credentials just because his boss speaks the same dialect as he does. This guy goes into office, fucks everything up and then is transferred to another office or promoted. </p>
<p>2) <strong>Older people do not want to give younger people a chance. If you think that the unemployed youth in the united states is a problem, wait until you go to Africa</strong>. You have to understand some things. For one, there is absolutely no structure of accountability like a social security program there. Loans are extremely high risk and bankers usually don't want to give them out unless you have alot of money in your bank account. For instance, if you needed a loan you would have to print out your bank statements and your salary plus your employer would have to send a letter saying that &quot;until the loan is paid, the sum required every month will be deducted from your salary to the bank&quot;. There is a middle class but vertical upward movement between classes is very difficult.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Brain drain</strong>. I am a very good example of this. Moving to a first world country because i will be treated with some sort of equality amongst everyone else. In Africa, young people are told &quot;wait, it's not your turn yet&quot;(i kid you not there is a swahili proverb that translates to moving slow in life). So young people move to Europe (Norway specifically) because they know that they may be able to atleast get a shot at school and work. Once they complete school, they feel indebted to their host country and work for majority of their careers then they move back to Africa to retire and become a CEO. And the cycle continues.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long post, just wanted to clear up some stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's almost as if Africa needs the united states of africa treatment because there's no way landlocked countries can compete alone (federal funding would be useful), there's no way the multiple ethnicities and cultures can coexist without some sort of shared core beliefs (a constitution of you will). </p>
<p>Would a United Africa be good for the rest of the world competition wise? Wouldn't it make it more difficult for resources and labour to be exploited? I ask this because economically, would you rather be competing with a large diverse economic entity or multiple disorganised entities. (I hope someone smarter can clarify this because it may or may not be the same case for the EU?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>damn this was informative. i want to do a ton of research on Africa now. your cultural argument is very interesting. As an American, citing a problem for a culture as being possibly BECAUSE of the culture is a one way ticket to you being labeled as a racist, a bigot or an uneducated fool. Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams have really opened my eyes to problems of a cultural nature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem. I saw a topic i could answer and took the opportunity. Yeah culture sometime can really hold a civilization back  especially when you mix that culture with pride. The extreme example would be Rwanda</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Africa is markedly poorer than the other poor nations of the world however, even poorer than India or Bangladesh or Vietnam. Its important to note the absolute biggest factor here... the Sahara Desert. </p>
<p>Similarly to how the oceans separated native american society from the rest of the world, the Sahara Desert separated Africa from the rest of the world. The coastlines of Africa on the west and east were JUST far enough from most other civilizations that trade was insanely difficult. Its extremely easy to see how subsaharan africa is EXTREMELY isolated, how would they get in contact with the rest of the world? The only option is to cross the Sahara, which was neigh impossible, or sail your boat literally thousands of miles to India or Persia, which was simply unfeasible. </p>
<p>The other regions of the world flourished, even those in harsh climates could still get a catch-up by trading with more advanced nations. Africa never had that easy available trade for them, the closest contact they had... was with another massive desert in Arabia. </p>
<p>Everything Africa had for them, they had to do themselves, up until the 1700s when the rest of the world finally caught up to them and sea exploration exploded. However the rest of the world simply too advantage of them instead in a massive way. While Africa wasn't GREAT before the slave trade, there was massive depopulations and an increase in war and conflict following it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like when you begin a game of Civ and you get a terrible starting place on the map. Same game, same rules, same potential among the different civs that are playing, but the initial starting conditions make a <em>huge</em> difference in the outcome. Life is obviously not as simple as a game, but I think that the Civilization series does a good job of driving home the importance of economics (natural resources, trade, population growth, and education) in the development of civilizations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now it's just a matter of time before I run into the other Civs and discover how much more advanced they are.</p></div>		</li>
