			<div class="markdown"><p>This is if you're doing something like a Seldinger. This isn't how you would go about administering IV medications. If you're going to give something IV, chances are you're going to have to give something else, too, so the first step is to establish a saline lock so that you only have to stick them once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this. I used to insert it all the way then pull back towards the surface.</p>
<p>Also, you're going in at an angle not straight down, so chances of staying inside the vein longer are increased.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you've pushed the needle too far doesn't that mean you've already blown the vein?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's some confusion about needles and IVs here. To put in an IV, you use a needle with a thin plastic tube coating it. You insert the needle into the vein, then once you see blood, you thread the plastic tube the rest of the way in and remove the needle. The end result is just a tiny plastic tube threaded into the vein. After the initial prick, the needle is removed and gone completely. We leave patients with just the thin plastic tube, known as an &quot;IV catheter&quot;. We do not leave patients with needles sticking into their arms.</p></div>		</li>
