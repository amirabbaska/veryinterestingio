			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;slate&quot; which everyone else is calling clapboard (I don't think I've heard it called that once on set in my entire career, it's an antiquated term to some degree) is one of three different forms of identifying every single take that has been shot. The other two, camera reports and the script coordinator's log are all cross referenced by an assistant editor through out filming and the editors are making rough assemblies of said footage during filming (on medium to big films). By the time post production really gets going the editorial department has its own logs to reference but even those aren't used extensively once the 'directors assembly' is together a few weeks in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think &quot;clapboard&quot; or &quot;clapperboard&quot; is maybe more of a UK term?  I've heard it over here although &quot;slate&quot; is more common these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The slate is the bit you write on, previously chalk, literally making it a slate. The clapper is the noisy bit. You can have one without the other. The terms probably get used interchangeably. To &quot;slate&quot; something is to mark the start in a unique, identifiable way, both on audio and film. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other form of identifying each take is the Sound Reports which the mixer keeps, meticulously noting the timecode of every take and noting any audio issues.
From what I've observed the process for dealing with sound reports is that the mixer gives them to production at the end of each day, production places them in a wormhole ripped into the space/time continuum, everyone forget they ever existed until there is an emergency with a single take 9 to 29 months later. A breathless call to my house and I email a copy of that day's report from my records. </p>
<p>(source: no one reads my sound reports) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm wormhole. I have watched PAs and assistant editors scrambling around trying to find sound notes in while continually double checking the camera reports and being baffled why they can't find any mention of &quot;that fucking buzzing sound&quot; the editor keeps yelling about. </p></div>		</li>
