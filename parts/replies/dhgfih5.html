			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree that those are all factors...I think the religiosity and early marriage are not as big factors (at least in my state) as you would think.  </p>
<p>I live in a deep blue state, in a very liberal area, in an upper-middle-class town.  About 5 miles down the road is a lower-middle-class/working class town.  Both towns are about 99.9% white.  I've noticed a distinct difference in worldview between the two.</p>
<p>A few things I've noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In middle-class/upper-middle-class towns, there is a <em>strong</em> expectation that people will graduate high school, go to college, start a career and <em>then</em> think about marriage and family.  It is just what you do. Thus most people will not marry til late 20's and start having children around 30.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Middle class/upper middle class also have strong expectations that your kids need to go to <em>good</em> schools, do sports or dance, take music lessons, language lessons, SAT preparation courses, etc..  That costs a lot of money, plus means buying an overpriced house in a good school district -- so the idea of having more than 2 or 3 kids seems insanely expensive and reckless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My working-class friends have no such expectation of having to be &quot;competitive&quot; for a selective college;  they don't do all the &quot;enrichment&quot; type things (although sports are definitely popular but many of them qualify for assistance as far as equipment and fees), and they are OK with living in a less-highly-regarded school district (some do school-choice into better districts, though).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among middle-class/upper middle class, there is also an unspoken assumption that you will finish college and then go where the career takes you.  Since this might be very far from family, you won't have built-in babysitters and backup caregivers for children -- so you are more likely to have only 1 or 2 kids.  My working-class friends have a <em>strong</em> unspoken assumption that you won't leave where you are from.  It is kind of unthinkable to them to consider moving far away from family and friends; so while they may not be able to afford daycare, they usually have grandmas, aunts, cousins, sisters, etc. around to help with childcare.  I know if I had had family close by to help out, I would have had more kids! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religiosity does not seem to be a big factor around here.  Very few people are religious;  and contraception is widely available and inexpensive.  The working class/lower middle class town has a high rate of unwed mothers, as most have grown up without fathers themselves.  Children + marriage are not really connected in their minds; whereas in the middle class/upper middle class town most people get married before starting a family.  My lower-middle class friends who grew up in public housing tell me they did not even know anyone who was married;  they seemed to think that marriage required a large, lavish wedding and thus was something only rich people do.</p>
</li>
<li>The lower middle class town has a very high rate of teen pregnancy, vs. almost zero for the upper-middle-class town.  As I mentioned before, we are very liberal blue state with comprehensive sex ed and low-cost contraception is easily available.  My friends who had children in their teens tell me that they knew perfectly well how babies are made and how to use contraception;  they just didn't really bother because &quot;well, you have a boyfriend and eventually you have a baby.  It's just what you do&quot;.  Most of the girls did not have plans for college or career beyond brief vocational programs (cosmetology school, massage therapist school, nursing assistant, etc..) so it didn't seem like a big deal to have a baby.  And as I mentioned, there is a multi-generational thing going on with single motherhood, so people didn't see the point in waiting until marriage to start a family.  It is really just seen as a part of normal life.</li>

<p>All of these extracurricular activities also keep kids busy, especially if they are trying to get into a &quot;good&quot; college that they don't have as much time to party, do drugs, and hook up recklessly. Not that it doesn't happen, but it's rarer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In sociology, this is part of control theories. Basically, the idea is that you can prevent crime/deviance by keeping those who would commit it - young people, especially young men - busy, and socially engaged/connected to &quot;proper&quot; society (note: control theory is probably the most conservative of the theories of deviance - compare with explicitly Marxist conflict theories or the more liberal learning or anomie theories).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Religion is probably the biggest indicator for number of children per family in my state.</p>
<p>I live in Utah, which is predominantly Mormon. Members are encouraged to marry young (I'm talking 19 for girls and 21 for boys) and have a lot of children. It's not uncommon for Mormon families to have four or more kids. I was &quot;unusual&quot; for &quot;only&quot; having one sibling.</p>
<p>As a result, Utah has more kids per family than any other state in the US (I think Hawaii was pretty close last time I checked).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's nice for discussion, but you are reporting largely anecdotal information. OP's post is covered in many anthropology and sociology courses. Many of the topics he covered were prominent in my studies. In no shape or form am I discouraging you from talking about these subjects but I can definitely say that OP's are supported by sciences and yours at the very least came off as purely anecdotal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there's also an aspect of agency involved. I think you have teenage girls from messed up families, that perhaps are trying very hard, and the girls know they aren't going to be able to go to college or have much of a career, and they'll never own a house, but one thing they can do as well as anyone is be a mother. It's a way of growing up, proving yourself as a woman. And possibly in girls from unstable or unsupportive homes, there may be an aspect of making it right, in trying to prove they can do better than their parents did. </p>
<p>This is anecdotal, based on observations of family members and others I've known throughout life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. There was a program in a small town in Illinois that identified girls that were deemed a high risk for getting pregnant. They were told in middle school that they would be guaranteed the money to go to college or trade school after high school, provided they didn't become pregnant. </p>
<p>After several years of this, the teen pregnancy rate in the town dropped by 50%, and more girls are getting better grades and continuing their education. If you've got other options on the table, a life of early parenthood isn't always the first choice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why alot of other 1st world countries have a low birth rate overall. In my country if you attend university you get paid to go. It's not much but its enough to get by on. And uni is also cheaper overall. </p>
<p>ANYONE can get into university and get paid to do so. You don't even need to have finished school. Most universities have a free (government funded) courses within the uni so you can get into almost any degree. </p>
<p>And since everyone has an equal opportunity to get an education they know its always there and don't need to have a kid to get fulfilment in their life.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Hysterectomies and vasectomies are also a rather common contraceptive</p>

<p>At least in the US, a hysterectomy is not a common contraceptive method. Tubal ligation and occlusion are common methods of sterilization, currently covered 100% by the ACA. Bilateral salpingectomy (removal of the Fallopian tubes) is also very effective, but less common as it's technically classified as a cancer prevention procedure rather than contraception, and therefore not completely covered by insurance under the ACA. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel that you are less likely to jump through hoops for asking to have your leg removed over getting your tubes tied. You can be 110% sure and the doctor will still doubt you and throw in the 'you might in a few years' card. But if that's the case and you want to have more children, you can always adopt. But that never seems to be an option since it's over priced. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got my fallopian tubes removed at age 35. I am married sans kids, and had always just assumed I had to be that age before I even asked. I told my gyno he was cool for not questioning me and agreeing so quickly. He said he had just done the same procedure on a child-free 25 year old! Some docs are more open to it than others I guess. Wish I had known that sooner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also really drastic, having a hysterectomy kicks you straight into menopause and all the hormonal changes that come with it. </p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks to the below commenters for clarifying: it doesn't kick you into menopause unless your ovaries come out with it. Nonetheless a tubal ligation is still much less complicated (and possibly reversible? not sure on that though) </p></div>		</li>

<p>I have. It's basically the &quot;I seriously do not ever want kids, not even a .01% chance, rip it out.&quot; or &quot;I don't want kids and have a family history of <insert female genital organ> cancer so let's get it before it starts.&quot;</p>
<p>Many doctors won't perform it on an elective basis because it is much more traumatic than a tubal ligation. Trauma as in physical trauma to the body, not emotional trauma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At my age I know two women who have had a full hysterectomy for that reason, it's likely more common among somewhat older adults. If it's not being used a uterus can lead to a host of complications, such as uterine fibroids which are not uncommon and can grow to be quite large. </p>
<p>A hysterectomy for purely contraceptive reasons is likely quite rare despite my anecdotes, but not unheard of. </p></div>		</li>
