			<div class="markdown"><p>In the past few years they've actually changed it again to MyPlate which is very similar to what you mentioned at the end of your comment. It's a circle divided up into protein, grains, veggies, and fruits and also includes a section for dairy above the plate (like as a glass of milk for a visual). I can't quite remember what year they changed it to this, but I think it's fairly new. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the point was that people were misunderstanding that one food was more important than another, not just that it was more portions.</p>
<p>But by then &quot;food pyramid&quot; had become part of the vocab, and the first change didn't want to ditch the vocab.   You're not the only one who saw how silly it was, and someone decided to just ditch the pyrmanid for that exact reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know what really annoyed me about the switch? Well I'll tell ya.</p>
<p>I was in elementary school when they made the switch, and had to do a project on nutrition. I put the old food pyramid in my presentation, and the teacher told me i used the wrong one and I had to use the new one. Well guess what? The information is the same! And I told her that! But she acted like the old pyramid was completely irrelevant and it has always really bothered me that they even changed it because the the new pyramid looked stupid and made the pyramid shape irrelevant.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, I agree. </p></div>		</li>
