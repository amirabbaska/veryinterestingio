			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to NMSU for my hort degree. at the time the chile pepper institute and dr Paul bosland were working on research to breed peppers that were more likely to be self fertile (by parthenocapry). They had a grant for it, now I'm curious what came of it. </p>
<p>So is the naval orange a parthenocarpy mutation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, they're as safe as the parent pepper. Pepper is pepper, there's nothing &quot;contagious&quot; about the growth abnormality.</p>
<p>Pretty much every plant we grow for food has been bred for exaggerated growth, and many plants (especially cereals) have been bred to do this extra-fruit thing on purpose. It's totally fine.</p></div>		</li>
