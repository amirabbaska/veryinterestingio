			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I will certainly get hold of Feynman's book. </p>
<p>Is there also a book you'd recommend which does go into the mathematics?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mathematical formalism used in QFT is convenient for its purpose, but not easy to grasp for laymen. I wouldn't recommend attempting to tackle its mathematical description without first getting a solid grasp of classical electrodynamics, special relativity and basic many-body quantum physics (in particular second quantization).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will echo the other reply here. The math of QFT is very esoteric and not easy to understand or use. The best path there is a solid grounding in graduate level physics -- classical field theory and quantum mechanics in particular. The Standard Model is even more complex because it relies heavily on gauge theory. As for a text explicitly on QFT, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Quantum-Student-Economy-Frontiers/dp/0813350190" target="_blank">Peskin and Schroeder</a> is a commonly used one which is oriented towards particle physics applications. You can use the preview to get an idea of what you're getting into. If it looks like gobbledygook then more prerequisite learning is necessary.</p></div>		</li>
