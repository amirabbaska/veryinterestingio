			<p>I'm not a lawyer but it's clear what's happening is not fair or legal. It's manipulating the stocks to your own advantage. You have a large amount of shares before the deal and know the client won't be getting back their investment in the end because once you've sold enough of the junk shares you sell off your own taking home the profit and leaving the clients in the dirt.</p>		</li>
