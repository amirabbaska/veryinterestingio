			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting to add to this very complete answer is that heavy water (made from deuterium) is colorless since the overtone band is shifted in the infrared, confirming that this is the origin of water blue color</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the colorless aspect, but here you can see a clear difference between normal and heavy water: <a href="http://www.dancingwithwater.com/wp-content/uploads/heavy-water.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.dancingwithwater.com/wp-content/uploads/heavy-water.jpg</a></p>
<p>(My guess is they used water which is rich in deuterium but not nearly as pure as the expensive stuff used in nuclear reactors for that picture.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Knew the top post, never knew this but it makes perfect sense with the heavier hydrogen.</p>
<p>Anyone know how semiheavy water would behave? Could you isolate it's absorption and emission spectra or would you need to process it based on a known equilibrium?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Monotone would not be the most effective camo.  Most marine life will be darker on the top of their bodies and lighter on the bottom.  So looking down on the animal the darker top matches the sea floor (going along with salishSailor red is the first color adsorbed in water so the animal would appear black/camouflaged at shallower depths.) While there underside is lighter to match the white when looking up on the animal from below it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the bright white of new snow is actually the color of the Sun (the same goes with white clouds). The scattered blue light of the sky and the yellow of the sun is combined BACK TOGETHER by the many edges of the snow crystals to the original color of the white of true sunlight. When you see blue in snow, it is because there is a lack of yellow sunlight that can penetrate as far as the blue light scattered through the snow crystals.</p></div>		</li>
