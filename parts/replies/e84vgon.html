My co-workers and I are exposed to fine and less fine dust containing all kinds of shit, most likely some heavy metals too...and it's a public secret that sterility rate in my town (built around the mine, glory to our forefathers) is higher than the rest of the country.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It being toxic is why it’s a good non-hormonal birth control. There is a copper intrauterine device that is a very effective because it’s a spermicide. It’s not dangerous to the human body itself though because the copper ions released by the IUD are a tiny amount. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, it’s not for every woman, and I can tell you first hand that the bleeding and cramps with an iud can be rough, <em>but</em> there are side effects with every birth control. For example, with hormonal birth control you can potentially gain an unhealthy amount of weight and have a hard time getting back to your original body. The bleeding generally regulates after some time, after 6 years with mine it’s not quite the same but I certainly am not worried about anemia. However, I imagine that a woman with heavy periods should maybe hesitate to have a copper IUD. In terms of copper toxicity it’s not dangerous for a woman’s reproductive system, which is why I said it isn’t dangerous. </p></div>		</li>
