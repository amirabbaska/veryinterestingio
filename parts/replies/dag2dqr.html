			<div class="markdown"><p>Cows have 11 major types. Type B has 60 different antigens (as opposed to just rhesus factor in people). Blood transfusions in cows are nearly impossible to find a donor for. Dogs have several blood types and are positive or negative for antigen, but they don't react to different blood types during transfusion and there are universal donors. Cats can be A, B or AB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans have 30 antigens, &quot;rhesus d&quot; is just the one that is a much more common issue.  There are other types of blood outside of ABO-/+. For example, you can be kell factor negative and that can be a real pain in the ass.</p>
<p>You can also be hh instead of AB or O. (The Bombay blood group.)</p>
<p>Edit- there are a few people in the world who have totally unique blood types like a man in India. They called his blood type &quot;INRA.&quot;</p>
<p>There are also 40 people in the world that don't have ANY antigens. They are called &quot;Rh null.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most species' blood types are just named in the order they're found. There isn't an universal donor, like in people. Type B cats have a lot of antigen against type A cats. Type A cats have a small amount of antigen against type B blood. So, for the very rare AB cat, you use type A blood and manage the reactions as they happen. Type B cats tend to be found mostly in specific breeds - persians, rexs, abyssinians, british shorthairs.</p>
<p>For dogs, you want a antigen negative blood type for donors and it turns out greyhounds are almost always antigen negative, so they're the go-to breed for blood banks. They're also a large breed with easily visible veins, docile and require less anesthetic than most other breeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are blood banks for dog and cat blood. Some maintain their own dog and cat colonies of either animals that were obtained from rescue or shelters or use purpose-bred animals and other use a community-based model where they have people bring in their owned dogs and collect blood and then the dogs go back home. Some hospitals will have staff pets tested and typed and will collect blood as needed if they don't have enough need to warrant keeping blood on hand. Universities tend to have blood for other species of animals.</p>
<p>Blood is almost never used for routine surgery. I would say half of our canine blood supply is given to dogs who rupture their spleens and are bleeding out into their abdomen. The rest goes to dogs with anemia (IMHA), chronic disease, trauma, parvo virus (though they get plasma generally) and a few other things. We stock canine plasma, cryoprecipitate and packed red blood cells and feline packed red blood cells, plasma and whole blood at the specialty clinic where I work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do know blood types are not limited to humans. IIRC, dogs have more than 10 blood types.</p>
<p>edit: I found a Wikipedia article on non-human blood types <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type_(non-human\)" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I'm pretty sure every mammal and person on earth has a 'blood type'. And technically so does every type of cell. Very basically, they are just different types of proteins that the immune system can recognize as self or nonself. We know more about the proteins on blood because they affect us in regards to blood transfusions, which are a fairly common medication. However, we are learning more about them in regards to tissue/skin/organ transplants. Similar things happen to proteins on tissues as proteins on blood - one person's immune system might attack the proteins on another person's tissues due to not recognizing them. It is plays a role I tumour treatments that are being developed. And bacterial infections, and everything. Something similar happens in each type of animal. </p>
