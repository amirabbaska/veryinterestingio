<p>I always thought the connection between dental health and cardiac health was simply that, folks who take good care of their teeth tend to lead healthier lifestyles (and perhaps, eat fewer sweets).</p>
<p>I did not realize there was a physical connection!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I happen to have a heart defect so must take a pre-med of antibiotic before any dental work. I recently had a severely abscessed tooth and a coinciding sinus infection which were treated with several antibiotics.  Despite this, Iâ€™ve had a constant low grade fever.  Going in next week to be checked by a cardiologist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you know if this was happening or would it just be happening constantly without your knowledge?</p>
<p>Just wondering as I have 2 teeth that need pulling but i've been delaying it and want to keep delaying it as the front of them still look nice (but decayed at the back) and i'm going to need to get dentures and all sorts when they are pulled not to look like a hillbilly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can at all afford it, get them pulled. Tooth decay is caused by bacteria, and letting all that fester in your mouth is not a good plan. Beyond the cardiac risks, tooth infections can spread through your sinuses into your brain. While admittedly rare, dying of a rotting tooth would be a sad way to go. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can afford it it just sounds painful and they need to be surgically removed and removing them may cause a hole in my sinus apparently as it runs right by the roots (Which is much more expensive to fix than getting a tooth pulled). They don't cause me any pain, food rarely gets stuck in them and if it does a tooth pick sorts it out, just the risk and pain doesn't seem to outweigh the risk of other stuff by keeping them in.</p>
<p>I can afford the root canal which i'd prefer but apparently there's not enough tooth left for there to be a good chance of any crown/cap/whatever holding even though the outward facing side is in tact so visually having them there is better to me at the moment.</p></div>		</li>
