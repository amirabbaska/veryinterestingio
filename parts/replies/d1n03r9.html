			<div class="markdown"><p>That could also be considered an <em>ad hominem</em> argument since you are arguing against the original speaker's credentials or status rather than discussing the argument itself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really a Straw Man argument because, in the guy's mind, that might actually be what he thinks the abortion debate is about. This is closer to what they call a Slippery Slope argument: That giving a little leeway on a particular debate would lead to an exaggerated result without any ability to mitigate it.</p>
<p>A Straw Man argument would be more like &quot;Oh, you're pro-choice? So you're telling me that I should abort my baby, then. Who gave you the right to decide that I should abort my baby?&quot; Because no matter how you interpret the implications or subtext of the guy's argument, that's <em>not</em> what he's saying. The person in question is building a fake argument that's easier to respond to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you've hit the nail on the head.  It's a common conciet that everyone understands your argument the way you mean it on the first go, and that anyone who does not react accordingly must be doing so intentionally to derail the conversation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this is actually a straw man, because those who hold that position quite literally believe that abortion is murder. </p>
<p>Thus, it is correct to say from their perspective that pro choice is essentially supporting the right to murder another human being.</p>
<p>It sounds like a straw man because to those who are pro choice they don't see abortion as murder and thus perceive a gross exaggeration. But again, for pro life people, it is not at all an exaggeration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Annoyingly enough, using a logical fallacy to get there doesn't necessarily mean the conclusion is wrong.</p>
<p><em>I'm going to jump off the roof and fly away.</em></p>
<p><em>My father, the well known expert underwater basket weaver, says people can't fly. You're going to fall and hurt yourself.</em></p>
<p>That's not to say they don't very often lead to wrong conclusions. But mostly what they are used for is to discount and ignore what other people have said.</p></div>		</li>
