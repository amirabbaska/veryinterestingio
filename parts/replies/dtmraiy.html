			<div class="markdown"><p>A company's strategy could easily be expansion but lose money for 5 years then dominate.  Or spend huge money on research for 5 years then bring product out and dominate.</p>
<p>If company ownership believes that a CEO will decrease amount of losses by a larger amount then their total compensation then it's a good hire.  Or if their leadership/vision is worth it in the end then they will recoup that compensation and more.</p>
<p>Look at Amazon.  They're dominating, but have known to spend immensely in order to expand/take over instead of putting away profits (I'm not 100% up on their recent strategies but this is what I've heard in the past).</p>
<p>Like everything in life, these strategies don't always work out.  Usually CEOs are extremely smart and talented people.  But  how companies and the market work are so complex that even the brightest economists in the world may be wrong at times.  Unexpected stuff happens. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every short sighted app/web entrepreneur I’ve ever met always smugly discuss how Amazon has never made a profit. This is usually when they next say how much they will make and say how little they want to pay me to do all the heavy lifting. 10/10 they go out of business within six months or never bring to market. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;In the red&quot; doesn't mean you don't have money, hell it doesn't even necessarily mean your doing anything wrong.  They have the incomes to pay their employees (a CEO and other execs are still employees).  As long as investors continue to trust that the company will profit in the long run, they will have money to pay their employees.  </p>
<p>If your question is &quot;why are they paying them <em>millions</em>?&quot; Then the answer is simply if you don't pay them a fair market value they will just leave the company and it will crash and burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not in <em>salary</em> though, right? To my understanding those &quot;millions of dollars&quot; are actually in investments and options, and the CEO otherwise makes a normal salary that they report on their income tax. They just have the option to cash out when they leave the company, taking those millions with them.</p></div>		</li>
