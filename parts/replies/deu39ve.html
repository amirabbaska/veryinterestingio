			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but a lot of people wearing mask are actually the one being sick. In China if you go to a hospital and you're coughing or have flu-like symptoms you'll be asked to wear a mask.
It is not uncommon to see people giving their seats in the subway for people wearing mask, as they are considered sick.</p></div>		</li>
