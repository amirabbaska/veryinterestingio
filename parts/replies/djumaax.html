			<div class="markdown"><p>i like to think of it this way (which is more useful if you're comfortable with at least algebra):</p>
<p>the relationship between distance, time and the speed of light is
<strong>d = ct</strong></p>
<p>normally people think that it's T that is constant in that the distance  traveled can change, and speed can change, but 1 second is 1 second.</p>
<p>but in reality, it's <strong>c</strong> that is invariant, regardless of how  you look at a photon, it's always measured to travel at the speed <strong>c</strong>, regardless of your reference frame. this causes all kinds of weird things to happen, like time dilation or length contraction. but the math has been literally tested to death: it works. </p>
<p>More practically, if relativity were wrong, the gps system in your car would not work, because time dilation needs to be accounted for to get proper measurements - if time dilation were ignored, your gps would drift something like 20-30 feet per day. </p>
<p>so anyone who uses GPS in your car, you're proving einstein right there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This cuts right to heart of my inability to understand relativity. I hope someone can answer this for me:</p>
<p>Let's say I have a light source exactly 1 AU from me, and a method to exactly measure the time it takes between the light activating and me observing it.</p>
<p>In our time reference on earth, it takes approximately 8 minutes. For simplicity, let's say it takes exactly 8 minutes 0 seconds (I know it's really a little more than that).</p>
<p>Now let's say that for whatever reason, I exist at a point of reference where time is experienced at 1/2 the rate it is here. Will the light still take 8 minutes for me to observe it?</p>
<p>Now say both myself and the light source are moving at .9999c. Will I observe the light in 8 minutes? Or will it take significantly longer for me to observe it?</p>
<p>To put it another way, if a photon had awareness or intelligence, it should be impossible for it to ever observe another photon moving along the same vector... right?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the replies so far. I think my real problem grasping the concept is this: &quot;c&quot; is a constant, but we define c as a speed/velocity, which distance divided by time. My background is much more in Newtonian physics/engineering where distance and time are always fixed units. Thinking of time as a variable is an extremely unintuitive concept to grasp, but these replies are helpful.</p></div>		</li>

<p>With you so far.</p>

<p>This is not as clear. The amount of time that passes within any inertial frame of reference over the course of one minute is always one minute.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as an &quot;objective&quot; frame of reference in relativity: frames of reference can only be compared to each other.  The only difference between two inertial frames of reference (which is enough for what we're talking about here) is the difference in velocity between the two.  <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Relativ/tdil.html" target="_blank">This link</a> has a calculator that shows how much time dilation occurs given the difference in speed between two frames.  To double the amount of time in one frame as compared to the other, one of the frames must be moving at almost .9c.  As in the linked example with muons, the muons count 2.2 micro seconds as they decay.  We count 22 microseconds because there is such a difference in velocity between us and the muons.</p>
<p>Therefore, your question can be &quot;how long would it take for light to reach me from my point of view if I were moving at .9c toward or away from a light source 1AU away&quot;.  I'm gonna pick away.</p>
<p>Remember how there's no such thing as an objective frame of reference?  That's important.  The question now can be rephrased as &quot;how long would it take light to reach me if a star 1AU away were flying away from me at .9c&quot;.  Well, I'm standing still, and the star is that far away, and light moves at c, so 8 minutes is the answer.  The interesting piece is that, since we defined our time dilation to be 2, the frequency change in the light is really dramatic.  In fact, the frequency in this star's light is going to be cut in half.  If it were moving toward us, it would be doubled.  </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, you're moving in the same direction as the star.  There is no objective &quot;still&quot; frame of reference.  You and the star have no difference between you in speed or direction, you are therefore locked into the same frame of reference.  The star is 1AU away, light moves at c, you will see it in 8 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a different can of worms.  The way relativity works, you can talk about perception within frames of reference approaching c.  you could repeat the nine in .9999999*c as much as you want and the math would work.  The moment you actually get to c (can't, because for particles with any amount of mass, you require infinite net energy consumption to get there), that time dilation formula puts a zero in the denominator and the time elapsed is undefined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can answer your last question. Two photons moving along the same vector with some finite distance/time between them can never interact. <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/188859/what-is-a-null-geodesic" target="_blank">Take a look at this explanation, specifically the light cone</a>. Light moves along a null geodesic, or rather the surface of the edge of the cone. </p>
<p>If you were to superimpose another light cone that is spatially separated at the same time as this light cone (or, equivalently, only time-separated and still at the spatial origin), then if you have two photons moving along the same path about the light cone, they will always be separated by the same 4D distance. Therefore, they will never interact, ceteris paribus.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What do you mean by this? Do you mean a frame of reference (not point)? In that case, where are you and which direction are you headed?</p></div>		</li>

<p>ignoring the practicality of space travel, fuel costs, and all that, one could in theory travel to andromeda galaxy and back in a spaceship that accellerated constantly at 9.8m/s^2, or 1G, in 56 years, internal clock time. </p>
<p>...you'd be travelling at a fair percentage of the speed of light however, so when you got back, the earth will have aged 4 million years. </p>
<p>so you can travel in time into the future, relative to the speed of a rest clock. </p>
<p>but as far as we can tell, you <strong>CANNOT</strong> travel <em>backwards</em> in time. although weirdly enough, relativity doesn't disallow it! it's not the physics of gravity that prevents time travel, and this is a source of great debate - what determines the 'arrow of time', so to speak. personally, i think it's Entropy - the natural tendancy for a closed system to tend towards disorder, but there are folks who think this is an effect, not the underlying cause. so who knows! maybe, time is an illusion, and we all exist in a 4-dimensional spacetime where our tiny human minds can only comprehend one slice at a time. then travelling backwards in time would be meaningless. or maybe, nature abhors a time paradox, and only universes where none are created are universes that can exist, so while time travel is not mathematically impossible, in practice it will never happen. </p>
<p>this is one of those questions like 'what is really going on with the electron before the wave function collapse'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  Wavelength is independent of number of photons. Each photon has a wavelength however that wavelength can change due to interactions and shifting. Wavelength is kind of like the energy level of the photon. </p></div>		</li>
