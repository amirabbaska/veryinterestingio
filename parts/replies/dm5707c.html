			<div class="markdown"><p>How do we know of the morphine actually relieved any pain for the bees?</p>
<p>We don't. Theoretically if it did relieve pain the bees should of consumed more.
The control groups consumed the same amount of surcrose with morphine as the bees with the pinched legs </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's likely the morphine doesn't relieve pain or it could be the bees don't feel pain, or it could be both? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume it wouldn't actually, given the dissimilarity in toxicity of many chemicals between insects and mammals. Even birds don't appear to be affected by capsicum (the &quot;hot&quot; chemical in spicy peppers) the way humans do, or at all. Many birds happily eat peppers that we humans find to be very spicy without any apparent effect.</p>
<p>More to the point, many insecticides are amazingly toxic to insects in minute levels, and barely toxic to humans in far greater quantities. Empirically, that tells me drugs don't affect insects the way they affect humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Invertebrates ranging from unicellular organisms to insects have been shown to contain opiate-like peptides and binding sites, and they exhibit biological responses to opiates. However, critical genetic data are lacking. It is not known how signal systems arise phylogenetically, but it is conceivable that signal molecules that are already present cause the formation of their own receptors from membrane proteins.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was my question, a human who was injured wouldn't be drawn to a glass of water with morphine in it if a) he didn't know then morphine was in there and b) he didn't know it had pain relieving properties.  I didn't follow the link, but this seems like a poor experiment and inconclusive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After you tried both glasses, you would definitely learn really fast that one of them reliefs your pain.</p>
<p>If morphine would have an affect on bees, and they would feel pain, they would learn that too.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then the bees would have to be able to correlate less pain with drinking more of the morphine solution. Can bees draw that conclusion? And do we know if bees can draw that conclusion when (I assume since it's ingested) the pain relieve isn't instant due to first reaching the stomache?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wondered the same thing, until I got to the part that mentioned that the hurt bees consumed more of both solutions than the bees that weren't hurt. So either each bee consumed more of both, or some bees consumed more sucrose and some bees consumed more morphine; you would expect that after trying the morphine solution, bees would consume more of it than the sucrose, whether that's across bees or in individuals, but it isn't what the results show.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To flip some of these results over, it should be added that newborns are given sucrose as pain relief, and it is effective at this. It seems to work via a non opiod route, and I don't believe we know much more than that. </p>
<p>The next question is do bees have opiod receptors, which it appears they do. Current models of other insects like drosophila absolutely do and it is a well conserved set of proteins. But are they related to pain relief, or do they have another purpose; that is still unknown. </p>
<p>So it is possible that the bees are using a primitive pain relief system, using sucrose. And we know this exists as it works for neeonates. </p>
<p>It is however, a massively difficult question to answer, despite it seeming easy. </p></div>		</li>

They did it for my daughter almost 4 years ago, but by last September when my son was born they told me they had abandoned it. Different hospitals, so who knows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter had to be hospitalized for a short time after she was born and the sucrose was amazing. Every time they drew blood they had a little capsule with sucrose they had her suck on and it was like she didn't even know a sharp pointy object was being pushed through her skin. This was 18mo ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there any studies that explain how sucrose works in infants? If it's administered orally, my immediate thought would be that A) it's something pleasant and B) it's something distracting. That seems far more likely than any sort of sucrose pain suppression mechanism.</p>
<p>If it's administered intravenously, I'm totally wrong obviously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was told by my son's NICU Dr (in 2006) that the sucrose water was a distraction from the pain, but it didn't actually 'relieve' pain.  It isn't ever administered through IV that I'm aware of.  They put the sugar water in a bottle nipple and let him suck on it while doing painful procedures.  </p></div>		</li>
