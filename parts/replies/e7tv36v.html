			<div class="markdown"><p>I went from 18mg to 0mg vaping. One thing I will say, don't try nicotine salts that nonsense is like crack as far as kickstarting your nicotine addiction. Another thing, going from 18mg to 3mg wasn't honestly that difficult. 3mg to 0mg was much trickier. You don't feel the comforting sting in the back of your throat that comes with nicotine. It makes the 0 nic eliquid less desirable and more difficult to stick with. Once you are set on 9 nic quitting is actually quite easy because the 0 nic isn't fulfilling the urge the same way.</p>
<p>After hitting 0nic I stopped completely shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Granted I have since begun again at 3mg after starting a new vastly more stressful job, but I'm in the process of being completely off again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a similar situation to yours.  I quit smoking cigs about 5 years ago and started vaping 12mg.  Took me about 6 months to go from 12mg to 3mg, and been stuck at 3mg ever since.  Every once in a while I try 0 but it just doesn't work.</p></div>		</li>
