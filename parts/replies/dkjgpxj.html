			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not particularly intuitive. Basically, when a wave component parallel to the surface is reflected, the direction doesn't change. But when the other component (perpendicular to the parallel component, but only partially perpendicular to the surface) reflects, the direction does change. In this partially perpendicular component, sin(theta) is parallel and cos(theta) is perpendicular.</p>
<p>Next, you need to understand that electromagnetic waves are basically two electrical and magnetic waves perpendicular to each other oscillating at the same frequency. So if one of them is parallel to the surface, the other is partially perpendicular.</p>
<p>So finally you assign either the magnetic or electrical wave to be parallel to the surface and create two equations that sum the magnitudes to 0 for the two different types of reflections. Because the magnitudes of the electrical and magnetic waves are related to each other by another equation, you can solve the system of equations for both the reflected and refracted magnitudes.</p>

<p>In short, those ratios are the only possible solution to balance out the electrical and magnetic fields at the boundary from the incident, reflected, and refracted waves.</p></div>		</li>
