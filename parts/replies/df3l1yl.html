			<div class="markdown"><p>Why wouldn't they do that? They certainly have the scale and resources to do more in depth analytics than black listing, and wouldn't black list lightly, because those IPs can be recycled at any time to huge groups of legitimate customers. </p>
<p>It's not an easy problem, and it's unlikely that Netflix is approaching it without putting a lot of thought into it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can tell they are not doing that because, you can test it yourself as see they are not doing any of that. </p>
<p>There are several VPNs that get past Netflix. My popular commercial VPN will not work but, why work VPN and my VPS will work on netfix(Those IP are not going to be in any known ranges) they are not doing any sort of packet testing( Again you could easly get around that) </p>
<p>Fingerprinting would not work because mainly people just use a VPN to around geo-blocking and are not the traditional security mined people they don't have ghostery or any of that other stuff. Not to mention this would only create more false positives. They are not looking for people that are likely to use a VPN at some point  But people using a VPN RIGHT NOW. I can turn off and on my VPN and see Netflix block and unblock me. Nothing other than my IP is changing. I don't see IP recycling to be a big issue, The IP ranges of the VPN servers are not going to be be home IPs any time soon. A quick call to customer services could clear that up if it ever happens.  </p>
<p>Biggest point is this. Sure they have the resource to do that but why spend all that Time, money and resources when they could just do a simple IP filter? It is the most cheaper option. Netfix dose not really care about people using VPNs, they were just forced to do something by studio heads. Netfix just wants the cheapest way to keep the corporate layers happy a very basic IP filter dose that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't system time and IP address time not matching factor into that as well? There's DNS leakage too I would imagine. Not sure if Netflix gets that in depth though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a small scale, yes, latency differentials in time and dns could betray the use of a VPN service. I imagine that it's mostly noise in the grand scheme of latency to their service though, so if they account for it they would weigh more heavily on other metrics first. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is everyone here saying Netflix can detect VPNs? I have been using a VPN to access the US Netflix for many years now, never had any issues and it still works flawlessly. </p>
<p>What are people talking about?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They most certainly can. I'm a US user and usually forget I even have a VPN until I try to load Netflix and it tells me to turn it off. Some providers are more easily detectable than others. </p></div>		</li>
