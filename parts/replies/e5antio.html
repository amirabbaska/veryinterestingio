			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question! I wouldn’t think so. I am a speech language pathologist with a background in sign language and I am working to educate myself about dyslexia. From what I understand, the reading difficulties arise from the brains ability to process written letters with corresponding sounds, which includes perceiving the letter, quickly recalling what sound(s) it can make, and stringing the sounds together to make a word. This is why it is difficult for someone with dyslexia to read and write.</p>
<p>In the case of sign languages, Most signs in the lexicon or “word bank” are whole words. There are occasionally words that don’t have a sign, so they are spelled out using the manual alphabet. Names are often spelled too. In this case, they might have trouble decoding the word being spelled out, but as with any other miscommunications, there are other ways to get the message across. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm.  I remember being told that sign language encodes like a spoke language, not a written one.  I'm mildly dyslexic, but I don't have any issues with spoken language.  </p>
<p>Thinking about it as I write this, someone above pointed out the difference between ASL and SEE (signed exact english).  I wonder if dyslexia would show up in SEE while being absent in ASL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To pose an even deeper question. It's being shown that the brain parts that cause the disconnect that results in dyslexia are made up in [strengths](<a href="https://dyslexiaida.org/success-stories-2/" target="_blank">https://dyslexiaida.org/success-stories-2/</a> of other things). Such as spacial awareness and the like. I wonder if a deaf person that Would have the wiring for dyslexia have the same 'super power,' like enhanced spatial awareness, and not the issue with reading and writing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it bears repeating that any sign language is a <em>language</em>, like Spanish or Japanese, and that the differences between spoken and sign languages, at least from the point of view of the linguists, are ultimately pretty superficial. There's a lot of quackery on this topic owed to studies with Nim (the chimp) and Koko (the gorilla), for example. But what <em>humans</em> do with sign language has to do with grammar and constructs of syntax, not just vague association – just like what we're doing right now. It would be very surprising if a totally different set of mental faculties were involved.</p></div>		</li>

<p>SLP student here. Do you have any back up for this?
From my understanding, babble is a precursor of speech, a way of playing with sounds and orofacial muscles in search for new combinations of sounds. As such, it occurs <em>before</em> the first word/sign even comes out.</p>
<p>Deaf babies (6mo) will also do some sound experimenting but, since they cannot hear their own productions, will stop. This is one of the major signs that something is wrong with the baby's hearing.</p>
<p>So i must be missing something here, do you refer to &quot;babble&quot; as muttering during sleep, after the first year?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’ve read that experts typically dismiss claims of linguistic ability among apes as wishful thinking and cherry picking on behalf of the researchers who work with them, but at the same time I’ve seen videos of both Nim and Koko doing things that look remarkably like thoughtful communication to my admittedly completely untrained eyes. </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Language&quot; can mean different things depending on the context, but there has never been any compelling evidence of any animals outside our own species using &quot;language&quot; in the sense that people do: constructing and parsing syntax with an infinite range of possible meaning. For example, for Nim, it was about a 50/50 toss up that you'd get &quot;Nim eat&quot; vs. &quot;eat Nim.&quot; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>thoughtful communication</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They may well be doing thoughtful communication, especially considering that it turned out many these subjects were smart enough to manipulate their handlers. Communication, however, is not language in the sense discussed here. Bees have an intricate communication system, but you won't be having any conversations with them. There is a finite range for what the waggle dance can communicate. To loosely paraphrase Noam Chomsky, there's about as much chance that other primates are waiting for us to teach them to talk as there is of a species of flightless birds off on some remote island waiting for graduate students to come and teach them to fly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, while apes can learn signs, they can't link them together in a language.  The signs they learn stand for specific things, so even if they use two signs together, it's not linked like language is linked.  None of them have ever asked a question of another person, which some see as the hallmark of language.</p>
<p>With Koko, her caretaker was utterly enmeshed with her.  She refused to teach Koko's form of &quot;language&quot; to outsiders, would not have people fluent in sign language try to talk to her.  Koko was obsessed with nipples, and the people working with her were forced to show her their nipples, male or female (and that is a separate issue from the quackery).  There was an old Aol chat where the researcher pretending to be asking Koko questions, and Koko kept on signing nipple and the researcher (her caretaker) was saying &quot;Oh, nipple sounds like people that's why she's signing it.&quot;  Nearly all the &quot;signs&quot; that apes have used revolve around food, which is unsurprisingly.  They may link some signs together like &quot;feed food&quot; but that, again, isn't language.  Language requires things like grammar (which all signed languages have) and not a single ape was able to do that.  Something like &quot;feed food&quot; is the equivalent of your dog pawing at you at dinnertime.  It's just a gesture that means they want to eat, rather than your dog sitting there and asking &quot;Can you feed me?&quot;</p>
<p>Additionally none of this has been reproducible in any other ape.  Koko learned a lot of signs, but there's also a dog that has learned a thousand words.  No one believes the dog knows language.</p>

<p>... with the non-obvious caveat (that gets this partially into circular-logic territory) that not every form of sign <em>communication</em> is a sign <em>language</em>.</p>
<p>Like, soldiers, police or SCUBA divers can have sign <em>codes</em> to communicate important things voicelessly, but those have very little grammatical structure, so we don't count them as languages.</p>
<p>Signing that's clearly more language-like than that is... a language.</p></div>		</li>

<p>... It's not really even a caveat because it applies just as much to spoken language. Not every form of verbal communication is verbal language, either.</p></div>		</li>
