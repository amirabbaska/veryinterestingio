			<div class="markdown"><p>If you read the Sci-fi series &quot;The Golden Age&quot; by John C Wright, they discover the &quot;Island of stability&quot; actually exists and create entirely new elements. They create a star ship to do exactly that, sail into the core of a star. It's a great series: </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the OP was asking about viscosity - something I'd like to know too. Your density answer is interesting, yet I don't see how density relates to  &quot;soft or hard&quot;.  For example Mercury is very dense but a liquid, and aeorgels have nearly the density of air, but are solids.  Technically, I believe soft/hard is measured as Durometer (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shore_durometer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shore_durometer</a>).  However since the sun is a plasma, I don't think durometer applies either.  So we are left with viscosity, which I'd envision as &quot;what kind of resistance would you get if you passed your hand through some sun&quot; (ignoring temperature, pressure, etc.).  All sources I've found for this question are way over my head - anyone have a good approximate answer?</p></div>		</li>

<p>All this talk about the sun etc and I thought you were talking about the planet for a minute! </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the reply I was looking for, thanks. The post you replied to bothered me for the same reason.</p>
<p>By the way, I was confused at first when you claimed Mercury was a liquid.. until I realized you were talking about the metal, not the planet. The metal should not be capitalized. Funnily enough, you made the opposite mistake with the Sun (failing to capitalize it when you should have), but this one is far more common and not at all ambiguous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sun is like a cloud at its outer layers, from afar it looks like it has a definite boundary, but in reality it is just an ever decreasing density of gas. And also, although the temperature is very high, the energy density is low since the mass density is low. So you would feel very little if you could somehow organise to wave your hand around in the solar corona.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So then the pressure on the core is what causes it to be so dense?  If that is the case, then if there were less pressure, would that decrease the density of the core material?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Pressure is due to gravitational attraction and the temperature caused by fusion; you can't lower the pressure without finding a way to cool the sun down (and to overcome gravity), and you can't cool the sun down without first addressing the pressure that causes it to undergo nuclear fusion. Its a vicious cycle, really. As long as you get together enough stuff that has a net positive heat delta when undergoing nuclear fusion, you'll get yourself a star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature doesn't cause (Edit: an increase in) pressure (unless you have a gas inside a sealed container). It's the other way around: Increasing pressure creates heat, but that heat can radiate away.</p>
<p>In the sun's case, the heat actually reduces pressure, by making the sun literally inflate. Without that heat, it would collapse (followed very shortly by a supernova).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I would say so given that it's vicious enough to cause spontaneous nuclear fusion.</p></div>		</li>
