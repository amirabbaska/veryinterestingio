			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually think, that instead of making the computer look x levels deep or be given x seconds to make a move, it would make for a much more humanly play if the computer on top of those two programming strategies could also be given some kind of percentage likelyhood of choosing one of the variations it has calculated. I don't want a chess computer which chooses the best variation/move 9 out of 10 times and then making a weird non human/computer move. I want it to, giving it's level setting, to perhaps choose the best variation/move 50% of the times and then the second best variation/move 30% of the time and so on. Of course when moves are obvious (takes), this shouldn't be an unbendable rule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the games Deep Blue won was off of this. Apparently after taking so much time analysing positions it could not figure out what to do and just defaulted to a random move. Gary saw the move and decided &quot;it/they&quot; clearly knew something he didn't so he conceded. </p>
<p>Turns out the move Deep Blue made was very, very bad.</p></div>		</li>
