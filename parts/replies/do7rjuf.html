			<div class="markdown"><p>Went through this for 2 years. Just had terrible stomach issues, I would always explain that it would only hurt me at night. I guess nighttime was when my anxiety would kick in, when I had nothing to distract me.</p>
<p>Had countless tests done, endoscopy. Absolutely nothing. Not a single doctor even questioned me about anxiety &amp; frankly I myself would've never though anything of it.</p>
<p>It all started when I got extremely ill roughly 2 1/2 years ago. I still suffer &quot;PTSD&quot; symptoms. Anytime I think of those times when I was sick or even think about getting sick, I get intense anxiety. Sometimes I even have severe shakes in the middle of the night. </p>
<p>It sucks, but once I realized what the issue was, it became much more manageable. Before, I used to just think I was constantly sick. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, had the same problems when I was a kid. It's crazy how the consequences of mental disorders can manifest themselves as all kinds of confusing physical symptoms. If you see one specialist after the next for different issues, they will most likely be trying to rule out acute and more urgent problems like infections, cancer, autoimmune disorders, etc...so it's hard to get a PTSD/Anxiety diagnosis without going through the gauntlet of tests. Depression is similar as well. This is why people who stigmatize and downplay mental illness make me fucking furious. It's so ignorant and offensive. It's like telling somebody with ALS to just deal with it and start walking again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best explanation. I have GAD and Post-partum depression. I was undiagnosed before pregnancy and the hormones exacerbated my every anxious moment to the point they were afraid I had post partum psychosis at 8mos pregnant. Zoloft and house visits from a state therapist. Meds helped the first year but after 18mos on 200mg it just stopped. Switched to Prozac and I haven't felt this good in years. My family is thankfully really supportive (with the exception of my youngest brother who thinks eating salads and &quot;deciding&quot; to be happy will cure me)</p></div>		</li>
