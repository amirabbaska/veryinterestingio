			<div class="markdown"><p>You should actually add another account to your OS for your 8 year old.</p>
<p>That will prevent what you descriped above, as the history is user based, aswell as being able to restrict the installation of new programs, and of course being able to install programs just for yourself, instead of globally.</p>
<p>You can remove his admin rights (he shouldn't miss it) and you have better control over what is installed for him to use. In return, he can customize his own experience by having his own desktop and other customization options set.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, putting users who can do damage and don't know what they are doing on a limited user account is the best thing you can do for someone. ie: grandparents, older parents, small children. Unless you want to be playing IT guy/girl/helicopter* every time they break something because they wanted a free ipad.</p>
<p>Edit: Now more inclusive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct.  Absolutely correct.  I agree with you.</p>
<p>My wife is something of a pain in my ass.  I have tried this sort of thing in the past.  As soon as she has to enter a password to log onto the home computer all hell breaks loose.</p>
<p>I can't get the 8 year old to use a password unless the entire house is password protected.</p>
<p>As it stands, I keep a close on eye on what the kid is doing.  If she did break something I have resources for fixing it - including restoring the computer from a weekly backup that I run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just tell your wife that someone at work was telling you about a virus going around that shows porn and you want to make a separate account so that your child is protected. The administrator account password doesn't have to be complicated.</p></div>		</li>
