<p>replay the dream you were having in your head. Maybe even write it down. You'll notice it isn't actually that scary at all. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This morning I had a nightmare that I was at work, which is in a really tall building facing the water. We all started to feel a rumbling, and we were mildly concerned that it was a small earthquake, but brushed it off for a few minutes. Then suddenly the water in the bay rose up higher than our building, like a huge wall, and started moving towards us. It was pretty clear that there was no fucking way anyone would survive. That's pretty goddamn terrifying for a dream or real life!</p>
<p>But yeah, your explanation is a good one. At least, it seems like it makes good sense to someone with no previous familiarity with anything you explained.</p></div>		</li>

<p>'It reminds me of Numenor,' said Faramir, and wondered to hear himself speak.  </p>
<p>'Of Numenor?' said Eowyn.  </p>
<p>'Yes,' said Faramir, 'of the land of Westernesse that foundered, and of the great dark wave climbing over the green lands and above the hills, and coming on, darkness unescapable. I often dream of it.'</p></div>		</li>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus" target="_blank">hippocampus</a> is the key bit of information in there. A lot of the things I said about it are actually known with a very high degree of certainty, especially it's dual association with both memory formation and emotions. </p>
<p>The dream parts were more conjectural <em>when</em> I read about them, between 5~10 or so years ago. Things might have changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can only venture guesses. But my guess would be that lucid dreaming is about training your brain to recognize a) when it is in a dream, and b) having agency.</p>
<p>Brains are tremendously plastic. Blind people learn to see using clicks of their tongues. So I don't see why you wouldn't be able to train your brain to do something otherwise completely &quot;useless&quot; like lucid dreaming. </p></div>		</li>
