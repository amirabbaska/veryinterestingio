			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to fabrics changing, our lifestyle has largely changed. Most people work office jobs or other positions where they aren't going to get extremely dirty and more people opt to pay others to do landscaping, home repair and car maintenance. Detergent companies can provide weaker products that meet our modern needs and make more profit too.</p>
<p>Powder detergent is still produced for people who do sirty jobs and have greater stain-removing needs. Powder detergent is still the gold standard if you really need to clean clothes. Make sure you follow the instructions though, as others have stated you can ruin clothes or also damage your skin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're partly right. Yes people where burning holes in their clothes with said detergent, but that was because they didn't keep to the recommended dose, way less than they were used to. </p>
<p>So the consumers were the problem, not the cleaning agent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blaming the customer for a failed product is meaningless, though, isn’t it? The manufacturers could have designed a container that dispenses the correct dose with a pump, or they could’ve included a right-sized cup to pour the detergent into. Or they could have advertised it more effectively. I️ don’t know, I️ wasn’t alive for half the 80s — but there were probably ways around it that weren’t utilized. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not in this context. The original statement was that these detergents damage the clothing they are used on, to which the response was that it wasn't the detergent, it was the dose. </p>
<p>I think you're both right - the customer was the issue, and these days, we'd probably just make a more diluted product with a pump top or so. </p></div>		</li>
