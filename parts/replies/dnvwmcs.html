			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best perspective to have on nuclear fusion. Energy density of the sun is less than a compost heap. It's the suns size that allows it maintain fusion. It's clearly going to be hard to do fusion on a small scale (actually should really say a extremely tiny scale) because it's the size of the sun that is the factor.</p>
<p>Fission in the other hand is much easier because thanks to an exploding sun, energy was packed into an atom, we just have to unlock it. We do it in hundreds of locations around the world everyday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Power is the flow of energy over time so that requires you to first get the energy out and use it so power-density is more a factor of the machine (complete system) than the fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but a key difference between the sun and a fusion reactor is that the sun fuses ordinary hydrogen via the proton-proton chain, which has an extremely slow reaction rate. That's why the sun sips its fuel and lasts for billions of years. A reactor would use deuterium + tritium which reacts millions of times faster. </p>
<p>Most of the time two hydrogen nuclei (protons) fuse in the sun, they just pop back apart. Once in awhile, the diproton spits out a positron, one of the protons becomes a neutron, making it deuterium, which almost immediately fuses with another proton into helium. So in reactors we cut out the middle man and just start with the deuterium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if it has less energy density, how do we ever expect to produce meaningful power?  Are we simply trying to speed up fusion?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're better off asking one of the other top-level commenters here, but I believe you are correct.  I wish I had more to say, but in short, yes, if fusion is to be a viable energy source, it must take place millions of times faster than it does in the core of the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fusion we're trying to achieve on earth is different from that in the sun. We want to fuse ready-made heavy isotopes of hydrogen such as deuterium and tritium, whereas in the sun protons actually have to get converted into neutrons to make those heavier isotopes, and then the heavier isotopes have to find each other in a sea of light hydrogen. In addition, ITER, for example, is expected to reach temperatures something like 10x that of the solar core.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's more complicated than that. We know how to speed up fusion, quite a lot in fact; we've done it before. It's called a hydrogen bomb.</p>
<p>The problem is speeding up fusion <em>just enough</em> so that we can profitably harvest energy from it as a sensible pace, and to do so in a safe and sustainable manner, and to do so in an economically sensible way. That's a lot of competing issues.</p></div>		</li>
