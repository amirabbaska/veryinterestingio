			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this anecdotally. Also I would add that when we overhear speech in general, even if it is not being spoken to us, if the speaking party is able to communicate a point to someone else, I think we view that as a &quot;successful&quot; version of speech. So if I overhear someone with a certain way of speaking that I think does better than my way to illustrate a point I will often catch myself having stolen it. </p>
<p>I think this is a really interesting question and I feel that very little of our speech pattern is ours but some amalgamation of many. again, anecdotally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation holds up on a socio-linguistic level as well. Learning a dialect and beginning to imitate it is an integral part of the language learning process that we as human beings are preprogrammed to do. Copying a speech pattern in your mother tongue follows similar steps as learning a foreign language does. The more time spent surrounded by the linguistic culture', the more apt one becomes at mimicking the speech patterns until it is a natural part of how we speak.</p>
<p>What is particularly interesting is our ability to 'code-switch', which just means changing the speech patterns depending on the cultural situation you find yourself in. The simple explanation is that you don't necessarily speak to your close friends the same way you would your boss. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The better you are at adapting your language to fit the recipients language, the better they will be able to perceive it the way you meant for it to be perceived.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very well said and the reason why cultural literacy is such an important component in, well, learning to be human really. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is very interesting and it reminds me alot of my cousin, who is very socially awkward because he just doesn't adapt to the situation or social groups is in.
We are both around 30 and I sometimes get some complains that he is weird and I try to bail him out since pretty much middle school, explaining people that he is just like that, he doesnt do or say anything on purpose and that sometimes, his lack of reaction to some news or events are not a sign of disrespect or that he doesnt care.
I try to tell people, he is very genuine, that the guy you see here is the guy he is and he is always like that, no matter the context or situation.
He doesnt adapt his topics of conversation no matter what, Ive seen him start discussions about Star Wars with people that clearly have no idea what Star Wars is...or going on for half an hour about WW2 around christmas, while ever1 was showing nono interest in that and were clearly trying to dodge the conversation.</p>
<p>The ability to 'code-switch', that you mentioned, he is the absolute opposite! He never adjusts how he talks, no matter who he talks too, he is informal to ever1 but not the most kind of informal...its hard to explain in english for me! But what happens regurally for him (even tho he doesnt even notice) he ends up being to informal for some people he should be more formal and respectfull and then end up sounding to formal and stuck up during a night out for beers with some buddies of mine...
He is also a loud speaker everytime and he when around people who use some unusual slang or particular accent, instead of roll with ir or atleast ignore it, I have seen mentioning it...
One day, I have seen him calling out a friend of a friend of mine who was always saying the same word, it doesnt make sense if I translate it, but the best comparison I can make are they guys who keep saying &quot;Duuude&quot; Dude this, dude that, dude to agree, dude to disagree...my cousin, meeting this person that night, ended up asking him why he kept repeating dude...</p>
<p>Maybe I side tracked a lot here and my cousin obviously has more social problems, than just adptating to is speech pattern accordingly but imo, it is interesting to see that people like my cousin, who I know for a fact that is not an asshole, he is just like that, &quot;he doesnt mean nothing by it&quot;...are actually more authentic in way and end up not being rewarded and even excluded for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happens to me! It started a few years ago when I started to date my now fiancee. But it fades out!
She is orginally from the country side and her dad and brothers are, I dont want to say hillbillies because they trully are not, but they are rough and a bit rude (not in a bad way)...eventho they all have academic education and one of them actually lives in a big city they never lost their &quot;rude demeanor&quot;...they insult each other all the time, and now me, they swear a lot, they curse watching sports like no1 I ever saw...you get the idea!
I was never a guy to curse a lot vocally, sometimes if I get mad or the situation in front of me is really ridiculous I can trow a fuck or two and occasionally &quot;shiiit&quot;, but its not common for me.
But when I spend some time with them, like 2 days in a row, vacations, holydays, etc, I end up cursing alot more, insulting them back and its not like Im trying to fit in or doing it on purpose it just happens...it was actually my fiancee who brought it to my attention after the 1st christmas I spent with them.
The next day, I start to adjust, still trowing more fucks than I normally would and then it fades out...</p></div>		</li>
