			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally agree. I was a restaurant dishwasher in a former life and I can confirm, you have got to put the dishes in there pretty much already clean. As you say, the machine just gives them a final rinse and gets them REALLY hot, so when you pull the tray back out, they are dry in 2-3 min. </p>
<p>A home dishwasher on the other hand can take a fair bit of food still stuck to things and wash it all off. For example dried on stuff has time to get wet, soften up, and fall off. In a commercial unit there isn't enough time for this. If you put plates into a commercial unit with thick gravy still on them, it will just cook it on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Years ago I used to do banquets in a newly built conference center and every chance I got I'd work dish pit. The machine could wash 3 racks at once in 3 and a half minutes. The best part? Built in garburator, no pre rinse necessary. In that time the machine would run through a pre wash, wash, rinse while running the garbutator, sanitize and finish with hot air jets as the racks are slowly pushed out the other side. Remember those nasty burnt pans you always wished you could just make disappear instead of scrubbing? Soak em for 20 min in hot water and throw them through the dishwasher twice and you could pass them off as new from the supplier.</p>
<p>This kind of makes me miss dishwashing. Put on the music, shut off the brain and just wash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes and no. A residential dishwasher can clean off a bit of mashed potatoes, and gravy and perhaps a few grains of rice without a problem. Pretty much anything that is going to dissolve and go down the drain ok, But anything bigger than a pea is not going to go down the drain, so you end up having to clean it out of the little trap in the bottom of the dishwasher.If you let enough crap go into that trap before cleaning it out, eventually it will plug it and you have a real mess on your hands. That said, a quick rinse is about all it takes, I have known people who would basically fully clean dishes, with soap, and then put them in the machine, and that is a waste of time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on your dishwasher! I'm visiting my grandma right now... her old washer gets clogged and the filter has to be taken out and cleaned or even the tubes purged if you aren't through. My newer one at home, a very mid-grade model, can take quite a bit of stuck on grime with no problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or if the asshole restaurant that you work at leaves dishes to crust up overnight for you.  </p>
<p>I remember my first job I was a dishwasher at a chinese place and every Friday when i had my shift from 5-8, I'd come in and there would be a literal wall of plates waiting for me.  No one else bothered to do dishes unless they were absolutely out of a certain kind, in which case they'd wash enough to get them by, which was usually 1 at a time.  </p>
<p>Food from the lunch special would be waiting for me, dry and hard as a rock, stuck to every single plate, exacerbated by the pressure of 300 plates sitting on each other.  </p>
<p>I'd get there, fucking go to town, and the time the dishwasher took was my <strong>bottleneck</strong>.  I'd be sitting there waiting for it to finish, and then more dishes would arrive in the back.  1/4 of the dishes would always have shit stuck to it so I'd sit there and try to rinse them better, but then I'd get bitched at for taking too long to rinse.  The chinese manager would always come to me and 'show me how do it' and just spray the shit out of it with burning hot water, quite literally threw it into the rack, and went to the other one.</p>
<p>I took out his plates and they looked exactly like mine, crusted and dirty still.</p>
<p>I ended up quitting like a month after starting.  I had a <strong>single</strong> shift at 5-8 on Fridays, with occasional call-ins on the weekdays, but man that job really sucked.  Occasionally, I 'helped' the sushi person which entailed me walking back and forth from the sushi bar to the back kitchen to grab things for the sushi chef.  It was the easiest thing in the world compared to dish washing and I only did this like once or twice but it made me wonder if they were willing to pay someone to do that job, why they didn't just get a second fucking dishwasher.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say this. I was 16 and learned this in vocational culinary school. I had a summer job washing high volumes of dishes from a cafeteria and the team leader argued with me I was wrong, it's a dish washer, not a sanitizer. Escalated to the manager to make sure I wasn't doing my job wrong by scrubbing the hell out of all the pots, pants, plates, silverware and I was right. </p>
<p>My home dishwasher though, that thing can get rid of bits of food like a mofo compared to the high temp quick sanitizers. This was like 20 years ago so maybe the tech has changed. I can't say for sure. </p></div>		</li>
