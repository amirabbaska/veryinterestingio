			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd vote for renaming &quot;double-u&quot; to &quot;wub&quot;. So many syllables would be saved when reading URLs out loud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>wub wub wub dot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>versus</p>
<blockquote>
<p>double you double you double you dot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which sounds better?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not &quot;wub&quot;, then &quot;wumbo&quot; is the next choice on my list</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I also proposed &quot;wumbo.&quot; Sure, not as many syllables are saved, but it does pay respect to the important field of wumbology, the study of wumbo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, then teach them German. The only odd one would be Y, but since we call it &quot;Ypsilon&quot; it still starts with itself. And some weird regions call the ẞ &quot;scharfes S&quot;, which is crazy since it's obviously called &quot;Eszett&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, when my kids learned phonics, their teachers taught them letters are like animals that have names and they make sounds. Like a dog says woof, a cat says meow and a double-u says woo, an A says aye and aww etc. The name of a letter does not have to connect to the sounds they make. </p></div>		</li>
