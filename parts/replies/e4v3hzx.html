			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI, if you want a bread low in preservatives but high in longevity, you can do no better than a genuine, slow-fermented sourdough. Lactobacilli release lactic acid into the dough, which is the source of the sour flavor. It also protects against fungal growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However much it is, when I was there and tried to have a bacon and potato scone sandwich (I'm Scottish) it tasted like I had accidentally used syrup instead of butter for the sandwich.</p>
<p>Never bought the stuff again and only got the bakery bread - not proper bakery but supermarket bakery fresh (it was better than the alternative)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's weird... it's really an American thing. Even across the border in Canada, everything is FAR less sweet. There is just so much less sugar in things. Bread in the US all tastes as sweet as a sweet brioche. Not nearly as good, of course, just as sweet as. It's like Americans have an excess of sugar and are trying to hide it in food wherever possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Canada.  We always buy the grocery store's bread, not the regional or national brands.  It's usually baked on premises or nearby, and likely the day you buy it.  Tastes better, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a thing I've heard often about American bread.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of a game called Where The Water Tastes Like Wine? While I haven't tried it yet, it offers a good descriptor for America itself. A place &quot;Where The Bread Tastes Like Cake.&quot;</p>
<p>And for extra credit, we could also call America a place &quot;Where The Water Tastes Like Lead&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now, put that 20 lb of sugar in a large vat of water, and watch the bacteria feast. </p></div>		</li>
