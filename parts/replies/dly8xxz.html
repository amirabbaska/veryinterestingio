			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yeah for sure on uppers haha, but I always figured the appetite suppression from that was due to the higher stimulation of your reward and happiness centers (from increase dopamine and serotonin), resulting in any emotionally driven eating being suppressed, basically only eating when your stomach is really pushing the issue. Cause of the times I've been cripplingly sad in my life, even if my stomach was grumbling while laying in bed in a pool of tears, there was still not interest to eat, and this has been seen even in animals who are overly grief stricken, to the point they starve to death.</p></div>		</li>
