			<div class="markdown"><p>None taken; Really, the matter is moot because we know incredibly little about anything related to dreaming. I just recalled that Hobbes had addressed this issue and included it as a curio for those interested.</p>
<p>You're right, this is a relatively old work of political philosophy, albeit one that was intended to establish a scientific way of speaking about the moral and legal qualities of government by beginning with a mechanistic picture of humans, treating the combination of individuals into a commonwealth as something like a physics problem. That's why Hobbes begins a political treatise speaking about things like optics, sense, clocks and the like.</p>
<p>Is there modern scientific evidence that something like this is true? I don't have any links, but consider the following, which should be easy enough to verify:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the reasons listed by Hobbes, VR is being used in medical settings to reduce the perception of pain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_load_theory" target="_blank">Perceptual Load Theory</a> would seem capable of addressing this question, but I'm not aware of any specific studies regarding dreams: &quot;In tasks of low perceptual load, since perception cannot be voluntarily stopped, spare capacity from processing the information in the attended task will inevitably spill over, resulting in the perception of task-irrelevant information&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>Your own personal experience that all sensation (and I would presume dreams to be a kind of sensation) is obscured by another overwhelming sensation (Loud noise drowns out quiet ones, bright lights block dim ones, acute pain masks smaller ones, really spicy food destroys the other flavors).</li>
</ul>
<p>This of course isn't the complete picture; the particular chemicals involved, which I'm sure are different than when awake will have some effect; what parts of the brain are active, which are different than awake, will have some effect. There's a lot involved. Even if reasons which are more firmly grounded in a quantifiable way, like a neurological answer using fMRI's are sufficient to explain OP's question, that still doesn't falsify what Hobbe's is saying. Just because other explanations are sufficient to demonstrate something doesn't preclude other explanations.</p>
<p>It's also not been scientifically established that parachutes reduce the likelihood of death by sky-diving. Like the utility of parachutes, I don't have any evidence to reject Hobbe's hypothesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No clue, but I do know that deep meditative experiences can be as vivid or more vivid than dreaming while you're still fully conscious and aware. Then lucid dreaming, where you aren't conscious but are still fully aware and in control of the dream. </p>
<p>So while I'm sure there's a more complex perspective, the idea that immediate wakeful sensory input having a priority over other kinds of signaling in the brain is plausible given that dampening that input (through meditation or sleep) results in dream-like states. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's not true.  Dreams are basically hallucinations.  Dreams and thinking are not the same thing on a continuum, they're just different things.  You can imagine something really hard when you're dreaming and it still probably won't make the leap from mind's eye to eye socket's eye.  What makes dreams more vivid than thinking is that it's a different and more vivid phenomenon than thinking, that involves the actual experience of seeing and hearing things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>There's some important context missing here that will make Hobbes sound much less believable.</strong></p>
<p>Hobbes thought that all our ideas/thoughts came from physical motions, and our memories are <em>literally</em> the continuation of the vibrations after they have entered our body.</p>
<p>The part that you emphasized:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>so as there is no new object which can master and obscure them with a more vigorous impression</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hobbes thought that memories never faded (ie that the motions which entered our bodies never stopped moving), they were only obscured by the entry of fresher, more recent motions. He does NOT mean &quot;impression&quot; in the same figurative sense that we interpret the word today. He means a literal physical outside force pressing on our organs.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is all to say that Hobbes doesn't really know what dreams are and you should take his interpretation with a bucket of salt because he wrote wayyy before the field of neuroscience was invented. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm aware of his mechanistic view of it. Just previous to this he indeed speaks of the organs behaving according to newton's laws; impressions remaining in motion (present) until acted upon by an external force. </p>
<p>I didn't think my response would be taken as a seriously as it has been. </p></div>		</li>
