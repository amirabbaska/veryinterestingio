			<p>&gt;Placing too high a premium on college education. To get a &quot;good&quot; job here, you need to graduate from a reputable university, with respectable GPA and a pleasing personality. Knowing people on the inside of the company is a massive plus. That said, eith the millions of people graduating every year, damn near everyone has these qualifications.<br><br>Shit, I have a 3.9 from an OK university, but I'm an angry misanthrope and a borderline recluse. Oh well, like Meat Loaf said, two out of three ain't bad.</p>		</li>

			<p>Something got lost in translation... Whenever a &quot;pleasing personality&quot; is mentioned in job listings here, they don't actually mean a pleasing personality. They just want you to look at least presentable.</p>		</li>
