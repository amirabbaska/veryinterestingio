			<div class="markdown"><p>I just stopped by to say you're not totally correct. I dated a Chinese woman for 5 years as we attended college together and she obtained her PhD. Most Chinese students in the US end up here as graduate students because they can get paid (essentially) to enroll as a PhD. Not because they're affluent or chosen by the government. The fact is ultimately that the Chinese government isn't that oppressive to its people, and the people have no illusion that their government is perfect. They also are much like your average American and just want to focus on their life and dealing with their shit. Not starting a revolution against their government. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just writing something similar. Yes, the top comment is definitely not correct. The students are not any priviledged or elite citizens associated with the party. They also don't really care who is in power in the U.S., as Chinese are (and have to be) very apolitical.</p>
<p>The truth is that people in U.S. and EU are brainwashed into believing that China is some sort of infant-eating evil star wars empire. But actually as long as you are not writing in the news that Xi Jinping has a small dick, you don't even realize you are in communist country. I assume it is the Cold War legacy on our part. China is very different regime from the Soviet block countries.</p>
<p>Lastly, sticking together is completely natural for exchange students from all countries, that argument does not really make sense. </p></div>		</li>

<p>+1, but don't forget the great firewall. </p>
<p>Have spent a lot of time in China (Guangzhou and Shanghai mainly) because of relatives there, as well as time in Canada, US, and U.K. The only reason I still sometimes feel on edge in China is knowing that, if anything happens and the police get involved, it won't be a lot of fun. And the driving, where yellow light means &quot;floor it before it turns red&quot;. </p>
<p>That aside, every time I've been there, we've had as much fun as in any other country. Daily life is no worse than in a country where you go about knowing that anyone (or everyone) in the vicinity could be (legally) armed, or where every citizen is under constant surveillance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's very natural for people to stick to familiar people over trying to meet new. Many Chinese students have poor(er) English language skills so they have difficulty to communicate with non-Mandarin (not all speak Mandarin but a majority do) speakers. Secondly, cultural differences mean it can often be somewhat confusing to interact. So it is easy to feel a desire to spend time with people with a background closer to yours. Hell, when I visited Shanghai for two weeks I got excited whenever I met anyone else who spoke English, as my Mandarin isn't very good. I imagine something like that, but for years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have legitimately never met a Chinese student studying in the US who was an undergrad so I honestly don't have experience with that. I'm guessing they are less common than the graduate students, but I only have my anecdotal evidence in that regard.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is also partly propaganda on our own end that we think the average Chinese person would want their government to be toppled if they only knew the facts. They're much more concerned about economic growth. As long as that chugs along, most people are happy.</p>

<p>That is perhaps something that most Americans simply do not get. They can't fathom how people are willing to give up or not to have idealism. Chinese are an eminently practical, long suffering and consequentialistic people. Ideas and freedom mean jack shit if you are starving. It means jack shit if you are living paycheck to paycheck or scraping out a miserable living on subsistence farming and abstract ideas aren't gonna feed you. Of course, you could argue that modern living is built on exercising these abstract ideas but you are not going to convince them.</p>
<p>Chinese probably even think that Americans have too much freedom and not enough sense of responsibility to exercise those rights. That's why trump got elected. His election is probably the worst thing that can happen to US soft power aboard, especially on cultural and political influence because all the Chinese have to say to convince other countries to abandon US as a friend and ally and that the Americans are shitty people by showing how they can elect trump. It is a powerful rhetoric. China has no such delusions about freedoms that only distract a country and sap its energy in pointless, directionless internal conflicts.  &quot;If you behave like little kids, you don't have the character to exercise adult rights.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Long term resident of China here. I've yet to meet anyone here who thinks anything similar to this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn this is a great objective and non-generalizing analysis (hard to find on Reddit). My wife is a naturalized American city from a middle class family in Beijing. Also, I work on Chinese projects and travel to Shanghai often. For those that live in the cities, China is pretty awesome (Beijing has some serious air quality issues, as I'm sure you know) but they don't otherwise seem to feel as though they live in a state of oppression. In my wife's profession she'd make much more in China and housing/COL is cheaper so other than being here with her husband, she didn't see moving here as a miraculous improvement. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. She loves the US and her parents love it too. But they don't see it as inherently better (other than the air quality--they love the constantly blue skies here).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My university has a large Chinese student population. They don't &quot;mix&quot; really well with others. Their group of friends/housemates are usually other Chinese students. I haven't met any who came with the intention of staying (or changed their minds during the degree). And this is the UK. At least prior to Brexit, getting a degree here would really help landing a local job if they wanted which could have easily led to permanent stay and access to the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, besides love for their family, there's still that financial grip over someone who was never financially independent and that can make it immensely difficult to move on your own. Even more when you are brought up to think you have a successful life in your safe nest. </p></div>		</li>
