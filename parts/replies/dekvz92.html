			<div class="markdown"><p>Jefferson and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hemings" target="_blank">slave/chef, James Hemings,</a> are a huge part of the story. Jefferson brought him to France where he learned french cooking techniques, which is a basis of macaroni and cheese pie, the dish Hemings created. If it were not for the fact that it was a favorite of the President, it likely never would have achieved the monumental popularity it has today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yankee Doodle went to town
A-riding on a pony,
Stuck a feather in his cap
And called it macaroni.</p></div>		</li>

<p>and was basically a butter-cheese-pasta casserole</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The recipe I use, which my mother learned from her mother, is cooked elbows, grated cheddar, and milk.</p>
<p>Cook the elbows, drain and rinse.  Layer with the cheddar in a casserole dish.  Add milk until it's about halfway up the side of the casserole dish.  Bake at 375 for about 45 minutes, or until the milk is fully absorbed.</p>
<p>And that's it.  If you want to get fancy you can put bread crumbs on the top and maybe a couple of little slices of butter.</p>
<p>Serve with ham steaks or hot dogs for a hot cheap meal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, because nothing says &quot;American&quot; like cheese, pasta, butter, and milk or cream.</p>
<p>Yup.  American cousine in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Edit:  This is very sarcastic.  I hope that comes across.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to come easy too far down to find the rationing connection.  The popularization of powdered cheese increased with the strict rationing of dairy during WWII.  You could get spaghetti with a ration card and use another to get sauce or dairy rations to get cheese or get 2 boxes of Kraft macaroni with the cheese powder included for one ration card.  Combined with the low price and that a lot of women were entering the work force it was a no brainer. Then the troops returned,  the baby boom and nostalgia.  </p></div>		</li>
