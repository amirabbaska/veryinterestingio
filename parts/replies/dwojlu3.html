			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say this, nuclear winter absolutely depends on what is getting nuked.  You can read more about it from a book written by Carl Sagan &quot;The Path Where No Man Thought&quot;.  Also modern fusion bombs produce far less radiation than fission bombs, although it is possible to add in the radioactive material which is what russia claims to have done with their submarine nukes (I believe I haven't read into that as much).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true.  Carbon dating is not particularly affected by fallout, it is easy to isolate the Carbon's particular radioactive signature from other radioactive decays.  </p>
<p>You can't use carbon dating on newer specimens for a different reason.  Carbon 14 decays very slowly.  New specimens have therefore had relatively little time for the carbon to decay, so the radioactive signal put out by them is indistinguishable background for a period of time.  </p>
<p>However, there are other isotopes with shorter half-lives than Carbon 14 which can be used for dating more recent specimens.  In fact, nuclear testing has made precise radio-dating easier, because it increased the amount and variety of shorter lived radio-isotopes.  </p>
<p>Also, 100 nuclear bombs set off anywhere would have a negligible impact on the earths climate.  Far more than 100 test detonations occurred over the span of a decade or so in the 1950s, and we aren't all dead.  From a fallout perceptive, the ash cloud of a city would be no more harmful than the ash cloud of a nuked desert.  Above-ground nuclear detonations (such as those from a war) would be worse from a fallout perspective than from under-sea or underground tests.  </p></div>		</li>
