<p>They are superior for the purpose of simulating reality, but usually that's not the purpose a filmmaker has in mind. Reality is oftentimes boring; many people would rather be immersed in a surreal experience that does not correlate with how we actually perceive the world. Do you also object to artistic color grading, shallow depth of field, anamorphic bokeh/flare, etc., because these are a few of the many unrealistic aesthetic choices that are made in films?</p>
<p>Also, your experiments won't work unless your display is set up properly to display 24 FPS.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It was a generalization.  Ultimately it's a matter of opinion, but I'll put it this way: If film had been, by some technological happenstance, 60+ fps since its inception, very, very few filmmakers today would be opting for an effectively arbitrary downgrade in framerate; the drastic loss of temporal resolution would make for a very niche &quot;artistic&quot; statement.</p>

<p>The OP is a gamer.  I feel comfortable concluding that he either has a Gsync/Freesync monitor or a combination bluray player &amp; TV made in the last five years, or at least comprehends the criteria I laid out when I described that experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true, I am a gamer, and the example video was very helpful. The slower cinematic &quot;take downs&quot; did look very smooth with the blur, but movement and fast action were not very tolerable. I hope that was the point you were trying to illustrate.</p>
<p>Edit: However, while the framerate was low, it was still far easier to watch than when I sometimes play games. I believe both focus required and consistency of frames being displayed also has a large impact of how easy or hard it is to watch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just about every aesthetic choice I listed is due to technological circumstance. Since they are so prevalent in every movie out there, they exist as cues to inform the reader that what they're watching is indeed a movie, and not broadcast TV or whatever else. So for the purpose of convincing you that you are watching a movie, 24 FPS does the job better than any other framerate.</p>
<p>There is no reason to believe that portraying reality accurately is the goal of any artistic endeavor. For example, modern painting techniques are so well developed that you can easily be convinced that you are viewing a photograph if you don't investigate the painting too carefully. With this knowledge in mind, do artists always aim to improve the realism of their paintings, or at least maintain their standards? No, as you can see in the history of art, oftentimes the opposite is the case, making the pursuit of unrealistic art hardly a niche goal as you say.</p>
<p>Another argument that can be made that filmmakers want to maintain suspension of disbelief. They want to make you believe that you are indeed viewing through a window into a fictional world. Chasing reality excessively, e.g. having a high framerate, instigates a niggling notion in the back of your mind that what you're actually watching is not Rey facing off against Kylo Ren, but rather Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver wearing costumes in a movie set. So even if a high framerate was established early on, there is reason to believe that a lower framerate would be chosen to maintain an acceptable break from reality.</p>
<p>Basically, determining what framerate should be used depends on what purpose you are trying to achieve, and it doesn't seem that imitating reality is high on the list.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once played a 30 FPS YouTube video (something with racing cars) on a monitor set to strobe the backlight 30 times a second (around 1ms strobes) and it looked smooth as silk. So 24 FPS could work for a video game and keep the smoothness of 60 FPS and higher, if shown on a proper monitor. Film is normally shown with two flashes of the lamp, causing sample-and-hold motion blur. Normal monitors have long/infinite strobing, so lower frame rates give more blur, regardless of the response time.</p>
<p>But, the flicker is unbearable. So low frame rates like that must have a longer backlight pulse/pulses, which ruins blur-free fast motion as a video game needs, but a movie doesn't need.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Black and White and lack of audio are also sometimes used for artistic effect in media, but in general, movies are made in color and with audio because it's more immersive and looks and sounds better.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Higher framerates are of course better for showing as much detail as possible, but sometimes in art it's better to leave the details to imagination. This can be either because of the inability to depict the events realistically (which even today applies to most action scenes in movies), or because the realistic depiction doesn't have the desired impact on audience.</p>
<p>Not saying we shouldn't move to higher framerates, but just something to consider.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On that topic, I feel that VR will greatly help usher in the push for higher framerates.  Soon enough, people will be watching their 3d media (home videos, Youtube videos and of course movies) on VR solutions, and the field of view for those experiences will grow and grow.  You want to underscore the shortcomings of poor temporal detail?  Try deciphering anything fast or actiony when it's taking up most of your visibility but you've got 42ms between each frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally, I agree. I saw The Hobbit with the high frame rate in theaters and the whole movie I couldn't shake the feeling that it looked like actors on a sound stage with fake props. It looked too real and too detailed, which might be nice for something that is portraying reality, but for a fantasy film it made it look like it was obviously costumes and props, which was very jarring for me and ruined the movie. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They call this the &quot;soap opera effect&quot; for a reason: It's a judgment by association.  We associate the minimal framerate with quality and the optimal framerate with a lack thereof.</p>
<p>For a while, I had this hope that those rather imperfect frame interpolation solutions built into most TVs would do some of the work of abolishing this curse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched the Hobbit in high frame rate and hated it.  Felt very much like a cheap documentary (soap drama effect I believe it's called?).</p>
<p>Similar to my old TV's 200Hz mode. Makes movies feel cheap like they've been recorded with a handcam.</p>
<p>I know it's technically superior, and perhaps overtime it's just a matter of getting used to it, but for my 24fps just looks better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soap opera effect.  Precisely.  It's a better experience (obvious during scenes with high motion if you're watching for them) but has the baggage of decades of unintentional association with lower production values.  The interpolation modes built into most TVs also have their own issues: None (that I've seen) can actually maintain their target framerate at all times, and the motion blur already inherent in the movie is meant to represent a certain camera shutter speed, so mere frame interpolation could give the impression of excessive motion blur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Higher frame rates can produce effects similar to the uncanny valley for some, including myself - it's not just 24P content that avoids this, 30P and a bit higher does too.  The exact reason why doesn't really matter, but it means I don't believe personally I'll ever be able to tolerate high FPS live action content very well.  I mean, I've viewed thousands of hours of 60i content (from childhood to now, though 60i isn't as bad as 60P), thousands of hours of video game content at 60P, and now hundreds of hours of YouTube video and footage I have shot at 60P as well, without any change in this subjective feeling. </p>
<p>For this reason, I'm really glad Hollywood is sticking to 24P and shows basically zero movement toward HFR. </p></div>		</li>
