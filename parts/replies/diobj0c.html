<p>(The statute makes the penalty severe enough, but it's hardly ever prosecuted to the maximum permitted sentence).</p>

<p>It's only not prosecuted if the prosecutor likes you, though. Lying without the protection of the prosecutor is a <em>serious</em> offense and you will go to jail for months for it. I think you're complaining not about the penalty for lying under oath, which is already pretty severe, it's that people the prosecutor likes don't get charged with it. This creates a lopsided playing field where only one side can't lie.</p>
<p>That's really the same problem everyone's been complaining about with police abuses in general - they are allowed to break many laws and won't be prosecuted for it, which if you do anything half as bad you're in prison for years.</p>
<p>To fix that you need an independent prosecutor in charge of prosecuting perjury (and other crimes committed by police) who does not rely on the people she prosecutes to stay employed.</p>
<p>In the case of Bill Clinton he was charged with perjury, but was found not-guilty for completely political reasons. To fix that you'd have to subject the POTUS to someone else's jurisdiction - but he's already subject to Congress impeaching him. You want, I guess, a 3rd party with power over him to make sure he doesn't break the law. There's really no good way around that for the POTUS, because to some extent there would always be charges against him if he weren't immune to what HillBillyProsecutor221 thinks is a crime. To some extent cops need to be able to do random searches to catch drug users and quotas of various other crimes. If we held the POTUS to the same standard as everyone else he'd instantly go to jail for ordering a drone strike or raid gone wrong, and cops wouldn't be able to meet quota.</p>
<p>TL,DR Clinton was charged and acquitted because the people supposed to police him liked him, and police get away with worse for the same reasons. You'd need some 3rd party not appointed by and not dependent on the people they oversee to stop it. It's possible to create independent prosecutors, but neither the cops nor the president would like that and will stop it if they can.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clinton did get hit with a $90,000 fine and had his law license suspended for five years for contempt of court though, so it's not like he got off scot-free.</p>
<p>The basic problem with the impeachment is Republicans in Congress really wanted to nail him on Whitewater, a real estate deal gone bad that looked really suspicious. They were never able to get enough actual dirt though, so they settled for impeachment for lying under oath about an affair. Problem is, the &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; in the Constitution are generally thought to mean crimes committed while acting in your official capacity as President. Lying under oath is pushing it at best, and a lot of people thought Congress was on a witch hunt.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What you're saying here is that it's an overly strict law and you are glad it wasn't applied to him because you don't disagree with him breaking the law. You think the civil punishment was harsh enough compared to the magnitude of what he did.</p>
<p>Every single drug user in prison would say the same thing, and a lot of people outside too. But they still suffer the full force of the law because the prosecutor doesn't like them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the fact that he got his license suspended for a crime of dishonesty (which will prevent you from passing the character portion of the bar outright) is the problem. The second a lawyer isn't shown to be an upstanding honest person is the second the profession gets harmed</p>

<p>the justice system works largely because society (as a whole) agrees that it is fair and just and anything that hurts the legitimacy ultimately breaks the system down</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.
Perjury is its own charge that requires a separate charge and conviction, where a jury or judge (if a bench trial is requested) has to find beyond a reasonable doubt that they lied under oath.</p>
<p>In your situation, the person is essentially saying they didn't do it, but the jury doesn't believe them; that's not proof that they lied.</p></div>		</li>
