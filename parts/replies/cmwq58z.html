			<div class="markdown"><p>I really appreciate you taking the time to give your perspective on this.</p>
<p>Pakistan and Afghanistan have a very long-winded and complicated history, and the last 3-4 years especially has led to lots of tension between the Taliban (who after the war in Afghanistan have been pushed into northern Pakistan and has absorbed a lot of locals of the same ethnic group, Pashtuns), and the Pakistani Military. </p>
<p>Your perspective is very interesting but ultimately not germane to the issue at hand. They're not trying to spread their ideaology at all, they're not total lunatics. Killing children isn't going to help recruit soldiers, they're seeking revenge for the attacks in Waziristan (area in pakistan where they're most populous) by the Pakistani Army. This has nothing at all to do with Iraq/ISIS/ideaologies and definitely not the nation state, although I do love some me some Weber. This is simply a tactic to scare the shit out of the Army by murdering their children so they stop the assaults in Waziristan. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's where my grandmother was from. My father hasn't lived in Pakistan since the late 70s, but we can't help but keep watching. It's not my home but it was his at some point. I studied the ethnic tensions of Pakistan and the roots of the Taliban in school (Poli Sci major, one of our profs was Obama's key anti-terrorism advisors at the beginning of his first term) so this whole thing is both very interesting and very heartbreaking for me.</p>
<p>EDIT: I feel I should clarify - the ethnicity is not at all the driver of this attack, I think that came off poorly in my original comment when talking about the growth of the Taliban in Waziristan.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In this sense, IS/ISIS/ISIL/&quot;Daesh&quot;'s characteristic brutality starts to make more sense, as despicable and horrific as they are. Their goal is to be so terribly more willing to use violence to achieve their goals so as to frighten potential rivals from challenging them, and thus achieve de facto nation-state status over the swath of territory they recently overtook in north-eastern Syria and Anbar province in Western Iraq.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the same as the Americans, and Russians, and the British, and the Chinese etc.. What do you think the atomic bombs were about? What do you think these wars since the WTC attack are about?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had no idea about the Manchester Manual prior to your post so I decided to read through it and I find it fascinating how the author(s) of this document don't realize how extremely hypocritical the text is. This passage was the most obvious example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They [the rulers] tried, using every means and [kind of]
seduction, to produce a generation of young men that did not know
[anything] except what they [the rulers] want, did not say except
what they [the rulers] think about, did not live except according
to their [the rulers') way, and did not dress except in their
[the rulers'] clothes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the very things that these people are trying to achieve themselves, yet somehow if some other form of Islam – that doesn't coincide with their barbaric views – does it, then it's blasphemy of the highest order. </p>
<p>It's also interesting to see how the narrative changes throughout the text. The first few pages are filled with excerpts from holy texts and with references to Allah, but when tactics and military behaviour are discussed, the citations from Koran cease and examples of American, Jewish, and Soviet (which had all been denounced as heretics just a few pages before) military and intelligence operations are given. </p>
<p>I find it ridiculous that these people speak of </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Intelligence and Insight</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>and at the same time commit atrocities that baffle me completely.</p></div>		</li>
