			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think it weighs the same if its sealed. The air pushed down by the drones would make a higher pressure in the bottom of the container and a lower pressure on the top part of the container, which would both have a downward force on the top of the container and a downward force on the bottom of the container. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this explanation holds true with physics but feel free to critique:</p>
<p>So they're all at rest until the truck reaches x speed. Then they take flight. </p>
<p>By the kinetic energy equation, the mass of that truck just was reduced (by a relatively small amount)  by the number of drones or chickens. Thus, the velocity will increase to maintain constant kinetic energy in the absence of outside forces. So the chickens or drones will start to move backwards as the truck changes velocity. </p>
<p>This is assuming the truck tries to maintain its energy level. I base this off you setting the gas to provide a certain level of power to move that truck at x speed for a given weight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to remember that the weight of the drone would still be applied downwards, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26807-if-birds-in-a-truck-fly-does-the-truck-get-lighter/" target="_blank">a
quick example here</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mass doesn’t change when the drone flies. If the drone is hovering, it’s exerting a force (lift) upwards equal to its weight. The air displaced by the propellers therefore has a downforce equal to the weight downwards, which causes the weight of the truck to remain the same. When the drone initially accelerates, there will be momentary fluctuations of course, but when deceleration happens the fluctuations will happen in the opposite direction and average out to the initial weight. This is because the truck is a closed system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok. So if we had an open truck this downforce would be reduced a lot from the lack of pressure I imagine? Makes sense</p></div>		</li>
