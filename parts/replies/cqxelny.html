			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi fellow kiwi. </p>
<p>There's actually a huge difference between the Nepal quake and our feb quake. Our quake was stronger.</p>
<p>In terms of magnitude, Nepal wins. In terms of PGA (Peak ground acceleration), we win hands down, twice over. </p>
<p>They had a maximum PGA of 0.6, while we had one of 2.2g's. </p>
<p>That's right, Christchurch pulled g's in terms of lateral movement. It's why we were so screwed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, I figure that really shows that <em>poverty</em> is the main killer in an earthquake. The earthquakes that hit Christchurch were bigger than the earthquake that hit Haiti, but while the earthquake in Christchurch caused a lot of damage, the earthquake in Haiti killed over <em>two hundred thousand people</em>. Port-au-Prince isn't even that much bigger than Christchurch - it's maybe twice the size. The Nepal earthquake was also much more devastating than Christchurch, even if Christchurch actually had more shaking. We have better buildings for dealing with earthquakes, and better infrastructure to deal with the disaster afterwards.</p>
<p>In the end, these deaths are just not the result of a natural disaster, but as a result of human society.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be more precise: those deaths are a result of shitty macroeconomic policies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>and we survived it with only 184 deaths, of which 115 were from the CTV building collapse.</p>
<p>I'm in awe that we had so few deaths after a major disaster. There's a lot of finger pointing after something like this, but I reckon a whole lot of building designers and disaster experts (civil defence, hospitals, etc) deserve a huge amount of credit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived through that earthquake too. I remember <em>seeing the earth undulate</em> as I walked across a park, and dodging the spewing liquifaction. And that was just one of the aftershocks shortly after the main event (I ran outside when stuff in my house was falling over and I felt in danger of my old shitty flat collapsing). Trippiest thing I ever experienced in my life. </p>
<p>So yeah, New Zealand's architects and civil engineers deserve a lot of credit for the lives they saved that day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm aware of that, I'm just using a rough correlation of magnitude with damage. Are you in any doubt NYC is totally fucked either way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in doubt as to how messed up it will be.</p>
<p>I don't think it will be as bad as you say, but it'll still be pretty messed up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the damage would probably be so severe that rebuilding the city wouldn't even be a certainty. (Since.. everything remaining would need to be demolished and replaced) </p></div>		</li>
