			<div class="markdown"><p>Not always pointless for everyone all the time. I got flare ups from a chronic sinus infection after some colds. I knew when, and sometimes was told to forget it when asking for antibiotics. Invariably I lost a week of productivity, in misery, getting worse until it progressed towards pneumonia until I got on antibiotics. Then I was back to work within 24 hours trying to catch up. I'd loose half my vacation days this way. So I know it sounds Kosher to say, but damn, the Doctors who refused to trust me caused a lot of grief. I know about resistance, and if it's a virus... but viral and bacterial pathogens don't fight turf wars over territory.</p></div>		</li>
