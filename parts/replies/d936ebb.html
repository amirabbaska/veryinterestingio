			<div class="markdown"><p>Except this is in people who are ocularly blind, not cortically blind, and had the relevant experience some time in their development to learn to interpret visual input. So, the people who are able to use these sensory-substitution devices are people who have had previous experience organizing and interpreting visual information from their eyeballs into meaningful formats. All they're doing after that is remapping the external information, now given through a device on the back or whatever, into the old pattern recognition system that already existed. The new device giving this information has to be fairly highly isomorphic or analogous to the original pattern of stimulation. <a href="http://hci.ucsd.edu/102a/readings/SensorySubstitution.pdf" target="_blank">here's a good overview on some of the details of sensory substitution -- from the godfather of sensory substitution himself, Paul Bach-y-Rita</a></p>
<p>But, the key point is that the part of these peoples' brains that are doing the interpreting was able to develop. If anything, the types of information people would get who had never had <em>something like</em> visual experience would probably be flashing lights or something.</p>
<p>Now, &quot;<em>something like</em> visual experience&quot; is fairly key here. As seen in <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/544/batman?act=2" target="_blank">this episode of radiolab</a> at about 38:25, we can see that there have been people who have had what appears to be a phenomenological experience similar to sight or images. This phenomenological experience is backed up by nearly identical occipital lobe activity in the brain to people who are normally sighted. This is from people who have not had especially lengthy periods of standard vision. It appears, for these people, the brain eventually co-opts the occipital lobe into a new system of &quot;vision&quot; or &quot;pseudo-vision&quot; or whatever we want to call it. Check out the podcast, it's quite the trip.</p>
<p>Anyway, going back to your original point -- any direct stimulation of the optical parts of the brain would be pretty useless by itself with no real experience from which meaningful connections could form. For this same reason, a sensory substitution device for a person who had been blind from birth (and had had no real experience with something like vision, as in the &quot;batman&quot; story) would probably produce nothing that exciting in terms of first-person experience. It's possible you might get some flashes of lights or otherwise low-level sensory or even perceptual experiences, but nothing even close to the complex experience that is regular vision. I would leave the specifics of this last part (that is, the specifics of what exactly you <em>would</em> get from stimulating the occipital lobe) to others, but suffice it to say, you would almost certainly not get anything like what we understand as complex vision without the antecedent conditions I've described.</p>
<p>edit: After doing some more sourcing and briefly skimming a couple of Thaler's (the neuroscientist they talked to in radiolab) papers, it seems they have <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020162.PDF" target="_blank">only looked at non-congenitally blind</a> patients. I'll try to see if anyone has looked at any congenitally blind patients using the echolocation later. It would be especially interesting if occipital blindness precludes the ability to have this sort of visual experience.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="http://jn.physiology.org/content/jn/111/1/112.full.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> is at least one of their studies where they compared motion processing in sighted and non-sighted individuals using the echolocation stuff. I've only skimmed it, but it could be of interest in giving some further indication of the likelihood of what this might look like in congenitally blind people. I'll try to write some more later once I get a change to read more when I'm not busy with other work.</p>
<p>otherwise, I did a bit of editing to the body of this comment to hedge some of my claims, as it's been a while since I actually listened in depth to the radiolab podcast, and I'm pretty sure all the people who have shown this pseudo-vision phenomenon had at least some early exposure to standard visual input.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP's point was about people who never had sight, so never developed the relevant portions of the brain concerned with parsing vision. If those people can slowly learn to see after their ocular defect(which prevented their brains from developing the cortex) is rectified, then the process would be no different from learning to see with a sensory substitution device, no?

<p>To my knowledge, people who have not had the relevant early-life experience cannot later develop vision. Now, what <em>exactly</em> is the amount or type of &quot;relevant&quot; experience, and what exactly is the timeline of &quot;early&quot; I am not sure, and cannot really comment on past some speculation without doing a bit more research.</p>

<p>This question makes it seem like someone somewhere implied that these people <em>could</em> get that vision back when their ocular defect was rectified. Did I say something that implied this, or did someone else, or is it just a hypothetical question? I think the conclusion is sound given the premises, but as with my previous point, I'm not sure the premise is something that is possible.</p>
<p>However, given all that, again it does seem to depend on the caveats of &quot;relevant&quot; and &quot;early&quot;. Once we can define those parameters a bit better, then we can start to make a good assessment. In my mind, up to a few months after birth seems plausible in terms of &quot;early&quot;. I'm under the impression this can be fairly critical, though, and the sooner the better, in order to avoid as much visual impairments as possible. But again, this is certainly not my area of expertise, and so I can't comment on those details much past speculation and vague recollections of undergraduate courses. I'm definitely a bit stronger on the sensory substitution literature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This has been tested in animal models, and the outlook is not great. If you deprive newborn animals of visual input during the critical period, they will later not be able to develop proper vision. You can read a simple explanation of some of these experiments here (note: they involve doing not nice things to kittens): <a href="http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/experience_rouge05.html" target="_blank">http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/experience_rouge05.html</a></p></div>		</li>
