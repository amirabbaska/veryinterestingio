			<div class="markdown"><p>This is certainly true in the United States, but some governments have adopted a very strict secularism, in which it's taboo for anyone to make religious displays in public affairs at all. That might be contributing to OP's confusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The funny thing is that this very strict secularism would actually run contrary to the US idea of separation of church and state. It would be seen as a state enforced religion/suppression of the religion of others and therefore be unconstitutional.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Secularism is not a religion. Secularism is not the suppression of religion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It works for politicians to reference God today, because a fair percentage of voters respond to it.  When the population no longer determines it important or actually disfavors a religious minded leadership, politicians will stop mentioning it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might be the case for some politicians but not all. Where I live, we have some small and strict religious parties. They aren't referencing god to get votes. If nothing else, it actually turns a lot of people away from them. They do it because that is what they genuinely believe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they are. They are &quot;strict religious parties, &quot; as you say. They mean to represent a set of voters. I didn't say all politicians do it to get votes,  I said that they advertise it because voters care. When it turns too many people away from them, they may just put their spiritual beliefs in their back pockets and run on other issues besides what religion they belong to. </p></div>		</li>
