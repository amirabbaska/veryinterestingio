			<div class="markdown"><p>First answer to talk about micrometeorites, rather than just dust.  Have an upvote.</p>
<p>Stolen from an answer I just found on yahoo answers:</p>
<p>&quot;Small impacts are common and have to be included in the design. Most satellites are designed for impacts of objects that are smaller than 1 cm (the typical meteor shower kind of meteoroid), and will usually only be completely destroyed for objects that are 10 cm large and more. But such impacts that are bigger than just dust are pretty rare:</p>
<p>The statistical numbers for Geostationary orbits are:</p>
<p>Larger than 0.1 mm -&gt; once every 4.67 years</p>
<p>Larger than 1 mm -&gt; once every 2,267 years</p>
<p>Larger than 1 cm -&gt; once every 2,440,000 years</p>
<p>Larger than 10 cm -&gt; once every 24,600,000 years.</p>
<p>(According to ESA MASTER-2001 debris flux model)&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Be aware that those numbers are <em>per square meter</em>. Since most satellites are much larger than 1m^2 these numbers grow quickly as you integrate over the external surface area of a spacecraft.</p>
<p>Also, Low Earth Orbit, the geosynchronous orbit and interplanetary trajectories are completely different micrometeoroid and debris environments, each of them with a different probability of impacts and size distribution.</p></div>		</li>
