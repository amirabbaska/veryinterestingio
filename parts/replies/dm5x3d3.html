			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the fat does not move from one place to another, the body actually just distributes fat to that spot on the body less (or more, depending on the location on the body) when on HRT. So, when starting HRT, it is best to lose weight first, which decreases the fat everywhere on the body. After about six months in, you would want to start gaining weight again, as the fat would be distributed in the places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a doctor either, but as someone who has heavily researched the effects of sex hormones and implements their use, water retention is a huge factor insofar as relatively immediate changes. Why do females typically bloat during their periods? Increased estrogen and progesterone levels. </p>
<p>Throw higher levels of androgens into a female's body and over time you will see the effects of virilization. Sensitivity levels to androgens will vary wildly between people though</p>
<p>Edit: Throw higher levels of estrogenic compounds into a male body and you'll see the opposite occur</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's literally a night and day difference. Bodybuilders for instance: it's common to crash estrogen levels right before stage and the visual changes are dramatic and quick even without factoring in diuretics. Without estrogen you get a much &quot;drier&quot; look. Add estro and you look puffy real quick</p></div>		</li>
