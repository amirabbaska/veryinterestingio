			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s correct. It follows from the definition of logarithms being essentially a reverse operation to exponentiation. If you look at how any number can be written as a sum of powers of ten where the largest power of ten in the sum (plus one) is exactly the number of digits then you should be able to see why this works.</p>
<p>As a concrete example,
1000 = 1 x 10^3 + 0 x 10^2 + 0 x 10^1 + 0 x 10^0
log10(1000) = 3 then 1000 has 3+1 = 4 digits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's based on the very way logarithms work, so you could say it's proven. </p>
<p>Edit: you always have to round up though so 2.1 would be 3.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or <code># digits = abs(log(x)) + 1</code> to account for boundaries like log10(1000)</p>
<p>Edit: oh duh, floor not abs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our counting system is based on exponents (ones place is 10^0, tens place is 10^1, hundreds place is 10^2, etc.), and logarithm is like the reverse of exponentiation. </p></div>		</li>
