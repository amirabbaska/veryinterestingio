<p>The Snoopers Charter was first introduced by her back then, it's something of a pet project for her, and she's always had an obsession with security and surveillance over freedom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you also need to realise much of what goes on in politics in the UK is based on the idea of a 'paternalist state'- a country which looks after its' citizens, which protects its' citizens often from theirselves. This is very different to the ideals of modern republicanism the US was founded on. </p></div>		</li>

<p>CCTV is widely regarded as OK because it's all public CCTV. The snoopers charter invades our private lives.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's never by the people.  The UK system is not about voting for the prime minister.  In fact, the Queen, officially speaking, picks the next prime minister.  May is as much selected by the people as Cameron or Blair or Brown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spurious. Brown I agree with. We technically vote for a party but we tend to know the person who will become PM and most of the focus is on them. If they leave for whatever reason or die, say, then a new PM is selected by the party. This happened with May after Cameron stepped down following Brexit. So in a sense we voted for Tories knowing full well Cameron would be our PM, as such, voting for Cameron. No one voted Tory expecting May to be PM. And perhaps, if we had known, then we wouldn't have voted Tory. May is rather disliked amongst the public whereas Cameron, for all his issues was always viewed fairly favourably as PM. Hopefully next election after the fucking up of Brexit people will blame May and vote in Corbyn and he can go about restoring a little bit of our freedom. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Whilst he's correct that UK voters technically vote for their local representative there's a very large unspoken assumption and knowledge that you are voting for PM/Party rather than the local individual </p></div>		</li>
