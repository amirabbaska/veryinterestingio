			<div class="markdown"><p>Fantastic explanation, thanks but I have one question: It is known that plants use the fibonacci series to distribute its leaves over the branches or parts of itself like the petals of a flower and so one. So they will get maximum sunlight, for example. It must exist some code somewhere that is read and contains that information. Is that on the DNA/RNA?</p></div>		</li>

<p>How and why the fibinacci sequence and golden ratio manifests in nature, I have no idea really. My only guess is that it's something that makes sense on every scale of organisation. In a similar way to a natural logarithm appearing in population growth and radioactive decay. And how we find all sorts of geometry in things like be hives, crystals and plants. In my opinion it would be the most effective way to organise things </p></div>		</li>
