<p>In many cities (like Seattle) &quot;at Will employment&quot; is the norm which basically means they can fire you any time they feel like it for any reason (or no reason).</p>

<p>In every state except Montana*
There fixed that for you.</p>
<p>Don't forget At Will goes both ways. You can quit for any reason with no notice as well. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And businesses have pushed against even that. They've been manipulating culture for generations to make it so people don't think they can, or that there are social mores on it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You have to give two weeks notice, otherwise they'll bad-mouth you to your next employer or you'll just be a bad person!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't talk about your compensation to anyone! They'll hate you for it!!</p>
</li>
<li>Don't leave early or take vacation! People will resent you for it!</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That last one is a trip. I’d get at work at 6:45 or 7 am, but when it came to quitting time at like 3-3:30 pm, out came all the sarcastic bitter remarks from everyone. I’m doing my full 40 Susan, when did you get here? 9:30?</p>
<p>EDIT: Yes it was a flex schedule. Get there anywhere from 7am-9:30 am was the set standard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned they can't make you give 2 weeks notice when I quit my first job. I got hurt on the job and a manager who was mad at me for reporting her racist friend to the union tried to work me hard when I got back from injury leave. The union rep went to the bat for me and told them they better let me leave and she'd make sure I got a Damn good review.</p>
<p>I really wish schools would teach more about how to enter the work place. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not a good argument for at will employment. They cant send you to jail for quitting unless you are making millions and have to sign a contract.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't get the &quot;At Will goes both ways&quot; bullshit.  </p>
<p>You know that in other countries without the &quot;At Will&quot; concept the employee can also quit for no reason, right?  They aren't locked into some sort of permanent servitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only worked for a couple of international companies but in both cases I was unable to quit any time for any reason without repercussions.  For one I had to work for a specified length of time and for the other I had to give a month's notice. Breaking either of those outside of a list of acceptable reasons would result in me having to pay the company a significant amount. But it worked the other way too, they couldn't just fire me without having to pay - again, unless it was for one of a set of reasons.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: And these weren't contract style jobs where you could have a clause to pay penalties for cancellation or something like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not so much a flip side as it is two things that don't have to be connected mashed together anyway. The position of employer and employee is, in general, highly asymmetric with respect to employment, whether that be in terms of relative power, consequences for severing the relationship, or public policy interests at stake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have some contract that dictates x amount of work and you breach it then you’d be liable for whatever amount of fines is written in. Sure you could be a lazy employee and hope to get fired but the contract would probably have some performance clause</p></div>		</li>
