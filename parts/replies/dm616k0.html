			<div class="markdown"><p>I always found kind of funny that ancient Greeks expressed higher level abstractions and complex concepts in their everyday lenguaje, because they were trying to be clear about difficult things and novel, revolutionary ideas while more modern philosophers choose a dead language almost no one speaks . It almost looks as they want to add a layer of obscurity and complexity... And maybe to hide the lack of substance.</p>
<p>And I'm both cases the language is ancient Greek</p>
<p>Bah, I don't know. Maybe ancient Greek also had an even older language to use and sound clever</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who speaks English and Spanish, all I can say is that arguing about anything in Spanish is significantly more exhausting and takes longer due to the fact that constructing sentences and organizing ideas takes way more words than English does.
Maybe my perception about it is based upon the fact that I learned my English by listening to debates on logic and atheism and reading about them, but all the essays I wrote in college always ended up being longer if written in Spanish as those I wrote when I was studying my masters and had to hand a couple of them in English. </p>
<p>My two cents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Latin defender here. I think it's reputation is deserved if misunderstood.</p>
<p>In lexicon its prestige may be historically accidental, as with law, taxonomy and logic. But it's elementary for those subjects nonetheless. It's literary heritage is equally historical yet inescapable, as with philosophy and theology.</p>
<p>In syntax Latin stands on its own though. Even up to the modern era scholars who knew it, such as Hobbes and Luther, used it instead of vernacular in their drafts and journals for its neatness. Latin <em>is</em> grammatically efficient compared to modern languages---you can say more with less ink, and with less sentential procedure. </p></div>		</li>
