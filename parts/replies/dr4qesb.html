			<div class="markdown"><p>The light spectrum is linier, like a straight hallway with a door on both ends. Now imagine  the walls are painted as the light spectrum,  starting with red on one end and violet on the other. The question is basically asking, how come when we walk through the hallway, and exit through the violet door, we are brought back to red, making our brains believe its a circle?</p>
<p>another way to ask; Why are color wheels so fluidly connected between red and violet, when they're on the opposite ends of the spectrum, which doesn't connect them at all?</p></div>		</li>
