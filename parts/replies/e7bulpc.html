<p>I exercise, get a decent amount of sun (for living not far from the Arctic circle anyway) and I have a good diet.</p>
<p>One bag of chips Friday night and I can pretty much <em>guarantee</em> there'll be a zit or two on my face on Saturday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was the toughest drug I ever took. 6 months of bloody chapped lips (chapstick was almost useless), bloody noses, and the driest flakiest skin I have ever had. I felt like I was shedding scales from my cheeks, and the inside of my nose felt like i snorted glass. Really not exaggerating that part. I think the excessive dryness makes the nose scab up on the inside. </p>
<p>People also say it has a track record of causing depression and suicidal ideation. I experienced these to an extent, but I have to wonder if that’s simply an expected reaction from spending 6 months going to school with an even further fucked up face. </p>
<p>With all that said, totally worth it. I can’t speak for others, but for me it did its job. Cystic acne has been a thing of the past, thank god. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely. I'm getting to the end of a course of isotretinoin myself at the moment, and it has not been fun. Luckily, the treatment seems to have been successful for me! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the side effects are nasty, I got pretty bad suicidal thoughts for a few months I was on it, but I was also really depressed before taking the medication because of my acne, so It's a pretty shitty cycle. Luckily I was a lot happier after my treatment and no longer had 7 cysts on my face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. Only after 8 months of Accutane and month in hospital with daily sessions of cleaning did they go away.
There were sideaffects but it is no suprise since I was 15, hormons and Accutane do not play well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t forget your hormones can also affect things! My acne was almost completely hormonal during my teens and early adulthood; I had to go on a birth control/testosterone-blocker combo to finally get rid of the majority of my acne because the hormones were causing my body/skin to produce excess oils and such, which made the acne much more likely (as my doctor explained it). After my hormones were a little more balanced, it was just a matter of finding a skincare routine that worked for my skin to get rid of the rest. </p></div>		</li>
