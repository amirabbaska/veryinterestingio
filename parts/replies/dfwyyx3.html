			<div class="markdown"><p>To me, if it were Sarin, the odds of it being smuggled chemicals by ISIS or other rebels is extremely low, unless there's some information I'm missing.  Sarin is something that can't be trivially manufactured, and is pretty much invariably coming out of government labs.  The rebels would have had to have stolen a rather impressive amount IMO.</p></div>		</li>
