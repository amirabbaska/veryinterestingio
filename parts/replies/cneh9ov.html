			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the epiglottis only opens/closes one pathway at a time. You can either send contents to the lungs or the stomach. If the air is moist enough that breathing is drinking, you're going to have problems with one of them (barring an evolutionary adaptation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Seattle.  During the winter, I drink a couple glasses of water each day and do just fine.  When I visit family in Colorado?  8+ glasses and I have to slather my entire body in moisturizer twice a day or instantly dry-freeze into Amon Hotep.</p></div>		</li>
