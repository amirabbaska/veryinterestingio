			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, though, is when I go see a DJ/producer, it's about the vibe more than watching someone do something.  It's about dancing and all the people there.  They'll also play unreleased versions of songs and songs that aren't released yet that they made or received from other producers , so you'll hear something that you can't hear anywhere else.</p>
<p>Shitty EDM DJs play pre-recorded sets and literally do just hit a play button.  Actual DJs mix live and all the stuff other people have mentioned.  There are a lot of producers who will perform live instruments during their sets, though.</p>
<p>Check out French Kiwi Juice, aka FKJ.  He makes electronic music but plays a lot of instruments over it.  Holy shit. Saw him live and he solo'd on piano, keys, guitar, saxophone, and played bass.  It was amazing.</p>

<p>At 16:15, he's performing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0nj5o5w-HU" target="_blank">Cherokee - It Don't Matter (FKJ Remix)</a>, but at 18:40, he breaks it down in a way that's not in the recorded version.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stupid question, why not just pre-record instead of doing it live? The output seems like it would be exactly the same, except you wouldn't have any messups from doing it live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DJ/producer here. People do make pre-recorded sets but there are a lot of reasons not to. The people that do tend to make pre-recorded sets are either people who are bad and can't make it work live, or really big artists that have lights/effects synced to certain songs. Think someone like deadmau5. He has his famous Cube setup with a bunch of cool visuals that are synced to his songs. While I'm sure he does mix live, he most likely has a set pool of songs he can play that sync with the visuals and may have &quot;mini-mixes&quot; of these songs whereby he has specific visuals into which he can transition into songs that are outside his standard pool and have more generic visuals (for instance if a cool new song comes out that he wants to play live). </p>
<p>As for the reasons not to have a pre-recorded set. A big part of a DJ set is controlling the mood/vibe and being able to read the audience and play off of them. Not every crowd will be the same. Sometime a genre that you played the night before at one venue might not get the same response at the next show you play. Maybe you try playing a couple dubstep songs and the dance floor starts to clear (the audience isn't feeling it), so you play some trap music which the audience was digging before. A good DJ will be able to read the audience and be able to give them more or what they want, even if the crowd doesn't know they want it. Sometimes you may be playing back to back bangers for a while and you need to drop a more mellow song to reset everyone and give them a chance to cool down before building it back up. </p>
<p>Another reason is that you'll want to have different vibes depending on where in the night you play. If you're at an opening slot at 10pm, you want to play more on the mellow side so people can build up the mood throughout the night where the headliner/DJ in the main time slot is the peak in energy. If you're playing right before the headliner you'll want to play something that's a similar energy level, but doesn't &quot;step on the toes&quot; of the music the headliner wants to play. </p>
<p>Finally, new hit songs come out every day and it's a DJs job to not only play crowd favorites, but to introduce people to amazing new favorites. A good DJ will be getting new songs at least once a week and testing them out live to figure what goes off, what doesn't, what songs mix well with it, what doesn't. Having pre-recorded sets doesn't really leave much wiggle room to introduce new material and test things out with a crowd. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>same reason you wouldn't (ideally) want to see a band perform live and they're actually just prerecorded and pretending to play.  The ability to manipulate the tracks into something new/different is the performance itself.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To echo the other response, mixing music live gives you the flexibility to be more creative and mix things up. Each time you perform you can change the sound of the mix, just like a guitar player might always play a familiar riff or solo in a song, but they change it in subtle ways to give it a different feel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi.</p>
<p>Nice answer, but please remove the self-promotion.  I'm going to approve your comment, but I trust you to remove the self-promotion. </p>
<p>Sorry, but we don't generally like to allow self-promotion because sometimes it can get spammy and also it can make it seem like the modteam endorses the service/product in question, which we do not (no offence).</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p></div>		</li>
