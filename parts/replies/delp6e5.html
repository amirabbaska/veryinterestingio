<p>The surface temperature of Venus is nowhere near the melting point of limestone.  Not even close.</p></div>		</li>

<p>On earth limestone is mostly produced by biological activity where certain organisms(such as corals) produce their skeletons by combining calcium and carbon dioxide and forming calcium carbonate. On earth this caused huge amounts of co2 to be taken out of the atmosphere and deposited it as ,mostly inert, calcium carbonate or limestone. All those huge limestone structures all around the world are deposits of tiny organisms that lived billions of years ago. Much later plants also contributed to this by taking up co2, growing, dying and getting fossilized into coal before being decomposed. So life on earth mineralized large amounts of co2 gas, essentially making it a trace gas.</p>
<p>In some ways life on earth stabilized the atmosphere of the planet by preventing a runaway green house effect due to excess CO2. Venus lacked water due to losing its hydrogen to solar wind. This prevented life from taking hold and planet eventually turned into some kind of a hell.</p></div>		</li>
