			<p>I love your analogy, it made perfect sense to me, but powerlifters do a ton of stretching! Children are definitely way more flexible though.</p>		</li>

			<p>I know right? The guy with the top post included terminology that quite frankly means nothing to me. Start with the simply analogy, <em>then</em> explain that the arm strength is the ionic bonds or whatever. If you throw around terms without explaining what they mean, you've failed to explain anything.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;The powerlifters are all about gainz and rarely stretch. <br><br>So hilarious!<br><br>Powerlifters generally are actually quite flexible despite the appearance of their bulk.  They need it to maintain their form and strength as they build up their gainz.</p>		</li>

			<p>The fact that they're children is immaterial. Relative strength of the people doing the holding (and, to some degree, size) is what matters.<br><br>Also, the flexibility--while important for other reasons--isn't pertinent to the OP's question.</p>		</li>

			<p>Lol good lord how high are you? First, the powerlifters were the obsidian in this scenario. No oiling/annealing. And second, basically what OP was saying is obsidian can achieve a much thinner edge because it's much more rigid on an atomic level. However, the rigidity makes it brittle. Metal on the other hand, needs much more support to keep form. This support gives it the &quot;bend, don't break&quot; quality.<br><br></p>		</li>
						<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mithril_marc" target="_blank">mithril_marc</a>
			<p>Ha. Well, the powerlifters are the glass in this scenario, so adding oil could represent adding heat that causes the obsidian to exceed its glass transition temperature and become a supercooled liquid. <br><br>Like obsidian's molecular chains in the supercooled liquid state, the body builders would easily slid past one another because they're slippery.<br><br>Annealing is heating a metal above a specific temperature and letting it cool in the furnace. </p>		</li>
