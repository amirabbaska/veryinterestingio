<ol>
<li>Collect bottles.</li>
<li>Process them into flake.</li>
<li>Melt flake into plastic resin.</li>
<li>Spin resin into thread. </li>
</ol>
<p>Thing is, anybody who recycles plastic bottles does steps 1 - 3. Those are just what plastic recycling <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>As to step four, most plastic bottles are made out of PET/PETE (plastic resin type 1, for recycling purposes), and that's one of the plastics used to make polyester. I assume the way money was made here was by accomplishing steps 1 - 3 at a cost below that that most textile manufacturers spend for their raw materials. </p></div>		</li>
