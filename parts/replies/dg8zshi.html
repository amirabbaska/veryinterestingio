			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it doesn't necessarily have to be the government. For example, engineers who wants to practice in Ontario need an EIT/P.Eng. designation by the Professional Engineers of Ontario, which is an independent body separate from the government. It was created to educate engineers with the latest developments and follow a Code of Ethics to serve the public interest. Why can't journalists implement something similar to report with the public interest in mind rather than simply skewing the facts to side with their viewpoint or outright spreading misinformation/lies?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And then what, have the government arrest people for talking about current events without a license? Outlaw communication with more than one person at a time?</p>
<p>Making it illegal to design bridges without a license is different from making reporting news illegal without a license.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The government/police doesn't need to arrest anyone unless an actual crime was committed. The independent body can simply revoke the license from the reporter who reported misleading/false information, which will make it difficult for that reporter to be rehired by another news agency due to reputational risk. This also pushes out the reporters who don't follow proper journalism (defined by the independent body) and retains the better trained reporters who serve the public interest. This is similarly what happens to engineers when they make errors on a bridge design or building, but the consequences of those errors are much more severe as people's lives are at risk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To start, in the US you can practice engineering without a license. We do have professional engineering societies, but they aren't required. </p>
<p>And the idea is supposed to be that any news organization that lies would go out of business because the public is supposed to choose news programs that tell the truth. And that is how it actually works. The issue is that news shows these days are opinionated, not that they lie. And whether something is good or bad is about preference, so people watch the news they agree with and become more entrenched I their beliefs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it wouldn't have to <em>be</em> the government, and probably shouldn't, but even an independent regulatory organisation will need some government backing, or else it will have no authority. </p>
<p>In the UK the replacement for the PCC, [IPSO] (<a href="https://www.ipso.co.uk/" target="_blank">https://www.ipso.co.uk/</a>), is independent but is funded through a tax on the media, and that took legislation. You mentioned the PEO - see their &quot;About&quot; page for how they were established by the Professional Engineers Act i.e. they are backed by the provincial government. </p>
<p>I assumed you were from the USA (sorry eh), but I still think that the partisan nature of their Congress makes such a government-backed independent body unlikely. They already have the FCC, which is an independent Federal agency which nevertheless relies on Congress for its funding. The EPA is another such body, which is currently finding out what happens when the US Government (or part thereof) doesn't like your message. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that any story reporting that someone was arrested for X should be legally required to be taken off the publishers website if the person in question was found innocent.  There are tons of reputation-ruining articles out there that end up with nothing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep - the Fairness Doctrine is mentioned in other comments. The problem with an &quot;equal time&quot; rule is that it gives equal time to e.g. anti-science nutjobs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I see. I never could figure why it would have been removed but I can see how a mass of flat-earthers with equal time could be a problem. I just figured news would sound more like the BBC rather than Fox. Thanks for the info!</p></div>		</li>
