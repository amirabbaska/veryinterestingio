			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind everything here is referring to the physical aspects of the storage device, and not how it's stored.</p>
<p>As file systems and compression methods improve, 512TB of similar data might fit within a 2TB drive. </p>
<p>Think about it as having 1, and only 1 page of a word doc to write whatever you want. Over time you learn about changing the font style and size, and that you can zoom in on specific parts of the page.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, 2TB in 1 sq. cm is already mind-boggling, and I'm a computer geek.  There may well be a newer standard in the future that would allow more, but until we actually approach being able to fit that much onto a card, there's no sense in making a new standard for space.  Right now, speed is the bottleneck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe a bit off topic but I think by the time 2TB SD cards becomes a consumer product, we may all have started moving to the cloud. Kinda like how we haven’t needed a new standard for physical disk with maybe a exception for 4K Blu-ray’s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember back when we were only able to fit 1.44 MB on a floppy disk, then I found this program that allowed a reformat and I think it moved it up to about 1.87, big numbers back then!!! </p></div>		</li>
