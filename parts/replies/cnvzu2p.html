			<div class="markdown"><p>We can estimate the number of stars from mass only when we know the fraction of the mass that reside in luminous stars in the first place.  84.5% of the mass in the universe is dark matter, and we first found out about it because galaxies (and clusters) have far more mass than can be accounted for with stars (or dust, or gas). </p>
<p>The original estimates of the number of stars in galaxies were based on the measured light emitted by them, and our knowledge of how star masses are distributed. </p>
<p>Since the estimate from mass and the estimate from light were so ridiculously divergent, and since the rotation speeds of stars did not slow down with distance from the center of galaxies, we learned that every galaxy is overwhelmingly a huge halo of dark matter (which we still don't know what is), and that atomic matter like stars and people are almost an afterthought.</p>
<p>Only when we had independent estimates of the breakdown between atomic and dark matter could we use mass to estimate the star count in galaxies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still not sold on Dark Matter being anything more than a human measurement error.  I think the closer and closer measurement we get the less and less Dark Matter we will need to explain the discrepancies.  Its like that &quot;coast of Britain&quot; problem, and we only have sticks that are as long as Britain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we presume all matter is as we know it, then we cannot explain the rotation of galaxies. The way normal matter interacts will naturally clump all the matter into the discs we see at galactic scales (this is due to collisions). However, if all matter in a galaxy is distributed in such a fashion, we cannot then explain the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Galaxy_rotation_curves" target="_blank">rotational speed of stars in a galaxy</a>. </p>
<p>Dark matter is a proposal that there is matter with mass but which has no electric charge, color charge, etc, and so does not interact in any way other than through gravity. This means no collisions and therefore a much more spread out and also spherical distribution in the galaxy which then accounts for the galactic rotation speeds.</p>
<p>There could be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Alternative_theories" target="_blank">alternative explanations</a> to galactic rotation, but I wanted to clear up the reason dark matter is proposed and point out that it isn't only a case of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Galaxy_clusters_and_gravitational_lensing" target="_blank">discrepancy between what we see and what we measure</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's too much for a measurement error and been corroborated too many times. It's not like 10-25% of mass is unknown dark matter, it's over 80%.</p>
<p>It could be that the vast bulk of the Universe is a series of subatomic particle that has mass but is not observable (yet) and we haven't figured out how to detect it or it could be something else but the only way to make dark matter less is to quantify the stuff that dark matter is.</p>
<p>Either way the mass of our galaxy is probably right give or take 3%. We're just not capable of seeing more then 3/4 of what exists yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The case for dark matter being real is actually very strong.</p>
<p>I know nobody who has made <a href="https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/dark-matter-in-galaxies-proven-ebcbea1a5402" target="_blank">the case for dark matter being real</a> better than Ethan Siegel. Give it a read.</p>
<p>(PS: I think this is a fair question, and I think it is unfair to downvote objections instead of replying)</p></div>		</li>
