			<div class="markdown"><p>You are wrong. There are less than 2000 essential genes in humans. The whole proteome of humans encompasses  73112 genes. So it's not really a large amount.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well obviously it doesn’t account for all the similarities between plant and human. Also really it’s more like 2000/20000 genes are essential. Looking at the whole proteome count is inflated by mRNA splice variants so that’s not really a fair comparison.</p></div>		</li>
