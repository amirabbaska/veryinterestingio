<p>Good luck with your renewal next year; it's sometimes easier if you kept a copy of your electronic questionnaire responses. From memory they won't re-do the full SSBI, but they do like to bring up items from your original paperwork. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Additionally, you know damn well that if you have a TS clearance and are currently in access then you shouldn't be talking about it on an open forum because it makes you a target. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meh, the Chinese already have the <em>real</em> names and addresses of everyone with a clearance in the last 30 odd years, they don't need to troll internet forums anymore. </p>
<p>But I agree with your sentiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An anonymous forum is nothing. They let people put clearance levels on resumes. Also the OPM breach showed way more information than some rando on reddit. Anyone who would be targeted is already on a list.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's this sort of conservative-authoritarian culture that believes any science that lets supposedly guilty people off the hook must be fake, a product of &quot;bleeding-hearts&quot; making shit up.</p>
<p>So like for example, in the Central Park rape case in the late 80s, the cops arrested five teenagers, most of whom were black, and the cops grilled them with stressful interrogations for 24 hours until they finally &quot;confessed.&quot; They all later recanted their confessions, but jerks like Donald Trump believe this is fake. But it's not fake, the science shows that high-pressure interrogation can make anyone confess to things they didn't do. And those five teenagers really were innocent, the real rapist later confessed to the crime (freely, not after stressful interrogation) and they were all exonerated. But plenty of people are still convinced the five guys committed the crime. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>In his mind, something is true because he thinks it's true. It's beyond narcissism, it's bordering on delusions of godhood.</p>
<p>He paid for full-page ads in all four major NYC papers back in 1989, he has 'nailed his colors to the mast' on the issue.</p>
<p>For him, admitting to making an error isn't about facts but about an attack upon his 'aura of infallibility', for someone with a deluxe-sized ego like him, that is pretty close to unimaginable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>they just want another tool they can use to punish people they &quot;know&quot; are guilty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or another tool to absolve management of responsibility for decisions.</p>
<p>There are a number of questionable practices where &quot;numbers out of a computer&quot; are used to make decisions. If the decision is bad, &quot;Well, the computer simulation/algorithm said it was the best decision&quot;, can be used as an excuse, and that has value. Not to the company, maybe, but to the people who make decisions.</p>
<p>It's not so much about whether the devices determination is actually better in an objective sense than tossing a coin, but that it's more justifiable. The guy who goes with a decision spat out of a computer doesn't get fired, but the guy who tosses a coin does, even when the computer is right half the time and wrong half the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's foolish to think polygraphs dont work actually. people think it's suppose to detect lies but that's not what it does. it can't read people's minds. it shows level of stress. all your biometrics are being monitored while they interrogate you. it adds on to their best guess analysis for whether you told the truth or not. that's why polygraphs are still around. there is no hard science behind it but if it's suspicious, then you're out. it can't prove you killed someone, that's all. that's why it shouldnt be used in court. </p>
<p>for example, if they asked you all your publicly available information and you're not stressed at all then suddenly they ask you about your job history and you spike. the guy interrogating can see that and probe more into certain parts. later on they go back over the information with the video, they might notice you were more stressed when asked certain questions than others. </p></div>		</li>
