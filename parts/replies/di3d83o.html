			<div class="markdown"><p>Was watching &quot;Anne with an E&quot; which is the modern remake of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; on Netflix.</p>
<p>There's a side-story there about a 16yo girl having &quot;intimate relations&quot; with the teacher.  Anne being from an orphanage and having been a foster child several times had more knowledge about sex than was &quot;appropriate&quot; for her age.</p>
<p>So, Anne not fully comprehending the seriousness of this went ahead and told her classmates, naively thinking he had a &quot;pet mouse in his pocket.&quot;... but also knew the sounds that her previous foster parents had made while playing with said mouse.</p>
<p>Anyhow the TL/DR is that Anne was punished for mentioning it... The girl who was having inappropriate relations with the teacher was not, nor was the teacher.  Everyone preferred to ignore the obvious, turn a blind eye, and anyone who didn't was punished.</p>
<p>I'm guessing that was actually the more historically-correct version that the previous didn't fully cover.  I've heard many stories about women going off to &quot;visit their aunt&quot; or similar... but I hadn't thought about what people would do when they became aware of their goings on even before that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the 40% of nuns were abused claim. </p>
<p>That's a bit of a stretch. </p>
<p>40% of the nuns that returned a mailed survey reported sexual trauma at some point in their life. </p>
<p>It was mostly at the hands of a family member as a child. </p>
<p>Sadly, 40% wouldn't be much different from the general population of the US in the 1900s. </p>
<p>From the survey &quot;While most of the abuse came at the hands of a male family member, about <strong>9 percent of the cases were attributed to abuse by priests, nuns or other religious people.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One in eight nuns said she had been sexually exploited. Of those, nearly three of every four maintained she was victimized by a priest, nun or other religious person. The exploitation included everything from pressure for &quot;dates&quot; to requests for sexual favors to sexual intercourse.&quot;</p>
<p>So 3/4 of 1/8 were sexually exploited by religious members which could be as simple as asking for a date or as severe as full on sex. </p>
<p>&quot;Slightly fewer than one in 10 nuns said she was subjected to sexual harassment at least once during her religious life.</p>
<p>Almost half of those were reported to be at the hands of priests, nuns or other religious people.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They wrote about several things and shifted topics several times. </p>
<p>But a lot of the nuns alive in the 90s were alive in the 30s. Nuns have a high median age.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man what would it be like to exist in that environment? Where everyone knows the truth, everyone knows that the perpetrator is acting in direct violation of every idea or principle that brings you all together, supposed dictations directly from the most <strong>awesome powerful being in existance</strong>, yet they walk around with their pious heads held high, berating others for falling asleep during last Sunday's service, and you don't ever say a word, or <strong><em>you'd</em></strong> be shunned, exiled, abused and dismissed? What kind of life was that? How did that affect a person's view of life, themselves, humanity in general?  I can't even imagine.  Wow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure there's a lot of commonality, but not to the degree that I'm picturing. I was imagiing a younger guy or girl, maybe still in training or mentorship at the rectory, and experiencing these hypocrisies for the first time. So while simultaneously learning how deep they go, and exactly how much of what you had been taught was not only good and pure, but also sacred, iron-clad, and indomitable, was supported entirely by lies and a strict, toxic silence.</p></div>		</li>
