<p>Breasts, unlike hands, attract a mate</p>
<p>Hormones make breasts large (preferred when mating)</p>
<p>Hormones can lead to breasts of different sizes (not preferred when mating)</p>
<p>Hormones also weaken immune system (Not preferred when mating)</p>
<p>Thus, a woman with large breasts that are the same size has good genes (optimal for mating)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your summary doesn't really answer the question though and only explained why breasts are attractive.</p>
<p>I think the key point was that breast size and symmetry are at odds with each other due to both being caused be increased hormones. Because of this, the end result is greater variation in size than other body parts, since larger breasts are simultaneously at higher risk of being asymmetrical, making the genes for larger breasts not universally superior for the sexual selection involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this perhaps explain (at least in part) the male fascination with breasts? From a sexual selection standpoint, breast evaluation would be ideal, I imagine. They're front and center, easily accessible, and barring surgery, what you see is pretty much what you get. If you can tell that much about the gene quality of a woman from just looking at her boobs, it might explain why men are so fixated with them. Yes? No? Maybe?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very likely. Similar evolution selected indicators of health include long hair (indicator of good health) and facial symmetry. The facial symmetry especially is impacted by immune issues just like breast symmetry and in men masculine facial features are especially attractive and just like womens breasts masculine facial features are created by hormones, in this case testosterone, which reduces immune system function and can result in deminished health and therefore symmetry. So just like women men also have to balance between having testosterone enough to have good facial features while maintaining good health to avoid facial asymmetry and the ability to do so is a strong indicator of good robust genes. </p>
<p>Edit: People are interested in butts. That one is less clear. Its easy enough to hypothesize all sorts of selective pressures from health (larger muscles or fat stores), selective pressures towards early hominids when our ancestors first went bipedal (bigger butt, better walker/runner), even sooner because of our ancestors preferred hunting technique of chasing down animals until they were exhausted (bigger butt, able to run for longer), even more recently than that as humans dispersed across the globe in the last 125-75 thousand years (bigger butt, able to run for longer and cover all sorts of different terrains), or simply due to its proximity to the genitals (especially when we still did it doggy style exclusively), or some combination of these or something entirely different. It is unlikely that it was a single factor that pushed for it but Id put my money on walking/running being a major aspect of it at some point in our evolutionary history. Whether that evolutionary pressure created the sexual pressure or maybe a sexual pressure started the behavior in the first place (lots of species do stand up on hind limbs to appear dominant when fighting over mates) is something we will likely never know but im sure there are a lot of great psychologists asking these sorts of questions. If you are interested there is likely some literature on it in evolutionary psychology circles and definitely several ideas in anthropology and social psychology theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say is something to do with feeding young. animals get big breasts/nipples when they have babies too. maybe just evolved to like big ones since they should mean the woman is fertile (breasts also get bigger around ovulation). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if it is our fascination with symmetry, and in turn circular object? Pure speculation but what if this also a possible reason why African tribes dont cover the breast, their breast simply are not appealing? I realize there are other reasons why they do not cover up their breasts, sexualization ect. Ect. But as humans, we pick out patterns, and symmetry has always appealed to us as a species. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Penis size is interesting in that it correlates with almost nothing.</p>
<p>To my memory there's no genetic component, so that means that large and small penised men may have different rates of breeding, but offspring will have penis sizes totally independent of their parentage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is genetic, but hard to trace for the same reason that all secondary sexual traits are hard to trace.</p>
<p>Half of your genes come from each parent, and very few are carried exclusively by the Y chromosome that comes from dad.  The genes that influence penis size, shape, and development are complex and come from both parents.  Of course your mother is just a &quot;carrier&quot; of these genes, as she doesn't have one herself, so it's very difficult to &quot;follow&quot; the inheritance through the maternal side.</p>
<p>Additionally, like all secondary sexual characteristics, including voice pitch, body hair, breast development, etc. they don't exist in childhood and are later &quot;activated&quot; by the presence of testosterone and estrogen.  Trouble is, a person's natural testosterone and estrogen levels are <em>also</em> genetic and inherited from both parents.  It's also believed that the mother's blood testosterone levels while a male baby is developing in the whom can also tweak things in one direction or the other.</p>
<p>In other words:  penis size is absolutely genetic.  But the genetic influence comes in multiple developmental stages, some direct and some indirect through hormone levels, and is difficult if not impossible to &quot;trace&quot; all of these back through both sides of a family to really see the connection.</p></div>		</li>
