			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I just want to say to OP: Wonderful question! I love these types of eli5 questions. I love a question that makes me think &quot;that is the dumbest fucking question ever. Wait. Why is there sand where the sea meets the shore? Why are the grains uniform? Why have I never questioned this!&quot; </p>
<p>Really, cool question. Thanks for asking it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To slightly add on to this, there is a fish called the Parrot Fish. It eats dead coral and poops out most of the solid coral material which comes out as crushed particles. those particles then get washed on to the shore creating more beach sand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not the full picture, most sand comes from inland in many parts of the world. Maybe sand is produced from existing rocks in the ocean or at the edges of land but you're answer is what many people believe is the full story</p>
<p>There is a good minute earth video that explains why most sand is the same size that discusses how beaches form.</p>
<p>The view that rocks at or near the edge of the land are broken down to form beaches is missleading, many beaches have been ruined by well meaning people trying to 'seed' new sand formation..</p></div>		</li>
