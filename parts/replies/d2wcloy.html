			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually, yes, but it would take more than just a few years.</p>
<p>First, sunlight is <em>way</em> brighter than any ordinary light bulb. Humans have trouble appreciating just how much brighter, because your eye has a logarithmic response to light (doubling the physical brightness does not double the perceived brightness) and furthermore your pupils automatically reduce the amount of incoming light in bright conditions, meaning it won't look as much brighter as it really is.</p>
<p>In bright sunlight, a given square meter of ground is receiving about 1000 watts of sunlight. That already sounds like a lot compared to a typical 60W light bulb, but then you need to consider that an incandescent light is only something like 2% efficient, so it's only giving off around 1W of light. Sunlight is <em>bright</em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the higher-energy the light, the more likely it is to damage molecules. Sunlight has quite a bit of UV light in it, whereas an incandescent bulb produces virtually none. It would take a very, very long time for a typical indoor light to bleach the color from something (unless the dye is particularly non-lightfast, of course).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically, UV radiation from sun is the wavelength that does the majority of damage to exposed objects. UV radiation is particular damaging to matters normal arrangement of molecules. If the lightbulb puts out lots of light in the UV spectrum, then yes - you will get the same effect. You could buy a UV bulb (the kind they use for growhouses) and produce noticeable fade in weakly bound dyes in a matter of days. If I leave my fertilizer bottles close to my grow lamps, the plastic bottles and its labeling with show noticeable fade in just 2-3 days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The final product doesn't <em>have</em> to be colorless, it's just that it very often is. There is a general reason for this effect, namely that the electronic transitions of simple organic compounds mostly lie in the UV part of the electromagnetic spectrum. This fact explains why if you go through the chemical closet in an organic lab, most compounds will look like boring white powders. In order to create an absorption band in the visible, we usually have to create large and complicated structures, like the extended ring structure in the orange dye I used as an example. As these structures fall apart (either due to light or chemical bleaching), you usually create smaller fragments, which again can no longer absorb in the visible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what is the relationship between the wavelength and molecule size to obtain absorption? I assume the photons get absorbed and push electrons onto higher energy state and when they fall back they release a photon of a much longer wavelength (thermal) so we don't see the reflected light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most chemicals do not absorb (or emit) light in the visible spectrum, so they are colorless to us. Only very few chemicals do appear to be colored, which typically is due to aromatic systems or conjugated double bonds (as the OP mentioned), which are comparatively uncommon. </p>
<p>The products of degradation by light, which are photochemically stable, are no exception; they will typically lose their double bonds or aromaticity and thus be colorless. There may be some exceptions, of course, but this is rarely the case. Also, not every molecule with an aromatic system or conjugated double bonds is colored. Understanding the chemistry of color can actually become quite complicated. </p>
<p>This is a simplification, but that's also the reason they are photochemically stable; because they do not absorb wavelengths of light which are damaging to chemical bonds, they do not degrade. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is because our body actively produces more melanin on exposure to UV light. This evolved as a protective mechanism, as UV light can damage the skin and cause cancer. </p>
<p>If though, as a thought experiment, you were to stay out in the sun after death (therefore after your body is able to synthesize melanin), you would indeed fade and lighten in the same manner as anything else does. </p>
<p>This would never happen though because this fading process usually takes months or years, and the body decomposes in days-weeks, much faster in heat (which usually comes with direct sunlight). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies, unlike dye compound, are alive (if yours isn't, you may want to see a doctor. Or a priest.  Nor am I sure about zombie tans.)  As a result, our bodies will produce a pigment, melanin, to absorb UV light in order to protect the important bits from the damaging UV rays.</p></div>		</li>
