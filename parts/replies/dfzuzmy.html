			<div class="markdown"><p>This does not solve the question though, it just begs it. Where did the japanese got the idea to include S rank above A in the test scoring system then?</p>
<p>Surely there is a sort of perfectly rational explanation for it. Or maybe not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because then a casual gamer couldn't get a score of an &quot;A&quot; even if they play the level extremely well. Adding more ranks lets you actually see how you've done. Think of it like todays games with trophies. You can play through the whole game and do a ton of stuff but only get 80% of the trophies. The rest are for people who are super serious about the game and will try to do literally everything because they like to. </p></div>		</li>

<p>My only thought is that Shū means excellent in Japanese, which also happens to be the kanji version of the &quot;S grade.&quot; So perhaps the S comes from Shū.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It spread to Korean games as well. Pump It Up (the Korean equivalent of DDR) has three &quot;S&quot; ranks:</p>
<p>-Silver S: no misses, but still had at least 1 bad and/or 1 good</p>
<p>-Gold S: no misses, bads or goods</p>
<p>-Double S: all perfects</p></div>		</li>
