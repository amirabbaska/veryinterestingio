<p>After looking up what &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astringent" target="_blank">astringent compunds</a>&quot; are, it makes sense that you'd want liquid. Which are those?</p>

<p>What does that have to do with wanting liquid?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just one of those things. Two factors would be most at work I think, the first would be the general acidity of dark chocolate. Acid has a &quot;drying&quot; effect on the palette, and is the crisp, fresh sensation from a good dry wine. (Note that dry in this sense doesn't mean devoid of moisture, but has to do with sugar)</p>
<p>The other would be tannin, the same thing that makes the skin of an apple so... something indescribable beyond tart. It's the stuff in wine and most fruit skins that have that same quality, and dark chocolate has it too. </p>
<p>The actual mechanism is that tannin makes certain signals in your mouth think it's got a full loud of saliva, so it shuts down production. You breath, and it actually DOES dry your mouth out. It gives you that sharp, &quot;Puckering&quot; feeling, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>The opposite of that effect, &quot;drying&quot; is a coating effect. The result of a coat of lipids and/or sugars on your tongue is to release lots of saliva. So, in essence, we get off on shifting back and forth between extremes in our palette. We like to shift from full salivation, to no salivation, and back. It's like getting that first taste of a good steak, in theory, you maximize that sensation with this process.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And astringent compounds dry your mouth out. Caffeine, theobromine (toxic to dogs) are some astringent compounds in chocolate. A lot of bitter compounds like them are astringent</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. Whenever I eat a little piece of e.g. Lindt 99% cocoa chocolate, I absolutely NEED something to drink together with it (usually a cup of coffee or an espresso). Although for me it is not so much &quot;thirst&quot; and more &quot;need something to help dissolve it so that it goes down&quot; :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yeah, it dissolves in the mouth, I enjoy the taste, but there is always some left stuck to the tongue etc. afterwards and that's where the coffee helps :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Be warned though! (At least in my country) some 70%-80% dark chocolates are lie! A lot of brands say they are 80% cocoa while label says 50g sugar of 100g chocolate or similar values.</p>
<p>Most of the time 'dark chocolate' has more sugar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the case here, German consumer protection laws are pretty strict.<br />
Anyway, the chocolate I buy is at the very high end (25g are between 2.5-4.5â‚¬) at those certainly are very cacao-y ;)</p></div>		</li>
