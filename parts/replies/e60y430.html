			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on your tastebuds. The less you exercise the more tender your meat will be, while if you do exercise a lot you'll be a lot more lean. Your diet has a factor too, which determines the type and quantity of fat and therefore flavour found in your body.</p>
<p>The cattle raised for Wagyu beef are massaged frequently, never move around much and are fed extremely rich food such as olives and beer, which results in the incredible marbling that Wagyu beef is known for. Basically you'll taste better if you're fat, lazy and eat a lot of good food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diet plays a huge part. Store-bought, grain-fed chicken tastes different than true free-range chicken that eat bugs and just whatever they find. Even their eggs taste different </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does lamb specifically have such a strong taste compared to other meats? A lamb chop can have the exact same marbling and fat content as a pork chop yet they don't even taste nearly the same</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually that's because it's grass-fed lamb. If you have grain-finished lamb (it eats grains for the last couple months of its life) than it will taste a lot less gamey. It's all in the diet and flavors introduced through what it eats. There are probably differences in the species that give the different flavors but the effect of diet is so strong that someone who doesn't like lamb but does enjoy beef will probably enjoy grain-finished lamb. It might be hard to find outside the US, though.</p></div>		</li>
