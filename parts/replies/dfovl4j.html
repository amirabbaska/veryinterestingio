			<div class="markdown"><p>The real answer is 1. it is an email provider and it needs to talk to yahoo, microsoft, comcast, aol and every other email provider. And none of them support end to end encryption by default let alone over a standard protocol.</p>
<p>And if you really want to there are plugins encryption plugins for email clients that fully support end to end encryption. These are a pain to use of they haven't gained much popularity.</p>
<p>I mean anything can become end to end encrypted even facebook posts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They certainly can be, the issue in this ELI5 thread is people simply not understanding how end-to-end encryption works, and the difficulties of adding such a thing to email.</p>
<p>People focus mainly on &quot;google wants money so they search your emails&quot;, using that as an actual reason. Sure, I have no doubt they use email data for targeted ads (which is why you shouldn't use Gmail if you object to it), but fail to see the technical difficulties of offering end-to-end encryption for all their users. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1 is no more &quot;the real&quot; answer than the others. GMail could easily add a feature to send e2e encrypted email within the GMail system completely seamlessly. GMail or any other provider could &quot;show the way&quot; by using or creating an encryption standard that can be used easily by other providers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;creating an encryption standard that can be used easily by other providers.&quot;</p>
<p>I am kind of sincicial but these I haven't seen people create many new open standards these days. HTML5 is the only one I know of off the top of my head.</p>
<p>Assuming you ignore everyone else except gmail. E2e encryption for email is hard because you need to do the initial key exchange, and identity verification has always been the biggest hurdle. Signal and whatsapp do it by using your phone and having restrictions. And e2e email encryption has been tried many times before and there are still free plugins that you can use to make any email provider e2e encrypted. It just isn't worth it for most providers to provide this functionality. If you don't trust me how much of a pain in the ass key exchange is then you should download &quot;Enigmail&quot; and you will see how key exchange is a pain in the ass especially to people who don't care as much as you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the biggest impediment to true end-to-end encryption is the fear of a lost key. If google truly implemented it correctly for email then they'd literally have no way to help anyone who lost their key...their email would be gone forever.</p>
<p>Of course google gets revenue from email but I think it's likely only a trivial amount compared to search. I think the biggest fear they'd have would be lost keys and not lost revenue. There is probably also a fear of becoming a haven for criminals because criminals tend to need end-to end. And no, I'm not suggesting only criminals need privacy; I'm suggesting that criminals need privacy more than just about anyone.</p>
<p>One thing I think you may be incorrect on is if google built the client correctly it could be possible to search your emails locally once you've decrypted them. Granted you would not be able to search them in the cloud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But WhatsApp also has my private key. If I log into a new phone or WhatsApp Web with my account I can read all my messages, so it has to be stored anywhere else too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>WhatsApp web opens a connection to your phone and performs every request through it. Do you never notice the screen saying, &quot;keep your phone connected&quot;?</p>
<p>When transferring to a new phone you generally sync stuff from one phone to the other. That is the point at which your old messages and keys are transferred. If you lose your old phone and didn't have the data stored in The Cloud somehow, you won't be able to get access to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah seems I forgot that ... Last time my phone broke and I set it up new I had to wait for my conversation partners to come online so I could read the old messages - I guess the keys get transferred from there phones back then, but I completely forgot that!</p></div>		</li>
