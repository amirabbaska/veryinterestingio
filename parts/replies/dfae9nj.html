			<div class="markdown"><p>As an example, people who do not watch wrestling just see someone do a wrestling move.</p>
<p>To those that follow wrestling they just saw Seth Rollins do a Pedigree. That is Triple H's finishing move and the reason he did it was because he used to be a member of the SHEILD and Triple H paid off Seth Rollins to break up the SHIELD. Now that Seth Rollins and Triple H hate hate eachother because of what Triple H did during the fatal four way match, Seth Rollins used that move to say &quot;I am coming for you.&quot; We now know they are about to feud and that the match is going to be a Pedigree vs Pedigree match, something we have never seen before. </p>
<p>All of that storytelling told in 3 seconds, with one wrestling move, and no words. That is the magic of pro wrestling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My boyfriend is into pro wrestling and he always tries to explain stuff like this to me. He's been watching since he was a kid and knows all the history and stuff. I am decidedly not into wrestling and it just goes in one ear and out the other. Interesting that it happens in text form too my eyes just glazed over when I tried to actually read that. </p>
<p>I don't hate wresting I've tried to watch it with my bf and just can't do it. The roided up greasy sweaty oily half naked guys gross me out, the half naked women obviously have no appeal to me, and the storylines and acting are just too over the top for me. I feel bad that I can't participate in this interest of his but I just can't do it. </p>
<p>For what it's worth he hates a lot of what they're doing these days with so many pay per views and shoving wrestlers fans don't like down their throats. Is it Roman reigns that he hates? Who was the guy that wwe hyped up that the fans booed?</p>
<p>Edit: the guys always look like they're soaking wet like they just got out of the shower. I think that's what grosses me out. </p></div>		</li>
