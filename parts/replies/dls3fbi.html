			<div class="markdown"><p>Right now, because of the complexity of quantifying recovery from traumatic brain injuries (what is considered recovered? regain of cognitive function? regain of cells? how do we measure these metrics accurately?), less is known about the brain. Since fracture repair can be quantified quite easily (how much bone tissue is formed? is there a union? how strong is the new bone?), we know there is evidence of faster bone regeneration with an additional  traumatic brain injury.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The guess there is that a brain injury causes more of them to circulate through your blood stream, leading to a better &quot;cleaning&quot; of the fracture site, and faster healing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there's more too! Additionally, macrophages may also change their phenotype from the classic &quot;white blood cell&quot; that we know to attack, protect, but most importantly collect into another phenotype that promotes angiogenesis, bone formation, and recruitment of other growth factors. The macrophage is an increasingly important cell type in these healing responses!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clinically, it definitely looks like it. I've seen plenty of TBI patients get super robust callus formation at the fracture site. The patients with traumatic brain injuries lay down a ton of extra bone precursor (callus) at the fracture and in my experience, it all solidifies into a super stable mass of bone. </p>
<p>But I've never bothered to check if there's actual data on it. It just &quot;eyeballs&quot; very similar to it. Assumed it was a part of the same spectrum. </p>
<p>Edit: Looks like it.

<p>Intuitively it made sense, so I'd never bothered to look up. Researchers lump it into excessive bone formation, whether hypertrophic callus or heterotopic ossification. So I'm going with yes. </p></div>		</li>

Who knows, maybe there is a connection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this have anything to do with hair growth increasing and darker and coarser hair than normal growing around healing sites?  Guys I met in orthopedic wards that had had major accidents like me seemed to have similar experiences with hair. (Long term the hair went away.)</p></div>		</li>
