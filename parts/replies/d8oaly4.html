Should we then strive to get into a harsh desert landscape to explore it? That's a closer analogy to what you're talking about. Having said that I totally agree with above sentiments about becoming an intergalactic species. It's just that I'll be sitting here smoking this scooby, y'know?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes. Because sooner or later, the shade, streams, fruit and women are going to get boring, and we'll have done everything there is to do in the oasis.</p>

<p>I mean, that's the only option for any one individual anyway, so who gives a fuck. Not my personal feelings but a lot of people just want to live well instead of paying money for abstract goals of future generations. </p></div>		</li>
