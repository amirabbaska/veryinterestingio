			<div class="markdown"><p>I experience sleep paralysis once or twice a year and aside from the first few times, I do find it kind of fun now! </p>
<p>I always remind myself what it is and start trying to move my fingertips which then eventually leads to a chain reaction of returned movement. I can always move my eyes though.</p>
<p>The last couple of times its happened I've seen a shadow demonic figure hovering above me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I think a lot of people see a shadowy figure. I've never seen one though and I've had sleep paralysis a LOT. But that was mostly when my sleep habits were all over the place. Either way, must have experienced it about a hundred times and never seen a figure. I wonder why</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only had it once, and it occurred while I was having some other dream. </p>
<p>I was sleeping in bed with my girlfriend, but the dream was also occurring in the same place. I literally was dreaming that I was sleeping in the same time and place with the same person as I was in reality. As a result, the lines of reality were blurred, if not totally gone. </p>
<p>I begin to notice footsteps and rustling coming from the hallway outside my studio apartment. Nothing crazy, people do walk after all. But it continues. It goes on for what seems like ten minutes, not stopping, someone moving outside the hallway constantly. Who the hell is shuffling around this small stretch of hallway at 3am?</p>
<p>Suddenly I smell gasoline. Pungent and strong, so strong it would take a huge amount to get under the door and in the apartment. My imagination conjures up the hallway outside with inches of gasoline pooling on the floor. Fear sets in as I put the smell of gasoline together with the suspiciously long presence of the strangers outside. This is a studio apartment, there's only one way out. Through the gasoline soaked hallway and the strangers outside. </p>
<p>Quiet as I possibly can be, I lean over and roll out of bed, careful not to disturb the mattress and alert the potential arsonists outside. As deft as I can manage, I am creep towards the front door, only a few feet away from the bed. I plant my body against it, to stop anything that might try and get in. I cautiously slide up to the peephole and place my eye to the aperture. </p>
<p>I see the black, gloved fingers of something covering the peephole. The growing dread plunges into to sudden and unrestrained terror. These people are going to burn us to death and we will have no way out. All at once my head is filled with images of the flaming hallway, no escape, neighbors burning as their skin grows red and sloughs off. I want to scream, to alert my girlfriend, alert everyone </p>
<p>But now I'm in my bed again, awake but completely unable to move. Somehow I'm still experiencing the dream, fear and terror gripping my mind, convinced we are about to burn to death, simultaneously imagining and dreaming the fire and neighbors burning outside, not yet aware that the entire thing isn't real. I'm trying to move, to jump up and fight the strangers outside. To try and save us. I have to, I have to! We're going to die! Why can't I move!?!?? </p>
<p>And I vault out of bed, leaping straight off the mattress and slamming directly into the wall immediately before the bed. I get my voice back too and I scream from the bottom of my lungs, a mixture of mortal fear and crazed kill or be killed desperation. By the time I find my feet, I've realized everything. That the whole thing was a dream, that we aren't in danger, and that my face fucking hurts from the wall. My girlfriend has come to, and is now panicked and terrified of whatever I'm scared of, despite not knowing what it is, or indeed that the danger isn't real at all. I spend the next 10 minutes explaining out the dream and calming her down down we could both sleep again. But God damn, I've never experienced fear like that before. Convinced we were going to die and completely paralyzed to react, it's unreal. </p>
<p>TLDR: Sleep paralysis is fucking scary yo </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive had virtually the same experience minus seeing the figure. I usually feel a presence in the room though. Like the feeling you get when someone is watching you x50. Its so intense that I feel like I should be getting away from it immediately </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once you learn to control it, it's like jumping between universes. Last time I went from our world being invaded by aliens to a world where everything was animated like an old Speed Racer cartoon. Before every time I switch worlds my head starts to feel &quot;crunchy&quot; for lack of a better term and I hear what sounds like radio static. When that static starts I know the paralysis will soon follow, so I try to hold that crunchy static feeling for as long as I can. Soon enough, I'm in between worlds where I'm falling through blackness and what I hear is akin to how Bumblebee talks in the new Transformers movies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do both, but I'm quite conscious while doing it. Usually I just very strongly have a particular idea of what I ought to do. It happens especially in places I never slept before or during stressful periods. Once when I slept in the same room with other people I woke up and thought that I had to wake everyone up. I even stood up and walked over to where the others were sleeping, but luckly started to doubt the realness of that quest and decided to sleep on it first.... and woke up the next morning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm usually semiconscious while sleepwalking. I remember it as if it were a particularly vivid dream. Strange stuff. </p>
<p>Similarly to your second story, I was sleeping in a room with friends and, according to someone who was up (he was going to the bathroom I think): I stood up, walked over to someone else, and laid back down on top of him. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't there a study somewhere about throughout the day we build up a certain chemical in the brain fluid, and during sleep we rid ourselves of it?</p>
<p>Edit: I googled it and read exactly 1 full article about it, so now I'm an expert. Apparently, it's toxin buildup in the brain fluid. They've never seen it happen in humans, just mice and other lab animals. I'm assuming it's because the procedure for observing such a phenomenon would be inhumane.</p></div>		</li>
