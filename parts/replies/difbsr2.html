			<div class="markdown"><p>The center of gravity for an object remains the same no matter where around the object you are, so the only thing that really matters is the distance between you and that object. The equation for gravity between the Earth and anything else is G*m(earth)/r^2, so because the mass is the same in both cases it becomes a comparison of distance from the center of gravity. Distance to the center is inversely proportional to force, so by being farther away at the equator you have less force. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shape of the object does matter. That equation assumes perfect sphere.</p>
<p>On the poles the Earth mass is pulling more towards sides weakening the resulting gravity force.</p>
<p>Distance from center makes more of a difference, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because assuming the density is fairly similar then more of the mass is also further away from you on the opposite side of the earth. In practise, local differences in the thickness of the earths crust can in fact affect the strength of gravity slightly.</p></div>		</li>
