<p>It's not they they can't figure out how to make a profit. It's that they need to continue expansion because there is opportunity for them to make tremendous money in the future. But they can't get that future money without spending money now.</p>
<p>Both Amazon and Tesla could be profitable next quarter if they stopped all expansion and R&amp;D. But doing this would kill their share price and cause them to quickly stagnate and most likely fail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes, you are indeed correct when it comes to Netflix and Tesla. However some other smaller tech companies that are still very much &quot;start-ups&quot; haven't figured this out yet, or haven't implemented their planned monetization methods yet.</p></div>		</li>
