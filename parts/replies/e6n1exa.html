			<div class="markdown"><p>Sooooort of. New layers are grown just underneath the bark, which is why if you carve your initials onto the tree, they'll be there for a long time. The tree doesn't turn bark into wood and most trees don't shed. ..they just grow new bark where the bark separates, like arboreal stretch marks.</p>
<p>Edit: I misspoke! Trees do shed. Chunks of older bark do fall off, but with a few exceptions, it's not an annual shedding like a dog in summer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With most trees the appearance of the bark has more to do with how much total growth has happened and less to do with the speed that it grew. Different species will have different looking bark because their bark has different properties. It's one of the ways you can identify similar trees.</p>
<p>Imagine if you halfway inflated a balloon and then painted it. If you pump more air in the balloon the paint will crack. Now for examples sake let's say you added another layer of paint underneath the first one and then pump up the balloon some more. You would likely get cracks all in the same places as the last cracks and maybe a few new ones. This is exactly how bark forms on a tree and you can sort of see how the speed you inflated the balloon has a very little effect on the way the cracks look </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I could answer this! I'm not a proper arborist, just someone who Googles random things that comes into their mind and has pretty decent retention.</p>
<p>In my experience, my community is plagued by tree of heaven, which is super fast growing and invasive. I find that the bark of this tree is much thinner, and more likely to fall off during distress, which minimizes scarring. The same was true of the sycamores I saw when I lived in Cali...super fast growing, but they shed bark in ribbons.</p>
<p>My guess is that if a tree has evolved to grow super fast, it has also evolved to shed bark, or have very thin bark that doesn't lead to deep cracking with growth like you see in thicker-barked trees. It might have something to do with climate, as well...trees with shorter growing seasons might be more about speed than longevity. (edit: though I'm not sure thicker bark leads to longevity, especially in fire prone areas). </p>
<p>But like I said, I'm not an arborist, so take that with a grain of salt! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, that I've noticed. Lots of trees have unique features about their bark, like the mockernut hickory which looks like crossed ropes with large deep furrows, or the common persimmon which looks like blocky alligator skin almost. Both fairly cracked and relatively slow growing. </p>
<p>Then something like the red maple is relatively fast growing, and doesn't have deeply furrowed bark. </p>
<p>I think the biggest difference is just how quickly a certain species exfoliates bark. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone interested. Eucalyptus is probably the most common example of a tree that sheds all it's bark every year. Pacific Madrone ( Arbutus Menzisii) is the only North American tree I know of that does it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't entirely true. The outside of the inside. Cork cambium (sort of like our stem cells), divides to create new bark on the inside of the old bark and sort of pushes it outwards as it grows. </p></div>		</li>
