			<div class="markdown"><p>But -son or -sen are not the same as de la.</p>
<p>In Swedish German and Dutch for example there are suffixes such as:
af, von, van. These aren't common in English names. The very common Dutch surname &quot;van Dijk&quot; means &quot;of (the) dike&quot;, &quot;van den Berg&quot; means &quot;of the mountain&quot;.</p>
<p>Not the same as Johnson, Jensen, Jansen.
In Latin languages, for example the name of the title &quot;de la rosa&quot; is not Rose's son. French names like Dubois or Dumont are combinations of du+place/object. (Dubois=of the forest, Dumont=of the mountain).</p>
<p>In summary, from your post, only the o'[name] comes close to what OP meant.</p>
<p>Edit: I see this has been pointed out as well by others to which you replied, so nevermind :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you might be confused. The names which mean &quot;son of ___&quot; are quite different than the ones preceded by &quot;of the&quot;. In earlier times one indicated your father, e.g. John son of William, son of James, son of Philip, while the others indicate your family's origin or your family's noble house, e.g. John of the Coast or John of the Windsors.</p>
<p>The examples you provided only show the first scenario, but not the second one.</p>
<p>I would say that most languages in Europe have both, do you know how english lost the &quot;of thes&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do in a sense, but in English they usually become part of the surname instead of a prefix you can reconigze. The same goes for dutch, ie: Jansen = 'son of Jan'.</p>
<p>He is asking why you don't have names like 'William the Baker' or 'Daniel of York' or 'John from the Mountain' similair to (dutch) names like  'Thiemo de Bakker', 'Willem van Oranje' or 'Jan van der Berg' or 'Vincent van Gogh'. Even worse, when a dutch name like that pops up you destroy it to, for example 'Hoyt Vanderberg' or you capitalize it incorrectly like 'Martin Van Buren'.</p>
<p>And well, he is correct, i couldn't find a lot of english names with a prefix like 'X of the Y' or 'X the Y' etc. A few: 'Henry VIII of England' or 'William the Conqueror' etc, mainly kings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I understand that, and we do have &quot;The Baker&quot; etc as surnames... we've just dropped the &quot;The&quot;. For example &quot;Smith&quot; is a literal blacksmith or similar, &quot;Baker&quot; is a baker, &quot;Clark&quot; and &quot;Clarkson&quot; are from clerk.</p>
<p>But yeah, English just drops the &quot;The&quot; portion... because we're lazy and do things like that. Or realistically, it happened when the country moved away from &quot;You do the job your father did&quot; and acquired more social (or at least occupational) mobility. It made little sense for me to be called &quot;Jon the Baker&quot; because my father was a baker, when I was actually a cobbler. Once this started, others followed suit out of fashion as much as anything else.</p>
<p>We did have names like &quot;Richard of York&quot;, just as &quot;William of Orange&quot; was a Dutch prince for example, and this is still common i the aristocracy: &quot;The Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Harry Wales&quot;, for example, are the current heir to the throne and his son, respectively.</p>
<p>Common people dropped most of these names quite quickly, and instead adopted the &quot;John Baker&quot; style of naming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the original question is &quot;Why don't they have 'the' in the name?&quot;</p>
<p>We understand that Baker or Smith historically come from Bob the Baker or Bob the Smith. We understand Hill historically come from Bob from the hill. They wisdom is why did English speakers drop &quot;the&quot; or &quot;of the&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can imagine that names based on occupations lost the <em>the</em> because of children.<br />
&quot;It was one of those Thatcher kids who done it.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Who was it?&quot;<br />
&quot;John.&quot;<br />
&quot;Which one?&quot;<br />
&quot;Fletcher, not Sawyer.&quot;    </p>
<p>Especially as tradesmen become sufficiently affluent so that they can send a child to be educated, or into religious or military service.   e.g. Fr. or Lt. Michael Chandler.  </p>
<p>Or maybe one of the Cooper's kids was levied into into service as a pikeman, and one of the Baker's sons was press ganged into becoming a sailor.  If they then settled down away from their families, they'd never resume their apprenticeships.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Harry Wales?</p>
<p>I don't think that's right. But the question of surnames and British royalty can be unexpectedly complicated. I think the actual surname is Windsor-Mountbatten. And he's known as Harry of Wales.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interestingly, Dutch permanent surnames were first formalized not in the Netherlands but in the New World. In the Netherlands, fixed surnames were not mandatory until 1811 during Napoleon's occupation where he made civil registration mandatory.</p>
<p>Before that, Dutch people generally used patronymics. Ander's son became Andersen and Ander's daughter became Anders. But Ander's grandson wouldn't be Andersen, he'd have a different last name. Whatever his own father's first name was.</p>
<p>When the Dutch came to future New York, lots of people had the same name as each other, hence all those &quot;van&quot;s and &quot;van der&quot;s and &quot;de&quot;s. Pieter Andersen van Voorhees was easily separated from Pieter Andersen van der Bilt. </p>
<p>The word for this second surname is called a &quot;cognomen&quot;. It would only be used when needed. If you knew a guy named Dave Thomas, you'd introduce him as Dave Thomas. If you knew two, you'd separate them by saying &quot;Dave Thomas van Wendy's&quot; and &quot;Dave Thomas de SCTV&quot; for example.</p>
<p>When the English took over New York in 1664, nothing much about this system changed at first but by the 1680s, they got tired of all the Dutch mumbo jumbo and required the male landowners in the colony to take an Oath of Allegiance to the English crown in 1687. The colonists did so, many begrudgingly, and it's on that document that many of those names stuck. Those &quot;Vanderbilt&quot;s were Vanderbilts forever from then on, even though they likely would have been &quot;van Manhattan&quot; or &quot;de Breuckelen&quot; in just another generation.</p>
<p>In other words, a lot of those Dutch surnames did not originate in the Netherlands. They originated with Dutch people living under English authorities, and so weren't Anglicized over time, but were Anglicized almost immediately. Often, the family they left back in the Netherlands ended up with a completely different surname when the Dutch acquiesced in 1811. The &quot;van Amsterdam&quot; family back in Amsterdam ended up with something more specific since everyone around them was also &quot;van Amsterdam&quot;.</p>
<p>Some didn't use their cognomen but went with their patronymic, hence the Peters and Peterson style surnames. And some ended up with an entirely new last name, often for reasons lost to time. And some not of their own choosing. There are many, many cases from that period where a person is recorded with a brand new surname by the English and it's the surname that survives to the present day, but in Dutch church records, they continued to use an old surname for several more decades.</p></div>		</li>
