			<div class="markdown"><p>My friends call me a font of useless knowledge, one of those things is ball-point pens. I've always enjoyed learning new things and interesting facts, it doesn't really matter what the knowledge is about. It's one of the reasons that the internet is so great for me, I can lose myself in it just learning things and creating theories to problems I find.</p>
<p>By the way a little bit more about Bic, whose full name is Bic Cristal if I remember correctly, it's a french company that started making the iconic clear 'cristal' plastic pens after WW2. They also created the ink inside of them, one that wasn't so fluid that it would just flow out of the holder, but not so thick that it would gum up around the ball. They opened shop in America some time later, the sixties or so.</p></div>		</li>
