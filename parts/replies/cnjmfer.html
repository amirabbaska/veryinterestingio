			<div class="markdown"><p>Cowpox and vaccinia are actually two distinct viruses. Unfortunately, the origin of vaccinia virus isn't really clear, as it has no natural host and is purely a laboratory virus (and was used in the eradication of smallpox). It's actually more closely related to horsepox than to cowpox, interestingly. It's also possible that it may have speciated from cowpox after continuous passage in humans, but the history behind it is pretty murky.</p>
<p>In terms of that wikipedia article, I'm not sure where they're getting the sentence &quot;The virus, part of the orthopoxvirus family, is so closely related to the vaccinia virus that the two are often spoken of interchangeably&quot;, as I work in a poxvirus lab with vaccinia, and have never heard them being referred to interchangeably. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! That's indeed what happened, and how Edward Jenner first devised the idea as using it as a vaccine against smallpox. The cool thing about orthopoxviruses is that they're all closely related, antigenically speaking, so that infection with one confers protection to most of the others. Unlike influenza for instance, which experiences a good amount of antigenic drift and antigenic shift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is, I believe, how the vaccine was originally discovered in the first place.  </p>
<p>For what its worth, you still don't want to get infected with Vaccinia.  From what I remember of my undergrad Virology courses, it is rather unpleasant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, Vaccinia is not actually cow pox. It more closely resembles horse pox. we don't know where the Vaccinia virus was originally obtained. </p></div>		</li>

<p>No one knows because records don't exist. It didn't just magically appear, just someone forgot to write it down, or else it speciated from horsepox or cowpox at some point and the technology didn't exist to figure out when. This is in the 1800s at some point, so medical technology is quite primitive.</p></div>		</li>
