			<div class="markdown"><p>Cancers require a few factors.  Think of a cell as a traffic stop:  You can get a green, yellow, or red light.  Green and yellow involve proceeding, either freely or cautiously.  Red involves stopping.  Insulin is effectively a green light signal- it can be stopped by a yellow light or stop sign, but if you're speeding enough you've got a high chance of running through these traffic signals.  There's more stuff, like becoming solar powered so it never stops for gas, but these are the big 3 (hyper proliferation, unchecked growth, and a measure of immortality through ignoring apoptotic pathways).</p>
<p>1.a.  Permanently Green Lit.  Whether hypersensitive to growth factors like insulin, or permanently active receptors for cell division in the absence of the normal signal, these cells will grow when other cells don't and divide when large enough to do so.  (See constitutive Tyrosine Kinase expression or loss of intrinsic RAS auto-GTPase function)  </p>
<p>1.b.  Never yellow lit -  normally, a cell will experience a microcosm of self-doubt.  It'll think, gee, am I speeding?  Is this intersection coming up too fast?  Should I pump the brakes?  Cancer cells ignore these yellow checkpoints (see Cyclin D and hypophosphorylation)  </p>
<p>\2. Disabling the &quot;self-destruct/ejector seat&quot; button in all cells.  A cell that sees a yellow light will often hit the brakes.  A cell that sees a pedestrian, or an engine warning light, will stop driving completely and go to a mechanic or scrap the car.  A cancer cell has cut the brakes entirely, never looks at the dash, drives faster than the distant red and blue flashing lights in the rearview, and doesn't care who it runs over.  These cells continue driving long past the point of safety.</p>
<p>Excess insulin drives the cells to grow faster, and this acceleration increases the risk of running a yellow light or a sign.  Even though they only increase the growth of cells, the more cells grow, the higher chance that a traffic mishap occurs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insulin plasma concentrations regulate insulin like growth factors. However, T1DM is an absolute insulin deficiency. These patients have too little insulin because none is being made once the final pancreatic beta cells are destroyed. </p>
<p>This is very different from type 2 patients who have a relative insulin deficiency. They have endogenous insulin and exogenous. They have much higher insulin concentrations. </p>
<p>The insulin both of these patients use is the same. But their plasma concentrations are very different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Related question: How exactly is insulin related to fat/growth and the risk of diabetes? </p>
<p>I'm wondering because I've always had a poor died, lots of junk food, and a <strong>LOT</strong> of soda and energy drinks for maybe 15+ years, but I never get fat. I'm scandinavian, tall - lean and a very high metabolism. Still... If anyone would have gotten diabetes I should have. Same with getting fat. If a normal person had my diet they would be super-fat by now. But my body seems to just burn everything away. I've probably had ultra high insulin levels for soon 2 decades, still, no weight gain and no diabetes (which I have tested myself for many times now). How is that possible? Does a natural high metabolism counter high insulin levels somehow?</p></div>		</li>
