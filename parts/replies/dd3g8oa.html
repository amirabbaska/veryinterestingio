			<div class="markdown"><p>Skin tone matters, but there are several varieties within caste. Appearance and occupation is not enough to define a caste. Although it does hold as a general rule that Brahmins are fairer, concentrated in cities, and more educated - this is not at all a certainty. As Mark Twain put it, India is &quot;the country of hundred nations and a hundred tongues, of a thousand religions and two million gods&quot; There are several other unique ethnic communities that claimed the title of Brahmin. It happened less frequently, and not commonly through the route you suggested. </p>
<p>I'll add to the above commenter. Identity is not only built into caste and associated appearances, but into one's family. A person that exits their community and attempts to integrate into another is left without any foothold. No one is about to allow marriage to a random migrant, regardless of who they claim they are. Without the backing of a community, most social functions such as marriage, funerals and jobs break down. </p>
<p>There are recorded instances of migration from one caste into another. &quot;The Hollow Crown: Ethnohistory of an Indian Kingdom&quot; written by Nicholas B Dirks describes one such instance. A group of laborers(Shudra) separated from a failing kingdom and forged their own new identity as mercenaries. They rebranded themselves as warriors(Khshyatriya) and even allowed a few to become caretakers of temples(Brahmin). The result was a considerably more egalitarian community situated in the foothills of Tamil Nadu. With the rise of the East India Oil Company, they became known as local dacoits that interfered with trade in the region. Eventually, when that situation became untenable, they converted to an agrarian community and are currently mostly farmers(Technically back to Shudra).</p></div>		</li>

<p>So Brahmins were just<em>caretakers</em> of temples? Gee, I thought they'd be at the <em>head</em> of temples, just one step down from the actual gods within.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About 10 years ago, I took a course in college called &quot;Anthropology and History&quot; (about the intersection of the two subjects). My final paper was about conceptions of caste. I read The Hollow Crown as well as an older book by Louis Dumont (Homo Hierarchichus) taking the opposite view (that caste is a rigid system, and that Indian culture is fundamentally different in that aspect). </p>
<p>I'm happy to see that this topic has come up on Reddit. My overall impression from these books and the others I read was that caste was both emphasized by the British as a leadership strategy and also misinterpreted by them. One point that I believe Dirks makes is that the caste system, with Brahmins at the top, was generally supported through texts, but it was the Brahmins who wrote and read texts, so their view became privileged. </p>
<p>My paper looked at some other frameworks with which to understand caste. I proposed considering a concept called &quot;loosely structured actors&quot; proposed in a history of Sherpa Buddhism by Sherry Ortner. My view was that both Dirks and Dumont were too extreme, and that the caste system was more fluid than Dumont supposed, but had more defined rules than Dirks allowed. I remember using the example of Dirks watching an American football game and seeing scoring by touchdown, field goal, and safety and then declaring that scoring could happen in any way conceivable and was an entirely unrigid concept.</p>
<p>Of course, I wasn't really in a strong position to argue against Dirks as a lowly undergrad, but it was an interesting exercise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting that you used the word &quot;community&quot;. When I asked an indian friend if they still talk of caste she said yes, but if you were going to ask about it you would probably use the word community which is more nuanced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/7brTC" target="_blank">This</a> is my skin tone. I'm a Brahmin, and I've lived in South/South-East Asia for most of my life. All of my family still in India have a skin tone pretty close to mine, maybe a tinge darker. IIRC most of the priests (and people, mostly other Brahmins from our extended family) we'd have at weddings  had similar skin tones. </p>
<p>As for behavior, remember that Hindu religious tradition was oral until rather recently - and even now, it's not easy to find a lot of guidance in paper/online form. I have a ton of scripture memorized, and I don't think I've really used a book at any point - my grandfather would teach me when I went to visit. It's not something you could pick up in your spare time, like math or physics or history or whatever. I can't really imagine how a non-brahmin would get the knowledge necessary to become a Brahmin in the pre-modern time.   </p>
<p>Edit: India is a huge place, with a vast variety in culture and language and behavior. What I've said above is true in my experience, but it may well be different for other Indians.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a really big Indian company. A lot of my coworkers were from India. This one time I was chatting with a guy, just rambling about life, and I noticed his access card had the initial J so I asked what it stood for. He said that was his family name and that denoted something about his status. I didn't understand what he was talking about but I perceived he wasn't comfortable explaining it to me so I didn't ask, I didn't want to offend him. I always wondered though. Do you have any idea what he meant?
PS. you have beautiful hands!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also want to add how powerfully evil (or beautiful from the perspective of the upper classes who wanted to retain their status) the invention of caste and karma was.</p>
<p>In Abrahamic religions such as Christianity and Islam, the pauper and Caesar were equal in the eyes of God. Black Americans, for example,  could use the idea of liberation theology based on Christianity to justify their struggle for freedom.</p>
<p>But with the karmic backbone behind caste, the avg Hindu bought into the idea of caste and their staion in life. Their religion taught them not to fight back in this life, but to accept it, and be a good pauper to hopefully be reborn into a higher status in the next life.</p>
<p>And just to add, I am descended from Namboothiri Brahmins. You don't get any more orthodox Brahmin than that. So, this is not some guy named Mike from Kansas, putting down Indians and extolling the virtures of Christianity. Just laying some cold hard truth.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>that's pretty much how most slaves and poor people in the west would have thought for most of history. instead of a better rebirth, they would have looked to being rewarded in heaven. </p>
<p>the rebels among black slaves or white serfs would have been few and suppressed with violence. in the larger view, christians were fine with slavery as an institution for more than a thousand years. abolitionism was a late movement. even today, there exists the ideology of the prosperity gospel which regards wealth as a blessing to those favored by god. </p>
<p>on the other hand, there were voices of dissent among hindus which criticized the notion of caste. you can find significant examples of these in the bhakti movement, which emphasized love for god above all else and made saints out of devotees of various caste backgrounds. there's also been a consistent emphasis on the virtues of asceticism and renunciation among many hindu traditions. this has served as motivation for some to give up wealth and power to seek out the spiritual life as a mendicant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much like the difference between the Great Chain and the Corporate Ladder. In medieval Europe, at least you had the comfort of belief that you were needed in your station - that your life meant something where you were.</p>
<p>Under the Ladder, if you have a bad life, it's because you're a stupid, lazy person who isn't strong enough to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and succeed.</p>
<p>Yes, hyperbole in both cases, but the contrast is interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate on this, mobility as we know it today just wasn't possible back then. You couldn't just quit your job and move to another city. People were attached to their extended families and their ancestral piece of land or business. Transport wasn't easy, you couldn't hire a uhaul and move across the country, even if you could, in a country that speaks so many languages as India does, your radius of mobility was probably limited to a couple hundred kilometers. This is where the traditional Indian family unit comes into play, the extended family unit stayed together but women of reproductive age were married to neighboring villages, their female offspring would be married to other villages. Visits between linked family units would have been common. This way there was an established communication network between villages. And in villages of a couple hundred families, if one family left, it would be conspicuous, if a family showed up it would be conspicuous. So the essentially the radius of this communication network in most cases probably was greater than the radius of practical mobility even if you could abandon your property and extended family and leave.</p>
<p>There are other cultural factors too as other have mentioned. There are a lot of languages in India and those languages have a lot of distinct variations within them. Growing up in a Brahmin family, my Kannada was very different than the Kannada someone from a lower caste would speak. My family's kannada would be more formal, with a larger vocabulary because if you grew up in a Brahmin family you had the advantage of educated grandparents and parents who passed on their knowledge through oral tradition that forms the backbone of Indian culture. </p>
<p>Food habits. Again, I'll take the example of Brahmins, because that's the family I grew up in, but it is equally true of other castes as well. Brahmins have certain dietary restrictions and practices that are not followed by others. I'd venture so far as to say one can make out another persons caste based on their cooking practices/food choices. A fisherman is a low caste, what does he eat? fish. See how one can tell by what one eats their caste?</p>
<p>Clothing. Higher caste individuals would have garb and jewelry that displayed their status and influence, lower castes would not. </p>
<p>Lastly, I'm no proponent of the caste system, despite the fact that I was favored by it. It's a broken antiquated system that has no place in our modern society. However, one must understand it's utility in premodern times to understand it's impact properly. Back in pre-modern times, caste served a significant societal function, to organize society into occupational verticals. You inherited your caste and along with it your occupation. The textbooks that say there are four main castes oversimplify the complexity of the system. Weavers were their own caste, potters were their own caste, bankers were their own caste and so on, but they under four major categories. So in addition to dictating your occupation, your caste also served as sort of a guild, a union even, and gave people of that caste certain bargaining powers. For example in Varanasi, one can see the funeral pyres burning in the open alongside the river in cremation ghats. The fires need to be stoked, only the Dohms, individuals of a specific caste take on this responsibility. This gives them certain powers. Nobody wants corpses, not cremated lying by the riverside. So belonging to your caste was often a utility even if you were low caste. So the idea that the caste system has always been this evil oppressive system where the Brahmins just shat on everyone else is exaggerated, it was of utility, at least for a large portion of the population. Over the last century it's lost its relevance and mutated into something oppressive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just that -- how exactly do you just pack up and move in a society that back then was one of the most overpopulated in the world, just as it is now?</p>
<p>This wasn't the Oklahoma Land Rush or something of the sort -- every piece of land was already occupied by someone. </p>
<p>And it wasn't modern industrialized India, in which there are jobs in the cities. It was an agricultural society. </p>
<p>So if you are poor and have nothing, and you decide to move to a far away place, you would be poor and have nothing there too. </p></div>		</li>
