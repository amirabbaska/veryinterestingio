			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm too - working in a coffee roasting warehouse distributor we provide lower prices to wholesale accounts, but require order minimums and we don't want to deal with a single order for a one time purchase.  We make agreements to sell to other businesses because we want them to order regularly to restock.  This means continued business.  For all the time spent to setup and account for you, just to order once, is a lot of wasted money.  Unless you're going to order more than $1,000 worth of product, we aren't going to do a 1-off wholesale order.  But if you bought $1,000 worth of coffee just for your home, it would take you 2 years to consume if you drank 80 ounces a day of brewed drip coffee.  usually by 6 months your coffee is expired...so as you can see, you'll have wasted $750.  That's why we would rather refer you to our rental side of the business for smaller orders.  In many cases, several businesses don't even qualify for our wholesale because all they need to order is 10lbs of coffee a month - where as real wholesale customers order around 80lbs a month along with cups, stirrers, filters, sauces, airpots, lids and other accessories.</p>
<p>As well, many wholesale companies do not have store fronts to deal with small transactions.  They make agreements to other businesses to be the storefront.  This way, they can negotiate lower terms and regulate bulk distribution based on Pallet, rather than box.  They send all of their goods via LTL, and that means less in shipping</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just depends on where you are.  But when you have customers that order 80lbs of coffee, along with a dozen other cafe items like cups, filters, sugar, creamers, syrups, sauces, chai, and teas - you make good money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically a distributor will have a &quot;cash sale&quot; account. No need to set up an account for one sale. If the product is stocked individually, there shouldn't be any issue. If the product is bulk stocked, or has to be ordered from the manufacturer I can see your point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And I would think 90% of wholesalers are not busy 100% of their day, where a small sale to 1 time buyer is actually costing them more money in wages than they make on the purchase.  </p>
<p>Their sales counter is likely manned anyways and unless they have a constant line, a small 1-time sale is not costing them any more money.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Used to order and work for over of these places and we were probably the customer you didn't like. We bought cases and our deliveries were delivered as probably a half a truck per week, split into 2 deliveries. But our size was just so that if we ordered expected amounts, there is likely to be a lot of waste, or our storage wasn't sufficient. We needed to stay 1/2 step ahead. So just as often, if there was something unexpected, we would need to run out and pick it up. So we would source from a company like yours as well as a Costco if needed, as well as maybe random grocery store visits. </p>
<p>Also, to add to what someone else said, our wine rep would often bring in wines to sample and maybe amend our wine list because it was always fluid. But we, and other restaurants, would never buy anything normally found in a grocery store because nothing is worse than going to a restaurant and ordering a $30 bottle of wine, then finding that same bottle a week later for $6 at the store. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all true, and I would also like to add that wholesale companies in the US do not collect sales tax due to the sales being sold for resale. Selling to an end customer requires collection of sales tax, and thus extra tax filings and tracking/reporting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I met a table distributor at his shady as fuck factory a number of years ago and thought I would be killed by eastern europeans. </p>
<p>I found a table we loved at a very large discount furniture store. They wanted $1200 for the table. I googled around and eventually found the supplier that imports them from asia. I called him an he said he can't sell to me because he only can to resellers, I said &quot;Come on, you want to make a sale quick&quot; and he said, &quot;ok fine, cash only&quot;. I met him, his guys loaded it in my truck and I paid him $600.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are actually more importers/distributors that conduct business like that than you would think.  My brother in law works for the federal government in a large Midwestern city (in the US), and he investigates that kind of activity (as part of a bigger overall responsibility).  </p>
<p>I've heard some crazy stories, but one of the best was about a guy buying rugs.  He started by buying rugs for his own home, and found an importer that sold it to him at wholesale price.  He bought several after he realized he got a great price, then stated buying more for family and friends.  The importer didn't seem to care, and kept dealing with him.  In time, the guy buying the rugs set up a legitimate business selling rugs retail.  At some point, he pissed off the original importer (I think he was buying from other distributors), and the importer blew the whistle on the guy (and unknowingly himself).  Apparently the importer thought he would be innocent in the whole deal, yet he had kept detailed records of every transaction he made with the guy.  He would have been innocent, except he never paid tax on any of the deals.  The importer wasn't native to the US, and was furious. </p>
<p>The story is better in person with my BIL, but from the sound of things, this is a pretty common situation (wholesalers selling to customers directly, even though they say they don't).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, you're correct. Since the end customer at the restaurant will be paying the sales tax, most sales we make are sales tax-free. If the product will not be used for retail, the customer is charged sales tax. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found that interesting to learn as a non-American. I'm more familiar with the sales tax of A/NZ - Sales Tax (or Goods and Services Tax (GST) as it's called) is collected on ALL domestic (i.e anything that isn't exported) sales regardless of whether they're B2B or B2C. </p>
<p>A business however is able to claim back all of the GST it has paid. </p>
<p>Imagine a NZ (GST is 15% in NZ) food distributor buys produce from a farmer for 100K+GST (115K) and sells it to a restaurant for 110K+GST (126.5K). The food distributor has paid 15K of GST and collected 16.5K of GST, when submitting it's GST return he would only pay the delta of 1.5K to the tax department. This happens all the way along the chain - from farmer, to distributor, to restaurant.</p>
<p>I'm honestly not sure which system is simpler. At least with A/NZ all businesses have universal collection and filing obligations, but the US system also seems to have an advantage that if tax isn't applicable it doesn't need to be collected and reported - it does however put the burden of determining when to collect or not on the business. </p></div>		</li>
