			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. I just want to add that we're also talking here about a zone of comfortable temperatures, and how close you are to your limits. With hot water that you get from a tap at home, you're going to be only a few degrees away from what is your upper limit before you burn yourself. So any hot water is pretty close to your limit and you can feel a difference of a degree somewhat acutely when you are near your limit. Small differences in temperature result in major differences in feelings of discomfort.</p>
<p>But with cold water, there's a very large range of temperatures you can go to before actually feeling damage. The difference between water that is 80 degrees vs. 85 degrees is minimal in terms of how you feel, but the difference between water that is 100 degrees vs 105 degrees is huge in terms of how you feel. Because of this, when you go put hot feet in cold water, you may be thinking that it's significantly cold, but really it's probably not very cold at all--like 70s. You have to have much greater changes in temperature when it's cold to feel a significant problem. I guarantee you if you put your hot feet in cold water that was 45 degrees Fahrenheit, you'd feel no relief--you'd feel extreme discomfort like needles of pain and then numbness. </p>
<p>If you put your cold feet in hot water in your actual experience, the water isn't really that much different in temperature than your body. It's probably not going to be more than at most 105 Fahrenheit, and probably a little cooler. So not many degrees different from normal body temperature. Nevertheless, you can only go a few degrees above normal body temperature before you reach a limit beyond which it's too hot and you feel scalded and burn yourself. In other words, each degree of temperature </p>
<p>So it's just a few degrees hotter than normal body temperature.
while you might feel soothed if you put your hot feet in cool water (like in 70s Fahrenheit), if you put it in ice water, it will be extremely unpleasant.</p></div>		</li>
