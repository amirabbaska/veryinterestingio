			<div class="markdown"><p>I completely agree. I was watching science discussions and learning about fusion reactors a while ago and they said we cannot use helium in a fusion reactor indefinitely, it would eat away at the lining of the reactor. They also said a simple solution was to use helium-3 but then helium-3 is not available in excess on the earths' surface, so in the future it was hypothesized that we would mine all our helium on the moon. Which is why you have seen an increase in private rocket companies like space-x, first one to set up shop there is going to be a very rich and powerful nation. This is all of course educated speculation but I digress. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not with the typical schemes for heat recovery. All the designs I have seen over decades center around a molten lithium layer swirling around the fusion reaction. Any alpha particles (helium nuclei) would get mixed with that and boil off. The real problems with the first fusion reactors is neutron bombardment. Not helium. Again the molten lithium would absorb most of those. In fact lithium would be the primary heat exchanger material and fuel breeder for the reactor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is quite the novel idea, I have never read or heard of such reactor but do not disagree with anything you have said. All of the designs I have learned about held particles with a very strong magnetic field, normal helium is heavier and will eat at the metallic lining so they hypothesized using helium-3 would extend the lifespan of the reactor. Also when I say it will eat the lining we're talking in decades. I'm not sure how scientists can make these specific claims when the &quot;best&quot; fusion reactor only sustained fusion for milliseconds. </p></div>		</li>
