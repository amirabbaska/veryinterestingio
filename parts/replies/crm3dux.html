			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem. I wish I could say they still ran like that, but they don't anymore. Most fans hated that style of racing so NASCAR did everything they could to get rid of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>one guy casting this race sounds like Kramer lol</p>
<p>and on a more important note: why do they run as pairs? Why, at least on this footage, there was no triple-cars going on?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Triple car tandems, as I recall, were theoretically faster and more efficient than two car tandems, but I think it ended up being too hard for everyone to run together for it to be a viable option. A few teams tried it in practice sessions and IIRC the speed gained just wasn't worth the trouble. It's also important to note when you're tucked up behind another car like that, you can't see shit. It's kind of problemactic if you've got a train going at 200+ mph and the two cars pushing you can't see out their front window. The drivers actually had to directly communicate with each other in order for two car tandems to work.</p>
<p>You also have to consider that most teams are either two-car teams or four-car teams. If everyone ran in three car tandems, the four car teams would have an odd man out and the two car teams would have to rely on a non-teammate to be competitive.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>NASCAR has since changed the Aero and Engine package so the cars don't race like this at all anymore. It wasn't even intended to be this way... it was a combination of the rules that year and the ingenuity of the drivers, namely Kyle Busch, who figured it out. It was fun to see once... and that was about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also.... this is one of the reasons why they changed this:

<p>People in the stands were hospitalized/airlifted because of that crash.  <a href="http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/news/story/2011/jul/14/talladega-crash-victim-20-recovering-after-surgeri/53988/" target="_blank">http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/news/story/2011/jul/14/talladega-crash-victim-20-recovering-after-surgeri/53988/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are the drivers in teams? Why would you stay directly behind a car the entire race and even at the last lap otherwise? I'm confused. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they're all on teams. NASCAR allows teams to have up to 4 full time cars and 1 more part time car. Some teams even have sister teams and technical partnerships with other teams.For example, in that video you see the cars 5(Kasey Kahne), 24(Jeff Gordon), 48(Jimmie Johnson) and 88(Dale Earnhardt Jr). Those cars are all a part of the Hendrick Motorsports team. Hendrick Motorsports also provides engines and Chassis' to several other Chevy teams, like Stewart-Haas and I believe Ganassi. Those teams are essentially sister teams to Hendrick. Anyway, since the drivers in that video are working with their teammates, they're choosing to do what's best for both them and their teammates. The ones in that video who are working with a non-teammate are doing so simply because that's their best shot at winning.</p></div>		</li>
