			<div class="markdown"><p>A filled or half-filled d- orbital is much more stable than if it is missing an electron, which is why you'll see that it often strips one from the s- orbital to make the d- orbital half or fully complete. </p>
<p>This is also part of the reason for some of the complex ionization states you see especially in transition metals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is it more favorable to (generally) fill it? You can explain not like I'm 5, as I have taken a few years of chem. I understand what orbital theory says and how they want to form and octet, but why? Why do they attempt to go to Noble gas configuration as in why is that stable? Why 2 for s, 10 for d, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a matter of space. Electons repulse other electrons but are attracted to the nucleus, so the electrons will try and get as close as possible  when the s shell has two electrons in it, it's more energetically favorable for it to occupy the next shell rather than the huge energy it would need to force itself in beside the extant electrons. The Paul exexclusion princpile also plays a role here, electrons being quantum objects.</p>
<p>The way the shells fill up from closest (lowest energy state for the electrons) to highest is the aufbau principle and it informs the electron and nuclear she'll models. (The protons and neutrons in the nucleus have orbit all shells too but they're much more difficult to work out!)</p>
<p>EDIT: Added in some more info.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will give a slightly different answer that might give you some insight. Suppose you have some atom with 9e- in a d-shell and another atom with 10e- in it's d-shell. Because electrons are indistinguishable, electrons within a shell can swap around without anyone being able to tell the difference. So, if you have 10e- in a shell, you can swap them around a bit more because of the extra e- -- this means that the entropy of this system is slightly higher! And as you might have learned in chemistry, higher entropy means more stable.</p>
<p>As for why this only happens when you get the d-block, it is because entropy scales with the number of states (technically the log of number of states). Adding a single electron to 9 electrons generates more possible states (10 extra states) vs adding an electron to 1 (2 extra states in the s orbital) or 5 (6 new states in the p orbital) and thus more entropy. It is only when you get up to the d-block and higher that this effect starts mattering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;For the first rows in the periodic table, this can easily be explained by the fact that electrons possess four quantum numbers (usually n, l, ml and ms). These numbers are restricted as such:</p>
<p>n=1,2,3,...</p>
<p>l=0,1,2,...,n−1</p>
<p>m=−l,−l+1,...,0,...,l−1</p>
<p>ms=−1/2,+1/2</p>
<p>By Pauli's exclusion principle all of these numbers can't be the same for any two electrons in an atom.</p>
<p>So in the n=2 shell you can have two possible values for l, one possible value for ml when l=0, three possible values for ml when l=1, and two possible values for ms. This sums to a total of eight possible value vectors: (1+3)⋅2=8</p>
<p>In the n=3 shell the eight rule also holds true for l&lt;2, which gives you sort of the same combinatorics all over again.</p>
<p>Since the quantum numbers cannot be the same for any electrons in an atom adding an extra electron to an atom with eight electrons in its outermost shell forces the electron to occupy a state with a higher principal quantum number (n), and since the binding energy of the electron <strong>decreases</strong> with n this is energetically unfavorable to binding with an atom that has more space in its outermost shell.</p>
<p>For further reference n is the principal quantum number (dealing with energy states), l is the orbital quantum number (dealing with subshells), ml is the orbital magnetic quantum number (direction of l) and ms is the spin quantum number (direction of spin).&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it still follows the Aufbau principle perfectly well. It's just that <em>the order of the orbital energies shifts based on the electrons already present in the atom</em>.</p>
<p>Hydrogen for example, when it has only one electron, has all the s, p, d and f orbitals at equivalent energy as long as it's in the same shell. Only when you add a second electron does it split up.</p>
<p>Similarly which orbital is the next &quot;lowest changes about all the time depending on how many electrons are present.</p>
<p>If you even believe electrons sit in a single orbital that is. Really the orbitals are more like the basis set that can be linearly combined to describe where the electron probability is. Like the x and y axes are on a graph. The orbitals only define the stationary states. And realistically are not at all little &quot;cup holders&quot;that each house an electron that just kinds sits there.</p>
<p>Also electrons don't actually add one at a time. There's a sea of assumptions in this orbital thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A great example of this is going from Th(IV) to Th(III) in a tris Cp framework. Common knowledge might suggest as Th has valent f orbitals, you'd make a [Rn] 5f1 configuration, instead the reality is a [Rn] 6d1 configuration as the tris-Cp framework lowers the d manifold to below the f orbitals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But just calling describing a global wavefunction is tricky, our many body theory isn't even really up to dealing with 2 electrons.</p>
<p>Oh, and fine and hyperfine structure means those orbitals are not necessarily equivalent energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the elements of the p block fill completely regularly ns2 np1 to ns2 np8 always keeping their 2 outermost s electrons.</p>
<p>you might have meant the d block:<br />
Cr and Mo have a half filled d and s shells (3d5 4s1 and 4d5 5s1)<br />
Cu, Ag and Au fill their d orbitals and also have half full s orbitals (3-5d10 4-6s1)</p></div>		</li>
