			<div class="markdown"><p>As you age the outer layer of skin begins to thin (epidermis).  This gives most the paler, aged looking skin as they get older. Also, the cells that regenerate are not all the same.  A babies original skin has fetal collagen and once born, the cells that are replacing it are produced with adult collagen.  </p></div>		</li>
