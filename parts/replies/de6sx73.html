			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it was a spinning disk.  A disk is all pretty much in one plane (more or less).  As it coalesced into planets, they stayed in that same plane.  There was no force to change that.   Why would they change their orbits and leave the plane of the ecliptic?  </p>
<p>If our solar system had a close encounter with another star, or even a large planet, then things could get messed up.  That apparently didn't happen.  </p>
<p>And electrons are not a good analogy, since they are actually more like waves than they are like spheres orbiting the nucleus.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omg I just thought of the best analogy for this!! Ok so pizza guy throws up pizza ball and it's spinning causes it to form a disk. It's just the natural shape something spinning will take. Is this right??</p></div>		</li>
