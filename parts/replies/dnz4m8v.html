<p>for a strict constitutionalist the 26th ammendment is set in just as much stone as the original document or the 2nd ammendment, even though it's from 1992</p>
<p>the 27th, funny enough, was written in 1789 and passed in 1992 (that's 202 years!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel it's a living document hence the entire amendment process. But for the sc it has to be a non living document meaning they have to interpret as it is written should a law be found in violation of this it's ruled against Congress should then have to decide to accept the ruling or push for an amendment to allow what they originally tried to do. The problem is Congress really doesn't want to start getting into amendments as it opens the door to other amendments being proposed eg term limits pay limits and so on.</p>
<p>Edit the reason I feel the sc has to take a strict as written approach is to keep their personal bias out of any rulings remember their rile in checks and balances is to interpret laws against the constitution not against their own views. Congress then has the amendment process as a check against the sc since I don't think amendments are something the sc could even legally approve eg the sc can't be brought into if an amendment is valid or not as they do laws.</p></div>		</li>
