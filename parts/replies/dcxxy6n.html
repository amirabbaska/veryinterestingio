			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, these quantum fluctuations happen at the event horizon of the black hole. Therefore the radiation procuded is proportional to the surface area of the black hole. You can think of the mass of the black hole being proportional to the volume and the rate at which it is turning into Hawking Radiation being proportional to the surface area. The volume divided by the surface area would represent the life expectancy of the black hole. The larger the sphere, the higher this number is. Therefore, the larger the black hole, the longer it will last.</p>
<p>This should explain <em>why</em> larger black holes last for a longer time.</p>
<p>The life expectancy of big black holes is ridiculously long. As viscence pointed out, it's many times the age of the universe, but with many, we don't mean 10. We mean 8*10^56 times as long. And that's for a black hole with only 2 solar masses.</p>
<p>The math behind the life expectancy of a black hole is actually quite simple. If you want, I can talk a bit about that.</p>
<p>(this is aimed at Blackbabygsus, you definitely already know this, viscence)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, since the temperature of a black hole (or rather, the Hawking radiation associated with it) increases as the hole gets smaller, which causes the hole to shrink faster, and thus keeps looping, the last moment of its life is its most energetic.</p>
<p>Along with that, the process is very directly converting the hole's mass into radiation, so it is perfectly efficient, via E=mc^2.</p>
<p>Anyway, once you work it out, at the last second of the hole's life, it still has a mass of a few hundred tons - all of that will be energy a second later. Our biggest bombs are still in the range of a few grams of mass converted, total. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, big blackholes are actually absorbing more mass from the Cosmic Microwave Background than they're losing thru Hawking radiation; so until the CMB is redshifted into a temperature lower than the blackholes, they will actually grow instead of shrink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure that depends on the black hole. For large black holes colder than 2.7 K, yes. For smaller black holes warmer than 2.7 K, no.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>but the smaller they get, the faster they evaporate. Exponentially faster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but to be pedantic, the power radiated by a black hole scales with 1/m^(2), so the mass as a function of time scales with (k-m)^(1/3), so the evaporation as asymptotic with t, not exponential.</p></div>		</li>
