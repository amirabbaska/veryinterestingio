<p>Driving a car is like programming.</p>
<p>Riding a motorcycle is like mathematics.</p>
<p>A lot of skills cross over between the two. It's easier to learn one if you already know the other. If you are talented at one, you will probably be talented at the other.</p>
<p>However, being good at one doesn't automatically make you good at the other.  You still have to work at it.</p></div>		</li>
