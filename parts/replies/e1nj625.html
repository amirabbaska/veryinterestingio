One thing that might work well in humans would be a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep25611" target="_blank">retroviral CRISPR/Cas9 system</a>.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, a recent study started in 2016 that edited pations wiht NSCLC in the US (penn I believe) and China! They basically edited the T-cells to better recognize cancerous cells and delete them <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep20070" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/srep20070</a>. I haven't followed up yet on the results, but they are mostly focusing on safety rather than efficacy (but it will definitely be exciting to see!). I have read some articles stating the possibility of CRISPR in mono-genic diseases (rather than multi, that would become rather difficult and even more risky). But of course, there is a risk of off-target mutations and a recent study posted the risk of inhibition of p53 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0050-6" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0050-6</a>. Deciding on whether to simply try this technique for disease requires a close analysis of risks and benefits (and wider impacts), as there are flaws. The trial with NSCLC was with late-stage 4 patients. Another concern is that some of these diseases would be treated through germline cell gene modification (hence this modification would be likely passed down to offspring and if it has negative consequences this would be harmful). So with the progress of CRISPR and gene modification, I think case by case application is wise, especially if delivery can be enhanced and off-target mutations risks can be minimized! They already made huge steps in these directions, so one day it may be possible but still, some tweaks need to be worked out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed on all counts, though my interpretation of the p53 loss study was that editing selects for cells with impaired p53 function, since those are less likely to be killed at a cell cycle checkpoint when they try to divide having not yet repaired the CRISPR-induced double-strand break. Immunotherapy is particularly exciting - but while it uses CRISPR, it does so on cells ex vivo (outside the body) that are then re-infused, so debatable whether it counts as &quot;true&quot; gene therapy. Then again, my lab doesn't do any work in humans at all, so I'm well outside my expertise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This team managed to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24487" target="_blank">regenerate an entire epidermis</a>. So you can cure stuff, but you gotta be tricky about it. In this case they cultivated a modified epidermis and then swapped it surgically. Also there is a lot of hope about some auto-immune diseases, because you can modify the progenitor cells of the blood cells. As you may know your blood cells get regenerated rapidly, and progenitor cells are the one who regenerate them.  </p>
<p>And of course, this is a hot topic in cancer research, the idea being to modify your immune cells so they recognize cancer cells and putting them back in. Hoping they will correctly attack the cancerous cells this time. This would potentially help a lot to kill all the sneaky cancerous cells that surgery couldn't remove, without having to do a chemo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Immunotherapy has been done without CRISPR and in some cases (I think Leukemia) has some really positive results, although with NSCLC these were not as strong (depends on the case). CRISPR, from what I interpreted (although I may be wrong) is simply enhancing the capabilities of the T-cell, making it stronger in a sense. But, I'm not entirely sure I grasped this fully, it has been a while since I read that article. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CRISPR/Cas9 is just a quicker and more effective way to do the same thing. You're right, we could do it without Cas9 technology. The gist of it is to make the T-cell recognize some protein on the cancerous cells (an antigen).</p>
<p>One main method is to modify the gene in the T-cell that produces antibody with genome editing. The other is guided evolution, where you cultivate the t-cells and screen them on their ability to recognize the cancerous antigen. With a few generation of 'natural' selection, you have t-cells able to recognize the cancerous cell.</p>
<p>The result in the end is more or less the same. &quot;Making it stronger&quot; is an inaccurate image. It's more of a key/lock situation. The lock is the antigen on the cancer cell, and you are trying to create a t-cell with the right key (antibody).</p></div>		</li>
