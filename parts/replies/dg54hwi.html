			<div class="markdown"><p>I see I have a abscess in my belly button, they originally thought it was an umbilical hernia until the CT scan  showed it was actually an infection. Gross how it starts inside my body and pushes out making my inward belly button almost flat it's pushing out so much. Anyways the doctor gave me 850 mg Amoxacillan they are huge pills. Hopefully that will do the trick because it is very painful!</p></div>		</li>
