			<div class="markdown"><p>I was flying over Lake Michigan a few summers back visiting a friend who was in the plane with me at the time who happens to be an ecologist, and I commented offhand at how pure the water of lake michigan looks.  He tells me it's because zebra mussels have killed the lake so much there is almost nothing in it in some areas, the mussels are biological filters and that pure clean looking water is almost entirely devoid of the microscopic life that keeps the ecosystem going.  </p>
<p>That observation went from &quot;wow pretty&quot; to &quot;wow bummer&quot; in a hurry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pull up the canal on google earth. The actual canal route transits a series of freshwater lakes. </p>
<p>The highest point in the canal is one of those lakes. And that's exactly how you want to do something like this. The locks are filled by fresh water flowing downward from that lake. So it's atually water flowing down hill that raises the ships. All you need to do is open and close the doors, and open and close water valves. That system also provides and outward flow of fresh water at both ends of the canal.   </p>
<p>If you wanted to use salt water, you would have to pump it uphill, which would require an obscene amount of energy. </p>
<p>Same applies to the Suez Canal. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That would be difficult anyway, the sea water level is higher on the Pacific side, plus the high tide is 5m more on the Pacific side. So there would be a constant strong flow of water from west to east.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The water doesn't stay fresh. There is water flowing from rivers into the lakes which then flow out to sea, so whenever salt water is introduced it just flows back out to see when more fresh water flows into the canal.</p></div>		</li>
