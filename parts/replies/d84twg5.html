			<p>Those make a number of different rainbow-like things called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(optical_phenomenon\)" target="_blank">ice halos</a>.</p>		</li>

			<p>What about if the planet had a different colored sun? </p>		</li>

			<p>If the radiation produced by the planet's star for example only contained red to green from the visible spectrum.  <br>Then we would only have a rainbow that contained colours between red and green.    <br>If a star exists like that is another question.  <br>As for the colour of stars, that is more determined by the star's mass and age.</p>		</li>

			<p>You can see something similar to this here on Earth if it rains immediately after the sun sets - the rainbow will go from red to yellow/green and then stop, since the higher wavelengths have been completely &quot;filtered&quot; (well, scattered).<br><br><a href="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--V5rYQkJc--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/crnohenrvp4jqdiqcqwn.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--V5rYQkJc--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/crnohenrvp4jqdiqcqwn.jpg</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Stars are essentially blackbody radiators ( <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/wien.html#c1" target="_blank">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/wien.html#c1</a> ) so different coloured stars would likely always have energy within the visible spectrum. <br><br>Additionally, if you were on the surface of a non-gaseous planet that had some refractive rainbow-causing particulates in the air, you wouldn't be able to visibly see a shift in colour of the rainbow. Only with scientific instrumentation could you see a non-smooth spectra. But that's already present here on earth ( <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/RemoteSensing/remote_04.php" target="_blank">http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/RemoteSensing/remote_04.php</a>)</p>		</li>

			<p>but on other planets it rains,, not water but other compounds.  on venus it rain Sulfuric acid.  On Titan it rains methane.  My question , do those compounds refract light like water does?</p>		</li>
