			<div class="markdown"><p>We really ought to do something about this. My preference is laws allowing things like streaming and (unrelated, I know) fan works modeled off the laws concerning the recording and public performance of existing songs (covers)... which is to say, the studio doesn't get to decide who gets to host their content, but they can get paid for it.</p>
<p>I'm really annoyed by how, if you want access to all the content, you have to subscribe to multiple services.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I tend to agree - why can't we disconnect the license from the content and apply it to the stream so it can't be shared/copied like a DVD can't be (by law).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are you suggesting, that studios should sell their content to streaming video providers like they sold VCR cassettes to Blockbuster? That is, the provider buys a particular instance of a stream for a given amount of money?  This is basically how e-book licensing works for libraries.  It has a lot of artificial complexities - the biggest of which are that e-books &quot;expire&quot; after a certain number of uses and have to be re-purchased by the library, and also that the library can only have X users reading the book at the same time, where X is the number of licenses they have purchased - that kill a lot of the major benefits of e-delivery of content. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>For obvious reasons, the studios really aren't a big fan of this revenue model.  They think they can get more money by negotiating individually. And given that the US is generally opposed to free-market interventions I don't think this will be an easy sell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It didn't used to be. Like I said, cover songs already work this way. But that precedent was established a century or so ago. Heck, even VCRs got a pass, despite the best efforts of the studios to get them banned as &quot;copyright violation devices&quot;. Things have changed, and for the worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this excellent answer: the issue is the licenses. Streaming content companies need a license to provide that content. That's negotiated with the content owner (the studios).</p>
<p>But with physical media, the content is bound to the media itself. When you purchase a DVD, it comes with a license to watch that DVD. Whoever possesses the DVD has the license to watch it. The license is valid for the useful life of the media itself.</p>
<p>So when Redbox buys a DVD, they get that license. When you rent a DVD from Redbox, you get that license as long as you are in possession of the DVD. It's not something that is negotiable.</p>
<p>This &quot;bound license&quot; is the core of the first-sale doctrine. Since you can't detach the license from the media, the content owner has no say in what happens after it's first sold. With digital content, there's no physical media, so there isn't a transferable license.</p></div>		</li>
