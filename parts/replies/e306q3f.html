<p>They wouldn't have had a mariachi hat <em>and</em> a ukelele.</p>
<p>It would have been a grass skirt and a ukelele or a steel string guitar and a mariachi hat depending on where the fossils were found. I can't believe i have to keep explaining this.</p></div>		</li>

My mental image is of T rex standing on a hilltop, waving its tiny feathered arms frantically, and making a call like the majestic cry of the Bald Eagle: &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlq2kcYQcLc" target="_blank">Eeep eeep eep eeep</a>&quot;</p></div>		</li>
