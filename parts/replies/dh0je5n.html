			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct. In fact, it's not about the ability to <em>make</em> the payments, it's about what those you owe to <em>think</em> you're able to do. As Japan's debt is mostly held within Japan, it doesn't make any sense for the debt collectors to cause mayhem as that would hurt them too. Greece, on the other hand, has to deal with the eurozone, and Germany in particular, which is much more disconnected from where the problem is. In Germany, no one cares if their decisions cause mayhem in Greece. At the end of the day, this shows the inherent problem in the EU -- as long as there's no monetary union in the true sense of the word -- where the rich countries support the poor -- the euro is not going to make it. Germany and the rest of the rich EU will have to start supporting the poorer countries without making a big song and dance about it (not to mention asking silly interest rates that effectively puts countries like Greece into debt forever!) Currently, all big decisions and monetary policies regarding the Euro is based on the situation for the rich, industrial north, not on the poorer, tourist-driven south.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In fact, Germany benefits, in some ways, from a weak Greece.  Now they can hire cheaper workers, and keep the value of the euro low to keep exports attractive.  Not that the average German <em>wants</em> a weak  Greece, but the inter-workings are very complex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, individual people never want to see anybody go through hard times but that's wrong, a weak Greece benefits the average German in that suddenly it's cheap to go on holiday to Greece.</p>
<p>Likewise there could be an argument for this fact benefitting the establishment: the thinking is that voters with twice as much vacation bang for their buck aren't going to give much of a fuck what politicians do. The more vacations you have, the less stressed you are likely to be; the less stressed you are, the less motivated you'll be to organise and contribute to grassroots efforts to vote out the current government.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is what all the US alarmists who like to freak out about our huge national debt fail to realize. </p>
<p>The US government has a nearly perfect credit rating (well we did, still &quot;excellent&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_credit-rating_downgrades" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_credit-rating_downgrades</a> )</p>
<p>Trump was talking about defaulting the debt before he was elected. It was absolutely terrifying, I have no idea why anyone would think that's a good idea. The liquidity our credit rating lends (that would be trashed in a default) is our most useful tool for someday diminishing our debt. If you default not only is it harder to borrow if we need it, it's harder to ensure the US can make payments because it becomes much more difficult to refinance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Currently 25% of our discretionary federal budget goes to pay for services consumed during Reagan bush and obama and administrations. They all ran on borrowed stimulus. By the end of Trump this could rise to 50%. These are just payments to pay the interest on our debt. It doesn't lower the principal. That will affect our economy. No doubt. That's why Japan is locked at 1% growth, IMO. Debt is a drag on growth long term. </p>

<p>Look at the graph for spending vs taxation. We have been avoiding paying for what we've been using for decades. Nothing wrong with stimulus but it only works for temporary situations, can't pump it in for decades. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Credit rating for a country that issues their own currency is entirely a charade. Either they don't know what they're talking about, or in most cases, rating agencies trying to apply political pressure for the government to act a certain way (such as to stop screwing around with debt ceiling shutdowns, etc).</p>
<p>The US has its own central bank, which sets the interest rate as a policy variable. It's not really a market rate, and the market has no way to discipline a country that issues their own floating-exchange currency.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So thank you for that.</p>
<p>Edit: when you consider human nature, historical events in europe, and the current global political climates... its not a stretch to say that the whole comradery thing and helping out your neighbor (even if it helps strengthen your own currency) is a slim possibility, <strong>then the comment i replied to starts to look like a list of reasons why the EU will fall.</strong> <em>please read bolded words before telling me that isn't an argument against the eu.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's an argument against the Euro, not the EU. The EU is a political union of countries, the Euro is a currency that some countries use (not every Euro county is in the EU, and not all EU counties use the Euro).</p>
<p>IMO: most arguments against the EU are inherently going to be a combination of nationalist, anti-globalist, and xenophobic/racist. The arguments against the Euro are valid and make economic sense. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You are injecting irrelevant politics into a comment that had nothing to do with the EU. The EU in some form has existed for like 60-70 years, the issues with the Euro have existed for maybe 10-15, and the recent wave of nationalism for maybe 5. It helps to keep things in perspective.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually Greece is less poor and more poorly run. They had a real influx of banks lending money to the general population about a decade ago and just like t in our stock market crash or was completely unwarranted at the time. Also the government there has only in recent years actually set up a real tax system and for some reason always pumped money they don't have into the military. Turns out when the economy went bad the only option was sell off state assets to the banks and that can't include things like the national grid so in the long term they may accumulated more debt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There wouldn't be military action, but it would burn Greece's bridges with not just Germany but the entirety of the EU.</p>
<p>That they can do this is why there's been continual negotiations between Greece and the EU, and not just the EU showing up like repo men.</p>
<p>But so far, Greece has decided it doesn't want to burn those bridges yet. Why exactly is hard to say since we haven't been privy to the details of those negotiations. We can just say the Greece government has preferred negotiation over defaulting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>German banks <strong>were</strong> tangled up in the Greek debt (the French and Italian banks, even more tho, Germany was not the only country against letting Greece default). It get's disturbing how in everyone's mind only Germany is suddenly responsible...</p>
<p>at this point most of the debt is owned by the ECB, the banks had to take a haircut and the danger of a complete European banking collapse because of Greece is mostly over (the main fear when the crisis hit and people became afraid Greece would default) </p>
<p>it doesn't really matter much anymore what Greece does, they can leave the Euro without taking everyone down with them when they want to. The reason they didn't and probably still won't is that the consequences are even worse than staying in the Euro</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To tack on another small point, Greece's government employs a much larger percentage of its population than Japan does, so Japan has a larger portion of its workers to tax (because raising taxes on government employees to pay government employees is completely pointless economically).</p></div>		</li>
