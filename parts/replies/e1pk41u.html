			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a significant issue when testing the ride with zero people on. The serious accident that happened on the smiler ride at Alton Towers was initially created when a car with no passengers got stuck between two inclines. The lack of speed was caused by the aerodynamic resistance on a windy day and an unloaded carriage. Operators then overrode the safety controls to send a full carriage around the track crashing into the back of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because the design should look at all local minimums and maximums, do the calculations there, and show that there aren't any specific instabilities in-between. That is probably thrown out often for rules-of-thumb.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I worked as a ride mechanic after we put the trains on the track we'd have them valley a lot because the grease in the wheels was too viscose.</p>
<p>Fun times having to get the come-along and hoist them up Hills. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Dragon Challenge rollercoaster at Universal florida (which they just closed permanently for some absurd reason) was a good example as it was 2 dueling coasters on tracks that intertwined with one another and was designed to have the coasters run right at each other &amp; twist around one another. To do that, they'd weigh the two carriages as they went up the first hill and would slow the ascent of the heavier one to accomodate for its eventual faster speed so that the two would then be timed correctly to meet at those intersection spots along the track. </p>
<p>it was a lot of fun to be in the front row and come around a corner to see another coaster heading right at you only to have both of you veer off and twist around one another at the last moment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're building a new Harry Potter themed coaster.  Multiple launches, Hagrid style motorcycle and sidecar vehicles.  Should be sweet.</p>
<p>Although I will miss the Dragons, they were fantastic rides, glad I got to ride them before they were removed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This ride closed and will be replaced with a new ride. The Dragon Challenge wasn't a new ride when Wizarding World opened, but was already there and was just rethemed for the new setting. To my understanding, part of the decision to replace it came from structural damage caused by not running the trains simultaneously, causing the manufacturer to decline to cover repairs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weeellllll, if the mass of the thing being dropped (hammer or feather) is negligible in comparison to the mass of the thing attracting them (earth), then the acceleration doesn’t change enough to include it in the calc.  Also, ignore the distance between the centers of mass.   So you just wrap it all up into 9.8 m/sec^2 and call it a day.  </p>
<p>Look up Newton’s universal law of gravity and think that the apple and the moon and the earth all follow the same laws.  The moon pulls on the earth, tides are evidence of that, but the Apple pulls on it too!</p></div>		</li>
