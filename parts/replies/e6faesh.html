			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seriously had &quot;three exits no waiting&quot; before from being so sick. Ass blasting liquid death while pissing and puking into a small trash can. It all began with this sick feeling and then so much saliva generated I had to spit, so I picked up the trash can and then all holy hell broke loose. It was pretty impressive TBH.  Much more impressive than the time I projectile vomited a world record distance of beer and chicken teriyaki at a concert, but I digress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish that when I had food poisoning that it triggered vomiting to get it over with more quickly... Instead it triggered 35 hours of diarrhea  and terrible abdominal pain with no relief no matter which way I sat/laid and roughly 10 pounds of weight loss. I couldn’t even drink anything for the first 28-ish hours because it would trigger more awful pain and diarrhea. My butt was sore for days after that...</p>
<p>I wouldn’t wish that experience on my worst enemy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Those contents act as an irritant to the GI system, leading to nausea and contractions of the stomach and esophagus that lead to vomiting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't get it - the nausea and vomiting are caused BY the bacteria's cellular content? I always learned that vomiting was a &quot;safety&quot; mechanism of our own bodies to get ridof the toxicants. Wouldn't vomiting be unhelpful for the bacterias?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is getting rid of toxins. If your gut bacteria is dying to some ingested food that is either toxic or covered in bad bacteria, it releases signals that is different from if it died normally. Your killed gut bacteria die but will be replenished, toxins on the food will induce vomit, bad bacteria might not have you as a host so will compete with your good bacteria and make their own toxins then expelled.</p></div>		</li>
