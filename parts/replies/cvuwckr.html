			<div class="markdown"><p>Mass is how much actual physical matter an object has. Weight is simply mass x acceleration. This is why we weigh differently on other planets, because the acceleration of gravity is different due to the planet having a smaller mass, and therefore a weaker gravitational pull. If you're in space, you have almost no weight because you're not in the gravitational field of anything significant enough to pull you towards it. However, your mass is still the same no matter what. You will always be 100Kg of mass no matter where you are, but your weight will change based on how powerful Gravity is.</p></div>		</li>

Because my scale tells me I'm 90 kg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be really pedantic, mass is two things (or three things). It represents an object's scaling factor for gravity - how much gravity affects it - <em>and</em> an object's resistance to being accelerated - how much force produces a certain acceleration.</p>
<p>You can then go further and split the gravity part into an &quot;active&quot; and &quot;passive&quot; part; the active mass of an object being the scaling factor for its gravity acting on other objects, and the passive mass being the scaling factor for how much it is affected by the gravity of other things.</p>
<p>It just turns out that as far as every experiment has shown, these three things all have the same value for all objects tested (to something like 1 part in 10^13 ).</p>
<p>It's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle" target="_blank">equivalence principle</a>, and there isn't a well-understood reason why it exists.</p></div>		</li>
