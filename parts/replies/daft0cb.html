<p>Is this real, or sarcasm? I used to work out all the time and get up and go into work early and at some point in the past year I've found myself hammering my snooze button for an hour every morning and I've honestly felt like shit and can't figure out why.</p>
<p>If I stop snoozing and just bite the bullet and get up will that fix my shit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look into the smartphone app Sleep Cycle. </p>
<p>Say you want to wake up for 7:30 (that's when I do.) When you go to sleep, you open sleep cycle, plug your phone in, tap &quot;i'm going to bed!&quot; and then put it face down next to your pillow. Sleep cycle then takes noise and movement cues from you and uses them to determine when you are in a REM cycle (deep sleep) and when you are not. It will wait until it knows you're not deeply into a REM cycle in the half hour before your alarm time and wake you up gently at the most opportune time in that half hour. </p>
<p>I started using it about 3 years ago, and it's changed my life significantly. If you're jolted out of a REM cycle, it's going to take you a lot longer to stop feeling groggy, sometimes hours. I noticed pretty quickly how much more alert i was before noon once I started using it.</p>
<p>It also gives you cool information and graphs it for you. Time spent in bed, sleep quality, how many REM cycles in a night. My sleep quality graph is cool because you can see when i had a week off vs when i was working 15 hours a day. You can also add notes like, &quot;drank coffee after 3PM&quot; or &quot;worked out&quot; or &quot;long day&quot; etc etc and when you tap going to sleep, you can add those tags to the night, and over time it will tell you how much better or worse your sleep is on the nights you tagged something vs your average sleep.</p>
<p>I digress. I highly recommend it. </p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://www.sleepcycle.com/" target="_blank">https://www.sleepcycle.com/</a> here's the app I use, for those interested. </p>
<p>Also, as said below, experience may vary when sleeping with a partner, because your REM cycles may not sync very well, and the app will be confused as to who it's hearing/feeling move. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That stuff about being jolted out if REM explains exactly what happens to me usually weekends when I do get to sleep in and freely snooze as much as I want.</p>
<p>Just yesterday I was smacking my phone's snooze button for about an hour or more. Immediately after snoozing I would go right back into the dream where I am usually doing a task, causing me to enter what I call a dream loop. This time I was making a franken-candle out of other candles. Everytime the snooze jolted me I would mess up my dream task, have stop the alarm irl, then immediately go back to the dream state to restart my task, and do the same actions over and over again. Dream loops, man! They're ridiculous. Does anyone else experience this? </p>
<p>Then of course when I do break out of it I have a sleep-hangover headache where it basically feels like a lot of pressure and I still feel tired and out of it. Even after a good dose of coffee this feeling sometimes lasts all day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Snooze sleep is shitty sleep.  I find I never am able to get back into that restful sleep mode, also that anxiety of knowing my alarm is about to go off again so my body is in a state of raised alertness anyways.  I gave up on the snooze button years ago and never looked back.  Just make the conscious decision to go to sleep a bit earlier and force yourself to get up at the first and only alarm.  If you're worried about sleeping through your alarm, put your alarm across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once, when I tried putting my alarm clock across the room, instead of waking up to shut it off, I woke up an hour late and found a pile of plastic and circuit boards across the room.</p>
<p>Apparently, in my sleep, I got up and spiked it like a football with retard strength, and went back to bed. Don't remember anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, if you work out often and train your muscles, they'll get sore and feel heavy when you wake up in the morning. It'd help to stretch or do yoga, even though I know many (myself included) ignore doing that. </p>
<p>Also drinking a glass of water helps too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I felt great while I was working out. But I fucked up my shoulder and couldn't work out for a long time, gained some of the weight back, got out of shape and depressed and it all kinda snowballed. Just trying to find a way to jumpstart myself back into a rhythm... maybe this will work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the morning = REM —&gt; ⏰ —&gt; snooze —&gt; N1 —&gt; N2 —&gt; ⏰ —&gt; wake up feeling like shit</p>
<p>Afternoon = feeling like shit —&gt; N1 —&gt; N2 —&gt; REM (who needs N3?) —&gt; ⏰ —&gt; wake up fresh or with sleep paralysis</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But as long as you time the alarm at the end of a 90-minute sleep cycle, you should be fine, right? I've at least tried to do that (<a href="http://sleepyti.me" target="_blank">http://sleepyti.me</a>), but sometimes when I'm pressed for time I say screw it I'll just feel like crap all day.</p></div>		</li>
