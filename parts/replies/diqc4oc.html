<p>I play soccer whenever I can. Play FIFA often. Watch 100+ games a year easy. Never bored. Every goal is exciting (or dreadful...).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because we are more advanced we have a wider spectrum of boredom. I love football and my home club arsenal. I could watch it forever and never get bored, I could play it my whole life and not get bored. Something here that people are seeming to neglect though is variation. It is variation that prevents boredom, not doing things you inherently like. Dogs aren't constantly playing fetch. They do eventually get bored. But they do other things like play with you sniff things sleep eat etc that also stimulate them. Imagine if you did the same thing and nothing else over and over. You will eventually get bored.  Boredom exists to make you experiment, to give mammals a surviving edge and tell them to try new things. That is its purpose. Mammals need constant stimulation, heck even reptiles need stimulation for good mental and physical health. It is why many zoos now have intensive enrichment programmes to help entertain their animals and keep them happy :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I've had my dog for years and I still get the same enjoyment from taking him for a walk in the woods. My dad's been taking the same after-dinner walk for decades and still enjoys it. </p>
<p>I'm not sure why some things get boring with repetition and other things don't, and I think humans probably require a greater level of complexity and variety to stay interested, but I don't think that dogs who never tire of fetch represent a major difference in cognition. </p></div>		</li>
