			<div class="markdown"><p>A rare side effect of atomoxetine(Strattera) is suicidal ideation, you probably already know that just for anyone else. </p>
<p>Did that go away after a while or did you switch to something else?</p>
<p>I hope you found meds that work for you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I stopped after only a few weeks. It worked very well, was very subtle yet I suddenly had all my shit together, effortlessly. However, I felt no joy in anything. That was when I understood the idea of killing oneself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only bad thing i really see is putting your body in constant stimulation. I knew people who were addicted but those people that I knew were addicted to many other drugs and were prone to addicted. I took adderall from elementary school until i was 18 (maybe 19) i was on 45mg xr. I stopped cold turkey after years of taking it because i couldn't afford it and I experienced no withdrawal symptoms, I did sleep a shit ton the first week so the physical addiction was rough. All in all it's a life changer for some people.</p></div>		</li>
