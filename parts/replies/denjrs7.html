<p>In this situation, the photon represents the <em>fastest potential orbit</em>. There are no <em>closer</em> potential orbits (since nothing moves faster than the speed of light). Also, light cannot speed up or slow down - it travels at a constant speed in all reference frames. Thus, it cannot have an elliptical orbit - it must always be in:</p>
<ol>
<li>A trajectory leading into the black hole.</li>
<li>A trajectory escaping the black hole.</li>
<li>A perfectly circular orbit.</li>
</ol>
<p>As per general orbits around black holes and neutron stars, when you are close to the object where the gravitational field is immense, you can no longer use Newtonian physics, but must use General Relativistic physics to describe the orbits. An orbit is either perfectly circular or an oddly precessing 'kinda elliptic' orbit where the object's orbit expands and contracts while also precessing. There are no elliptical orbits <em>near</em> the anomaly.</p></div>		</li>
