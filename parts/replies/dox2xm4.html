			<div class="markdown"><p>Microfiber are threads of man made materials, such as polyester, that are thinner than silk.  These types of sheets are know for their “cost effectiveness” and ease of creation.  </p>
<p>You typically will get these for much cheaper than higher quality cotton sheets and will work for most people’s needs.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anything above 400 in cotton is a rip off. According to Consumer reports, you can only fit 416 threads per inch. Manufacturers inflate the thread count by counting individual strands, but your skin can't feel the difference.</p>
<p>I'd link to the source but I'm on mobile. The point is don't  waste money on 1000+ thread count sheets.</p>
<p>Edit: I came off sounding like an ass so I tried to reword. </p></div>		</li>
