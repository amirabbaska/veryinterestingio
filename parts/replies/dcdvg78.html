			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this: a lot of people, when reading academic texts/things which take a legitimate stance, have a hard time not immediately being convinced by them. </p>
<p>Have you ever read any philosophy text and been convinced that it was dead on about how the world works? Them you read another one and...boom! You've got a new world view...continue as nauseam.</p>
<p>He means that too. Not only the ability to entertain the merit of an argument different than yours, but to also be mature enough, and resolute enough in your own beliefs, to not glom on to the new idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. I'd never thought to equate maturity with never changing your mind, but I bet plenty of people do.  Edit: not an attack,  just a realization.  Your interpretation might be spot on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually the only way you can really have a discussion/debate with someone and actually hope to change their minds.  If you start off with the idea that &quot;they're an idiot and have no rational basis for what they are doing&quot; then there's really no way you will ever convince them of something.</p>
<p>However, if they feel like their arguments are heard, and then ACTUALLY refuted, then you can actually change how they see things.  However, most political discourse is the exact opposite.  Assume the other side is an idiot, call them names and belittle them, and then wonder why they don't bother listening to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would go a step further and say that if you cannot fathom the other person's viewpoint then either you or the other person has a poor understanding of the subject matter. When it comes to politics I think most people tend to have a poor understanding of issues. Part of the art of politics IMHO is to take a technical issue and boil down to a few emotional arguments that people can latch onto.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd go another step further and say that if you're discussing something in order to change someone's mind, you've missed the object of the discussion, which (in my humble opinion) is to become more educated. That requires an open mind and not an agenda. I realize you weren't centering your comment on the notion that a discussion is meant to sway or dissuade someone from a particular 'side' of an issue, but it's truer than not to say that there are many who speak and do not listen, rather than those who listen and respond with either logic or some version of accordance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pro-choice / pro-life is the perfect example.</p>
<p>The key (as you stated) is that you have to understand the merits and value of the opposing side. If you are pro-choice and you say 'Yes I understand their standpoint. They are pushing their religion on other people and controlling women.' then you aren't seeing the merit and value of their argument. </p>
<p>Understanding their merit and value would be saying 'They do have a point, if you believe life begins at conception and they are granted a soul at conception then abortion is murder. I, however, don't believe life begins at conception.' You have seen from their eyes why their standpoint is 'right'.</p>
<p>It is a powerful tool. It makes life so much better because you understand people, and when you understand someone it is much harder to hate them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's beautiful as an example because it also works in the opposite! with a pro life person understanding the same difference they have about where life begins! which weirdly enough, is a kind of common ground they can work from/with</p></div>		</li>
