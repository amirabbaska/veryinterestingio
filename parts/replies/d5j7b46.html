<p>Speed of light varies depending on the medium in which it is traveling. Velocity factor is important in long haul cabling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually... Fiber is faster inherently.</p>
<p>Sending one signal through a copper wire will send it across at about 2/3rd C.
Sending a signal across a fiber line will send it across at C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not correct, fiber is fiber, not a vacuum.   It also suffers from a ~30% speed reduction vs C.  If photons over fiber is slightly faster or slightly slower than electrons over copper, I do not know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light through glass is still the speed of light through glass. They move at the speed of light through their medium. Electrons jumping from one atom to another does not happen at the speed of light in their medium, fiber technically transmits data faster.</p></div>		</li>
