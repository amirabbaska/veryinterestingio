			<div class="markdown"><p>Conservative snowflakes definitely don't. They whine all day that they can't make racist or misogynistic jokes or whatever when they absolutely can. They just have to suck up and accept the social consequences. Does anyone remember when conservatism was the ideology of personal responsibility?</p>
<p>Edit: really curious how fast I got negged on this one. Nice botting, whiny conservatives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I totally agree with your point, but the main problem with media outlets such as twitter is that they seem to be very biased when choosing who’s comments are removed. Most of the comments that get national attention for removal are not very offensive and to find them offensive almost takes a very illogical approach of twisting it into such. This may happen to many people on both sides of the spectrum but from what I’ve seen it’s honestly ridiculous what Twitter deems as inappropriate at times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I will defend with my blood our right to be an asshole. Doesn't mean I'm not going to treat someone like they're an asshole. We have that right, but ideally no one ever makes use of it, because assholes suck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I absolutely agree with you that said people are hypocritical and obnoxious - singling out one side of the aisle just serves to further entrench us in our own bubbles of denial and hypocrisy. Either attack both sides as is fair, or don't single out one side while ignoring the same behavior from the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whereas in a store, most people will just cause a scene or whatever, complain to friends maybe threaten to go to the local news establishment if they genuinely feel it was wrongful or just to try and threaten their way to free stuff. Witnessed that kind of behavior firsthand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They face higher criticism because these platforms are massive and choices they make about what can and can't be said on their platform have significantly further reaching effects than your local walmart's policies might.</p>
<p>Also, unlike most physical stores these platforms exist for the explicit purpose of communication, so when they mess with that people are are much more likely to care. It's for the same reason that people would complain if a brick and mortar store did something which hindered their ability to shop; they're interfering with the central reason people use their service.</p></div>		</li>
