			<div class="markdown"><p>I took some letterpress and printing classes in school years ago. Justifying type for a press isn't particularly time consuming once you have a little experience. The spacings between letters and words are determined by blocks and spacers of fixed widths. I don't remember the specifics any more, but as I recall there were only maybe 3 letter spacers, about the same for word spacers, and then maybe 8 to 10 different size blocks to position and lock-in the paragraphs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I guess it's just when you're doing it by hand you have to work out how much total extra space you need, then fiddle about and insert it all. And you'll still get bad looking lines because you can't analyse the entire paragraph at once ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't that bad, actually. There are longer spacers that you drop on end at key spots, which allow you to open a gap and a place another spacer. Start small and fill them in until it looks right. There's no absolute answer for how a paragraph should look, other than avoiding rivers and jagged ends.</p></div>		</li>
