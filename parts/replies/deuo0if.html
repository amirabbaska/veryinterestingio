			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's so much more interesting than that. I do subscribe to the theory that joker represents our dark side. See Joker's quote from Dark Night Rises:</p>
<p>&quot;Don't talk like one of them. You're not! Even if you'd like to be. To them, you're just a freak, like me! They need you right now, but when they don't, they'll cast you out, like a leper! You see, their morals, their code, it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you. When the chips are down, these... these civilized people, they'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve.&quot;</p>
<p>You don't need to look far to find that humans, time and time again (and even currently), will 'eat each other.' Violence, rape, murder, genocide...That line between good and evil runs right through all of is. The Joker represents another side of Batman. In a way, without the Joker there is no Batman. And maybe, without the Joker (or other nemeses) Batman would arguably become the murderous one very quickly. He's no innocent child. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Joker perpetuates that explanation because it validates his twisted worldview and causes pain and suffering to othrs, but that doesn't mean he's <em>right</em>. Though he's probably an effective villain because people <em>fear</em> that he's right.</p></div>		</li>

<p>see, he's right about this</p>
<p>but what he is leaving out (on purpose) is that he is the person working hard to make the world more brutal, forcing people to act more brutal</p>
<p>he is actively working for the terrible state of humanity he refers to </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But in a way aren't you perpetuating this ideology that if there were an apocalypse tomorrow then all of humanity would turn on each other. Because by subscribing to that belief you're giving it validation where on the other hand if everybody (or a majority) held fast to the systems of civilization we have in place now then there's a good chance that humanity would be just fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you really believe that all the moral people holding onto an ideology will stop a band of thugs only looking out for number one in a world where there is no consequences? </p>
<p>I don't want to give that idea validity, but I don't think anyone has the sway to make all people one big happy family. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The audience wants &quot;goodness&quot; and &quot;rationality&quot; from a hero. Villains like the Joker foil this in that he is not only evil, but irrationally evil. He isn't evil to achieve power or money, he is evil for absolutely no reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Bruce Wayne</strong>: Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred. Just have to figure out what he's after.</p>
<p><strong>Alfred Pennyworth</strong>: With respect Master Wayne, perhaps this is a man that <em>you</em> don't fully understand, either. A long time ago, I was in Burma. My friends and I were working for the local government. They were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders by bribing them with precious stones. But their caravans were being raided in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit. So, we went looking for the stones. But in six months, we never met anybody who traded with him. One day, I saw a child playing with a ruby the size of a tangerine. The bandit had been throwing them away.</p>
<p><strong>Bruce Wayne</strong>: So why steal them?</p>
<p><strong>Alfred Pennyworth</strong>: Well, because he thought it was good sport. Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other part to this is the Joker really challenges Batman into fundamentally changing his beliefs. He constantly pushes Batman into situations where killing him would be the easiest solution, even though killing is something Batman never did in the films.</p>
<p>Not only is joker irrationally evil, he wants Batman to join in with his irrational behavior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can enjoy a villain's dark side selectively. Sometimes they target things we despise. Sometimes they have the kind of humor we see in comedians, except they actually act them out. Often they do things we dread as well. </p>
<p>I think we're interested in watching villains because we realize that not everything is black and white. The villains are often portrayed in such a way to make us ask questions about some things we might take for granted.  </p>
<p>EDIT: To add to that, they're often portrayed as being smart and confident. Sometimes they're aggressive and reckless. Other times they're careful, calm, and methodical. Often they're successful. A lot of them have characteristics we respect or wish we had, even if we can't respect what they do.  </p></div>		</li>
