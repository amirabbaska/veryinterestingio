			<div class="markdown"><p>Mt St Helens was interesting because it was triggered by a landslide. Explosive volcanoes are made up of many layers of ash and lava and pumice and so on, each of which have different strengths and properties. These can then be further knackered by dyke injections or faults. This means they're riddled with weaknesses. In Mt St Helens' case one of these weak sections was lubricated by glacial meltwater. That lead to a flank collapse (giant landslide) that removed about 1/4 of the volcanoe's mass. That then depressurised the magma chamber below, which causes the gas dissolved in the magma to come out of solution like bursting a coke bottle. That then drives the magma up the path of least resistance and you get a blast eruption. This then settled down to a more normal plinian-style eruption. Have a look at this video from 1.15 to see how it happened: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK--hvgP2uY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK--hvgP2uY</a></p></div>		</li>
