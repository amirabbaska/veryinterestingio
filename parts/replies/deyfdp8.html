			<div class="markdown"><p>Night terrors and hypnagogia are different phenomena and happen in different sleep stages. Hypnagogia happens as you're falling asleep, and night terrors occur during the first hours of stage 3-4 NREM sleep. What you're describing is sleep paralysis, which can include terrifying hallucinations.</p>
<p>Either way, it sucks! Hypnagogia is usually a pretty cool phenomenon, but sleep paralysis isn't. I hope you experience less of it now?</p>
<p>I have sleep terrors (they're are truly terrifying, although you get used to handling them), and I can't reliably induce them, but I'm more likely to have them if I'm sleep deprived, if I've eaten a lot of sugar before bed, or if I've done something adrenaline-inducing (including aerobic exercise) during the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once woke up, only at 11 pm, had been sleeping for an hour maybe two and thought I saw someone standing on the other end of my bed so I jumped out and bumped my head against the wall.
My mother came looking because of the noise (I am 21 and a student so yes I still live at home) but at that time I could barely remember anything about it. Had the same thing for over an entire week, always thinking someone was standing there and jumping out of my bed or throwing my blanket on it which did nothing of course because there was nothing.
After that week it just stopped, thank God.
Any idea if this is something like you were talking about? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had something similar a couple of times. Although for me it's always actual objects I mistake for something else. For instance this one night I woke up to a stranger standing at the foot of my bed near the window. I jumped up right at the guy and beat the shit out of him. After that I just went right back to sleep.
I woke up the next morning with my bed and the floor covered in earth and my poor plant that used to stand on the window sill torn apart and broken on the floor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could either be a sleep terror or a sleep hallucination. But yes, that's what a sleep terror is like - often worse. There's never really a &quot;dream&quot; per se, just a sensation or an image or an impression (ie. &quot;there's an intruder in my room&quot;), and a feeling of genuine fear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I fall asleep, I'm usually conscious of it cause what I think about suddenly turns ridiculous and uncontrollable. Most of the time it's funny and I'm conscious of the loss of control and I know it's because I'm falling asleep. Is that Hypnagogia or am I just weird? It's as if I was dreaming before being unconscious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's hypnagogia. It's not the same as being aware of falling asleep, it's a known stage <em>before</em> falling asleep. It always feels weird though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure that can be attributed to hypnagogia. Do you sometimes manage to transition directly into &quot;full dream mode&quot;? :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I experienced severe hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis a few months ago when I was in the hospital. There were visions of people being tortured and mutilated, all set to this droning, peaceful hymnal music. Then if I finally managed to fall asleep, I would feel myself paralyzed and floating above the bed, like something out of an exorcism. I would be thrown around the room while an ominous figure watched me. I didn't get a full sleep cycle for eight days because of this, which of course just made the situation worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm so sorry for you.  I used to get some trippy ass night terror/sleep paralysis when I did stimulants a lot and only got a few hours of sleep every few days.  I subsequently stopped doing drugs that kept me awake because that shit is the most terrifying reality imaginable.  If there is a hell, that would be it.  I hope you're doing better!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds awful. Were you sick or on medication? Either of those things can make hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis more intense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All valid points just a side note though. If you get past the fear and realize that it's just your brain messing with you, not only will you get a firmer grip on your impulsive thoughts and emotions by not giving into but instead getting them under control. </p>
<p>The other thing is that if you get past the fear of sleep paralysis then you can instead have one of the most mindblowing and amazing experiences that I've ever had, which is becoming aware.</p>
<p>You become aware of thing around you, how things starts to build up and become more real. You'll start experiencing images and feeling and soon things will become physical like things are now. You'll get the feeling that you're IN somewhere and not just imagining stuff. You'll be able to explore and experience this world almost exactly like you are right now. You'll be able to touch thing and they will feel solid and real.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at first, it was just something that happened sometimes. So I read up on what I found out to be sleep paralysis and what REALLY causes it to happen. (because wow.. the amount of muck of misinformative explanations like demons and such)</p>
<p>So once I had an understanding of sleep paralysis and that it's something natural that the body goes through every night to protect me, I could start getting over the irrational fear. </p>
<p>It's still a very powerful and, especially in the beginning, overwhelming experience. But with time I got used to it and I knew what to expect and also found a few tricks to keep the fear under control, like keeping your eyes closed. </p>
<p>I started getting excited about experiencing them because they had turned into something positive instead now with the fear response mostly gone. Because like OP here commented, you feel very much alive when it happens. </p>
<p>I started reading about different ways of doing it and trying some with various success. I'd be then learned that what I experienced after sleep paralysis is generally known as Lucid Dreaming. </p>
<p>I tried most techniques that I could find and eventually found the easiest and most effortless way FOR ME, you might be different. </p>
<p>Something I've found though besides the techniques is that keeping a dream journal is one of the most important pillars of lucid dreaming as well as the way Reality Checks work. </p>
<p>But for the guide. It's called Astral Projection and referred to as Phasing in the guide but meh, same thing different name based on my experience. </p>
<p>If you Google &quot;The Frank Kepple Resource&quot; you'll be able to find it. First there's like half an intro page and then a bit down under &quot;What is phasing and how can I do it&quot; there you can find the technique. It's the way I do it pretty much. </p>
<p>Good luck! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would not recommend training ones self to do that. </p>
<p>I have these quite often. At multiple points I thought I was dead/dying/already in hell. </p>
<p>Its an extremely terrifying, jarring and surprisingly realistic event. I think mine were a result of stress, messed up sleep patterns and deprivation. But I know other things can cause it (a lot of the kids I coach say they've experienced it around age of puberty so maybe that hormonal shift has some effect). </p>
<p>There are some documentaries on YouTube that kinda accurately portray what its like. But my first time it happened ill never forget. Its like in my top 3 of unforgettable memories..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have these as well although I only get them every month or so. They are honestly not that bad once have had them and know what they are. I still get really anxious every time I wake up and have and am experiencing it but it's not anything insane for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate it. Mine are on another level. Ill see shadowy demons. Ive seen hands reach from the side of my vision trying to grab at me. Ive had things (demons, whatever) sitting on my chest looking down at me. I once had the entire shadow of the room morph into a face and hand and push down on my chest. Ive heard voices. Ive heard people talking about me. Its so intense and real. I would sometimes literally think I had died in my sleep and these things were coming to take me to Hell. Like...legitimately. (Think Krampus style shit but happening in the shadows of your bedroom).</p>
<p>For a while it was so bad I refused to go to sleep. I went to the Dr about it. They all but laughed at me. Got some Trazodone. Didnt work. Got moved to Lunesta. Worked for a while but was too expensive and had side effects. Finally got a low dose (0.5) of Clonazepam to take before bed and it worked. Then I moved to Ambien. That also made me hallucinate but in an awesome way AND I was finally able to sleep. Got taken off of it recently but so far so good (fingers crossed).</p></div>		</li>
