			<div class="markdown"><p>imagine Greece is a Walmart employee on minimum wage who when they were behind on money they used payday loans to get credit cards that they immediately maxed out to seem wealthy to get more loans and are now behind on taxes.</p>
<p>While Japan is a CEO who owes a lot to a few close friends who have given in order to help with medical bills and emergency costs , they are considered responsible and can be trusted to pay back the money over time as well as being on good terms with those they owe, as well as being able to change the terms of the deal if need be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good answer. A couple of comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The low interest rate of Japan's debt is because it is low risk</li>
<li>Greece had a low interest rate until the risk became high, at which time the rate got very high.</li>
</ul>
<p>The interest rate is an effect of the risk, and not a cause of the risk.</p>
<p>Also, you comment on the aging population of Greece. Japan has this challenge to an even greater extent.</p>
<p>You also missed a / the key difference: The numbers in the heading are gross debt. Japan's net debt is only roughly 116%. Greece's net debt is the same as their gross, roughly 200%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Completely agree on both points. I'm pretty sure that's what I conveyed?</p>
<p>I did not mention debt levels because I didn't feel the need to insert life numbers and distract people. Point taken though.</p>
<p>Appreciate the clarifying :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are missing the main point:</p>
<p>Japanese debt is being denominated in Yen. And Japan can &quot;print&quot; at many Yen as it wants at any time.</p>
<p>It is technically impossible for Japan to default on its debt. While printing Yen to pay off debt is bad, defaulting is worse, and if Japan ever comes into the situation of being in thread of default, Japan will print money.</p>
<p>When a default is impossible, a Greek-style panic-run is less likely.</p></div>		</li>
