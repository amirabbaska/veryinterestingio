			<div class="markdown"><p>Black and white film is simply made of silver halide (halide is chlorine, fluorine, or bromine - generally they used chlorides). The dissolved chemical is suspended in a thin layer (emulsion) of gelatin on the film (originally, on glass plates). When exposed to light, it can be developed. the more light, the faster the silver crystalizes out with developer chemicals. (reduces).  Then the undeveloped (unexposed) silver halide is dissolved out, with the fixer, so you can look at the finished product in light. </p>
<p>Where the light hit, therefore, developed as black silver crystals - so lightest parts are black, hence you have a negative. Expose anpother plate - glass, film, or paper - through the negative, and you get a positive. </p>
<p>Colour film is a more complex, multistep process. As mentioned, you need a layer for each colour - a layer sensitive mainly to red, to green and to blue (or technically, Cyan, magenta, and yellow). Each layer the light-sensitive silver halide is chemically tied to a dye of that colour - so a lot fancier chemistry. People made the original photography black and white stuff at home as amateurs originally. Colour was very advanced. </p>
<p>The exposed flim is developed to bring out the silver crystals (black) and the tied-in dies. The all the silver is dissolved out, leaving just the dyes behind. Again, there's a negative, but colour - more light makes dark, more red makes green, etc. </p>
<p>Slide film (no negative) is even more complex. the dye is tied to the undeveloped silver, so there's a two-step process where the exposed silver is developed and dissolved, then the remaining silver halide is developed with the dye, and then dissolved. </p>
<p>So what was needed? More precise multi-layer emulsion, and the fancier chemicals to tie coloured dyes to light-sensitive chemicals - and light-sensitive chemicals that were sensitive to a certain range of colour.</p>
<p>Of course, in the early days, there were other tricks - hand colouring, taking and combining several b&amp;w pictures with multiple cameras with different color filters in front of the lenses, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also remember technicolor was 3 fully separate black and white films synchronized and put though RGB one color for one film, until it was cheap enough in the 60s to get a single strip with multiple layers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was the technique used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Prokudin-Gorsky" target="_blank">Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky</a> to take and then project early color photographs.  He's been on the Reddit front page for that <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Prokudin-Gorskii-19.jpg" target="_blank">famous Russian photo</a>.</p>
<p>In more recent times, the <a href="http://www.bigbookofamigahardware.com/bboah/product.aspx?id=307" target="_blank">NewTek Digiview</a> for the Commodore Amiga was similar.  It used a black and white digital camera with an external color wheel that you'd actually rotate by hand to take three separate images, then combine them in software.  Obviously this was only useful for taking pictures of static things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These pictures are great! The quality is gorgeous, even the original composite is in great condition. The digital renderings give the strange impression that these pictures could have been taken quite recently, due to the quality.</p>
<p>edit: One of the sources from the linked article has <a href="http://www.prokudin-gorsky.ru/database.php3?first=0" target="_blank">the full collection (at least what we have) of the original pictures</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That technology is actually quite old, only a few decades younger than photography itself and there are for example real colour photographs from <a href="http://time.com/3803957/rare-color-photographs-from-the-trenches-of-world-war-i/" target="_blank">World War I</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first colour film is even older than World War I, here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs75ZIr0Fvk" target="_blank">the wedding video of the Kaiser's daughter in full colour</a>. It's nothing <em>quite</em> like technicolor yet, apparently someone used three separate cameras with filters, and then coloured the three films and glued them back together or something.</p></div>		</li>
