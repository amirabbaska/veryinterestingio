			<div class="markdown"><p>I would highly recommend Pushbullet for this: they have a new feature called <a href="https://www.pushbullet.com/channels" target="_blank">'Channels'</a> which is exactly for this kind of subscription-based thing, and it's free :D.</p>
<p>If you send an email to hey@pushbullet.com they will most likely even add you to their featured channels list since they are Science/<a href="/r/Pushbullet" target="_blank">Reddit</a> lovers. </p></div>		</li>
