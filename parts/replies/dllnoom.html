			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! That is a really good question. Essentially, dark matter is a term that people use both to refer to a problem in astronomy (something we don't fully understand), and one particular idea for a solution to that problem, and I think that can make it confusing to read about since different people treat the term in different ways.</p>
<p>The &quot;problem&quot; of dark matter is that if we measure how much mass is in, for example, the Andromeda Galaxy, by looking at how much light it emits and using what we know about stars, we get one answer. However, if we measure how much mass is there by observing the motion of the objects in the galaxy, we get a different, larger amount. This makes it look like there is a significant amount of mass in Andromeda (and other galaxies) which isn't emitting any light or interacting with the light that is there in any way. </p>
<p>One idea people have to explain this is that there <em>really is</em> invisible matter there, and we usually call that dark matter, though theories that describe specifically what dark matter is go by several names (for example, one is that dark matter is &quot;weakly interacting massive particles&quot; (usually called WIMPs!), some sort of really heavy particle we've never seen before. </p>
<p>However, there are alternative explanations. Some people believe that our theory of gravity (general relativity) is not completely right, and that if we knew the correct theory of gravity our calculations would not give different answers; that is, there isn't <em>actually</em> more mass than there seems to be, but we just don't fully understand how gravity works. </p>
<p>There's other hypotheses for what causes the dark matter &quot;problem&quot;, and no one is exactly sure which is the right one yet (though many people will argue for one or another being the best). </p>
<p>Hopefully that answers the thrust of your question. :)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey Dylan, thank you for your post. A follow-up question if I may: Which of the current working hypotheses on dark matter and/or modified gravity do you think is most plausible, and why?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I'm on the fence. I think that (as most do, as far as I know) modified gravity and a WIMP-like dark matter are the most likely explanations, but when it comes to particles versus an alternative theory of gravity, I really don't know yet. If you ask me again in a couple of years I might have a different answer, though.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I have a hard time understanding the fact that &quot;space-time&quot; might not be continuous throughout the universe. Can you explain it better?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The classical definition of spacetime says it is continuous. By continuous, we roughly mean that we can split a given length or time interval indefinitely. Can we split a length a little bit small than an atom, though? The question whether spacetime is discrete is only relevant at very small scales only (&quot;at Planck scales&quot;, in fancy words). The problem is that we cannot directly measure the discrete structure of spacetime at such tiny scales, so we don't really know whether spacetime is continuous or discrete. </p>
