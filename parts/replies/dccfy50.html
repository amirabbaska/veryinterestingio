			<div class="markdown"><p>What's really interesting about the mammalian ear is that it is actually derived from the jawbone, which is why these two parts of the head are related.  Early proto-mammals would generally &quot;listen&quot; to the sounds around them by putting their jaws against the ground.  The associated nerves were located close to the brain, right around where the jaw bone connects to the cranium.  This way, if anything was moving around them, they could feel the vibrations.  Over time, the ear bones became more adept at picking up and distinguishing sounds and became separate from the mandible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I had no idea that was the case!  Could this have been useful especially for some kind of animal that already had its head on or low to the ground, like a mouse?  Snakes and lizards do too, but I'm guessing they have different ear evolutions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not trying to step on any toes but this is actually incorrect.  When you yawn you simply open the eustachian tube which is normally closed.  This action allows pressure to equalize, however it DOES NOT cause the dampening of sound.</p>
<p>The act of yawning (during a stretch) or contracting your muscles (during an intense stretch) activates a small muscle called the tensor tympani.  The normal role for this muscle is to keep tension on the tympanic membrane to dampen loud noises so you don't blow out your ears.  Activation of the muscle further dampens your hearing, leading to perceived temporary deafness.</p></div>		</li>
