			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, sometimes they do not make a pill specific to your dosage. So you need to mix and match.</p>
<p>Conversely, there are some pharmacists (local, mom and pop types; not CVS or Walgreens), who make custom dosing pills. When I was on chemotherapy, there was a pharmacist like an hour a day who could make compound doses (multiple meds together), or custom dose pills. He was expensive though, and the insurance would only allow him to make certain prescriptions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>another I<em>think</em> was missed; sometimes you have to take varying doses of a medication at different times of day. Very common with both a-type and c-type steroids, some antibiotics, and therapeutic-dose nutrients. So it's easier on all parties to have one 'scrip for one size pill and vary the amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could the time for something to be dissolved in the stomach play into it as well? Two smaller pills will dissolve faster than one large pill of the same overall volume, due to the increased surface area. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  While yes, dissolution involves some time and is the first step of an oral dosage form becoming bioavailable, it's rather negligible compared to everything else and is rarely clinically significant.  If we need to get something into your body quickly (e.g. aspirin during a heart attack), we'll recommend chewing it or get it into your body some other way that doesn't involve the oral route. </p>
<p>For OP's question, it's most likely that the strength written for isn't available. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also a possibility, yes. I don't find it to be too common of a reason, as the time difference is usually negligible at best, but it can be one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Goes along with bigger pills might not exist, but economies of scale play a part. Can keep costs down if you just make one standard size and when people need a larger dose, if the jump in amount isn't huge, it's easier to just take two.</p>
<p>You had a great answer, I just wanted to add the economies of scale answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also an answer, yep! Generally, drug companies make their drugs in multiple sizes, but proportionally, the most commonly prescribed doses are the ones that are produced the most. Sometimes a pharmacy has to special order a certain size if the prescription calls for it.</p></div>		</li>
