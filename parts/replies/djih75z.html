			<div class="markdown"><p>Cysteine is basically vital to most proteins found outside of cells. Chemokines, antibodies, etc. all have cysteines because while proteins are generally held together by &quot;weak&quot; interactions, and a lot of them (hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals interactions) cysteines are capable of forming a very strong bond (covalent) with one another. </p>
<p>A protein's function depends on it's 3-D shape, like when you fold a piece of paper in two (or I guess, a better example would be into origami or something). When the proteins leave your cells, it's especially important for them to keep that shape since they aren't inside of the cell, which has all sorts of &quot;machines&quot; to either fix or get rid of mis-folded proteins. So a lot of the proteins that need to exist outside of cells have these strong, cysteine-cysteine bonds that help keep it's 3-D shape better than most others.</p></div>		</li>
