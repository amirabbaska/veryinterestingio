			<div class="markdown"><p>And I don't think it is a fair comparison. AFAIK, in the USA, most home use gas for heating, cooking and water heater. I know they talk about electricity only, but they should go with &quot;energy used&quot; instead and do include those. It would change the list quite alot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly part of what concerns me is that so many people wonder &quot;How can I reduce energy consumption in my household to save the environment?&quot;, but many sources seem to indicate that commerce and industry consist of greater than 50% of energy consumption throughout the world. While there is <em>some</em> benefit to being conscious of your own environmental footprint, it is far more urgent to regulate industry and commerce; regulating households barely puts a dent on humanity's environmental footprint!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This statistic is a great example of why information, while technically true, can mislead. Taken on it's face the data could lead one to believe that air conditioning has a much greater environmental impact than heating; in fact, the opposite is true. Why? Because this answer addresses only the use of electricity, while heating uses other energy sources, in particular natural gas. When all energy sources are considered heating has a much larger relative impact.</p>
<p>This effect is multiplied by a simple fact: in much of the northern hemisphere we require a bigger temperature differential from outside air when heating than when cooling. In the US for example, a typical temperature swing from winter to summer is from the freezing point (32F) to about 90F. When heating, an energy conscious household will maintain about 68F in the house, for a delta of 36 degrees. However, in summer they only need to bring the inside temperature down to about 76F, for a delta of 14 degrees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd be VERY surprised.  Someone posted a thorough explanation but you might be more interested in TL;DR.</p>
<p>The efficiency of an air conditioner (heat pump in general) is called the coefficient of performance (&quot;COP&quot;).  It is defined as the ratio between heat transferred by the heat pump and the energy put in.  It tends to be greater than 1.  So if you want to cool your house by 10 kW you might only spend 2 kW of electricity to do so, so COP=5 (I can't find figures on what kind of COP a central air conditioner actually has; this is an example number.  Edit: 4 is about typical.)</p>
<p>It sounds like efficiency over 100%, but the heat isn't disappearing, it's moving from inside to out.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>3.2. COP, AFUE, EER, and SEER
In the US, the energy efficiencies of heating and cooling appliances are currently rated using different measures—a situation that does not encourage direct comparisons. For furnaces and boilers the measure is typically the annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE), for room air conditioners it is the energy efficiency ratio (EER), and for central air conditioners it is the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER). In this paper, the three measures were converted into a common measure of energy output (energy generated for heating or energy transferred for cooling) divided by energy input—the coefficient of performance (COP)—using the following approximate conversions [8]:</p>
<p>3.3. Results
The heating sources in the US are natural gas (69% of energy generated), oil and other petroleum liquids (17%), liquid petroleum gas (7%), and electricity (7%) [9]. COPs for new furnaces and boilers powered by natural gas or heating oil are currently in the range of 0.80–0.98, while for electric resistance heating they are near 1.00 [10]. In contrast, for new central air conditioners, COPs are currently between about 3.1 and 4.3 [11]. (For new room air conditioners, COPs are typically between about 2.8 and 3.5 [12].) Note that the COP of an air conditioner can be greater than 1 because it operates much like a lever, a block-and-pulley system, or a gear ratio that provides a mechanical advantage, allowing a greater quantity of heat energy to be transferred than the electrical energy that is consumed to create the movement.</p>
<p>3.4. Conclusion
A typical central air conditioner is about 4 times more energy efficient than a typical furnace or boiler (3.6 divided by 0.9 equals 4).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>efficiency is weird in a way. gas and oil are inefficient but they have a high heat input meaning they give you heat quick, and they are cheaper than electricity or an AC heatpump. electricity is pretty much 100% efficient but the heat output is slow ( think the toaster oven) and electricity is much more expensive.</p></div>		</li>
