			<div class="markdown"><p>Before computers, it was somewhat impractical to ever consider aerodynamics at all for consumer cars, so most companies didn't bother. They just deigned things that <em>looked</em> cool, and then designed (and sometimes hand-crafted) the car to fit the design. While older cars back then were very much more distinctive, they were also quite fuel-inefficient, and inconsistent in their safety.</p>
<p>I had a paragraph here about not being able to use Navier-Stokes Equations in the 1950s but I was corrected. Basically, cheap gas meant no one cared much about fuel economy, so people designed their cars however they pleased, economy of parts and manufacture permitting.</p>
<p>Primitive graphics software also allowed much more precision using computer-numerically controlled machine tools by the 1980s. Limitations here are why many cars designed at that time <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Ford_Thunderbird_1980.jpg" target="_blank">looked very boxy</a>. In the 1990s these CNC machine tools were able to do things like beizer curves or NURBS, and companies went to town <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/98-99_Ford_Taurus_Sedan.jpg" target="_blank">with newly enabled curves</a>. </p>
<p>This all became much more subdued in the 2000s when computers were able to facilitate the design of a car in literally any shape they wanted, plus optimization to any degree. Hence, fuel economy and safety per dollar becoming big driving factors.</p>
<p>EDIT1: Fuel efficiency historically has been more important to the demand for aerodynamics than analytical limitations. Thanks to the comments below.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Numerous comments have been made about my incautious remarks about the history of aerodynamics. Thank you for keeping me informed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I guess bigger American Muscle Cars might be different - you had big roads and built bigger cars to fill them.</p>
<p>In the UK and much of Europe cars have actually got progressively heavier as we have improved the build quality, added airbags and made them safer.</p>
<p>Many European family cars in the 1970s would barely tip the scales at 800kg.</p>
<p>Your average family car today would start at 1200kg.</p>
<p>For instance, a current Ford Focus has a kerb weight of 1275kg.
A Gen 1 Focus was ~1100kg. It's predecessor (the Ford Escort) started out with a kerb weight of ~770kg in it's 1968 Mk1 incarnation, which put on fat to reach 1000-1100kg by the time they released the Gen. 6 Escort in 1995.</p>
<p>Basically a 2016 Focus at the kerb weighs as much as a Mk1 Escort with all 4 seats filled plus luggage!</p>
<p>This trend is starting to reverse as increasing lightweight steel alloys, aluminium alloys and composite materials become affordable for use in non-supercars and are combined with advanced manufacturing techniques to bring the weights back down to enhance fuel efficiency, handling, safety and stopping distances (the irony is that as cars have gained safer designs, airbags and crumple zones, they've also become harder to stop, because kinetic energy = mass x velocity squared, so heavier cars have sapped the benefit of improved brakes and tyres!).</p></div>		</li>

<p>We also had crazy cheap gas.  Like 1/4 the price you guys were paying.  That's why Europe cared about fuel efficiency and preferred small cars, as well as the many old (as in older than the USA itself) roads that a big car wouldn't fit down.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They were much lighter than you might realize. A 1960 Ford Galaxie was about 1,650 kg; A new Ford Fusion (Mondeo to the rest of the world) is about 1,550 kg. A new Ford Taurus is &gt;1,800 kg. Cars the world over have been getting bigger and heavier since the 1960s.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pantograph milling machines that can be used to machine complex surfaces were invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantograph#Sculpture_and_minting" target="_blank">James Watt in the 18th century</a>. Bezier curves and surfaces were invented in the 1950s, and made public <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_surface#History" target="_blank">in 1962</a>.</p>
<p>If you needed CNC machine tools to make aerodynamic surfaces, how do you think they made propeller blades before? In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ3YZ4foFHk" target="_blank">15 min video from the 1940s</a> you can see, among many other things, the machines that carved metal in the exact shape needed for an aerodynamic surface.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We knew a <em>lot</em> about aerodynamics at the time, and it was never impractical to consider it because of a lack of computing. We found it with lots of math, and even more trial and error. </p>
<p>The reason they didn't really care was because gas was stupid cheap, not because they weren't able to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely. Companies were designing cars for aerodynamics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatra_V570" target="_blank">even in the 1930s</a>. </p>
<p>The absence of CFD isn't a <em>huge</em> issue. Wind tunnels have existed for a while now, and they're often more accurate than computer models. The advantage of CFD is that it allows engineers to examine a larger number of design alternatives without building physical mock-ups, and do it quicker than a purely experimental effort. However, it does not do away with the need for wind-tunnel testing. Physical models still needs to be tested to make sure that the computer models accurately predict real-world results.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatra_77" target="_blank">another example</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1935 the T77 was updated and improved, which resulted in the T77a... The smooth body of the T77a gave a coefficient of aerodynamic drag of 0.212, an incredibly low value even for today's cars, as only a few modern prototypes are able to achieve this figure although some sources confirm that this figure is based on a 1:5 model test.</p>

<p>aerodynamics, sure, CFD, not so much. until computation became relatively affordable, companies would hire interns to grind out FEA calculations  by hand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The operative word in /u/accidentallybrill's post is still &quot;impractical,&quot; not &quot;impossible.&quot; This is an important distinction. </p>
<p>Even if 1950s technology were sufficient to do aerodynamic optimization, as you said, the low price of fuel rendered the ROI on that sort of optimization too low to be worth pursuing. That's kind of the definition of &quot;impractical.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can definitely confirm this. The govt, has strict regulations on efficiency and safety. When it comes to safety the government regulates everything down to the material you can use for the dash, and what the tolerances of the slopes of the curves on the dash let alone the the type of curve you can have on the front or rear bumper. </p>
<p>Those old cars do look really cool, but let's be honest. Some of them are death traps if you get caught in an accident. More people died of car accidents in 1960 than they did in 2014 and we drove 3X as much.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been in three bad crashes, and have walked from each. 1 my fault, second riding passenger when someone ran a red-light and we t-boned them (didn't help he got scared and hit the gas instead of the brake). 3 spun off an icy highway, through a telephone pole and into 3 used cars on a lot. 3 got a concussion, but walked away just fine. </p>
<p>Important to add. 1 was a 2003 Dodge Ram 4x4, quad cab, with grill guard. 2 was a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee. 3 was a 2005 Dodge quad cab 4x4. </p>
<p>All impacts were from 30-50mph. Had it been more then it def would be worse. With that being said. Cars do 'comfort' you when you crash. I never felt anything except a couple bruises in the days after. This long rant is just to prove how right you are in the safety aspect. It is well looked after, or I may not be able to type this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing that really drove this home for me is the video where they crash a 2009 Chevy Malibu into a 1959 Chevy Bel Air, both with crash dummies inside. With all the steel, you imagine the Bel Air cutting through the Malibu like wrapping paper, but the dummy in the Bel Air is absolutely dead, whereas the Malibu dummy lived and might even be able walk away from the accident under their own power. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few months ago I was at a red light when a car in the perpendicular lane tried to take a left just as another car sped through, crashing into it head on at 40mph+. I quickly pulled a u-turn and parked in a lot, then ran to the crashed cars. Another pedestrian was already on the phone with 911.</p>
<p>The guy who caused the accident was dazed, but conscious. His vehicle was basically okay, and I let him know an ambulance was coming. </p>
<p>The other vehicle was just destroyed. The front was completely collapsed. I knocked on the window and...honestly I can't remember if I got a response or not, but I opened the door expecting to find corpses inside. Happily, there were two very shaken, only slightly injured girls, still in complete shock. I asked if they were ok, asked if they could move, and once we determined they could, suggested we get them out of the vehicle since it was in the middle of the intersection and cars were driving all around us. I managed to escort them to the sidewalk and hung out with them for a few minutes before the EMTs showed up. </p>
<p>(I gave my info and described what I saw before leaving.)</p>
<p>But Jesus Christ, if that car hadn't had crumple zones and airbags those two girls would have died instantly. I can't believe they walked away from that.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thank you, of course, to whoever gave me gold. Very generous and very unnecessary. I made this point in another comment, and I don't mean to come across as preachy, but I didn't do anything remarkable -- I barely helped the situation. It's unfortunate that doing the bare minimum of human decency is seen as a heroic act, but maybe if we all joined hands and did, at the very least, the absolute minimum to be kind to each other, maybe we can make the world a marginally better place. You guys are great. Thanks for the gold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They built solid cars back then, but that was their main safety flaw. Just look at how the steering wheel in the Bel Air goes up into the dummy's grill while the dummy's inertia is carrying it forward...45mph driving speed, steering column coming at you at that plus the speed of the car hitting you. And the way the windshield on the Bel Air just flies away like it's saying, &quot;Later.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
