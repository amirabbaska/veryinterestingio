<p>Not really. While meat is obviously high in protein, it has smaller amounts of carbs, fats, and micronutrients than the human body needs. Vitamin C, for example, is a vital nutrient for humans (since we don't produce it), and it's most easily found in fruits and leafy vegetables. You'd actually be better off eating only mashed potatoes instead of meat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vitamin C is present in high quantities in the liver of most animals. Same with other nutrients. You can't get everything you need only by eating 'meat,' but if you're willing to consume the organs and other parts not normally consumed, you would be fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point. It's like skydiving: You don't need a parachute to skydive. You need a parachute to skydive more than once, and you technically have the rest of your life to get it open once you're out of the airplane.</p></div>		</li>
