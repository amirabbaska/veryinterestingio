			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree it could be a MPG game, diesels do not run stoichiometric air/fuel ratios.  The cars in question are all diesels.  Diesels always ingest the maximum amount of air in the intake stroke, which is why there is no throttle body.  Throttle is controlled by the amount of fuel injected.  Fuel is injected at the end of the compression stroke, with the cylinder at TDC.  AFR ratios vary significantly due to throttle and load.  The cars had software that most likely turned on and off the EGR.  The EGR is mostly responsible for controlling NOx emissions in diesels.  However, this comes at a cost.  When exhaust gases a recirculated into the engine there is less available oxygen which results in a loss of efficiency.  Both power and fuel economy are impacted.  The real problem is that EGR causes carbon particulates to blow by the piston rings into the oil which deceases the lubricating properties of the oil, causing premature engine wear.  The recirculating gas which contains soot, unburned fuel, and oil can also cause build up on the intake valves and problems with the intake swirl flaps.  This problem will effect power, fuel mileage, reliability and engine longevity if a proper solution is not implemented, such as DEF.    </p></div>		</li>

<p>I had a 1.3 turbo diesel. 104,000 Miles. At that millage, when I took apart the intake manifold (it burst and made a hole somehow...) the whole thing was full of carbon  buildup, probably restricting it by a third or even more..</p>
<p>After I cleaned it all out, all the smoke I was getting before dissapeared, throttle response was much better etc. I was going to take out the egr but turned to be a bit of a pain so I left it (was selling it anyway) but the egr seized a few times. I'm sure it siezed closed. Definitely didn't siezed open that's for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You WILL notice a mpg boost without much if any of a power loss, depending on the tune you can increase power and mpg! Advancing the timing, shorter injection window with same fuel volume / IQ, and a couple other things play into it. On TDIs this means upward of 5 mpg gains from tuning alone which can be done at the flip of a switch. I am guilty of tuning my TDI to increase economy, If I have learned anything these vehicles are eye opening how much can be tuned just via computer. My question though, I read they base emissions on &quot;per gallon of fuel&quot; rather than per mile?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, lets see if the sales do outweight the cheating. I know my number isn't going to be accurate because I'm too lazy to add more variables and I only feel like averaging, but here it goes.</p>
<p>Here are the base prices of the diesel models:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passat: $26,410</li>
<li>Golf: $25,895</li>
<li>Jetta: $24,075</li>
<li>Beetle: $25,330</li>
<li>Touareg: $63,245</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, assuming they sold similar numbers of each of those cars (a reasonable assumption, since the market for TDI diesel isn't huge so each model completely fills its niche), the average would be $32,991. The Touareg is an outlier, but it didn't skew the average too bad, the average is still not far off the next highest priced car, the Passat. Now, lets add on 5k and turn it into $37,991, since its also a reasonable assumption that the average person is adding on 5k in options. Remember, these are base models that likely don't even include power windows or air conditioning and have a painfully slow 4 cylinder engine. This also includes dealer markup, no dealer worth his salt is going to let you walk off the lot without paying at least 10% over the base price, which they usually hide in the loan terms.</p>
<p>Let's multiply <em>that</em> number by 550,000, which is the total recall amount, since its almost entirely diesel models. The number comes out to $20,895,050,000. Even if my number is off by 5%, they still made over $1 billion on the sales over what the fines cost. Not only that, but if they do the smart thing and settle with the EPA instead of going to court, they will almost certainly be able to write the whole $18 billion dollars off and make up for the fine with the taxes they won't be paying, like Bank of America did. In other words, the number might seem huge, but this is just another Bank of America style &quot;cost of doing business.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're comparing the fine with the total price of the cars. You should compare it to the profit/car. </p>

<p>I'm guessing arounf 3-10% profit... so they made around 2bln in profit from those cars. Compare to 18bln potential fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I guess it is a big deal then. If Germany's inquiry also results in a large fine, there's a serious chance that VW could go out of business globally, rather than just exiting the US market, which is pretty much the least that will happen at this point unless they can negotiate down the fine. I can't really say they don't deserve it, though. Who knows how many thousands of people are going to die of cancer a few years or decades earlier because of this.</p></div>		</li>
