			<div class="markdown"><p>Stronger is not relative to the heart, its a container of blood and it needs to pump it. The bulkier it is due to size, decreases the amount of room for blood(it is 'strong enough' already).</p>
<p>Its response to stress(stimulants) and constricted arteries the heart must work harder to pump the same amount of blood, so it does get larger.</p>
<p>taken from /u/mmtree</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you exercise, you increase heart rate but you also get a dilation of the arteries (aorta, brachial artery, femoral artery, etc) due to the build up of metabolites like lactic acid, increased CO2-- thus you get a decrease in systolic pressure and a slight increase/no change in diastolic. This means your heart can pump blood easily, albeit quickly, and become efficient but not get bulky; similar to how a gymnast or cyclist trains. </p>

<p>The ideal heart is an elastic and springy one, not a larger and bulky one with thicker walls and less room for blood.</p></div>		</li>
