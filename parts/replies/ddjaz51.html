			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! So I'm going to make a completely baseless assumption, would that mean that people who actually have speech impediments have neurons that are dead or missing? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I stutter and they've found a few key areas that are a little different, but much of secondary stuttering is related to muscles in the throat and face. The funny thing is I don't tend to horribly mispronounce words once I say them and anything over text is absolutely fine. We're not missing neurons, we are wired differently. I've provided an article that states some over-activity, though they've also found reduced blood flow to other areas related with speech in many stutterers. It's important to note that we don't stutter in our minds; we have completely fluent and vivid thoughts. I don't know very much about other speech impediments.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>here's an interesting situation for study… I  I do not stutter however I did stutter one time when somebody approached me who was angry and voicing that anger as they approached… it was not dangerous, I knew the person, it was more that it was unusual for them to be angry at me in the first place...  I would say I was feeling surprise and a little bit of alarm.  not for my physical safety so much that they might not like me.</p>
<p>I think this particular experience shows that it's more a result of situation </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've stuttered since I was able to talk, although the severity has greatly reduced the second half of my life (I'm about to turn 32).  I can often hold full conversations without any obvious problems unless the other person knew what to look for.</p>
<p>I'm opposite from your other response, as my stuttering has no relation to face or jaw muscles and has never settled on any particular sound, phrase, or word.  My impediment is solely based on high-pressure and high-expectation speaking situations.  I'm pretty terrible at introducing myself in a business meeting or over a conference call with a client or with management.  Conversely, I have no problem giving a presentation to my coworkers who I see and interact with on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I will agree that I do not stutter in my mind and I can practice phrases out loud without a single stutter.  Put those same phrases in a high-pressure situation, though, and I can turn into a stuttering mess.</p>
<p>Edit: It's also interesting to note that my 3 year old shows no sign of stuttering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmmm, how odd.  I stuttered when I was younger as well (grade school) and as I grew older it's gone away.  The thing is that in my mind I stuttered and my speech mirrored it.
Nowadays I notice that it's caused by nervousness, it's very rare now that I speak with a stutter and only in very tense situations.  My shameful secret is that my brain still does it fairly often but my mouth has learned to avoid it. How strange, never really thought much about it till now... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never had an issue stuttering when I was younger.  But after I started getting migraines it's gotten progressively worse. Most of my stuttering happens when I'm comfortable and speaking off the cuff.  But I can be articulate during meetings and presentations despite being nervous because I've already come up with measured responses. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not that they have dead or missing neurons. Its that people have legitimate speech impediments is that their brain is literally hard wired like that, brain to speech is wired difderently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lag in computer processing has nothing to do with mixing up speech. Lags occur in programs because the data isn't readily available (i.e. cached), but the data returned will always be the same. The data returned will not be different just because it hasn't been accessed in a long time. </p></div>		</li>
