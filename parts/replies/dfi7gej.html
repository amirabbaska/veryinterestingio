			<div class="markdown"><p>So not just from our sun? It's starting to make sense.</p>
<p>I'm at primary teacher and a student referred to being made of star dust and my explanation fell woefully short. I told him to research it at home and I'd ask reddit.
Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few weeks ago, we completed a digital citizenship unit - message boards and forums came up as a way that people engage with others online. I thought that using Reddit would not only illustrate how different members build on each others' ideas and points of view, it is also a valid way to learn something new.
I realise that the information here needs to come with a disclaimer, but it definitely gets the key points across. I've asked a couple of students to do their own research into this (it was their question after all) and they will probably do a simple Google search.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're explicitly not made of material from our sun, really. That material is still trapped in the sun by and large. Previous stars that have gone nova have seeded space with their elements. The sun is not going to go nova, and if it did we wouldn't be around to benefit from the seeding :)</p>
<p>Note that this is not the <em>only</em> way other elements are produced. For instance, any radioactive decay is also producing a new element, and this is happening all over the place on earth at any given time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that our solar system itself is made up from recycled materials from nearby stellar nebulae which would have had a supernova and spread out a lot of other materials which over billions of years collected into a Protoplanetary disk.
