			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Note that 1.6 is quite close to 1.5 (ratio of 3 : 2) and 1.66... (ratio of 5 : 3) which is a pretty good estimate for things that are neither very square nor very stretched. Look at your tv screen, which is probably something like 16 : 9 ~ 1.7; or a piece of paper, which is sqrt(2) : 1 ~ 1.4. I'll bet you that with a bit of trial-and-error you'll fit a good golden ratio to it. To the human eye, those are pretty close, and you'd be surprised how easy it is to fit a golden ratio spiral onto an image with a bit of cheating. For example, check out either of these Google Image results: <a href="http://media02.hongkiat.com/golden-ratio-in-moden-designs/mona-lisa-golden%20ratio.jpg" target="_blank">http://media02.hongkiat.com/golden-ratio-in-moden-designs/mona-lisa-golden%20ratio.jpg</a>, <a href="https://b.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-large/inline/2015/04/3044877-inline-i-1-the-golden-ratio-designs-biggest-urban-legend.jpg" target="_blank">https://b.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-large/inline/2015/04/3044877-inline-i-1-the-golden-ratio-designs-biggest-urban-legend.jpg</a> - do you notice how many of the lines in the image actually <em>don't</em> really match  up with anything substantial?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The second article you linked to debunk the myth doesn't even agree with your claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the appearance of the golden ratio in nature, which is real, substantiated, and of considerable scientific interest</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to say that the golden ratio is an unreliable measure of beauty, that's fair. Beauty is entirely subjective. The golden ratio for sure appears in nature, though, and the top comment explains it pretty well.</p></div>		</li>
