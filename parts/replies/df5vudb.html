			<div class="markdown"><p>Something very important to note is that diplomatic immunity applies to a position, not a person.</p>
<p>So if someone commits a crime in another country being a diplomat won't protect them automatically. It has to be confirmed by the diplomats country. They could obviously lie but no government is likely to claim immunity if an ambassador murdered someone while on vacation for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The immunity applies only in the country where the diplomat is accredited, and on travels between that country and the diplomat's home country. On a vacation, you wouldn't have immunity, even though you carry a diplomatic passport. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can be sued for not paying rent, and you can be ordered to pay it by a court of the host country, as you're only exempted from civil liability if it arises from actions done as part of your job. If you still refuse, the host country has no way to force you to pay within the legal system though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a host country can expel a diplomat.</p>
<p>So someone from country B can't just remain committing crimes in country A once country A tells said diplomat to GTFO.</p></div>		</li>
