			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing" target="_blank">Simulated</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_annealing" target="_blank">quantum</a> annealing might be of interest - it's an optimisation technique used to look for the maximum/minimum value of a function, where you can't easily solve that analytically, or test every possible input value.</p>
<p>So instead of trying to <em>always</em> move &quot;uphill&quot; to better values, it randomly skips around. The probability of moving is weighted towards favouring better values, just not so absolutely weighted that it refuses to ever abandon a local peak. You gradually decrease the simulation's willingness to move downhill and hope that it settles into the <em>global</em> maximum rather than just a little local maxima.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Annealing is really interesting - you can use it to infer far-fetched relationships with reasonable accuracy. It's very useful for narrowing down large data sets.</p>
<p>If you have data that weakly indicates a relationship, and you want to confirm it with reasonable accuracy, you can use annealing. Basically, a lot of weak evidence can add up to almost irrefutable evidence.</p></div>		</li>
