			<div class="markdown"><p>R12 and R134a cannot be absorbed at all, they just asphyxiate.  Holding your breath isn't the same thing because the urge to breathe comes from elevated CO2 in the lungs, not low O2.  It is also accompanied by the bio changes of high waste CO2 in the blood.</p>
<p><del>R410a</del><strong>R152a</strong> (difluoroethane), replacing R134a due to its global warming potential, is actually absorbable into the bloodstream and can affect the brain directly, thus an increased potential for abuse.  Also a bit flammable.  </p>
<p>Almost all office air duster cans are <del>R410a</del><strong>R152a</strong> now.  They add a bitterant to discourage abuse but it is a solid dust that gets on things and never really goes away.  Eating a sandwich once you get it on your hands is very unpleasant.</p>
<p>Bitterant was never required by law, but the mfgs didn't want to be associated with a &quot;huffer&quot; market, nor did they want to be the one who didn't put this &quot;protection&quot; in while others did</p></div>		</li>

<p>One of my A&amp;P professors was also a toxicologist on the side, he told us about a case where some idiotic kid had put a large plastic bag over his head, taped the opening of the bag around his neck and then inserted the straw from a can of compressed air and squeezed.  The kid obviously died, but according to the kid's friend he thought it would make sure that the &quot;air doesn't readily escape for an epic high&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Excuse my ignorance. He squirted compressed air into a bag he had taped over his head and his death should be obvious? Is compressed air not air? Is it because it gets cold when it decompresses? Are there other bad things in there in addition to the air?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly - those &quot;duster cans&quot; often contain various things that aren't air.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_duster" target="_blank">The stuff from the cans are typically 1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane, or 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane</a>.  They compress better than atmospheric air as you can get more into a can than with the air around you.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Not a factor in this, based on the details the professor gave, it wouldn't have done anything even if the bag deflated a little once the air heated up to room temperature/</p>
<p>You tend to get high from inhaling the stuff because there's not enough oxygen, so your brain doesn't function right.  Typically this isn't ESPECIALLY harmful if you temporarily deprive yourself of oxygen as you begin to breathe normal air again.  By taping the bag to your head, you're enclosing yourself into a space with limited oxygen.  While high, you may not be in the state of mind to even realize the situation and not pull the bag off in time, leading to suffocation.  </p>
<p>Basically, bad ideas together that leads to you dying from a lack of oxygen.</p></div>		</li>
