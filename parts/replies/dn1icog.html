			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, same.  Especially number 1 and 3.  Number two there was definitely a change between number 1 and the other two but it just seemed like a vividiness thing I didn't perceive any change in hue.  Number 1 and 3 are the same picture side by side to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow it's kind of incredible as those images have incredible color differences. Like in the third image the ground is covered in leaves in the path and across the grass that are all reddish-brown and they completely disappear in the right-side image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right? Barely any difference between them (except for the protan example in the balloon house, because I'm a deuteran).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is interesting because as a color-normal person I can't tell the difference between the protan and deuteran ones in that example. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone with normal vision, please tell me something... in picture #2, are the 2nd and 3rd photos drastically different or do they look somewhat the same?</p>
<p>I am only mildly colorblind so ... it's confusing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They look very similar, but the red balloons resemble olive green in the deuteran photo, and are more of a dark gray in the shade and a darker olive green on the light-facing side in the protan.</p></div>		</li>
