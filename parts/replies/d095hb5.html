			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very interesting question.  The curve that the OP is showing is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Sepkoski curve&quot;, named after Jack Sepkoski.  He and David Raup did a lot of work studying diversity through time, and did a lot of the foundational work on extinction events.  They considered the bias you're referring to, as well as other potential biases (e.g. variation in the rate of sedimentary rock formation).  Much of this has been addressed by a combination of statistical methods, and newly discovered fossil assemblages in which large numbers of soft-bodied organisms were preserved in addition to hard-bodied ones (e.g. in China).  Correcting for these biases doesn't change the outcome, however.  There does appear to be an increase in diversity following a hyperbolic pattern, but we aren't really sure why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know either, but could it be because life becomes increasingly good at filling in ecological niches? Say you put all plant species on a plot with only two axis: x for temperature and y for humidity. The first plant would be somewhere hot and humid and fill in a large region on your plot even though it's not that efficient, just because the space is vacant. New plants would fill in new regions, but after a while new plants would nest in between other plants until your plot is full of small, overlapping blots and the first plant doesn't even have a chance anymore against the more specialized ones. Then you have a mass extinction and you wipe out every second blot, but since they're already spread out it doesn't take up much time to fill the plot again. And nature actually creates new niches to expand the plot over multiple axis, for example every flowering plant creates a niche for a specialized pollinator and if there are enough polinators they might have parasites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to this graph, wouldn't a mass extinction event happening now be like an asset bubble bursting in a fastly-growing marketplace? In other words, more of a return to the mean?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biodiversity estimations are intrinsically skewed by the data we have available. Not every species is well-preserved, and there are not always data from all ecological niches in all time periods. There are untold numbers of species that we will never know about by virtue of their scarcity, their inability to be preserved, or that the environment in which they lived was rarely preserved, or that the strata are not available- physically buried and never seen except in core samples, or have been weathered or eroded away. A fossil is the exception, and not the rule: some vertebrates are known only from single bones, or from a handful of bones like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanosaurus" target="_blank">titanosaurus</a> and its vertebrae + limb bones. The story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphicoelias" target="_blank">A. fragillimus</a> is a fascinating one.</p>
<p>So, while graphical data like that are interesting, it must be viewed with some skepticism as to how the authors arrived at these numbers. Now, if those estimates include flowering plants and particularly grasses, I could believe it.</p></div>		</li>
