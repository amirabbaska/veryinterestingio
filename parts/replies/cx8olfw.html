<p>Have you ever worn a latex glove, then dipped your fingers in water?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used to work nights at a homeless shelter (man, I miss that job sometimes) and half of my shifts would end with me cleaning the men's showers. For the morning clean-up we'd have volunteers from the shelter help us and, depending on who was helping, I'd have a helper or I might not (there's some people we would single out to clean the showers when they helped out: they were hard workers and had a good attention to detail, perfect for making sure the showers were clean and devoid of hair). Regardless, cleaning 9 (or 5, if I had a helper) regular, single stalls and 1 large handicapped stall made me feel so gross from head to toe (very damp room, been up most the night, sweaty from giving the stalls a good cleaning). After a shift where I had cleaned the shower stalls, my hands felt the worst and it was an a feeling I could also describe as the &quot;having cleaned a bunch of shower stalls while wearing latex gloves&quot; feeling. </p>
<p>On the plus side, that job gave me a ton of time to read and talking to homeless people before they go to bed is hilarious. Very few people have as many good stories, the funniest people I've met have been homeless, and the ribbing you a young early-to-mid 20-year-old gets from homeless men in their 40s or 50s is priceless.</p>
<p>On the downside... those goddamn latex gloves.</p>
<p>Fuck 'em.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that explains a lot. Every time I get latex gloves wet they feel wet and it drives me crazy, my brain really thinks my hands are wet even when I know they aren't, sometimes driving me to the point of changing the gloves just to get rid of the feeling. It's very annoying!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! And then it bugs the ever living hell out of me because I can't tell if my hand or glove is wet or not! So then I take the glove off, wash and dry my hands, and get a new pair of gloves... I'm glad I'm not the only one who does this. </p>
<p>It's even worse when this happens while emptying preservative juice out the large plastic bag we keep the dissection lab cats in (clear light yellow liquid), because then my fingers feel like they're trapped in a glove full of corpse juice.</p></div>		</li>
