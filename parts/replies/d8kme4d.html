<p>Almost, I would say. Dams, as in all structures, have designed-in safety margins, including the height of the dam. But anything we build has a limit to the number of failure modes we can design for and still fund the project.  Many of the structures we designed in the past were designed on very little real world experience with, so we overbuilt the shit out of them.  </p>
<p>Look at the old suspension bridges and the weight of the cabling systems. We just didn't have enough experience with cables in this application to understand their failure modes, so we overcompensated.  </p>
<p>The Brooklyn Bridge was opened in 1883.  The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in 1933.  Just looking at them, which one is lighter?</p>
<p>Most of our dams are really old structures. The life expectancy of the engineers that designed them was less than 50 years.  I think they built them to last long enough for the next generation of engineers to figure out a better way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would that be exponential as well? Since the pressure on the dam rises not just because of the  new water added, but because the pressure exerted outward by all the water is higher against the sides of the body of water, including against the damn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, water pressure increases in a linear fashion in relation to water depth. So it doesn't matter if you are in a 300 ft deep pool or 300 ft deep in the ocean, the water pressure is the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, earthen dams have weeping tiles run throughout the face of the dam.  These keep the slope of the dam dry.  If it gets wet throughout, it's very unstable and can collapse.  </p>
<p>I could definitely see in times of heavy rain that the toe drains can't handle all of the rain soaking in to the face and then can't handle the pressure of the rising water behind the dam.  </p></div>		</li>
