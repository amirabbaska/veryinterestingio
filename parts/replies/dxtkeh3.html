<p>Slight correction.</p>
<p>In humans at least, the teeth are not &quot;plugged into the bone&quot;, there is a significant separation called the periodontal ligament. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but it is; The tooth and the bone are necessarily separated and when this is not the case, that's called anquilosis and a major hassle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, I meant more like there is an indentation in the jaw bone in which the teeth are set, a sort of gap if you will. Sharks do not have this gap. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, mammals are the only ones with teeth in sockets in the jaw (thecodont dentition). Bony fish, amphibians, most reptiles are acrodont..with teeth cemented to the top of the jaw. Sharks, as you said, are even more different with their teeth not even cemented to the jaw but instead attached to gums. </p></div>		</li>

<p>To explain: sharks do not have sockets in their jaw bones for teeth. Rather, they grow out of the skin, which is why they are able to have so many cycles of teeth. In most other animals, the teeth are plugged into the jaw bone. This is not the case in sharks. This is probably because shark jaws are not entirely homologous, evolutionary seen, to our jaw bones. The jaws of sharks are developed from the first pharyngeal arch if I remember correctly, which is the same arch that our jaws are developed from. However, cartilaginous fish, also known as chondrichtyes, do not really develop as many bones as we do. Rather, a lot of their skeleton is made of cartilage. The rest of their skull develops very differently from bony fish (osteichtyes) and from tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles (including birds) and mammals). If I'm correct, although evolutionary development is a while ago for me, the feature of having dentition incorporated into the skeleton happened after the evolution of bony fish, which have jaws that are more similar to ours. Since sharks split off from bony fish before this happened, their jaws are different from ours.</p>

<p>Tooth replacement is common in reptiles as well, and many reptiles (e.g. crocodilians) have socketed teeth. Furthermore, teeth develop directly from the &quot;skin&quot; (oral epithelium) in all cases, including us. </p>
<p>Shark jaws are homologous to our jaws as well. The rest of this explanation is also kind of nonsensical.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's true</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Oral epithelium is not skin. Skin has several layers, as well as hairs and sweatglands in mammals. Just because it is epithelium does not make it skin.</p>

<p>I said not entirely homologous, since there are some differences. They do of course evolutionarily derive from the same cells.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My point is that oral epithelium produces teeth in sharks and in all osteichthyans, including us. There is no difference there. I don't think this is actually skin, hence my use of scarequotes.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The common ancestor of sharks and mammals had jaws derived from palatoquadrate and Meckels and those elements still structure the embryonic jaw in all osteichthyans and ARE the jaw in sharks and chimaeras. They are completely homologous as jaws.</p></div>		</li>
