			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like more of a cultural belief rather than a universal belief. But if you’ve ever refrigerated dishes cooked with lots of saturated fats (butter/ghee, lard, tallow, coconut, palm oil, etc.), you will have noticed that they become solid. It could be that very cold water slows digestion by temporarily solidifying bits of these in your stomach.</p>
<p>I believe Indian cuisine often uses ghee, correct? That may be why it’s a belief in your culture and not as common in - for example - a Mediterranean culture that relies on liquids fats like olive oil, sunflower oil, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Did anyone else ever get told to not drink milk while eating fish? My parents told me that if I did so, I would get white patches all over my skin. I believed it for years until I did some research and found out it was bullshit...</p></div>		</li>
