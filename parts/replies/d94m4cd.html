			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, most birds will kill their prey before they actually swallow it, but you might not notice because it's so quick. </p>
<p>My starling can eat HUGE mealworms. Now, I didn't think it was a good idea to feed him the big worms till I saw how he handles them; he actually will only grab them by the head (or move his beak to the head after grabbing it) and crush it before swallowing it down.</p>
<p>It happens so fast, it's easy to miss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding some useful info:</p>
<p>Some birds keep rocks in their gizzards as well for grinding and replace them as they wear down, but that's mostly seed eating birds.</p>
<p>Predatory birds soak everything in digestive enzymes in an organ called the proventriculus before storing it in the gizzard.  It sits in the gizzard (which is relatively weak in predatory birds) until everything that can be dissolved and passed to the intestine is gone, then they regurgitate &quot;pellets&quot; aka the worst lab in biology class.</p>
<p>Pelicans have a pretty cool system of air bladders under their skin and even in their bones that serves as an all purpose cushion/float and prevents bulges and things like you see in snakes bodies.</p></div>		</li>
