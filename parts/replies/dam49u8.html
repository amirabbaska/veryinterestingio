			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. There are plenty of reward circuits that are being activated at the time in men (and women), which can alter brain wave patterns and patterns of brain activity in the brain. Women are particularly prone to out of body type experiences. Both men and women can find the peacefulness of the flood of reward circuitry to help with clarity of thought. For example, people get a flood of oxytocin during sexual activity. Oxytocin helps form social bonds and trust, as well as enhances perspective taking abilities (ability to see from other people's points of view). The flood of neurochemicals can definitely affect how you think, although the affect is usually very brief.</p></div>		</li>
