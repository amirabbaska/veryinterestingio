			<div class="markdown"><p>You should read Solaris! It's pretty much about life next to a weird, mimetic, liquid-metal ocean, that may or may not be watching our narrator every time he goes outside.</p>
<p>It was also the book that spawned modern sci-fi, so it's worth reading just for that. None of the tied-in realism of HG Wells or Verne, just men in space. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If they made a movie of that, I would be in the theater in full-chub.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I kind of want to see a sci-fi movie of it that brings my imagination to life. right now the thought of falling through thick dense air that slowly(or quickly?) turns into liquid metal as I continue falling is tripping me out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What does the Jupiter diagram posted earlier mean by helium-neon rain? Is that the glowing ocean you were referring to? I can only assume it is, but why would it be called rain?</p>
<p>Also, I know not necessarily your area, but going further in the slides from the diagram, there's a picture of the Jupiter aurora, for the description it says there are magnetic flux tubes that connect to the Jovian Moons, Ganymede, and europa. Would this mean that the moons are magnetically connected to Jupiter through the flux tube?</p></div>		</li>
