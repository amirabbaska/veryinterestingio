			<div class="markdown"><p>That reminds me of when I was trying to help my mom with her computer, but I live overseas. So over MSN (yeah it was a while ago) I asked here to download and install teamviewer. No response. So I type like 3 or 4 sentences with the word teamviewer in it. I ask my mom if she is still there. She says yes. Anyways, one confusing story later. MSN had a  blacklist of urls and phrases it would not send. Skype has this to. </p></div>		</li>
