			<div class="markdown"><p>Londoner here. Usually what people think is just British slang is actually Cockney (that is, <del>South</del> East London) rhyming slang. This is slang where you say a word or phrase which rhymes with the word you mean, such as &quot;Dog and bone&quot; instead of phone, &quot;Butcher's hook&quot; (Usually shortened to &quot;butcher's&quot;) instead of look, &quot;Pig's ear&quot; instead of beer, and so on. It's a fun slang to try and speak. As a better example than what my North London knowledge can provide, here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eu7aj1SCE8k" target="_blank">brilliant scene from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT: Apparently it's East London. Christ, I don't even know my own city! </p>
<p>To be fair, it's the opposite side of London to where I'm from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good lord, I cannot even wrap my mind around Cockney rhyming slang. I'm from the American South, so I'm well familiar with several odd and specific dialects, but calling one's head his &quot;loaf&quot; from &quot;loaf of bread&quot; for example is just a whole extra layer of linguistic craziness.</p></div>		</li>
