<p>Well, in regards to external fields--this doesn't do much. What is accomplished by twisting the entire bundle in the cable is the provision of stability as it is drawn through the final die that applies the last sheath of insulation. </p>
<p>Another reason is that existing cabler machines rotate in order to tighten up the cable to package it within an insulated sheath, simply pressing it together will be unreliable--this is why you will pretty much never find any cables of any purpose ever not having a twist unless it's a ribbon cable. As a result of cable makers having the machines set for this assembly approach, they would not benefit from instead laying wires flat and untwisted through most cables, especially if the cable is to be installed in some way where the cable will be bent.</p>
<p>A functional reason is that the overall twist allows the cable to bend without individual wires either separating from the bundle or breaking. The twist allows for some mechanical slip of each individual wire as the wire flexes because it deflects the motion to wrap the cable's internal path, such as when you install it in a corner or if the cable will be rolling over a pulley.</p>
<p>The reason why it's not interference related for the overall cable's twist is that they have no idea of what orientation that interference comes from, so it can't actually do much against it. With the twisted pairs, that pair has signals that are related and they always know the wire's orientation versus it's pair's orientation if they twist them together.</p></div>		</li>
