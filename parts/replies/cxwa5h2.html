			<div class="markdown"><p>Day 1 emt training. Unconscious? Sternum noogie. </p>
<p>So many tricks. (all of the following should be done by trained people) </p>
<p>Wrist bleeding profusely? Roll a towel and put in the armpit and push arm against ribs. Brachial artery squish. (don't do this in any other instance but an emergency.) </p>
<p>How low is the spinal injury? Pinch the ribs and start going lower until they can't feel. (good estimate on how low the injury is and where to brace.) </p>
<p>Airway problems in a car accident and need to treat another? Gauze their head to headrest. (a medic in my class did this and saved 3 lives) </p>
<p>A joke but real thing is &quot;are they fat? - - check if they're diabetic.&quot;  I've tended to three people in everyday live who had a diabetic collapse. Sugar under the tongue is what I was taught. It seems to work. </p>
<p>One for everyone to know,  even non professionals : chest compressions for cpr should be at 100 Beats per minute. Breaths are optional/digression. Hum the &quot;staying alive&quot; song  if you think they'll live, &quot;another one bites the dust&quot; I'd you think they'll die. Still, give Compression. Keep your wrists locked and if you are afraid of breaking a rib, you're doing it well. </p>
<p>I can name a million. </p>
<p>I'm not a medic, I'm trained as one but don't practice. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Things have changed. Ok that might not be EMT training but for CPR training I did a few weeks ago, we were never told that. We are supposed to check if the person is breathing, clear the airway and just wake them up by slapping the chest multiple times. My instructor was an EMT. He said a lot of things are not recommended anymore. But who knows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting story from my childhood. My cousins and I use to wrestle a lot. Occasionally you could sit on someones chest and lock their arms under your knees. We found out that if you took one finger and started poking them in the sternum that at first they would be slightly annoyed, then it kind of hurt, and then the person would literally have an emotional breakdown and start to cry. After it happened the second time we decided to experiment with it and see if a willing participant would develop the same emotional stress, sure enough that person started to cry even though they had prepared themselves for it. The sternum sure has an odd link to the brain!</p>
<p>Also, do not try this on anyone without their consent. It is easily a form of torture. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably hurts because a) it's practically right under our skin, and b ) it protects the heart, so that area's likely to be more sensitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the reason is that it's the place where lots of nerve cords come together. It's called the solar plexus. It just happens to be there because it's protected well enough for us to not have any significant evolutionary disadvantages.</p>
<p>Natural selection doesn't care about pain, except when it affects our chances of reproducing and thus passing on our genes. Pain usually won't do that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Shouldn't it be LESS sensitive then? Like the skull protecting the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just tried that, and it hurt like a mother fucker. </p>
<p>Edit: For everyone saying it doesn't hurt, I don't know what type of mutants you are; but you're very lucky. I'm only 140lbs, and there's just skin and bone over my sternum, no fat whatsoever. I'm using that middle set of knuckles, and raking them vertically down the center of my chest. I've now done this about 20 times because of your doubt, just to see if I'm being a pussy. IT FUCKING HURTS EVERY GOD DAMN TIME! </p></div>		</li>
