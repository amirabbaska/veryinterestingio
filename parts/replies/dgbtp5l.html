<p>Absolutely, but beer seems to have been so revolutionary that <a href="http://humanhistorytimeline.com/" target="_blank">it is specifically mentioned on this human history timeline</a>, whereas other booze isn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a couple anthropology courses that explained this well. </p>
<p>First: Beer that was made back then was a lot more nutritious then beer now. So, without refrigerators, we now have the one first storable form of energy and pleasure in a world where everything else rots. </p>
<p>Second: Beer back then also had a lot lower alcohol level than today's beer. Especially compared to wine, which was good because everyone couldn't be drunk all the time, and was also more nutritious being grain based, than wine.  Also, most importantly in the argument of Wine vs Beer, grain is a lot easier to grow and has a shorter season than grapes/fruit for wine. </p>
<p>Third (Most important): More or less, you make beer by doing what? Essentially by storing a large amount of grain and a couple other ingredients in an area for extended period of time (yes, I know its more complicated than that but that's the jist). So, now for the first time in human history, it's more beneficial to stay in one location instead of being nomad hunter gatherer society's. </p>
<p>To continually make beer, we had to stay in one location Long enough to plant crops, harvest the grain, store it, and then by the time it turns into beer, they could just plant more crops and continue this cycle. </p>
<p>This marks the beginning modern agriculture and civilization as we know it. People began to specialize in certain trades to do things for others (like the farmers to busy making beer for everyone) for a form of currency that the farmer could also use to sell their products. With people specializing in stead of doing everything themselves, people got a lot fucking better at those things and advancements in technology became exponential. Additionally, since people didn't have to worry about surviving, knowledge became a tool more than force. Inventors became abundant and since everyone was staying in one spot, they could develop universal languages, learn to read, actually pass on the information that they learned throughout their lives without it being lost forever when they died like it did prior.</p>
<p>Etc. </p>
<p>Kinda TLDR
There's a lot of things that made the shift towards modern civilization possible but there main thing is that farming on a wide scale became possible due to the storability of the beer. They could overproduce Incase of a drought, winter, etc. Before, if any climate extremes would happen, they would have to move away from that area immediately to find food elsewhere. Now, they could be prepared, staying in one spot seemed viable enough to build large structures, communities, defence mechanisms for those communities, etc. And then once they have their gated, one language speaking communities, their collective knowledge grew exponentially and he we are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes very well thought out from an ag and tech standpoint. However to expound on the tech side of it, math and written language. With people settling down. They had to invent systems to keep what someone claimed as their own separate from others claims, as in farm land. Also the grain had to be kept track of, the finished beer had to be accounted for and sold according to market value. It is crazy how one natural occurrence sparked such a snow ball of building events that kept us alive as a species and paved the way for us to be the dominant one</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, it's not beer vs wine, but beer vs bread:</p>
<p>Why did humans ever settle down? Before crops had been domesticated, grains were small and yield was low, and so, for a tribe to give up nomadic hunting and gathering and to settle down and start farming might not have been such a clever move to keep everyone's stomach full. </p>
<p>However, if a family somebody settled down to grow grain, not to make bread, but to make beer,  they had a really interesting and unique produce to trade, and could maybe live quite well from that.</p>
<p>So, the idea is that humans settling down may have started with farmers/brewers rather than farmers/bakers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually know this. Beer and similar low alcohol beverages are what really allow humans to settle many places. It's not bread early farmers had to make to survive during the growing seasons. Beer is nutritious AND is safer to drink than a stream. The brewing process involves boiling and alcohol is antibacterial. Hops is also antibacterial... but, likely this is added later.</p>
<p>Beyond that, beer is step one of making booze. You basically make a beer without hops then you add another process to create booze. Booze was also created about 7000 years later. It's important to the economy of some areas at various points but, it's nothing compared to the importance of beer.</p>
<p>Finally, we think early peoples farmed grains, not fruits, and beer is made from grains while wine is made from fruits.</p>
<p>Beer is considered one of the greatest inventions in human history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The birth of civilization (as per geographic determinism) requires the cultivation of food crops like wheat/barley (cereals). These are easy to cultivate and more importantly to store. The aborigines of Papua New Guinea remain basically stone age because they did not have access to cereal cultivation (true for all rain-forest civilizations). Beer, as you have pointed out, was a way to create potable water from polluted water in settlements due to the lack of knowledge of keeping shit out of your water source. </p></div>		</li>

<p>To add to this comment, back then, settlers didn't know what microbes and bacteria were, and they didn't know that boiling water killed those bacteria. What they did know however was that they had to boil water (the mash) in order to make beer. Not getting sick from drinking that now boiled water/beer was really just a bonus for them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beer was a common practice and became a huge staple between the years of the ancient Egyptians were in rule to the bubonic plague and the culture evolved from there. Beer was used because the wort was boiled and the fermentation (if done properly) sanitized all the water. It was a way to get clean way efficiently without having the proper knowledge of the science behind it. But it was commonly traded as a currency. Beer also used to be slightly weaker than it is now and used to be enjoyed as a light breakfast or dessert, even by children. But those times are long (like 500+ years) gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, there was a time when beer was drunk more frequently than water, even by children, simply because it was safer to drink than the locally available water due to it being sanitized during the process of making beer. It would maker sense if it were very low in alcohol content. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The Romans invented transparent glass specifically so they could admire the colour of wine. <em>Lenses</em> wouldn't have been a thing if it wasn't for wine. No microscopes, telescopes … heck, no spectacles adding 20+ years of usefulness per inventor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, distilled liquor required, well, a still. Wine or beer (I think) can theoretically be made in any kind of clay pot or vessel. </p>

<p>I think that's the key. Distilling takes more effort and technology. Beer can be produced relatively easy so even very primitive societies can produce it for trade and their own use.</p></div>		</li>
