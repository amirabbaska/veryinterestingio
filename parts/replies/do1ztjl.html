			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you think about throwing them so they fly straight and don't spin? I put together a few 2 / 12s in the backyard, high wooden fence about 20 ft away (safe'ish?). I got pretty decent at throwing them pretty much dead straight and getting at least 80+ tip first... driving nails, man. 1&quot;+ penetration, couple times I managed to get a 'hunting' knife all the way through.</p>
<p>throwing distance was about 15 - 18ft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey there.  You certainly know what it takes.</p>
<p>I threw knives and such for about 10 years (12-20 years old) For knives, I threw the most classic style bowie knifes, holding them from the blade.  It's all about the exact distance and knowing how many times your particular knife will spin in those distances.  Like throwing a football, your finger memory, muscle memory, and making fine adjustments on the fly in your throwing motion.  I had a true smaller throwing knife made by Case that I threw from the handle.  I could stick it from about 21 ft on occasion. </p>
<p>I threw axes as well.  Traditional double blade axes.  Last time I threw one of those I was at a County fair and there was a challenge to come forth and try to win a prize.  I just stepped up and knew you have to have a good back draw that goes pretty close to your butt.  The back edge of one blade split my pants just under my nut sack.  Last throw I ever took.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is terrifying, an axe within a foot of my nuts isn't ok.  My buddy who works the axe side of our gig has had to catch them because people didn't wait to move, scary scary shot.  Gotta love random skills that win prizes though.</p></div>		</li>
