			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct and you have worded it extremely well.</p>
<p>If I'm to add to this, it's that enamel is the hardest substance in the human body, and also has the highest percentage of inorganic material (96% I think).  That is the key, it's inorganic, where as the rest of the tooth is organic and can be repaired.</p>
<p>Basically during tooth development, a bunch of cells (ameloblasts) lay down these really hard crystalline structures surrounding and protecting the softer, more organic parts of the teeth. After they have created them, the ameloblasts die off.</p>
<p>It's weird to think about it this way, but enamel is like a stone covering for your teeth.  It's not really &quot;human&quot; like your other body parts are.  It's closer to a crystal you might find in a cave somewhere. You can't add anything to or repair a crystal.</p>
<p>You can however add chemicals to it to form a different type of crystal.  This is what fluoride does.  The crystal in enamel is called hydroxyapatite, and with the addition of fluoride, it forms fluoro-hydroxyapatite, which is a lot stronger and more resistant to decay.</p>
<p>To answer someone else's question, during tooth development, internal usage of fluoride can be helpful, whereas once the tooth is formed, direct surface application via toothpaste or mouthwash is more useful.</p>
<p>So brush your teeth twice a day kids!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun addendum: the reason too much fluoride exposure can be bad for your teeth is that fluoro-hydroxylapatite has planes of cleavage that act as entry points for harmful bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you serious? What constitutes too much fluoride? </p>
<p>Edit: google says it's a developmental thing, too much before age 8 = a bad condition called enamel fluorosis. Is that what you meant? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard this in multiple places, and always was skeptical: is it true that xylitol is completely anti-bacterial as well as could possibly help re-mineralize teeth? If this were the case wouldn’t it be a good idea to flush your mouth with xylitol? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what is remineralizing doing then? If it's not growing back the enamel, does it just leave a residue of minerals on your teeth that help it be shielded? And that residue will come off eventually?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your teeth are more in a state of constant demineralisation and remineralisation that is influenced largely by pH (critical pH) - a sort of equilibrium if you will with the ions in your saliva. So yes in a way that 'residue' which is really part of your teeth is constantly coming off and re-forming.</p>
<p>Many of the dental treatments today contain very high concentrations of those particular ions in order to saturate your saliva and push the equilibrium into more remineralisation than demineralisation.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I look at it as three states of enamel:
Mineralized enamel
Demineralized enamel
Loss of enamel</p>
<p>Mineralization is the loss and gain of ions (calcium,  hydroxide, fluoride).
There's this dynamic between remineralization and demineralization which is always in play based on your oral pH. Low pH (acids like soft drinks) can reduce enamel ions (demineralize). Enamel when demineralized is weak and can be loss (cavities) with pressure (bitting).  If the enamel can withstand being loss (maintain the scaffold) it can remineralize. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it true that cheese is helpful in remineralising teeth because it both neutralises mouth pH and contains calcium etc? (I choose to believe this as a lover of cheese so am really just looking for confirmation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool, thanks! I just recently chipped my front tooth, and lost a good chunk of the face of it. The deepest part was <em>extremely</em> sensitive, but after a week or so it looked like some kind of deposit had &quot;sealed&quot; up the sensitive bits.  Now I know why!</p></div>		</li>
