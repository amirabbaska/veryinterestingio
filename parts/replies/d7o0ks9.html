			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen these 'large print' gauges that have a much larger collection area than the tube itself, and the measuring marks are spaced out accordingly. It's like 3 feet tall but only goes up to 5 inches of rain or something  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The surface area of the top of the cylinder is multiple times the surface area of the bottom, therefore the &quot;inch&quot; distance is scaled up proportionally.  </p>
<p>If that model didn't have the cone/funnel top but was a straight cylinder, then it would have actual inches on the sides. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes the most sense; the bigger container has more surface area so it's collecting rain faster (so to speak).</p></div>		</li>
