			<div class="markdown"><p>The beauty of that design is that it's completely self-centering. There's nothing guiding the wheels to shift one way or another, it just happens because of the shape. The physics behind it are kind of awesome. </p>
<p>Also, if you invert the cones, so that they get wider on the outside instead of narrower, you get something that will derail on anything but a perfectly straight piece of track with the wheels perfectly centered. It's auto-derailing. </p></div>		</li>
