			<div class="markdown"><p>A conflict of interest is the possibility of bias, not its actualization. Proving that there is a possibility of bias is easier than proving that actual bias influences a decision, due to the need to prove intention (like in a hate crime). This is why law makers make laws saying that a conflict of interest, if disclosed, is fine, but having it influence their law-making is not fine.</p>
<p>Look at future HHS leader Tim Price. He invested some amount of money in a pharma company shortly before introducing a law that, if passed, would've returned 2-4 times what he invested. In his confirmation hearing, when confronted on this, he hid behind plausible deniability, i.e. &quot;You can't -prove- that I introduced that law for personal benefit.&quot;</p>
<p>Basically, since law makers make laws, they want to make sure that there's ethical adherence, while also being able to have their own lives outside of legislating without being subject to an ethics lawsuit every couple of days for a new conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Handling a conflict of interest is tough, and there's no exact right answer short of &quot;Don't have one.&quot; Just ask the Trump administration...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not technically insider trading, though, and that's why it's hard to regulate. All bills and proposed legislation are subject to public scrutiny (compared to actual insider trading which uses nonpublic or confidential information). Even that STOCK act repeal that was on the floor for a whopping 30 minutes was available to the public.</p>
<p>Any bystander could've seen Price's aforementioned proposal. If the bystander was confident it would pass, he could have invested in the same funds that Price did and reaped the same reward. That's why it's not insider trading.</p></div>		</li>
