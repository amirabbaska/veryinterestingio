			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's a little of both. Though they're probably thinking of the kids more than the families because the kids are more at risk of succumbing to infection than passing it on. If they were exposed to fungal infections, those don't get passed human to human. Some of the bacterial/viral are more likely to be transmitted person to person, but I think the doctors are more concerned for the boys because of the weakness described by the rescuers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For rabies, definitely. While in much of the Western world rabies is rarely seen, it is still very much an issue for tropical nations and is on the WHO neglected tropical diseases. There have been rare cases of rabies transmitted via inhalation, and others where no cause has been identified. That compounded with the fatality of the disease if left untreated and the high tolerability of immunoglobulin therapy, I would be very surprised if they didn't receive treatment.    </p>
<p>For the rare fungal infections, yes and no. As opposed to antibiotics that often target very specific bacteria, antifungals were not found using rational drug design. That means instead of finding a mechanism to target in the fungus and creating a drug to perform that task, our current antifungals are more often chemicals that already existed and were found to kill fungus. That's a long-winded way of saying, they are generally broader acting drugs and can be used against many different fungal species. So it is more likely that the boys will be treated with low levels of broad-acting antifungals rather than antifungals specifically designed for rare fungal diseases.   </p>
<p>Edit: Removed mention of bat guano as a cause of rabies inhalation. Inhalation of saliva is a more verifiable route, however with the rarity of this transmission type there is no consensus about the likelihood of this transmission in nature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rabies is a virus not a fungal infection, assuming, however, assuming you meant any pathogen it is likely they were treated for rabies since a bat could have been in the cave with them and standard treatment is to go through the series of shots if you slept in the same space as a bat (since you can't be sure it didn't bite you), otherwise they might be put on some broad antivirals and antibiotics to be safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Esteemed travel writer, novelist and journalist Bruce Chatwin contracted a lethal lung infection of the fungus <em>Talaromyces marneffei</em>, probably as a result of exploring bat caves in Indonesia. The fungus is relatively common in SE Asian caves from Burma to southern China, including northern Thailand, but is seen only rarely in other environments.</p>
<p>Being HIV-positive (a fact Chatwin found out only much later), he had a compromised immune sysem with which to fight off the infection. It slowly became systemic, and four years after being diagnosed, he succumbed at the age of 48 to penicilliosis, a disease similar to cryptococcosis. </p>
<p>His passing - just a few weeks after his novel <em>Utz</em> was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize - was a great loss to the world of English literature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going to be honest, if you have HIV, I feel like you just shouldn't go into caves. You know the potential is there for you to get a lot sicker than other people, you know the drugs might work differently than you.</p>
<p>So...yeah, if you have HIV, say no to caves, people. </p>
<p>Sky-diving is fine, though. Go sky-diving. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good advice today, but very little was known about HIV and AIDS at the time (early Eighties). </p>
<p>This state of public ignorance was largely because of the Reagan administration's unwillingness to fund either research for the disease, or any attempt to publicize and control through social means what was quickly becoming an epidemic. Instead, the pathologically homophobic Republicans in control of the WH and both Houses regarded it as exclusively &quot;just a gay disease&quot; that would decimate homosexuals, but wouldn't spread to the genpop. Oops.</p>
<p>In fact, Reagan himself didn't even <em>mention</em> AIDS in any public speech or press release for more than five years after being elected, and more than <em>seven</em> years after it was first identified in '78 as a significant health risk for Americans by the CDC. By which time the American death toll alone had gone from 42 to over 13,000, and the estimated worldwide mortality to 250,000.</p>
<p>In addition to there being a general lack of awareness about the disease, Chatwin wasn't diagnosed as HIV-positive until well after he picked up the fungal infection. In fact, he only became aware of his compromised immunity after actually collapsing on the street in Switzerland, halfway across the planet, a couple of years later.</p>
<p>The infection is now regarded as an &quot;AIDS-defining&quot; disease, particularly among the Asian medical community. Meaning if you got the one, you almost certainly have the other.</p></div>		</li>

<p>EDIT: I did a quick Google search and it turns out that the Marburg virus is a close relative to Ebola so it makes sense that they have a similar origin (bat feces). Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong because I literally have no idea about science. </p></div>		</li>
