			<div class="markdown"><p>Why nobody has scanned all the movies at the top resolution that a film corresponds to (8k or 16k or whatever) once and for all to preserve them for future generations? I would imagine the source is degrading one year and one rescan at a time. If we have even consumer grade electronics at 4k, the specialized scanners I'm sure can pull 40k if needed. Instead we rescan the film every year for 1080p, for bluray, for 4k, I don't get it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up some videos on Criterion. They restore old movies all the time. It's an expensive process and requires a fair amount of labor to correct color and fix other issues these physical film reels may have developed while sitting on a shelf for 30 years. </p>
<p>There's a fair amount of misinformation in this thread about the detail in 35mm. You can definitely scan it at 4k and get a noticeable detail boost, but it's not at all like  digital 4k. Digital 4k will almost always be much crisper, sharper, and more detailed than a 35mm anamorphic film 4k scan. There are a lot of things that effect grain on the film like what stock it is, light sensitivity, age, if it's a copy print or master, etc. Some will be ridiculously sharp but more often than not you will see a lot of grain or the physical light sensitive &quot;pixels&quot; of the frame of film. Film grain is a beautiful thing, but it does mean you'll see less detail on a 4k 35mm film scan than a 4k digital file. That's why we'll probably never scan it at 40k, if you did it'd be like taking a magnifying glass to your phone screen. You can see the pixels sharper, but it doesn't help discern any more detail in the image. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Honestly I'm not sure I can really see a difference between 4k and HD.</p>
<p>I sat in front of a Blue Jays game changing the channels back and forth from the HD feed and 4k feed, and I just couldn't tell the difference.</p>
<p>Edit: The television was 4k</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an awesome explanation- cheers /u/camwow13 !  Piggybacking on it, you still get more color subtlety with film over 4k (although it's damn close). Biggest tell I've found is watching scenes with clouds. Those shot on film will have more visually than that on digital format. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Film has been scanned at 4k for many years now. Cost prohibited it being done as standard. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the top resolution that a film corresponds to (8k or 16k or whatever)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Super 35mm, around 4k. At work we sometimes scan S35 at 8k, but it doesn't actually give a better picture, it just allows us to play with the file more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>once and for all to preserve them for future generations</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Counter-intuitively, film is one of the best archival media. Just because we can scan it now, it doesn't mean we will have the tech in 20 years to read the digital file that was created. There are files we have stored at work that we can't read any more.</p>
<p>Edit: When AMPAS reported on this issue they concluded &quot;There is no digital archival master format or process with longevity characteristics equivalent to that of film.&quot;</p>
<p>(As an aside: for the home when going from 1080p &gt; 4k, the simple increase in pixel count is probably the least important aspect of the increased picture quality of the 4k standard.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you use industry standards instead of idiotic proprietary formats that's not a problem. Jpegs are as good today as they were 20 years ago. Film, on the other hand, deteriorates with time, like all things physical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can speak a little bit to this as an archivist who's worked with AV formats. Film, though fragile, is actually a better preservation medium long term than digital formats. This is mainly because technology is constantly changing and a digital format would need to be migrated to a different storage medium periodically to ensure compatibility with current technology. Think about the EXTREME long term. What do you think is easier to reconstruct 500 years from now after the apocalypse and all our modern technologies have turned to dust- an optical projector that can handle film or a digital projector that can read input from a complex file and convert it into film? Aside from that, 35 mm film will last (we think) for hundreds of years if stored correctly. There might be minor damage to the emulsion that carries the image, but as pointed out above, there are ways to combat/remedy that. Most digital files are stored on plastic and have a shelf life of ten years MAYBE.</p>
<p>All that out of the way, the original film prints can only be scanned at a quality correspondent to the best technology available. There hasn't been a digital copy made equivalent to 4K because 1) that would not have been possible several years ago and 2) there would not have been a demand for it. The best way to do what you're thinking of would really be to make a new film print on a better quality film so it will need less treatment the next time a better quality scan needs to be made. Hopefully this is not all nonsensical. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: digital is great for distribution but terrible for long term preservation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add to this insightful comment.  Not only was Star Wars shot on 35 mm (Eastman 100T 5247).  It will be scanned with great precision by people who constantly wash and dry their hands.</p>
<p>What exactly is the equivalent digital resolution of this commonly used motion picture stock? short answer: 12mp (plenty to scan)</p>
<p>Long: <a href="http://pic.templetons.com/brad/photo/pixels.html" target="_blank">http://pic.templetons.com/brad/photo/pixels.html</a></p>
<p>To add to this quality we must go deeper into the post production process of Episode IV and the inception of a historical special effect company called Industrial Light and Magic.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult tasks of making a special effect on film with no computers was not what the layperson thinks of as &quot;CG&quot;.  Part of the quality and charm of episodes IV-VI were the finely crafted and manufactured vehicles.  They were built in real life, filmed in a fashion similar to drawn animation, one step at a time.
Now days we would simply throw all of these ships and planets into a computer using a compositing software. </p>
<p>Before computers this was done with optical printers. They were prone to &quot;generation loss&quot; or  the loss of quality between subsequent copies. Each time you print on a spaceship into the finished frame, you would lose some quality...so how the fuck did they do Star Wars?  </p>
<p>They bought every last VistaVision Camera. A long dead format from the 50's that was basically the Grandpa of IMAX. So they filmed all the effects shots at what could be estimated at up to 20-30mp. Way more sharp special effects, with way more elements than anyone had seen in any film before 77'</p>
<p>I assume they have these assets and have been using them for all versions since the big 90's re-release.  So add that to the 35mm discussion and you can safely assume the 4k release will offer a &quot;never before seen&quot; home experience for those with the properly configured HDR 4k TV.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're entitled to your opinion about the quality of cgi in modern films, but this kind of general dismissive attitude towards the painstaking work done by vfx artists contributes to the terrible working conditions and exploitation they suffer these days. </p>
<p>Having worked on model shots and cg shots, I can honestly say neither one is any easier or more skilled in practice, just that if a computer makes something ten times quicker you'll be expected to do ten times as much work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can wet mount film for most types of scanners. I have never touched an Imacon, but I wouldn't be surprised if wet mounting hardware exists for the scanner you use. From what I've heard, wet scanning processes tend to be more labor intensive than dry ones.</p></div>		</li>
