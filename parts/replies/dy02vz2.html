You might not notice it when the sweet factor is paired with bitter flavors, but try something the next time you next time you make coffee: add milk to one, nothing to the other, then add ice to both to chill it. (Chilling reduces the bitter flavors so bitterness isn't competing with your sweetness evaluation.) The one with milk in it will taste better to most people.</p>
<p>If you usually make drip and it's too diluted to do this with, you can do the same thing ordering two cups each with a shot of espresso from a coffee shop. Add ice cubes to one, then milk and a bit of ice to the other.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you ever visit Starbucks and are at all into their Chai Tea Latte, try ordering it sometime with &quot;no water&quot;. That means they make it all with milk. It tastes <em>vastly</em> different than the one made with half water. I mean vastly. The reason why is mainly the sweetness of the milk.</p>
<p>Edit: About the comment about chilling reducing bitterness, one thing you should keep in mind is that chilling <em>also</em> reduces sweetness--but not as much as it reduces bitterness. At any rate, if you're the kind of person who doesn't like coffee hot, try it iced (with nothing added). You might find the flavor when chilled more appealing than when hot, just because the serving temperature will affect taste receptors in your tongue and reduce the apparent bitterness of the drink. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plain milk tastes more sweet than it does any other flavor sense.  And cream tastes even sweeter.  It's not bitter, sour, or even particularly salty.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Milk is very much sweet; we just don't typically notice it as it's a very mild sweetness and again, is cut by the fat.</p>
<p>If you get lactose-free milk, for scientific reasons, it actually tastes even sweeter because the lactose is broken down into sweeter component sugars...</p>
<p>Edit: So in part, you have a point that milk doesn't taste as sweet as one might expect based on the weight of the sugar in it, since lactose isn't as sweet a sugar. That said, it still definitely has a sweetness to it.</p></div>		</li>
