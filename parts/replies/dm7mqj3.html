<p>Not <em>strictly</em> true, in all circumstances. </p>
<p>As electronics were developed, scientists began to become aware of the 'microwave auditory effect' -- where microwave EM radiation could stimulate the human ear directly, without vibrating the air between. Some of them started experimenting with it, seeing if they could affect what people hear, changing the tone. One even managed to get people to hear rudimentary music ... and then the US government took over the project and made everything top secret. Nothing has been heard about it since. And it makes you wonder ... maybe those people putting tinfoil hats (faraday cages) on to stop the government from putting voices in their head ... maybe those people aren't quite so crazy after all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Perhaps it's true but only to a few people per million. Everyday we have millions of people going by the line of sight of high powered phone antenna yet never experience any of this. Microwaves are everywhere these days. WiFi transmits microwave. Phone transmits microwave.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does this effect happen at frequencies as low as 60hz? Microwaves are in the range of hundreds of megahertz to gigahertz.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not that anyone is aware of. When you hear the 60hz hum, you're hearing the physical vibration of the components transmitting the electricity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rapid expansion/contraction of air heated by the flow of electrons in the lightning bolt. There's no arc (flow of electrons through air decomposed into a plasma) in normal electric distribution, so there's no sound except for the magnetostrictive effect discussed above. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thunder comes from sudden thermal expansion due to nearly instantaneous heating from the electrical current producing plasma. Basically, thunder is an explosion. This is not the same mechanism as the buzz from AC devices, and it is due to heat, not electromagnetism.</p></div>		</li>
