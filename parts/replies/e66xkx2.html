<p>Good old trenbolone.  Has an anabolic:androgenic ratio of 500:500.  It was originally made for livestock cattle since they aren't fed when on trucks being trasported to slaughter, they get trenbolone put into them in the form of a pellet called Finaplix and it is so anabolic it keeps them from losing any muscle even with zero caloric intake.  </p>
<p>It is very, very bad for you.  </p>
<p>Literally not even made for human bodies.  It's bull steroids.  One of the most popular bodybuilding drugs out there.  </p>
<p>I fucking love the shit out of it.  </p></div>		</li>
