			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, it's now.  The dark times really started to hit in 2007 when the economy crashed and things have gradually been getting worse.</p>
<p>I live in a college town, and there was group of college kids I was working with on a project.  They've all graduated now, and I see them working at walmart or the grocery stores.  These are all smart people that just can't find jobs.  All my friends, including people I know in a few social clubs of 30-40 people, either work crap jobs or are engineers &amp; computer programmers, but they make half as much as the older generation for the same kinds of jobs, and they seem to get laid off every couple years as they make themselves obsolete or get outsourced to India.   I'm 30, a millennial, but an older one.  The city I live in is considered to be &quot;rapidly growing financially.&quot;  </p>
<p>The middle class was dealt a death blow and isn't recovering.  There's a thousand news articles out there about, &quot;The economy recovered, but the middle class hasn't.&quot;  </p>
<p>Another tidbit is that the USA found a clever way to <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/03/charts-whats-the-real-unemployment-rate.html" target="_blank">lie about unemployment.</a>  See, you're only unemployed if you had a job within the last 6 months.  After 6 months, you just don't count for &quot;reasons.&quot;   Also, they don't care if you make $7.25 at Wal-Mart but have a masters degree with $140,000 debt.  It's called being underemployed, and for the people keeping &quot;score&quot; you're winning. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a ton of literature on this, I recently read <a href="http://www.mauldineconomics.com/frontlinethoughts/angst-in-america-part-7-the-angst-of-the-millennial-generation" target="_blank">this article</a> going into the plight of the millenial class. </p>
<p>The thing to note is that GenX (late-thirties and up) are just as affected by the trends and forces of automation and globalized services. Especially those with bad luck or were not in a position to retool their skill sets into something futureproof. </p>
<p>The result is you have large swaths of the population who are being forced into a helpless position. Helpless people tend to take more extreme positions politically speaking. You can see this after the first world war as both Fascism and Communism took root in very depressed countries; you can also see it today with waves of nationalist populism in both the US and Europe. </p>
<p>We need to combat this by taking real steps to raise the financial viability of the lower class (I don't say middle class because it doesn't exist). Whether its UBI or some other means, something has to be done, or the wasted energy and anxiety of a sizable non-working population will be captured by a charismatic despot in disguise. Feel lucky that the one the US got isn't a capable man. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to dispute your general point, but computer programmer is a pretty safe job for the future. The older generation of tech jobs get paid a lot for having experience in tech that is on the way to obsolescence but vital to big old companies. Tell your pals to hang in there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, after the inevitable violent collapse, it <em>is</em> possible that things could move towards a much more &quot;Everyone chips in a little bit and everyone reaps an equal share of the rewards&quot; setup by which the mindless robots (until <em>that</em> particular uprising) do the grand majority of the work and all of the population finally benefits.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm going to get downvoted to hell, but there is nothing stopping people who's jobs are under threat from going and earning qualifications in emerging and growing industries. Don't tell me that they're tied to a location for &quot;reasons&quot;. Every generation has had to fight to survive, get off your ass and move somewhere else, learn something new, and keep your family going, just like everyone else had to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except in <em>this</em> instance (article mentioned) it's not automated jobs that are being cut, it's white collar jobs. </p>
<p>At the same time the Big 3 have tons of waste due to terrible company and HR culture and policies. If you look to many other large companies, white collar jobs are cut all the time due to various factors (unprofitable departments, change in direction/strategy, etc.), but the Big 3 rarely do that to white collar employers, most articles are on plant level positions due to various reasons (shifting production, automation, lowering/cutting production). </p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if Coke used it as an excuse to cut out fat in general salary positions as well. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I haven't read up on this specific Ford case, but there are countless white collar jobs lost to automation, and many more coming. </p>
<p>As data gets better and as our algorithms get better, a huge amount of white collar jobs become obsolete.  Many think white collar workers will suffer worse than blue collar jobs.  The middle class will feel the crush earlier and just as bad as lower-middle and lower classes will.  We're a while away from bots that can do construction work or bots that can fix leaky pipes, but we're already seeing programs which make many white collar jobs totally obsolete.  Much of that construction work is being done in factories already as well, prebuilt by machines ran by computers, then shipped to the build site to simply be put up in place.</p>
<p>To use your words, &quot;cut out the fat&quot; will be happening at fairly extreme rates.</p>
<p>The person you were responding to is totally correct, its coming, and its coming much faster than people realize.  The only reason it isn't mainstream news is because the companies are hiding by blaming a shaky economy, by blaming workers who want to earn enough to eat, and because no one gets elected talking about honest and difficult subjects, they get elected by pointing at distracting nonissue issues.</p></div>		</li>
