<p>Now, you bought a share when I made my IPO, but now you want cash. But I don't want to buy your share back.</p>
<p>So, you go to Anna, and you say, &quot;Anna, this piece of paper gives you 1% ownership on PenguinRocketScience's land. Do you want to buy it?&quot; </p>
<p>She says yes, and pays you cash for it. Now, she gets a cut of the money from my land, instead of you. Anna has the share, and you have your cash, even though I wasn't involved with the sale in any way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The primary market is sale of shares from the firm its self, the initial public offering (IPO). Financial firms register interest that first sale and then the secondary market takes over. The secondary market is largely inconsequential to the actual firm, it doesn't have much effect on their actual finances</p>
<p>The Dow Jones is just the 30 largest firms in the US so a useful barometer for the health of large companies</p></div>		</li>

<p>First, let's set the stage. </p>
<p>There are two ways companies make money. You either make things (Goods). Or you sell someone's labor (services). </p>
<p>To make money you need money. </p>
<p>Your goods companies need to buy supplies, and pay people to transform the supplies into goods for sale. Your services companies need to pay the people who deliver the service. </p>
<p>The primary purpose of the finance department is to figure out how to get that  money the company needs to make money. </p>
<p>The finance department has only three ways to obtain that money, aka cash flow. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Internally, you use the organization's profits,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Debt, you borrow money from others, and </p>
</li>
<li>Equity, you sell a piece of the business (or more formally, you sell a cut of future revenue).</li>
</ul>
<p>(This sounds simple, but figuring out which method to use, how much to raise, when and balancing that with the current economic environment, the state of the firm, and then the needs of both the employees and investors can be tough).</p>
<p>So what's the primary market? </p>
<p>It's those first investors who buy equity directly from the organization. </p>
<p>These could be </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>founders of an organization that put their own cash into the business to start it, or </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>friends and family of the founders, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>employees who are investing their labor (aka sweat equity), or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wealthy individuals (aka angels), or </p>
</li>
<li>professional investors that invest on behalf of others ( aka private equity investors, aka venture capital companies).</li>
</ul>
<p>So now that the firm has the money to make the money, how do the people that provided the money get paid back?</p>
<p>One way is to pay dividends (or a slice of the profits based on what percentage the investor owns). </p>
<p>Another is to use a secondary market to resell that ownership stake to someone else.</p>
<p>The secondary markets, of which the public markets (NYSE or NSADAQ) are one example, exist for that purpose.  </p>
<p>There are also private methods for selling interests in private firms, but that's prb a bit much for an ELI5.</p>
