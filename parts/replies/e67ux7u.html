			<div class="markdown"><p>Was looking for this one. A really easy way to understand this is with metals, they feel cold to the touch at room temperature not because they're colder than the air around, but because they &quot;suck&quot; the heat out of your skin in a very short amount of time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same reason you shouldn't blow into your coffee/soup/tea to cool it but rather across the top.  Still air develops a soft of buffer layer pretty quickly when it is near a surface of a different temperature/humidity but if you keep moving fresh new air over the surface than that buffer layer is constantly being created and moved away.</p></div>		</li>
