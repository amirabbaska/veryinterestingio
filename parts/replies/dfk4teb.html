			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my dad and I do all teh videos on the channel and he said something about that. apparently a bunch of advertisers realzied their ads were being shown on like hate videos and hate sites and started complaining. It certainly looks like we got caught up in that crack down as a how to gamble channel. </p>
<p>It sucks because of all the online casinos that operate in a legal grey area in the US and we end up getting grouped up with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just checked, no more of our videos had their monetization shut off. I had heard that a bunch of advertisers had complained because their ads were appearing on hate sites and stuff like that. I didn't think we would be grouped into that because we have a how to gamble channel but it's certainly starting to look like that...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Usually only when the game is launching though. I KNOW i've influenced probably 100+ purchases of the game but they usually will only sponsor you when the game is initially releasing. </p></div>		</li>
