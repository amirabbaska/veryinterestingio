While the Si-O bond is much stronger compared to Si-Si bonds (452kJ/mol vs 222), so it tends more towards -Si-O-Si-O- chains.</p>
<p>Carbon also has pretty close energies for two C-O bonds and one C=O bond, while this isn't the case for silicon, which again shows that its catenation is more limited, while carbon can make complex organic molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice on describing these other chemicals, some courses would be appreciated though. It's not just about atomic size though, it's about electrons screening the nucleus. The electronic behavior almost completely determines the chemical behavior of something. Of course, the atoms are larger because of the higher orbitals having greater kinetic energy (the n quantum number). Not necessarily greater angular momentum though, because the electron can be going around the nucleus both directions at once (gross oversimplification). Of course, the orbitals shrink as proton number increases, but the electrons continue to occupy higher orbitals that are further out. And in case anyone wants to see why this is: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin–statistics_theorem" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin–statistics_theorem</a></p>
