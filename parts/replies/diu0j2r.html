<p>Yeah. Electricity is often compared to water to make it more intuitive. There are a lot of similarities in how it functions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Such analogy is very wrong once your physics class is transitioning from DC to AC and to electromagnetic waves. Water analogy is the main culprit that makes students unable to grasp more advanced concepts of electricity. You can't use water to explain electrical reactance. Neither can water go fly wirelessly from one antenna to another. Water analogy simply can't explain why AC current pass through capacitors just fine as if there were a solid wire connecting in-between. You can't use water to explain why collapsing small harmless current in an inductor will seemingly generate voltage so high it can destroy microchips. It certainly cannot explain semiconductors.</p>
<p>If you have kids going through high school, the best advice to them about electricity is to NEVER ever think of it as water flow. Think of what it is. Once they get to science in college (perhaps), they will learn that electricity is all about electromagnetic force traveling across the wires at the speed of light, and that those electrons actually move slowly just inches per hour in the wire, not as envisioned back in high school.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He was one of the first ever <em>recorded</em> philosophers (&quot;in the Greek tradition&quot;).</p>
<p>All deep thinking and knowledge and culture and philosophy did not magically begin with the advent of written language. Further, none of these magically started with the Greeks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He actually showed publicly how it can attract small dry leaves. Pretty much like today's schoolkids rub a plastic ruler to attract small pieces of paper.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, amber is one of the few natural materials that is similar to plastic, both are made of polymers for starters.</p>
<p>I'm trying to remember what else Amber got used in naming... tip of my tongue.. I learned it while learning German oddly enough.</p>
<p>Edit: The famous surname Bernstein... It's actually Germanic for &quot;Amber&quot; but can be more literally translated to &quot;burning stone&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
