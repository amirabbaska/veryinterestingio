<p>also, PT 2x4s, they almost always had a twist. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's like a giant puzzle, gotta start with the 10s first, and work my way up to the 16s. And try and finish it in a way that it's completely, or almost flat on the top</p>

<p>It seems like it should be easy to make an app that'll automatically figure out how to do that for you. Put in the lumber order and the computer will figure out the optimal way to stack everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could probably do that. But it's really not necessary. Once you have experience building orders it's pretty easy to figure out what to pick next. Also, usually there's full bundles of studs that go with the orders I build. So if I need to I can add those to the top of my load to make it even. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wondered why orders seemed to be so screwed up. For example. I always thought they should put what I need first (2x10 floor joists) on top, 2x4 studs under that, then 2x8 rafters and 2x6 ceiling joists below that, followed by plywood on very bottom.</p></div>		</li>
