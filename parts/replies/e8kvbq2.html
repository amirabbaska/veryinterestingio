Any motionless fluid feeling gravity will have a pressure gradient, where the fluid at the bottom is at a higher pressure than the fluid on top. This extra pressure is exactly equal to the weight of the column of fluid above that particular piece of fluid. This is called hydrostatic equilibrium.</p>
<p>Imagine a fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium. If you decrease the density of a pocket of fluid (heating the gas), it is no longer in equilibrium because the pressure difference between the top and the bottom is larger than the weight of the fluid. The regular density fluid underneath does actually push it up, this is called buoyancy force. As the low density fluid starts moving up, the regular density fluid underneath that's doing the pushing is itself getting pushed by all the other fluid around it such that the pressure difference on the low density pocket is maintained and force of buoyancy is constant.</p>
<p>If instead of creating a pocket of low density fluid you had a whole layer (at same gravitational potential) of low density fluid, it would theoretically be at equilibrium because the pressure in the fluid below would simply decrease to match the lower weight of the lower density fluid layer. This is an unstable equilibrium that creates a really cool fluid instability called a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Taylor_instability?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Rayleigh-Taylor instability</a>.</p></div>		</li>
