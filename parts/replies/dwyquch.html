			<div class="markdown"><p>Bisecting a half-inch layer off the giant sheet without shattering the whole thing sounds challenging, though admittedly I never did it.</p>
<p>All the videos I see of it being done still have liquid water in the bottom when they pull it out so there's no fog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The clouds of ice are caused by air getting caught. As the ice freezes, the air is going to get pushed out into the unfrozen parts. Eventually the air has nowhere else to escape to and it freezes amongst all the other ice.</p>
<p>In an insulated cooler (with the lid off) the ice freezes top-down (since the top is exposed it will freeze first). If you let it finish freezing eventually when it reaches the bottom all the air will be trapped there and it will be cloudy. If you don't let it finish freezing the ice that did freeze has no air in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish some Kickstarter or something would make an insulated ice mold for this that wasn't hugely bulky or ridiculously expensive. I know insulation would require it to be bulki<em>er</em> but hopefully it could be less massive than finding room for a whole cooler in your freezer.</p></div>		</li>
