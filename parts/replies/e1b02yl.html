			<div class="markdown"><p>LPT: If you are experiencing issues with signal or data issues and have a rooted or jailbroken phone and you call your carrier, <strong>do not</strong>, under <strong>any circumstance</strong>, say that your device is jailbroken or rooted. Employees are often trained to blame any issues on that and deny support unless the rooting or jailbreaking process is undone.</p>
