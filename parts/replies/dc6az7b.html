			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh, thank you so much! I've never been able to smell and I hate when people actually try to tell me I can't taste. Apparently the thing they learned in elementary school trumps my actually experience of not being able to smell.</p>
<p>Edit: apparently even I get confused between smell and taste</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THANK YOU. So many people here who don't understand the difference between taste and flavor, yet they think they know more than people who are actually explaining it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still dont get the difference :(</p>
<p>I now understand there is one, but I dont understand the difference. </p>
<p>Like, if somebody asks me how it tastes I'll say how good it is and ask about the seasonings. I dont automatically tell the person, well its not sweet, its not bitter, its not sour, its not metallic, it has no taste. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you put stuff in your mouth you taste it, but aromatic molecules and particles come out of the food as well and go to your nose (usually going up the back of your throat towards your nasal cavity, when you <em>exhale</em>), this is how you perceive the smell of food when you're eating it. The collective stimulus of the tastes and the smell is what we call flavor.</p>
<p>Try this: close your nose with your fingers and eat/drink something you're familiar with. Since there's no way for air to flow towards your nose, you'll only taste the thing, and the smell component will disappear (well, usually it'll just be very weak). The full sense of &quot;flavor&quot; will be gone. Now while the thing is still in your mouth, release your fingers and exhale. You'll instantly get the full effect of flavor from the smell of the thing.</p>
<p>This is a way for you to uncouple the two sensations. You can smell things but not taste them by not putting them in your mouth, and you can taste things but not smell them by closing your nose. Both will feel weird and flat. You need both at the same time to get a sense of a &quot;flavor&quot;.</p>
<p>If you really wanna enhance your sense of flavor, move the food around your slightly open mouth while exhaling slightly. Great tip if you're into cooking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's annoying when people say that 'if you didn't have a sense of smell, you wouldn't taste'. My dad doesn't have a sense of smell, but he tastes just fine. It also means that he can eat Durians easily, and loves the taste of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a horrible sense of smell but taste just fine. Maybe it is because I'm an avid cook and have developed my palette, but I'm often able to pick up on seasons and flavors my friends miss/can't narrow down. </p></div>		</li>
