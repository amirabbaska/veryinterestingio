They told Voyager to turn on its microthrusters, which haven't been used in 37 years, and it did. Building something that can remain idle in space for nearly four decades and still work like a charm when you ask it to is some badass engineering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well with little to no Oxygen/other gases in space relative to Earth's atmosphere, so they don't have to worry about rust/corrosion, right? So then they'd just be protecting it from electromagnetic shit and radiation?</p>
<p>I don't know enough about all of this to state it all as fact, but I can see how it happened in an  environment (potentially) easier to maintain itself than Earth's atmosphere. Still doesn't make it any less remarkable that it actually worked, though. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly that eerie stability is one of the coolest things about space. Obviously it is incredibly difficult to design something that can survive in space, but if you get over that obstacle there are really no major forces other than heat radiating away that can cause change in any form. </p>
<p>Even things like the velocity of the object just continues on <em>forever</em> because there just aren't any outside forces to interact with the object.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, just stuff that the nuclear death ball in the middle sends out -- aka our Sun. It passed heliopause however. There's no more radiation pressure. And it's not easier. It's actually much harder. Electricity travels in a vaccum. That's a problem when you don't want it leaking out everywhere. Or in. The farther from the Sun something is, the colder it gets. Voyager has relied on its own heat for a long time now to keep its electronics working. The electronics are being kept alive by the waste heat from the RTGs. That waste heat is running out now. The power packs have degraded to the point the heaters soon won't be able to stay powered on. When that happens, Voyager dies. There's just not enough radioactivity left in the tank to create the heat Voyager needs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Satcomm guy here.</p>
<p>This is more or less correct, the only thing that is really between them is the Kuiper belt and our atmosphere.  Nothing else really stands to degrade the signal.  </p>
<p>Plus, NASA probably has a low noise amplifier that is the stuff of nightmares, so even if the signal has lots of interference/noise they can probably piece it back together easily enough.  Latency is their only real concern when it comes to this kind of thing.</p>
<p>[edit:  Anyone perusing this thread, please read the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator page below this post.  This is not commonly known technology(mostly because it's old and has few practical uses outside of space) and it's absolutely worth a read.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! The LNAs used for deep space receivers are cryogenically cooled to a few Kelvin to lower the thermal noise as much as possible. </p>
<p>Edit: Since this is ELI5, I'll take a shot at less technical explaination...</p>
<p>Applied heat, even at room temperature, causes small, random motion of the electrons in wires (or any conductor, really) of a radio receiver. The signal from Voyager is so weak that even the tiny amount of noise generated from electron motion can drown it out. Cooling the amplifiers and other components in radio receivers weakens the random motion and reduces the noise. NASA uses liquid helium to cool these components down to ~15K (-430F / -250C). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Atmo is a signal degradation, one of the larger concerns besides interference from the sun.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Because you can't put a seventy meter antenna in space as easily.  The gain of no atmo would not outweigh the loss of terrestrial equipment.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>The signal contains Forward Error Correcting codes so that bits can be restored. The interleaving/coding of the bits means that a burst of noise won't wipe out a complete data packet but rather bits of separate FEC coded packets. </p></div>		</li>
