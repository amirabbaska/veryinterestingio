<p>I think Martha Withjack (also at Rutgers) has some students using clay models to study  reactivated thrusts during extension as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some cases (not this one), yes. Formation of metamorphic core complexes requires high magnitudes of extension that thin the lithosphere so much that metamorphic rocks from the middle and lower crust are exposed at the surface.  The core complexes were first recognized in the Mojave desert where calculated magnitude of extension is ~100%. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Core complexes are a weird situation where you have massive amounts of crustal extension, but the angle of the faulting is extremely shallow or is partitioned weirdly and full rifting doesn't occur. If an extension event reactivated a large decollement surface then I guess its possible, but it would be much more likely to form short-cut faults at closer to a standard 60 degree angle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed so. I conduct research looking at previously unrecognized histories of extension in the Great Basin by using fault-slip inversion. Recognizing reactivation can be very difficult without looking directly at fault kinematics.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Owens Valley as we see it today is actually very young. Current thought is that the current morphology originated about 3 - 5 million years ago. It formed because of a change in the tectonics of the region. Prior to 3 - 5 million years ago, the region was undergoing northwest-directed extension and formation of a metamorphic core complex (mentioned in one of the other comments) in the Silver Peak Range just east of the White Mountains. After 3 - 5 million years ago, the deformation style changed to transtension, meaning that there is simultaneous extension and lateral shearing. </p>
<p>The mountains surrounding Owens Valley are not formed by convergence but rather by extension. The reason that the Sierra Nevada and white mountains tower over Owens Valley is because the basin is forming faster then sedimentation can fill it up. We informally call these types of basins a &quot;starved basin&quot;.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh woah, so that means that the Sierras are the result of the metamorphic core complex pushing up and faulting / shearing younger rocks as opposed to an uplift from two plates colliding (like the Andes or Himalayas)? That's a pretty amazing amount of vertical deformation.</p>

<p>Heh, as long as Los Angeles exists its going to keep starving too since we collect, control, and drink the water that would otherwise be laying sediment in the bottom of the basin.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caledonian_orogeny" target="_blank">The Caledonides</a> for example. The mountain range doesn't exist at all any more, but remnants of it can be seen in the geology both sides of the North Atlantic. </p></div>		</li>
