<p>It's most important that you brush your teeth before consuming food or beverage, afterwards is not as important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you elaborate on that?  I’ve heard it before but I don’t really understand why.  Wouldn’t it be better to remove the food source for the bacteria as well as the bacteria themselves?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bacteria make an acidic environment very rapidly upon consuming food, within a few minutes. At this point, damage is already being done. Additionally, if you do brush in the short term, you could increase the abrasion done to your teeth, while the material is weakened by acids.</p>
<p>If you brush before eating, you remove the plaque, which means less bacteria to produce acid in the first place, and less harm. </p>
<p>Actually removing food particles isn't really the goal of brushing, generally speaking. This can be achieved by a simple mouth rinse in most cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you can use mouthwash after you eat or drink to help remove and kill some of those bacteria. </p>
<p>Drinking water will also help raise the pH of your mouth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dentist told me the worst thing you can do after drinking a fizzy drink is go and brush your teeth because you’re essentially just scrubbing the sugar into the enamel. He said always drink some water first and then wait a while if you need to brush them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's actually the acidity of the soda and not the sugar. Sugar doesn't harm your teeth, it's what the acid producing bacteria eat and turn into acid. A lot of times pregnant women with bad morning sickness develope problems with their teeth because they brush after throwing up which does the same thing (acid scrub your enamel).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have heard that eating/drinking actually changes the PH of your mouth, and your teeth surfaces get a bit soft when you eat.  It takes a little while (20 mins?) for your saliva to get your mouth back to its proper PH level, and for the surfaces of your teeth to harden again.</p>
<p>So, brushing immediately after eating is not recommended because when you brush when your teeth are softer, you can actually damage your teeth.  Anyone in the dental field please correct me if I'm wrong! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first part is right, the second part is not. Bacteria are most successful under a &quot;biofilm&quot;. The biofilm is being remade constantly and you absolutely need to brush your teeth BEFORE bed. Sleeping with a days worth of food while your teeth dry out because of low saliva due to normal body shit is the most detrimental. Swallowing bacteria is fine. If you  brush once a day, do it at night. </p>
<p>I'm a dental hygienist. I talk about this stuff all day at work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s more like brush before bed, not after dinner. Do you eat dinner and then immediately go to bed? You should have plenty of time after dinner for your teeth to recuperate from eating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fine. Brushing while the enamel is softened by acids will brush away a tiny layer that can be rebuilt by fluoride. Usually when I'm brickfaced I'll go straight from drinking to brushing to bed. That's fine every now and then. It's the daily brushing away of that tiny layer that ruins teeth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine brushing opens up micro abrasions in your gum line for bacteria to enter so brushing before a meal would be detrimental to your oral hygiene. Brushing after sounds logical as long as your rinse your mouth before brushing.</p></div>		</li>
