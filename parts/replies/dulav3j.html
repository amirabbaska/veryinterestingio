			<div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here who does breast surgery.</p>
<p>Any doctor familiar with breasts is very aware of inflammatory breast cancer.   Breast is such an area of high litigation it causes anxiety among providers, and so breast issues are very commonly sent to breast specialist quickly.  </p>
<p>Can look like infection such ass cellulitis.  It’s generally ok to try short course of antibiotics, but any doctor who routinely works with breast would know to biopsy it within a week or two If it doesn’t improve.  </p>
<p>My biggest advice is if something doesn’t seem right about your breast, go see a doctor.  A mammogram, ultrasound, and exam are easy and painless to do. </p>
<p>Of note, OP is right to say inflammatory breast cancer is a bad actor in general, glad she’s apparently cured.  Majority are not that lucky. </p></div>		</li>
