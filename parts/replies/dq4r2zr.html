Youve probably had one before they tend to be fake Microsoft web pages saying you have a virus and cant leave until one of their team removes the virus and then supplies a presumably extortionately priced number on screen. I feel real bad for anyone who falls for those because I can see how older people who are just getting into IT could fall for it </p></div>		</li>

<p>Instead of clicking on anything on their obnoxious popups:</p>
<p>You can pull your computer off the internet and force-quit your browser. </p>
<p>(In OS X it's Command-Option-Escape, then select Safari or Chrome or whatever browser you're using, and click the &quot;force quit&quot; button; on Windows there's a key code I've forgotten to get into the Task Manager -- did they use control-alt-delete for that and then select &quot;task manager&quot; rather than shutdown or reboot or etc?)</p>
<p>If you have your browser set to restart with the same environment as it ended with, then the next step (while keeping your computer offline) is to start up the browser again and close the window (Command-W on a mac, I think it's Ctrl-F4 on a windows machine). </p>
<p>Alternatively you can try repeatedly pressing Command-LeftArrow to go back to previous pages in the history. </p>
<p>This isn't ideal, but it's better than clicking on their crap.</p>
<p>EDIT: added windows ideas</p></div>		</li>
