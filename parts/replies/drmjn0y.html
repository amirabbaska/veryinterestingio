			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand your explanation correctly, barring any negative effects the manipulation of LPL might have (if any), would it be feasible to manipulate where LPL expresses itself in the body? As in, from adipocytes to skeletal muscle cells, thus bypassing a major obesity maintaining factor and extending the amount of time one would be able to perform aerobics? I feel like the answer is hormones, but then how would one safely go about manually regulating specific hormones for said purpose of particular LPL expression?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, you don't want lipid build up in your muscles either. The only time it's ever really safe for someone to have fat stores in their muscles is if they're endurance runners. Anyone else, that's a symptom of metabolic dysfunction that is especially prevalent in obesity, and thought to be one of the reasons for how diabetes occurs from obesity. Muscles don't like to use fat for energy because it's slow and more energy intensive than necessary. Placing lipid in there preferentially won't make the muscles use what's around them when glucose and creatine stores are easily utilized. </p>
<p>One of the things I try to put out there when these discussions come up is that lipids aren't bad. Fat isn't bad. We need those energy sinks (adipocytes) around in order to maintain proper energy homeostasis and prevent the dysregualtion that results from increased lipid a circulating. Eating lots of sugar, or even protein, will become lipid if you eat more calories than you're burning in your day-to-day. Ultimately, you just need to burn what you take in and the point of putting on weight in non-ideal places becomes moot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another question I got from this is what happens if LPL is down regulated. Where does the fat go?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good way to store fat just on your boobs would be make a special container that rests right stop your boobs. Then store said fatty items in container, whether it be butter or a really fatty piece of meat. Or go classic and just stuff said items in bra. Either option works</p></div>		</li>
