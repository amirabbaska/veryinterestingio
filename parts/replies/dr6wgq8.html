			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1006" target="_blank">SN_1006 Supernova</a> was 7200 light years away, and it was visible during daytime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you like maths I'll give you an exercise: </p>
<p>Given the speed of light (300 000km/s), the distance to IK Pegasi, and the fact that the material in a supernova expands at around 10 000km/s, what will the angular size of the supernova of IK Pegasi be 2 weeks after explosion (around peak brightness)?  How about 4 weeks?</p>
<p>Assuming the human eye can resolve objects of angular size at least 1 arcmin wide (1 sixtieth of a degree), will you be able to resolve the supernova at peak brightness? How about 2 weeks after? </p>
<p>Bonus: how long would the supernova have to expand for you to be able to resolve it with your eyes? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will always be a dot, but a very bright dot, like headlights from a car. Even if the supernova is a million times larger in diameter than a regular star, it's still a dot to a naked eye. But if it's close enough, it can be brighter than the sun.</p></div>		</li>
