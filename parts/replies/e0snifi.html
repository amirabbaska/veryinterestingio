			<div class="markdown"><p>Yooper here, one that lives on the keweenaw peninsula of the upper peninsula. I have to agree there nothing that feels peninsular about the central portion of the UP except that you can be at one of the great lakes, most of the time, within an hour. Being on the keweenaw feels peninsular though. I can be at a beach on lake Superior within like 15 minutes anytime I want and it really shows in the extreme weather, winter for instance. All snow is lake effect snow because all the wind that gets to us has to come off the lake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, Go Pack Go! But, it's a fairly even split, I  would say. I guess the closest &quot; big city&quot; would be Green Bay, for me at least. I'm about 5 hours from GB but I guess if you wanna go big big then Milwaukee or the twin cities. As for Lansing, meh. We kind of get forgotten about up here. I actually live very near to Calumet which was almost the capital at one point due to the crazy amounts of mining production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in Michigan and was taught in school a peninsula is a landmass surrounded with water by all borders but one border...hence why there are 2 peninsulas. The bottom of Michigan is connected to the rest of the United States and the UP is connected to the rest of the lower peninsula. This seems elementary to me. The thumb isn't a penusila to me because it's a part of a whole. But at the same time you're right about the thumb. I also grew up in the thumb (shout out!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does, but it's still connected to Wisconsin. I was incorrect to say it was connected to the lower penusila of Michigan. I got a head of myself. </p></div>		</li>
