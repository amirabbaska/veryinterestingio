			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment is coming dangerously close to a common misconception. That the main economic benefit from being a member of the EU is based on receiving more money from the EU budget that you are paying into it. This was the &quot;misconception&quot; that caused the Â£350m-a-week NHS Bus during Brexit.</p>
<p>In reality the far greater economic benefit from the EU is the increased GDP growth all member states gets from the common market of the EU which not only creates free trade between member states but also homogenizes regulation within many areas of member-country's economies allowing for far easier trade between EU members.</p></div>		</li>

Unfortunately for the rest of the UK (more unfortunate for Wales &amp; NI) London doesn't like sharing its wealth with the more povo areas of the uk. I'm a scouser (Liverpool) and we saw a massive amount of money from the EU to the point our city was revitalised from the brink of death due to londons selfish investing. Sad to leave the EU, such a backwards step for us (you'll think differently if your racist, rich or from London) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because his comment is not true. London benefited from EU-membership as well. The membership fee crumbles in comparison to the increased revenue from increased GDP growth because of the common market. London, being the financial capital of Europe, benefited hugely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything you said is incorrect.</p>
<p>London taxes heavily subsidise the rest of the UK. If it weren't for London, your area would be a lot more &quot;povo&quot; than it already is.</p>
<p>London voted to remain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not British, and prior to Brexit this wasn't something that was really on my radar, but since then I've heard a lot about how skewed the country is between &quot;London&quot; and &quot;not-London&quot;. That really sounds extremely messed up, and even now, I get the impression a lot of Londoners aren't really aware of it.</p>
