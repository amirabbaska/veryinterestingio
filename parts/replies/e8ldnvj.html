Whereas on Earth, we're mostly concerned with temperature and precipitation because our atmosphere allows it, in space the weather we care most about has to do with radiation exposure because it can damage equipment and our bodies.  The amount of radiation has to do with your local climate, for example, you'll receive less radiation in you're very close to earth, and shielded inside its magnetic field but you get heaps of radiation if you fly through the Van Allen belts or into deep space.  If the sun releases a CME that hits our planet, you'll get a transient &quot;weather&quot; effect where radiation spikes wherever you are, but proportional too the local climate you're in.  </p>
<p>NASA actually has probes monitoring space weather in our solar system to help keep our satellites, probes, and astronauts safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Van Allen belts are within Earth's magnetosphere. Also, you don't get radiation spikes associated with CME impact. The solar flare that precedes a CME might blast Earth, but the CME causes Earth's magnetic field to go wonky (scientific term) and eventually dump a bunch of plasma nearby. conveniently, since the CME itself delivers a bunch of plasma besides the magnetic wonkiness, you get a lot of those particles making it all the way to the ionosphere and causing light shows and such. </p>
<p>Space weather isn't just concerned with the radiation emmited by the sun (or galactic cosmic rays), but also plasma precipitation mechanisms that get kicked off by the sun. This includes plasma transport from the sun to the near earth plasma populations as well as magnetic field orientation.</p>
<p>The two pirmary terrestrial space weather concerns are radiation exposure over the poles and radio communication conditions. For satellite operators, they care about those energetic particles buzzing around Earth in the ring current and the belts, since those particles are directly responsible for the damage satellites constantly sustain in space.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Layman's explanation: it's the radiation that's rnant of the time shortly after the big bang.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd argue that there IS CLIMATE in space, but not based on the traditional definition as /u/Conscious_Mollusc astutely explained. </p>
<p>If you take the condition of the universe over a long period of time however, there is indeed something you can refer to as &quot;Climate&quot;.</p>
<p>The &quot;climate&quot; of space is more akin to Entropy, and the reactions available at the time. For example the climate of space will be very different in a billion billion years, as it is to now. There will be less energy, fewer stars, and over-all lack of life or opportunities for it. This space climate is certainly different. Regionally, in space, the climate is of course different due to local phenomenon; Black holes may change the regions climate, super massive red dwarves, etc.</p>
<p>However, don't get this confused, I'm not saying you should refer to the state of the universe overtime as CLIMATE, but there are certainly aspects to space one can liken to climate, and it doesn't hurt entirely to think of a stage in which the universe is at, as a different climate to one it was before or will be.</p>
<p>As for weather and its role in &quot;space climate&quot; again, entropy plays a part. Right now the weather is a rainy. Planets are still being made, fusion is still happening, super novae etc. But it used to be all-out storming. And some day soon the luls will come and it will stop raining. Forever.</p></div>		</li>
