			<div class="markdown"><p>Well written. I also want to add part of the code is don't mess with the opposing team's goalie. It doesn't matter who you are, if you are whacking at the goalie after the whistle has blown or if you even spray ice on the goalie when trying to stop, you better get ready to be in a fight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, there are a few goalies who loved to fight. I remember a Buffalo-Ottawa match where just about everyone ended up in a fight. Ray Emery skated to center ice to meet Buffalo's goalie with the biggest grin on his face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If i'm thinking about the right fight, Emery went all the way to the opposing corner to fight Ryan Miller. And if i remember correctly Miller looked to want to part of Emery who threw the &quot;code&quot; out the window and started throwing punches at a downed player with their back turned. He then lost all my respect when he threw his arms up claiming a victory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both most times, along with anyone else on the ice at the time. Alot of goalies will hold grudges and really hack opposing players with their sticks when they screen the net. Getting hit on the calf where there is little to no padding is probably one of the most painful things I've felt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you hit the goalie, everyone on the ice on that team will go after you. Pretty much no exceptions. Goalies are very protected by their teams and the refs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure how it can really be said to be. I've seen many a sports event change on a key moment like a fight.  When these moments occur and the game flow changes, how can you argue it still would have either changed without that event or that the event simply had nothing to do with it?</p>
<p>Athletes themselves will even refer to such events when these games occur, yet we can someone analyze and say they are just making stuff up and it didn't matter?</p></div>		</li>
