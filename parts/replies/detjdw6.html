			<div class="markdown"><p>Formal town planner here, I did a presentation at uni on this topic. Good explanation but I believe it is missing one part of the story. We all agree that Gentrification occurs when:</p>
<p>1- Wealthier people arrive in an existing urban district
2- There is an increase in rents and property values because of that
3- And changes the district character and culture</p>
<p>The real question is how this happens and about this there are two main theories, the one you described which is a cultural phenomenon driven by demand (Demand Side Approach) and another theory where gentrification is driven by the capital (Supply Side Approach) also called the Neil Smith's Rent Gap Theory.</p>
<p>According to research, the demand side approach is driven by the return of middle socio-economic classes from attractive but isolated suburbs to the inner city. The transition from an industrial to a post-industrial urban economy generated a new middle class which sees suburban homes less desirably. (Hammett, 1991; Ley, 1987, 1994, 1996; Zukin, 1982; Lipton 1997; Atkinson, 2000; Hamnett, 2003)</p>
<p>In the rent gap theory instead, investments in deprecated urban areas are triggered by the potential gain from a substantial increase in land rent and land value and population turnover represents a physiological consequence of the process. Neil Smith's theory follows a circular path where:
1- At the beginning a brand new neighborhood has been built on vacant land.
2- After years there is an initial deprecation of the average properties (wear and tear, obsolescence in style, need of major repairs)
3- The first original landlords and homeowners sell out and seek new homes somewhere else
4- Tendency of the neighborhood towards rental tenure. Properties are generally under-maintained
5- Progressive heighbourhood decline. People start leaving and the area becomes more dangerous and rough
6- Tendency of social segregation phenomena (ghettos), total disinvestment by landlords and financial institutions
7- The gap between the asked rent (now very low) and the potential rent of the area (probably very high as the area was built many years ago and is now probably in a central part of the city) triggers interest from developers.
8- Single buildings or entire parts of the neighbourhood are demolished and replaced by new and more expensive buildings
9- The area becomes more expensive therefore the original population is outpriced and forced to leave</p>
<p>The Rent Gap which this theory refers to is the difference between the Capitalised Ground Rent (CGR) and the Potential Ground Rent (PGR).
Rent Gap = PGR - CGR</p>
<p>The Capitalised Ground Rent is the actual economic return from the right to use the land.</p>
<p>The Potential Ground Rent is the maximum economic return from the rights to use the land.</p>
<p>To give you an example of this, when you buy a house the price you pay includes the Capitalised Ground Rent and the House Value (the cost of building). Here is a graph <a href="https://quilas.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/newurbanfrontier-3-2.jpg" target="_blank">https://quilas.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/newurbanfrontier-3-2.jpg</a></p>
<p>In this model there are many agents, the owner/occupier, the landlord, the tenant and the property unit, but the real driver is the developer who is the only one who can trigger the gentrification process.</p>
<p>These two main theories looks very different one from the other however they are both valid and the way they happen mainly relates to the local planning system and regulations. If one part of the city buildings are listed as historical and cannot be demolished gentrification is likely to be driven by demand rather than by supply.</p>
<p>An example of this is London where in parts like Camden Town gentrification is driven by demand while in Elephant and Castle is driven by supply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't a small uptick in demand trigger investment by developers? Also can't the demand model happening in one neighborhood trigger a higher precieved rent gap in the adjacent neighborhoods, This is what seems to be happening in Washington D.C.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you are correct. Proximity is one of the key drivers in housing prices, think about the presence of good schools, healthcare facilities and green spaces, they all play a role in determining the price of a property. In the same way, easy access to a adjacent cool neighbourhood might push prices up in other parts of the city. It is also true the opposite, as especially at the beginning of the gentrification process the newly built properties are still cheap as the surrounding areas are still deprecated and likely to have high rates of criminality.</p>
<p>For example, I live in London on a new development but all around there are council flats and low values properties. My property cost me 1/3 of what it might have cost just 2kms away, but in the long run more and more new properties will replace the old council flats and slowly prices will go up. Basically I made a good long term investment :)</p>
<p>Proximity in space however is not everything because more often proximity in time matters more. Basically you could be quite close to a cool area but it takes a lot of time to get there because it's not well connected. This for example is why american suburbs with all those cul de sacs are not very appealing as it takes very long time to go anywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Decent new neighborhood is built, slowly gets shittier as it gets older, people stop putting money into it. City in general gets bigger and the shitty and cheap neighborhood is in a really good location so people buy up property and build nicer buildings, causing rent to go up and forcing out a lot of previous owners/tenants. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An area is cheap,  maybe a bit older and run down. Slightly richer people move in to save money,  or just think the area has charm. Slightly higher class businesses take interest in the area. </p>
<p>This snowballs,  and the value of the area increases. Existing residents,  both people and business have to pay higher property taxes as the value has increased.</p>
<p>They go broke trying to stay,  or are forced to move out. At least this is my understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One point to mention is that gentrification happens in stages, at least in New York. The end result is the same, but from what I've seen, the pioneer gentrifiers and businesses often get priced out themselves. </p>
<p>Here in North Brooklyn, one such example is a higher end expensive grocery store chains called Khim's Millennium Market. They were one of the first expensive natural grocery store chain to open in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. They still seem to be doing okay, but stores like Whole Foods and Trader Joes will always be able to undercut their prices. It's a matter of time until they have to close down and move out to the gentrification fringe.</p>
<p>I live in a part of North Brooklyn that, 25 years ago, would be completely unsafe to walk down the street at night. Crack houses and gang violence were rampant. Whenever I meet someone who's lived here since those days, I ask them their opinion on how life has changed. Most seem to appreciate the safer neighborhood, but I'll never be able to get the opinion of someone who was forced out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Born and raised in brooklyn. Survived the 80s and 90s. This doesn't only happen in minority neighborhoods and dangerous neighborhoods. Growing up, you could walk down the street for a week and not hear English - only Italian. My neighborhood was safe and quiet (surrounding areas not so much). Everyone knew each other. My whole family lived there. I grew up in the same neighborhood my father grew up in and the neighborhood my grandfather landed in when he got off the boat from Naples. I was walking to school by myself by 3rd grade because every block between home and school had aunts, uncles, cousins and family friends. </p>
<p>Now? All the old ginzos are gone. Including me. I go back to the neighborhood and I don't know anyone. The house I grew up in, my mother sold for almost a million and that was over a decade ago. She bought it for $40k.</p>
<p>I still have friends in the area. No one knows each other. The teachers at school don't really know the kids or their families. And the neighborhood is actually more dangerous than it used to be. The criminals from the surrounding areas figured out years ago that the Italians who would've beat the fuck out of them just for entering the neighborhood or shot them for breaking into a car are gone. Kids don't play in the streets like i used to. Kids don't walk around by themselves like i used to. Old folks don't sit on the sidewalk on beach chairs watching everything like they used to. The stores sell pre-packaged brie and shitty, dry baguettes instead of fresh made, still warm mozzarella and Italian bread. Fuck gentrification. I get it - it's the cycle of the city, etc. But it ruined my home. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gentrification didnt ruin your home man. My neighborhood in South Philly was the same way. People just change. Families dont have 4-8 kids anymore. Parents dont let their kids roam the streets unattended, even in their own neighborhoods. Not nearly as much anyway. Families dont feel the need to all buy houses in the same 3 blocks of each other. These things started to disappearing the 90s. And gentrification had nothing to do with it. </p>
<p>I grew up 2 blocks from the Italian market. We had the fresh bread, cheese, meats, etc. my family had 13 houses within 3 blocks. Wed roam the neighborhood until dark. I was walking to school by myself as a five year old first grader, having to cross three different streets. Eventually the kids grew up and bought houses of their own, but not in the neighborhood. Some went to the burbs, some went to Jersey, some went to other places in the city, and some just left the area. The older family members died and their kids sold their houses and split the money. The market is still there but for years it struggled as the nighborhood got worse, not better. There was empty storefronts and abandonded houses all over the neighborhood. Junkies walking around. Crime getting worse and worse. Then these young hipsters started to move in. They bought dumps for cheap money and ten year tax abatements. They fixed them up. Developers bought the empty buildings and built new ones. Property values rose so some long time residents took advantage of a big payday and sold their places. They cleaned up the parks and playgrounds. Nobody was forced out, if they left they did it on their own for the money.</p>
<p>I just dont see how people could say its better to leave a neighborhood filled with junkies and crackhouses rather than have people that want to move in and clean it up. It sucks that good poor people may not be able to afford to stay there but usually if they arent renters these people are making up to ten times what they paid for their houses. Those days you remember were never going to stay the same either way, most people really dont live like that anymore. Its a time thats past. All gentrification is doing is making your neighborhood clean and nice like it was when you were younger rather than a crime ridden slum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the flip side, the neighborhood I lived in as a kid in Baltimore, Pigtown, was a complete cesspool of white trash junkies in the 90s. Mom didn't let me play outside alone because it was dangerous. There was a sense of community in the 60s but by the time I was born there were no blue collar jobs in the city and most the honest people have moved out. </p>
<p>Nowadays it's a nicer, safer environment, the boarded up houses which were used as traphouses by heroin dealers are slowly getting rehabbed. There are decent businesses around and less trash on the street. The best part is its still affordable. Before, it was dirt cheap; the family house sold for $30k. Now it's more expensive but reasonable for someone with a working class income, with that same house having sold for $170k a few years back after being rehabbed (I saw it by chance while on zillow).</p>
<p>Gentrification in my city has been very different than in most rich cities like NY. It's mostly been white working class people being forced out here in Baltimore with people from the suburbs moving in and in some instances (like Pigtown) the neighborhood actually has more minorities than before. As someone from the white working class in this city I see it as a good thing. Neighborhoods are safer, and less dilapidated but still relatively affordable. It's honestly only pushed out piece of shit junkies, drunks and the kind of urban good ol boys that don't like anyone not like themselves. I welcome it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where in Brooklyn? Not sure where you grew up but trying to think of a place 30 years ago where you'd only hear Italian. FWIW I'm from Bay Ridge, though we had a pretty big Irish/Italian mix along with Greek and now Middle-eastern / Korean it seems (I moved out to Manhattan awhile ago because fuck the R train). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived in downtown Brooklyn close to Jay st./metrotech and left New York in 2013.  The area we were in used to be dangerous as hell, but with the expansion into Brooklyn from Manhattan, our building was torn down to make high rise condos. My former 5th floor walkup with the wonky stair case and steam-engine radiator has been replaced by glitz and glass.  The little taco shop I used to hit up is gone.  The proximity to Brooklyn Heights has created an influx of wealthier businesses, and the weirdness of the Jay street stores is being 'normalized' for the newer residents.  </p>
<p>My old apartment was a dream; we were walking distance to every subway we could want, there was a trader Joe's close by that I could get groceries from walking home from work, and we were right across from the MTA building so there was a constant police presence that gave the impression of safety. We paid $1250/month for a one bedroom (really a loft with a wall put up to make a bedroom, but still).  We were maybe 7-8 blocks from the Brooklyn bridge.  My now-wife found the apartment through a friend almost by accident and the landlord owned the block of buildings around us. He rented the first floor to a little bodega that had the worst hours (6am-2pm) and ran his law firm from the second floor. Floors 3-5 had two apartments each.  </p>
<p>I'm from Ohio originally and I grew up in some unsavory neighborhoods but I felt safer in the quasi-run-down area of Brooklyn where I worked than I did in my middle class neighborhood in Ohio.  It was such a strange dichotomy, and the only time I felt any sort of unease was during hurricane Sandy.  I had to walk my sister across the Manhattan bridge to catch a bus and the constant stream of people going into Brooklyn meant there were some unstable folks coming into BK where there was light and power.  That was one of the most surreal experiences too; walking across the Manhattan bridge into a completely dark Manhattan, the lights stopped halfway over the water, and we had some staggering homeless guy lunge out of the shadows at us.  </p>
<p>The gentrification of Brooklyn is weird.  My wife worked in Bed Stuy and had a shuttle to take her and her co-workers from the subway stop to the school 6 blocks away because of the amount of teacher that were mugged on the walk.  Now even Bed Stuy is getting 'cleaned up' and people are being pushed further away from the central areas.  I understand the problems involved with gentrification and the issues associated with rising housing costs, and I've been affected by it as well in my home state, but some of the interesting things that come with it are the rehabilitation of neighborhoods that were formerly affluent and fell out of favor with the wealthy residents and became dangerous neighborhoods afflicted with drugs and violence. Now those areas are being restored to their former glory and people are angry about the influx of money into their neighborhoods because of the rapidly racial dynamic changing into an imbalance based on income, but they're still patronizing the new businesses.  Something else I find interesting is that the finger is always pointed towards the traditional 'rich whites pushing out poor minorities' but our New York landlord was a Cuban immigrant who was only too happy to raise rent before selling his buildings to the condo developers.  A friend of mine lost her apartment when her black landlord raised the rent by 200% over the course of two years, and a co-worker and her family were pushed out of their apartment by the new landlord (also black).  Obviously those are only a few cases of minority owners and they're purely anecdotal, but it always seems like it's less of a racial thing and more of a money thing.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>And just because a Cuban raises his rent doesn't mean that it's not rich and white that are pushing the poor immigrants and lower earners out. The Cuban is a middle man. Trump, Kushner, and the like are the developers who create the spaces for the wealthy types to come in and spent untold millions on their apartments overlooking the bridge. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Gentrification happens in stages&quot;
Except when it doesn't. Williamsburg is the fast outlier that it was because Mayor Bloomberg cut deals (in my opinion) with his developer friends and rezoned wide swathes of the neighborhood. Part of the reason Williamsburg was so blue collar was because of all the factories and warehouses the neighborhood was zoned for. As businesses moved out, it left the neighborhood separated from the rest of the city (imagine blocks worth of factories). Bloomberg rezoned those blocks and replaced them with luxury multi unit buildings - doubling and tripling the amount of people living in an area without investing the same amount in the infrastructure- schools, hospitals, police, transportation. And then because the wealthier new tenants tend to have more political pull things start happening - new bus stops, police patrolling the new buildings and parks.
Imagine how the locals feel when they have been ignored when they asked for local improvements but suddenly the new comers are getting everything they are asking for. </p>
<p>An interesting variable on this happened in my old stomping grounds in Midwood. When I was growing up, the neighborhood was predominately white Italian Catholics. They sold their houses to the Hassidic Jews who tend to stay to themselves and support their own. I watched all the Italian bakeries and delis disappear and become Jewish businesses that closed at sundown and on Saturdays. I eventually moved out because their were no longer anything supporting my lifestyle. Try finding beer and pizza on a Saturday night in a Jewish neighborhood. </p></div>		</li>

Areas like TriBeCa and large parts of Brooklyn had that happen and now only the extremely wealthy can live there. Natural gentrification is a fact of life though. As time goes on and a neighborhood has become stable and established, property prices will go up and external parties will move in </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Come to Austin, Texas to see this in person. A buddy of mine recently opened up a restaurant in what used to be known as the &quot;ghetto&quot; part of town (E. 7th Street). Of course now it is a hipster breeding ground where a studio apartment starts at $1500/month. That may not seem as bad as New York or San Fran, but keep in mind that this just happened over the last 5 years. I remember we used to live in what were considered &quot;luxury&quot; apartments in 2010 and were paying around $800/month for a 3 bedroom. Due to increased rent we were pushed to the outer parts of town. It's annoying because I love this city but it has gotten waaaay to expensive to live here.</p></div>		</li>
