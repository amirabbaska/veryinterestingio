			<div class="markdown"><p>A question I have had for many, many years.</p>
<p>After an IQ test, the official answer was, &quot;He is very bright, but we don't want to put a number on it.&quot;</p>
<p>What would lead to that? Inconsistent results?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm making an educated guess here, but many programs teach that the IQ is not the best measure for cognitive ability. It's the best overall measure--as in if you had to take one score and tell someone how they performed, but it doesn't paint the whole picture of a person. </p>
<p>Instead, we are taught to evaluate the individual indices (general content areas such as language, memory, etc.) and base our interpretation on that. Some psychs even prefer not to report the IQ if there is too much variability among the indices. If there was significant variability in the indices or how they thought administration went, then the IQ may not be entirely reflective of your true cognitive ability. </p>
<p>However, if you were tested in a school in the US or by a private practice you should have access to your records and the report. The school/practice would have given your parents a copy of the report at the time. If you're curious...</p>
<p>What would it lead to--inconsistent results? Well more of a number (which remember the practitioner deemed not entirely representative of your ability) that parents and teachers could have inaccurately held you to. </p>
<p>Basically, they were looking out for your future interests. If they said you were &quot;very bright&quot; I'd take that as a compliment and that you have certain cognitive strengths that perform better/more efficiently than your peers. Hope this helps. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Tried that. It was a long, long time ago. :) Records can't be found (this was in 1970). And that was the actual answer they gave my parents, nothing in writing.</p>
<p>We tend to the intelligent side in my family, so no surprise there, just always thought the answer was puzzling. I never had the full battery of tests other than that one time, and all the informal &quot;IQ Tests&quot; I have ever done have been inconsistent.</p>
<p>I can understand not wanting to be branded with a number, and that may have been a very good idea. </p></div>		</li>
