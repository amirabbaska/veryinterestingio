			<div class="markdown"><p>What about languages that don't use ma and pa words for mother and father. For example, in my language which is Cree and also a native american language, we use nikawīy which is mother and notawīy which is father. Or would this just be due to languages evolving over time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cree is Algonquian, not IndoEuropean. It is therefore derived from Proto-Algonquian not PIE. That's why you don't get ma and pa, because it's not related to that family of languages. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know Cree is Algonquian just like navajo is southern athabaskan. I was wondering why some languages don't use ma and pa type of words especially because there are northern athabaskan languages that also don't use &quot;ma and pa&quot; that aren't that far from Algonquian languages, like dene </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just going to say, Proto-Indo-European is far from the common ancestor to most languages spoken today. It is a large family but it is not the largest. The fact that many words for mother and father have been seen to be similar across languages is likely due to the fact that the sound p and the sound m tend to be the first ones that children can make. Since humans are pretty self centered creatures, many people will hear their baby saying mama and papa while they are babbling and assume that they must be trying to refer to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for saying this... It's what I came here to say. Per Wikipedia, there are 445 estimated Indo European languages spoken today, out of 6,500 languages in the world.. So about 8%. By another measure, 46% of the world's population speaks an Indo European language as their first language, which is probably the highest for any language family.</p>
<p>Proto Indo European emerged only about 5,500 years ago, whereas language itself is estimated to have emerged somewhere between 60,000 to 200,000 years ago. Put another way, all of the evolutions, transformations, and diversification that got us from the single language of PIE to the 445 living (and countless dead) Germanic, Romance, Slavic, Persian, Hindi, etc languages we have today, had <em>already happened 10-30 times over</em> by the time PIE came into existence. So the idea that characteristics of PIE are fundamental to all human languages seems pretty far off the mark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Persian: Ma-Dar (Mother) and Pe-Dar (father)
At the time of Islamic/Arabic conquests the Persian language went through some changes and our writing changed from cuneiform (like Greek) to the written Arabic style.
Then many words changed as they don't have the letter P. </p>
<p>This is actually a huge deal. Many words had to be changed from P to F. </p>
<p>INCLUDING Persian. Persian/Persia is a western word. Iranians called the original ethnic groups of that name- Parsi. </p>
<p>So the language became Farsi. </p>
<p>You'll hear someone say they are Persian (etnicity) from Iran (country of origin) and that they speak Farsi (name of language after Arabic/Islam conquests.)</p>
<p>We still pronounce the word dauGHter with the original gh. </p>
<p>Here's some extra words (phonetically) for those interested:</p>
<p>Door:  Dar
Eyebrow:  Ah-brew
Lip: Lab
Sugar: She-Kaar
Blouse: Bowl-Eez
Brother: Baar-ah-dar
Better: Beh-Taar
Good:  Khoob (the KH makes that cat hiss sound)</p>
<p>The majority of the current Farsi language is a melting pot of all the conquests against and for Iran during the last 3000 years. It's one of the easiest languages to learn to speak. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you know these sounds are universal for all babies? Even babies have accents and favor sounds that they hear in their environment. I'd imagine that a baby in a household with an entirely different language background would experiment with different vocalizations.</p>
<p>Here's a pop science article about it:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans are born with the larynx high in the throat like most mammals. At about three months it begins to descend and at about age 4 it reaches its final destination. Until this process is complete, a baby is physically incapable of producing certain sounds, hence why certain sounds are considered universally first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not only IE languages. The same, Chinese (Sino-Tibetian) as 妈妈 (ma1ma) for mother and 爸爸 (ba4ba) for father. Georgian (Kartvelian) has “mama“ for father and “deda“ for mother afaik. In Turkish, “anne“ is mother (don't know father). It's cross-linguistic because parents all over the world assumed that their children didn't just blabber-repeat the easiest syllables but trying to say their names. Especially in Georgian you can see that the process can also occur inversely.</p></div>		</li>
