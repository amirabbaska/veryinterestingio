			<div class="markdown"><p>The faster a gyro are spinning, the more force required to move the system, so a gyro with a lot of ang-momentum will stay standing for longer than a slow one, but a gyro on a finger will <em>slow down</em> faster than one on its stand because of the higher friction caused by the skin - the one on the finger would still fall before the one on the stand</p></div>		</li>
