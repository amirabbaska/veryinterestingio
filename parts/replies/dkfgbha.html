I used the pulse thingy on the running mill couple of times and it always throws my attention off the task.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a few use cases I'd have:</p>
<ol>
<li>Literally see your fatigue curve in real time as expressed in 02 sats and pulse rate</li>
<li>Higher dip in 02 = more intense rep or technique, letting you hone in on more explosive, powerful, or optimal technique, or better HIIT</li>
<li>Lower dips in 02 = more optimized cardio technique (inverse of above)  </li>
<li>More objective measure of fatigue / cardiovascular load than &quot;perceived intensity&quot;</li>
<li>Can track and aggregate for later analysis, and greater macro trends across your workouts / training / matches</li>
</ol></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would probably be pretty simple to do. Off of the top of my head I imagine there would be issues with the effects of motion on the light detection. I don't know how accurate you can get with that. I'm also not sure if you could get the hardware down to a size that would fit comfortably on your earlobe. Maybe an armband or ankle band would work better.</p></div>		</li>
