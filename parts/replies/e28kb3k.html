			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of all of the other effects that they have on your body.</p>
<p>To list a few:</p>
<p>Endorphins are opioids.  They are just like other opoids and there is evidence to suggest that they are addictive in the same manner.  We don't have pills because, well, there are other opioids that we use.</p>
<p>Dopamine is made in pill form and is taken for some conditions.  however, it can raise blood pressure, cause headaches and in severe cases cause loss of kidney function, heart arrythmia and loss of blood flow to the extremities.  Popping a dopamine pill just to feel good would be the height of stupidity.</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, we don't have specific Serotonin pills.  However, serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) are commonly prescribed for depression and have many, many side effects.  Big ones are sleep disruption (drowsiness or insomnia), diarrhoea and sexual dysfunction (inability to achieve erection or orgasm and/or loss of libido).  Typically, the side effects really suck and it's just not worth taking SSRIs unless the alternative is worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Taking it would do nothing for you. Parkinson's disease is caused by a shortage of dopamine in the substantia nigra. If you could just take a dopamine pill, the disease could be cured (or at least made manageable). Instead, patients must take levodopa, a biological prodrug that is able to pass the barrier and it transformed into dopamine by your body. This is very inefficient because not all of it is converted and simply taking more doesn't mean it will be converted in the brain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of these neurotransmitters are tightly controlled by individual neurons in small little packages that they release when they get enough “signals” from neighboring neurons. </p>
<p>Most these neurotransmitters have low bioavailability, which means that very little of what you swallow makes it all the way into those little packages to where they would need to go to have an effect. </p>
<p>Also, with most of these, more isn’t necessarily better all the time. Increased levels of neurotransmitters in certain spots over a long enough period of time often makes those neurons rearrange themselves to become less sensitive to them. This means once the neurotransmitters fall back to normal levels, they can’t do as much as they used to until the neuron slowly adjusts itself back to how it was. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for using your own time to educate an Internet stranger. Are these neuron packages holding the 3 mentioned (hormones?) All over the body or just the brain? Where do they release these 3 into? Just tissue or blood or..?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People do all the time, just not directly. Most of these chemicals cannot pass through the blood-brain barrier, so taking them would do nothing for you. Instead, people take drugs that have an effect on the same chemical pathway as these neurotransmitters. Cocaine and amphetamine act on the dopaminergic system. This is why they make you happy and energetic. Opiates like heroin and Vicodin work on the same pathways as endorphins, killing pain and making you feel good. Psychedelics (for the most part) affect the serotonergic systems in our brain, completely altering our sense of reality. Uppers, downers, and psychedelics are basically the closest thing we have to taking a pill with dopamine, endorphins, or serotonin, respectfully.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for answering. Would you say that drugs then kind of really makes someone feel good/happy every time taken?</p>
<p>The way I always imagine it is that like the first couple of times they feel good, but then an addiction kicks in which is like a new axis of the body craving it just for the addictive quality instead of wanting again something that feels good. I guess I am asking are drugs addictive because they feel good time after time again, or because the body is tricked into craving them after a while?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if you happen to know, why might a dopamine deficit cause ADHD (if that's widely supported)? Being on a lot of drugs to fix that, I find it interesting but don't have the scientific literacy to research it myself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the idea is that ADHD is not merely a deficit of Dopamine, but it is often the &quot;duration Dopamine stays bonded to activation sites, before being removed&quot; (aka reuptaken). The idea being that the &quot;interest and motivation&quot; you get from Dopamine is much more fleeting than someone without ADHD. Therefore you need more frequent stimulus to maintain interest, hence the hyper/all over the place behavior. </p>
<p>With ADHD meds like Adderall, both the frequency AND the duration of Dopamine are increased, so you no longer need something interesting thrown at you every few seconds to maintain your focus. It helps alleviate that &quot;short attention span&quot;, or &quot;short Dopamine activation period&quot;.</p>
<p>Someone with a stronger background in this stuff, feel free to swoop in and correct me on the details, but I believe this is generally correct. That being said the underlying causes to ADHD aren't fully understood, so this isn't necessarily the case all the time.</p></div>		</li>
