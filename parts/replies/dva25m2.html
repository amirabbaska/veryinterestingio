			<div class="markdown"><p>WW2 was nearly the last era that saw bombers with multiple turrets though, so the lesson was learned eventually.</p>
<p>Later versions of the B-36 Peacemaker in 1954 had just the tail turret (deleting the others to save weight), and I don't recall any other aircraft of that era or later which had more than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could that also be partly from the shift to jet aircraft and missiles and everything? I have to imagine it'd be difficult to site in on a jet whipping past you. And with missiles, I'd think you wouldn't need to get as close as you needed to in WW2</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think that was a factor in the 1950's.  Air-to-air missile technology was only widely deployed in the 1960's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, the RAF was almost exclusively flying night missions, and the fighters opposing them were radar-equipped, so there wasn't much of a chance for gunners to see, let alone engage, an attacker. The situation was pretty different with the USAF's day bombing campaign. </p></div>		</li>
