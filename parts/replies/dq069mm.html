<p>When the sparkplug adds an ignition source, it explodes, and the huge surge in pressure makes your piston expand. </p>

<p>Nope, fuel in a cylinder needs to burn in a controlled fashion, to evenly push the piston down as it expands the gas in the chamber. When a car engine runs 'lean' - that is too little fuel for the amount of air available, you get 'detonation'. That's when you do actually get an explosion in the cylinder, and it ruins the engine in very short order. The exceptionally high peak pressures generated can bend con-rods, blow past piston rings, or ruin bearings be subjecting them to excessive force. </p>
<p>So car engines absolutely do not rely on 'explosions'. The fuel needs to burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some do: Nitrous Oxide is just chemical supercharging. You also dump a load of fuel at the same time to saturate the NO2 and stop it detonating. Interestingly, about 1/3rd of the power gains come from the intake charge cooling effect of vaporising that amount of Nitrous in the intake: Colder air = denser = more of it fits into the cylinder = more oxygen available for combustion = more power!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah most are, but you can get subsonic rounds for both rifles and pistols in certain calibers. A fair few rifle calibers can shoot 2 or 3 times the speed of sound.</p></div>		</li>
