			<div class="markdown"><p>What is also interesting about this is that rods cant detect colors, which means that in our peripheral vision we only see black and white. Funny when you test it imo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you test this? I don't know if that's because my brain compensates somehow, but the kid on my right has a blue coat, and as I type these words, I definitely see it bright blue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I did it by having a classmate slowly putting some random item in my peripheral sight. I guess you shouldnt know what it is before and you have to keep staring front of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that as your eyes move around taking information from the scene in front of you, information (such as colour) is retained to fill in the detail in the periphery. </p>
<p>You see that coat as blue because you looked at it directly at some point and your brain fills in that information even when your gaze is off to the side. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Visual memory comes into play here. You've already &quot;seen&quot; the coat, and know that it's blue; So even though it's in your peripheral vision your brain &quot;knows&quot; the coat is blue, so it fills in the color information for you. If you could see the direct feed from your eyes you'd see the coat in gray-scale but that'd probably be disorienting. If somebody took an object you'd never seen before, and slowly brought it into your field of view, assuming you don't look directly at it, it would appear black and white at first (I think, can't find info to confirm this last bit).</p>
<p>Here's a pretty good (and somewhat concise) article about visual memory:

<p>and here's an experiment you can perform at home with a friend to test your own peripheral vision:

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some cones in the periphery, just no red cones. So you will still be able to see some color through the combination of your blue and green cones. So it's not exactly that you're seeing black and white as much as you're kinda colorblind in the periphery. </p></div>		</li>
