			<div class="markdown"><p>We definitely had a name brand knock off without the plastic piece! It was the Nestle Wonderball, which made a resurgence earlier this year -- but I'm pretty sure they're gone again. And they had no plastic piece to show stuff on the inside, they were just super thin and broke easily to show the stuff inside.</p>
<p>It had little candies on the inside and sometimes other things. I remember getting stickers in mine sometimes. They had toys in them for the longest time before competitors lobbied against them as dangerous. But they sold that way for years in the 90s.</p>
<p>They were awesome and it seems everyone forgets them whenever Kindereggs are brought up. But they sold at all the stores. Walmarts, Bi-Lo (here in the south when they still existed and weren't Food City), Dollar General, etc.</p>
<p>I always wonder why they're forgotten because we did very much have our own Kinderegg for the longest time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! They could sell them because the item inside was edible. It's when the &quot;prize&quot; isn't edible that there's an issue. </p></div>		</li>
