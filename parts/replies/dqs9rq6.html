			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, no. It acts as a good gentle exfoliator that is environmentally friendly, a really good alternative to the micro-beads that are quite popular and quite bad for the environment. It's also more gentle on the skin, great for people with allergies and sensitive skin. There's no solid research to support or reject the oil-removing properties, however most good charcoal face washes will contain salicylic acid and possibly kaolin, which are well researched and effective at removing oil/excess sebum. The carbon removing oil should work in theory, but the lack of downsides mean it doesnt really matter if it doesnt work, the exfoliation alone is worth it.</p>
<p>Using a good charcoal face can make a massive difference for your skin. Whether or not the charcoal alone removes oil etc - unsure, but it doesn't make a huge difference whether or not it does if you get the right product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it scrub your face? Yes it does. But the entire marketing around it deals with the removal of &quot;toxins&quot; and the strengthening of your skin as a result, which is nonsense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but it would still be popular as a face scrub without the toxin marketing, especially in a market where we're removing harmful abrasives like apricot shells and microplastics.</p>
<p>When it's marketed in skincare items like sheet masks, and things like that, yes I agree it is bullshit marketing.</p></div>		</li>
