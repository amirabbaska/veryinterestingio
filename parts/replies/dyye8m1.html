			<div class="markdown"><p>your comment makes sense until the last sentence, its not your body regulating itself which it does.. but it wouldn't be the feeling he is experiencing that is just thermodynamics the same thing if you press a warm bagel against a frozen bagel.frozen bagel + warm bagel= mostly frozen bagel and a cold one. Frozen bagel+ boiling hot bagel= 2 room temperature bagels. The warmth you are feeling on another part of your body is probably not much more than your average body temperature so is it really warm? the coldness of your extremity is probably significantly colder. its not that one of your body parts is getting colder and one is getting warmer its that they are averaging their temperature out as they are pressed together, your slightly warm body part will lose its warmth from the other and be suddenly colder than your average body temp so what else is there to feel but coldness/the the loss of heat? your hand which was very cold will still be above what is considered warm so while the temperature would be going down it still wouldn't really give off a feeling of being warmed up i imagine you can try this experiment by holding an ice cube in a sink of hot/warm water you'll feel both but the ice will be more intense for the same reason </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You feel hot when your skin temperature reaches above 85 degrees. You feel cold when your skin temperature is below 95 degrees. Your average skin temperature is 93 degrees. Why does this matter? To even start feeling warm, you have to raise the temperature of the skin to at least 85 degrees. I assume that the thermal properties of your body don't change, so your belly warms your skin in the same way your hand cools its skin, so with that in mind if your belly is 93 degrees and your hand's skin needs to be 85 degrees to even start to feel warm then that means if your hand is below 77 degrees (which isn't very hard) then when you average out the temperatures you won't even begin to feel warm. At the same time though, your belly is already in the start of the range where it can feel cold. Any additional cold added makes it feel the cold more. That is my take on the article at least. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure it is. You have heat and cold receptors that make you feel hot and cold. They can both be active at the same time, its just they tend not to be very strong when both are active. </p></div>		</li>
