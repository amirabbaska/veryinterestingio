<p>One very striking example is the Widmanstätten pattern. The crystalline patterns form over millions of years of very slow cooling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. It ended up happening in parallel at the same time, basically. We found a couple of varieties of meteorites that seemed very different in terms of their minerology from other meteorites. Specifically they had a much younger age of formation than asteroid rocks do (which tend to date to the early days of the formation of the Solar System). In the '70s people came up with the theory that they were all from the same parent body, which then transitioned into the theory that the parent body was Mars. Partly this was due to analysis of the minerology of Mars, but also simply due to a process of exclusion. There was no other body large enough to support the same level of geological processes and also able to send rocks to Earth (via impact ejecta). Venus has such a thick atmosphere that it would be hard for rocks to escape it with escape velocity, and the orbital dynamics are less advantageous as well, so Venusian meteorites are expected to be extraordinarily uncommon on Earth, if they exist at all.</p>
<p>Ultimately the clincher was analyzing trapped atmospheric gasses within the meteorites in question and comparing that to the measurements of the Martian atmosphere the Viking landers had made, but at that point it was just confirming what was already suspected. Further research has shown that these meteorites must have come from a body that was extraordinarily similar to Mars, and since there is only one Mars we know of in our Solar System, that seems to be a good bet as to their origin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be too speculative, but would one of these types of asteroids be more useful for hollowing out to make an interior habitat? Like would some types be more resistant to fracture? </p></div>		</li>
