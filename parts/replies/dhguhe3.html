<p>Weather, though some may argue that it isn't cultural, leads to a more laid back environment due to less strain on the body to adapt to varying temperatures and weather patterns.</p>

<p>Your environment definitely affects your culture.</p></div>		</li>

That's just what spring is in Saskatchewan. We also have a reputation for being one of the kindest parts of Canada. Think about that, even Canadians think people from that part of Canada are annoyingly polite. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Hear, hear!</p>
<p>I understand why many people like the idyllic weather of the heavily populated parts of California (what people are actually talking about here, not the whole West Coast) but it annoys me when they say that everybody should like it.</p>
<p>I live in NY, and though I've been to various parts of California many times, the longest I've stayed there is five weeks in Silicon Valley. Every day was warm and sunny. Not too hot, not too cold, etc., etc., etc. By the end of that time I was climbing the walls. The day I left I saw storm clouds on the horizon and I was thrilled! Finally, a change! Eating the same food every day is incredibly boring even if it's your favorite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I came across a legitimate study one time (peer reviewed research) that claimed that northern colder climates always resulted in more productive and industrious populations historically whereas southern warmer climates were less productive both through industry and economy. Seems to generally hold up but I don't remember the exact arguments they made. Just pointing out that there's some validity to your point about the weather. </p></div>		</li>
