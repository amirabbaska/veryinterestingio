			<div class="markdown"><p>Another important thing to keep in mind is that the way Tibetan Buddhism is expressed in the west (post exile) is very different from how it was expressed pre-Chinese take-over in Tibet.</p>
<p>Tibet was a <a href="http://www.swans.com/library/art9/mparen01.html" target="_blank">very feudal society</a> with the monks at the top.  It does not make what China did right in any way, but it is important to know that, like pretty much every religion, there was a lot of bad stuff going on in Tibet.  After the exile Tibetan Buddhists heavily re-branded themselves and started paying a bit more attention to some of the core tenants of their religion rather than taking advantage of the benefits of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're saying this as if they had outside help in reforming their religion, and it wasn't something that they naturally wanted to do for themselves when they were no longer living with scarce food at the top of a mountain.</p>
<p>Feudalism is an excellent system for dealing with scarcity. We who live in an age of endless plenty simply think that people were evil in the past or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Feudalism is <strong>a</strong> system for dealing with scarcity, but it is far from an <em>excellent</em> system for doing so.  Feudalism is typically a strongman approach and often increases scarcity for the majority while reliving it for the minority who are in power.</p>
<p>If you read the text and look into what happened when Tibetan Buddhists first came out of Tibet it seems pretty clear that an outside influence and no-longer being the top dogs did indeed have a pretty major part in reformatting the religion.</p>
<p>Your &quot;top of the mountain&quot; statement shows that you're taking a somewhat idealized view of how and where they lived.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah! I basically wrote this, too.</p>
<p>I agree that Tibetan Buddhism is pretty weird compared to other types of Buddhism. It can also be really secretive, which I think feeds the Orientalist stereotype people have of Buddhism and Asian religions in general. The misconception often is that they have some deep spiritual secrets that will save us while we have all the logic and science. </p>
<p>Of course, I think the people who say that haven't tried to read Buddhist philosophy. That stuff is a trip.</p>
<p>Anyway...thanks for your comment. I really appreciate how you explained it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A big part of the secrecy, from what I understand, is because of their vajrayana teachings, or 'lightning-vehicle' which is the fast and dangerous vehicle to enlightenment. The teachings are considered dangerous for people with frail psyches because it centers very much on not simply destroying your ego (as in classic, early reductionist buddhism) but using your desires to reshape your ego into one more aligned with the ego of an enlightened being, such as Avalokiteshvara, or some other bodhisattva perhaps. It's dangerous because some people have psychotic break downs, so the monks are cagey about talking about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that and many non-Buddhists who don't even understand what meditation is, will come to India searching to practice Vajrayana and really pester the monks about this because they heard it was cool and think it will cure them or something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, Tibetan Buddhism is Tantric Buddhism. Its a bit different.    </p>
<p>I think wikipedia describes it best: Vajrayana is a complex and multifaceted system of Buddhist thought.    </p>
<p>It's a very broad tradition. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are three main schools of Buddhism:</p>
<p>Theravada, which is seen as the more traditional Buddhism, is practiced mainly in south Asia and relies on the original Pali texts. It emphasises simple meditation practice to attain enlightenment.</p>
<p>Mahayana, which is mainly practiced in east Asia, is a more literary Buddhism with a vast cosmology, using tales of deities to demonstrate the values of the Buddha. It emphasises the Bodhisattva ideal of helping others to achieve enlightenment before yourself, and tends to be a little more ritualistic and colourful with influences from other regional folk religions.</p>
<p>Vajrayana, which is mainly practiced in Tibet and Bhutan, is tantric Buddhism. This basically means it is more 'magical' in nature. Many teachings are kept secret, and some practices include guru yoga (devoting yourself to a teacher), dream yoga (lucid dreaming as a means to enlightenment), deity yoga (a visualisation practice where you visualise a particular deity until it becomes in some sense 'real', and then merging with it), amongst others.</p></div>		</li>
