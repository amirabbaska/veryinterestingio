			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Mice lacking telomerase and having short telomeres, especially if they experience DNA damage, can die of telomere crisis-induced organ failure in the absence of any &quot;disease.&quot; Does this happen in humans? In short, we don't really know because we can't tell if someone died of that or not. But, the mouse data suggests that it is at least possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting, never knew that. What's the mechanism that causes short or lacking of telomerase to induce  organ failures?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When telomeres are too short they can induce all sorts of problems during mitosis including loss of whole chromosomes and complex translocations (parts of chromosomes swapping places with other chromosomes). If this happens too often, the cell can undergo a &quot;genomic catastrophe&quot; leading to cell death. This could be exaggerated by DNA damage from radiation or other sources or perhaps defects in other genes. If this happens enough and in enough critical cells, it could create a domino effect of organ failure. My guess is that this is extremely rare in humans just because of how easy it is to die from other things first, but you never know...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DNA damage can force early cell division or just knock off telomeres.  Most likely this is only known because it was specifically being studied, hence the issue with humans being a lack of data.</p></div>		</li>
