			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fairly logical, so my question then shifts to why the other image-hosts need to use so many characters for their image URL's?  If a seven character URL opens up more single combinations than they have images posted, having five times that seems...useless.  Likewise with the capitalization aspect, there's more possible combinations than images have ever been produced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing, which might not even be intended, is the ability to remember a url. One such example from the aforementioned gfycat, which uses combination of 3 words: <a href="http://gfycat.com/NippyKindLangur" target="_blank">http://gfycat.com/NippyKindLangur</a> , which has become so famous (in certain social circles) that tons of people know that phrase and relate it to that specific gif and can recall it from the top of their head. Even up to the point that when Redeye (the person on the gif) lampshaded it by stating those three words himself, gfycat gave the gif of that the url <a href="http://gfycat.com/BrutalSavageRekt" target="_blank">http://gfycat.com/BrutalSavageRekt</a>. </p>
<p>Same applies to sites that allow users to choose their own custom urls, like bit.ly. Sure, you can generate the shortest url possible, but you can also shorten an url to a very easily remembered string of words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's definitely why gfycat uses words instead of random characters.</p>
<p>Random characters, for computers, is easiest.  Words are easiest for humans.  Making what's essentially a number memorable for humans means combining the two.  If you have a dictionary of 10,000 words, that means by picking one, you basically have a single digit of a base 10,000 number, which computers don't really care what base it is because unless it's base 2, they'll have to convert anyway.</p>
<p>There's a similar principle with bitcoin private keys.  24 words with a specific wordlist is enough to generate a bitcoin private key, which looks like this (in hexadecimal)*:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E9 87 3D 79 C6 D8 7D C0 FB 6A 57 78 63 33 89 F4 45 32 13 30 3D A6 1F 20 BD 67 FC 23 3A A3 32 62</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or as a simple decimal number:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>105627842363267744400190144423808258002852957479547731009248450467191077417570</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which would probably be hard to remember, however there's a way to re-create a bitcoin :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>wasp junior chest front section panther spirit remove gate wire best pelican consider hundred until unhappy desert multiply athlete whisper universe skill regret pudding</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Create a story with those words and you can have it memorized within 20 minutes, I'm sure.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's a (wasp) on a bus.  He has a (junior chest) filled with wizard spells.  Sitting in the (front section), he summons a (panther spirit) to (remove gate wire) so the bus can make it through to the (best pelican) watching spot.  When he gets there, he meets a wise monk.  The monk says &quot;(consider hundred until unhappy)&quot;.  The wasp uses a spell and transports him to a (desert) because the monk's an idiot.  The wasp gets bored of being alone and decides to (multiply).  As he's copying himself, an (athlete) wasp sees this and decides to (whisper) the secret of the (universe) to the wizard wasp.  Suddenly, his (skill) is gone.  With (regret), he gets back on the bus for lunch and eats his (pudding).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as /u/Ponea mentioned, this is very similar to XKCD's &quot;correcthorsebatterystaple&quot; password comic.</p>
<p>* technically bitcoin keys can be any 256-bit number, and can be generated from as little as a single character, but as you may be able to guess, these keys are not secure since the result is the same for anyone generating a key from the same characters.  That's why you let the computer choose the random number, then it makes the word list out of it and you memorize it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may just be that they don't care about the length of the URL. They may also want to make it difficult to &quot;guess&quot; a URL that leads to a valid picture. If you use something like a 30 character code, the number of valid image URLs in relation to invalid URL means that you can't find an image unless you have a URL. It's a basic level of  preventing other sites from cataloguing all the images by trying all the possibilities.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>One potential reason is that, if they want to allow for people to put up private images that are only shared by that person sharing the link with others, then they need to make it very, <em>very</em> unlikely that entering in random characters will yield a valid URL.  Using a longer URL pretty much ensures that no one will ever be able to find anyone else's private images.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The protocol and dns name (<a href="https://i.imgur.com" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com</a>) are case insensitive because that's the standard. Those tell your computer which server to talk to and in what language. From there, it's up to the server as to whether or not it cares about case. IIS isn't case sensitive, whereas most other web servers are unless the framework or developer adds logic to make it not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>3.5216146e+12. Couldnt even begin to understand this one. What does the &quot;e&quot; mean? and why the plus 12?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't want to be rude or anything but you're meant to learn exponents in primary school or whatever they call below 8th Grade.</p>
<p>Edit: What country are you from if I may ask?</p>
<p>The small 7 after 62 is an exponent. So 62^7 is 62x62x62... and so on, 7 times. The base is 62 and the power is 7.</p>
<p>The 'e' at the end of the number is also an exponent but in this case is always base 10. So example: 9.88e+2 (Base 10 to the power of 2) is 9.88x10^2 which is 988.</p>
<p>9.88e-2 would be 9.88x10^-2 which is 0.0988.       </p>
<p>Edit: As for making small numbers. That's just formatting on Reddit. You can make anything small by using a caret (the hat triangle thing ^ ). E^x^a^m^p^l^e.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the UK. I also have no idea what an exponent is. I kid you not, I really am this dim, assuming all this number stuff is common knowledge. My education was more about trying to keep myself safe than actually learning anything. It might also explain why the UK has what is called &quot;Jobcentre Plus&quot; and the USA has NASA.
Thanks for the explanation, I understand the power thing. Its actually simple enough.</p>
<p>Altho the + and - thing after the &quot;e&quot; seem to mean x and ÷. What you did was 9.88e+2 = 988. So the E equals 10 to the power of 2. I thought the x (multiply) symbol would be used. I seem to get the gist of it tho.</p></div>		</li>
