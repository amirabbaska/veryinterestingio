5 - Pursuant 2., the muscles in your legs are large and produce a lot of heat while working. Even a very well developed bicep will be small compared to calf size, much less the large muscles of the thighs.</p>
<p>This still isn't an excuse to skip leg day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honest to god freezing is warm in Minnesota. When it is f-ing cold (think -15F to -35F), we wear at least three layers on our legs if we are doing anything more than running to/from vehicles.  Those 3 layers are thermals, sweats/trousers, and then snow pants (think jacket for your legs). </p></div>		</li>

<p>It is harder to layer clothing on your legs, because of shoes, etc. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coats are easy to take off, thermal undies not so much. I'd say your argument applies more to things like snow pants, which are still harder to take off than a coat due to shoes but fashion is likely the primary driver as to why we don't see them much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the real answer is just 3. My legs get cold af and I would love if pant-jackets were socially acceptable but they're simply impractical and would look ridiculous so people make do without. They even technically exist via ski pants but due to aforementioned issues you don't see people walking around with ski pants on all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get thin, breathable rain pants that have a zipper on the legs so easy to put on over shoes, and that are packable (they stuff into their own back pocket). For me they add about 30 degF warmth and I wear thin fleece pants under them to 0 degF.  Thick fleece (200 weight) pants under them for colder.</p></div>		</li>
