			<div class="markdown"><p>Thermodynamically the biggest effect is that when you cut the crystal in half, you lose the energy associated with bonds between the two pieces. Think of it this way, when you take atoms in the gaseous state and you allow them to form a crystal you release heat. This is not a huge surprise since we know that crystal formation must be energetically favorable. This heat released upon crystallization is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy_of_sublimation" target="_blank">enthalpy of sublimation</a> (Hs) and it is roughly proportional to the number of bonds in the system. If you just consider nearest neighbor interactions, then the loss in energy is basically due to the loss of the component of Hs due to the bonds broken at the gap, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BRAIEws.png" target="_blank">as shown here</a>.</p>
<p>Now you also asked about entropy, but the effect there is much smaller. When you create a crystal from gaseous atoms you pay a price in terms of entropy due to the need to order the atoms more tightly. Of course, the enthalpy term still wins out so the process can still be energetically favorable overall. However, when you break a crystal in two pieces, the change in entropy will be rather small. The reason is that what you are left with are two crystalline chunks where the atoms are still very highly ordered. The situation is very different from ripping these atoms from the surface and allowing them to fly around in the gaseous phase.</p></div>		</li>

<p>By this you mean energy must be put into the bonds to break the crystal lattice, correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All surfaces (of any substance) have a high energy barrier between the inside and the external gas or vacuum.  Contacting the surface together in cold welding reduces the barriers on both surfaces so it reduces the energy of the system.  </p>
<p><a href="http://img.tfd.com/mgh/cep/thumb/Diagram-of-the-energylevel-scheme-for-field-emission-from-a-metal.jpg" target="_blank">Metal-Vacuum Energy Diagram</a></p>
<p>With air or other gas, there is usually a surface layer that alters the barrier either as adsorbed atoms or by chemical reaction which prevents the re-assembly and reduction of the barrier energy.  </p>
<p>I haven't done the math to confirm but it's quite possible that you need to be able to tunnel atoms (which is a thing because matter can be particles or waves just like photons) which requires an especially clean surface to get closer enough for that (tunneling probability is proportional to barrier height and width).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For cold welding to work best you need clean crystalline bits to come to together in the right orientation. Outside of a vacuum other atoms and molecules can stick to either surface through adsorption, oxidation, etc. These impurities can then get in the way and prevent the two bits from cleanly fusing together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is because, as soon as you break the bonds a microscopical oxide layer forms on each respective part and hinders the bonding.</p>
<p>In a nutshell. This is why stainless steel and aluminium doesn't rust, these oxide layers form ridiculously fast and form a strong anti-corrosion layer.</p>
<p>P.S this is not the &quot;accurate&quot; way of describing it, but I´m lazy and it is the basics of it</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that it only takes place in a vacuum, it's that a vacuum is a clean environment which lends itself to electron sharing between metals (or really any substance likely to make <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_bond" target="_blank">metallic bonds</a>). There are simply no contaminants to get in the way.</p>
<p>At the same time, the reason why a solid chunk of metal stays together is also due to metallic bonds: without other particles getting in the way / stealing away electrons for themselves, the metallic atoms are free to share electrons with each other and only each other, thus forming an overall larger piece.</p></div>		</li>
