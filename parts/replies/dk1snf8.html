			<div class="markdown"><p>If I look as far right or left as possible, I also experience some discomfort. My focus seems to be a few feet away, so it doesn't seem to be something that would strain the lense muscles. Is this just a normal muscle stretching sensation, or is it something different?</p>
<p>EDIT: Forget to ask an actual question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a lazy eye I retrained to see straight, when I'm physically exhausted it starts to hurt so I close my eye to let it relax back to the side. I get the same pain when I cross my eyes for a few seconds, and feel the muscles tightening and tiring that normally keep my eye straight. Maybe it's the same muscle and humans are just not used to using it regularly so it hurts when people try it. </p>
<p>That's my best non doctor estimate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I know what you mean. I can hold my phone near my face but focus on the floor so that I see a partially doubled image of my phone and my brain wants to make part of the doubled image transparent but if I mentally focus on the phone then both images becomes solid. </p>
<p>I once dated a girl who said that the paper-towel tube &quot;hole in your hand&quot; optical illusion didn't work for her, I wonder if her doubled images were always solid when she had something near to her face but had her eyes focused further away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have both eyes open while looking through my camera's viewfinder, so I could see where I was pointing when I was zooming in, and depending on which part I was concentrating (either viewfinder or reality) the other part became a bit more transparent iirc. This isn't exactly the same, but it's the first thing that came in my mind when I thought about changeable transparency. But I can also change any nearer object's transparency when I'm focusing on the wall behind it. I don't do the thing with the camera anymore, because I got glasses now and it's kinda uncomfortable wearing them while looking through the viewfinder, so I wouldn't really see much with this method I used before... </p></div>		</li>

<p>Since these two muscles are conflicting, it can cause eye strain over time.</p>

<p><em>If you're not used to it.</em> As with any muscle in the human body, use of these muscles in ways it is not familiar with will result in at least some sort of discomfort. Extended usage will then start to cause &quot;muscle damage&quot;, just like in body building. It's tired, so it'll ache. But given enough rest, nutrition, and consistent exposure, it'll get used to it. Real quick, even.</p>
<p>If you know a person who has a 3DS or own a glassless 3D device and actually uses the 3D screens, give em a &quot;magic eye&quot; picture, they'll probably nail it immediately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using magic eye for binocular vision is difficult... for a lot of people it can be a processing/attentional issue but than again I worked in neurorehab (OT) so it was a very atypical setting for visual-perceptual therapy... i find using the Brock string to much more efficient plus you are training your eyes gradually and within a threshold. You wouldn't lift an 80 lb weight when you first lift.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>True, but then again you're comparing &quot;looking through a non-transparent surface&quot; against lifting 80lbs. Because that's all magic eye is - looking through a non-transparent surface. Tricking your brain to not focus on the surface of the page and instead focus <em>somewhere beyond it</em> in order for the images to align correctly and reveal the image hidden within its patterns.</p>
<p>It's not hard to do, but it requires that you know what you're doing. Kinda like playing the flute. The only hard part is how to trick your brain, because your brain will keep on attempting to focus on the surface that is clearly in front of it instead of &quot;through it&quot; or &quot;behind it&quot;.</p>
<p>Easiest trick I know of is to focus on a distant object and then bring your hand between that object and your eyes about a foot away without changing focus. Most people would instantly focus on the hands - unless they're farsighted, in which case they'd likely keep the distant focus since their eyes actually can't focus well on objects that near. Or if they're in a daze, where they have a relaxed gaze, in which case their focus is on a fixed point but very shallow, even unfocused entirely.</p>
<p>But yeah, I don't think that's 80lbs of lifting per se.</p></div>		</li>
