			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on - as I worked for a company that did this.</p>
<p>You have a brand. You sell brand to Target at wholesale price of $29.99. You have a very nice margin for both you and Target. </p>
<p>But Target asks, can we buy your product, remove your secret sauce, and rebrand your product as something less potent (ie detergent) ?</p>
<p>So we say, well removing this ingredient by 50% reduces our cost, so we'll sell it wholesale to you for $19.99 to rebrand. It works &quot;almost&quot; as good as ours.</p>
<p>Now we make money on two products. The process is similar except we put less chemicals so it costs us less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very true, most &quot;store brand&quot; products are close to name brand products but not exact. Many chain stores don't ask, they demand that suppliers sell them a re-branded cheaper product or they  will not buy the name brand.</p>
<p>Manufacturers will agree to make a product similar to the name brand but it will be missing a few things to get to the price the store is willing to pay.  Sometimes this means there is little difference and sometimes leaving out one little thing can make a huge difference to the product.  This is why some no name product tastes or works okay but others are complete crap, you just have to experiment to find out what works and what doesn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can definitely tell the difference in quality with some products, not so much on others. For example, it seems like with canned fruit, the name brand uses the best quality ingredients, while the store brand uses the &quot;rejects&quot; or whatever. Or with milk, the store brand seems to go bad a little sooner than the store brand, so it's probably missing a preservative or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah is a hit or miss how effective a store brand works. Target swiffer pads suck compared to Swiffer brand pads. The fluid not so much different - that I can tell at least. </p>
<p>Target toilet and regular paper towels were sometimes cheaper, not by much always, but were just as good as name brands. Plus you can get extra discount with cartwheel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's been a controversy of late in Australia where supermarkets (there are kind of two big chains competing at the moment, with another two kind of doing their own thing but not nearly as big) will offer big money deals to brands and say, &quot;We'll give you $x if you only sell in our stores.&quot; So they do. And then the supermarket sets up a separate deal to manufacture a competitive &quot;own brand&quot; product. And since the supermarket has the monopoly on that manufacturer, they then jack up the price of the competitor and lower their own brand product (since they have a bigger margin of error not having another distributor to work with).</p>
<p>You can almost do a timelapse of a store shelf these days: Known product, prominently placed; own brand item taking over the place of prominence; known product getting less shelf space; own brand item being the only one left.</p>
<p>It's not always done as a deal with the distributor, is what I'm getting at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's crazy when you need to go to IGA for proper choice. Although I see less of this switch to solely own brands at Woolies. Coles are rampant about it though...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You left off a fairly important point, and that is quality levels.</p>
<p>With your cookies, what you forgot to mention is that they help maintain the high end brand by selecting only the best cookies from the line.   No flat corners or slightly wrong mixes or off center drizzle lines here.</p>
<p>But why waste those perfectly edible cookies?   People expect less from the cheaper brands, so that off center drizzle batch can go in one.   That mix with a slightly too high wheat content, making it taste a little grainier, can go as the store brand.  Those ones that came out flat cornered can sell as generics.</p>
<p>This winds up saving/making them even more monney, as items discarded by QA for minor reasons still get to be sold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly right, I was thinking about adding this but I felt it got a bit long. They do the same thing with graphics cards and CPU's btw. a 7700k is only a &quot;luckier&quot; version of the 7700 that's being produced on the same wafer. A duo core is just a broken quad core (most of the time). It's very very common for quad cores not to work, they get turned off permanently and sold as lower priced duo cores.</p>
<p>The rate of failure (for intel) is known in advance and the manufacturing conditions are set to correspond with expected sales per quality level. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The term for this is a &quot;factory second.&quot; There's this really fucking fancy pottery place in Vermont my wife likes. We only buy seconds, because usually the defect is on the underside. Then we go to the Cabot cheese factory, and buy a gigantic vacuum pack bag of cheddar cheese that isn't a perfect square. Same principle</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its interesting you said that because I like the Chips Ahoy! Crunchy cookies. Once I bought the same name brand and everything looked the same on the packaging, but I bought it from Amazon instead of my local store and I didn't like the cookies as much. I sware it tasted different and had a different mouth feel. So it wasn't even a generic brand, everything was the same except the cookies inside. Does that happen or did I just happen to get a dud package from Amazon or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happens to me with Oreos all the time, probably because we shop at different grocery stores depending on what sales are going on. Sometimes I get the ones that properly absorb milk and turn into a satisfying mush after a few seconds. Sometimes I get the ones that never seem to absorb anything and remain dry and crunchy after being submerged for several minutes. I can never keep track of which store sells which.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, usually the brand will have higher standards for their own products, and lower these standards in agreement with the store brand.</p>
<p>It's not complicated switching the stamp, nor is it complicated switching to lower-quality chocolate chips.</p></div>		</li>
