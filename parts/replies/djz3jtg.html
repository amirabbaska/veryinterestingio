<p>I see a few mentions of gamification here but I’m going to advocate a different perspective. Particularly, I think gamification (i.e. the reward) isn’t accurate because people don’t do things for the rewards- they don’t expect to get upvoted. Well sometimes we do, but we usually don’t and we shouldn’t. I’ll expand on that point more, below. The question then becomes why do we keep posting?</p>

<p>I don't think you fully understand what Gamification is within current academic literature. </p>
<p>'Gamification' is simply the application of game design elements in non-game contexts (Deterding definition, most widely cited since 2011). The focus of that application can be on short term engagement campaigns (done through the use of elements designed around extrinsic rewards) or the facilitation of long-term engagement (through increased affordances for intrinsic motivation). Gamification focuses on neither innately but, is open to both. </p>
<p>SDT is also just one of the many theories which guide the application of gamification. Others being 'Flow', player typologies/taxonomies (Yee, Bartle, etc), JDR model, Caillois work on 'paidia/ludus' the list goes on. </p>
<p>You're vastly underselling the complexity of human motivation by suggesting that SDT in isolation can explain why people care (or not) about 'upvotes'. </p></div>		</li>

<p>while it may appear this way, gamification actually reduces all those attributes for me. Gamification as implemented today reduces my agency, not increases it. I dont want a play a game in order to access functions of my computer. I want my computer to be flat and static.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You took alot of care to write this &amp; I appreciate the level of education behind it. However I think beleiving it is solely intrinsic motivation where there is clearly a reward/praise based system implemented to contribute to some ones motivation to type cannot be ignored. Extrinsic motivation needs to be given its credit here as there is an 'Extrinsic behavior that is driven by external rewards such as money, fame, grades, and praise' that is definately going on. More often than not these types of motivation work in conjunction with one another.  Thanks for taking me back to my linguistics days! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Current gamification literature does not rely solely on SDT for this exact reason. In fact, I would suggest that he has fundamentally misunderstood what 'gamification' actually is. </p>
<p>The best definition we have currently is one offered by Deterding (2011) &quot;The use of game design elements in non-game contexts&quot;. The most important thing to take away from this definition is that 'elements' occur at various levels of abstraction. They can be the use of certain mechanics, design principles, heuristics or lenses. It is not the rigid application of points, badges or other types of extrinsic rewards but, instead is the application of a process to induce 'gameful' experiences. Without going into what a gameful experience entails (if you're curious google caillios work on paidia/ludus), the goal is, in general, to facilitate engagement. </p>
<p>The type of engagement is very much dependant on the application of gamification but, it is not uncommon for gamification to be used as a short term engagement tool for marketing campaigns (usually reliant on elements which focus on extrinsic rewards) as well as, a long term engagement tool (through elements which increase affordances for intrinsically motivating experiences).</p>
<p>I guess the TLDR version is : Gamification is a process of enhancing engagement through the application of extrinsic rewards and intrinsic value (depending on the context/goals of its application).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He did say it was his personal opinion before the explanation in his defense. Sorta agree with him because one of the reasons we believe an upvote is a &quot;reward&quot; is because it's a proof of our own competence
or value we add depending on the context. Competence in making someone laugh or explaining something. The upvote comes later but the contribution is driven by either altruism so some complex form of self-validation or seeking validation. I guess it's probably a mix of all these factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate your point re: extrinsic motivation needing to be given its due as an additional motivator. Generally, I agree with the author in that I'm a big fan of SDT in its value toward explaining continued participation in point-based activities. But that doesn't mean that extrinsic rewards don't play a role. </p>
<p>I think it's important to acknowledge that the reason why long term users post on Reddit (or on Snapchat, I assume) is not for points. I emphasize &quot;long term&quot; here because intrinsic motivation is required to feel enough enjoyment to continue the behavior in the long term. If the user is solely completing the behavior for extrinsic rewards, it is likely that they would not continue the behavior in the long term simply because they do not find it fulfilling enough (due to not receiving the intrinsic satisfaction previously described). </p>
<p>It is also worth noting that users may initially begin participating on Reddit due to a desire to receive these extrinsic rewards, such as a desire for points. I'm guessing that, in this scenario, the user wouldn't purely be seeking points but more so what the points mean, i.e. internet fame, social rewards, or something else. Regardless, after contributing to Reddit for some time, they may find participating to be intrinsically satisfying and find their motivations shift from being externally- to intrinsically-based. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well extrinsic rewards lead to a decrease in a behavior, loss of enjoyment, and poor performance.  There's quite a bit of research showing that, so it can't exactly be the case.  Autonomy, competence, and relatedness in some sense can be thought of as a reward, except it's not a 'contingent reward' and people are guaranteed the reward beforehand, so they can't really be posting just for that reward.  These things can promote continued behavior because it feels good to make fun of OP's mom, to show you know what you're talking about, to get upvoted, etc.  So yes, in a sense, these are rewarding, they feel good, but they are not purely extrinsic.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, nickel and diming my payments at work may decrease my performance, but I also will work a harder, or show up at all, when the pay is good enough.</p></div>		</li>
