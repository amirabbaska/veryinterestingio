			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm wondering the same about Otters. I've heard it said that their vision is a little blurry out of the water. I've also heard stories that seem to support this, like otters accidentally walking close to humans after coming from the water and then being surprised by their presence as if their vision was suspect, but I always wondered if it was true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am even less knowledgeable regarding tetrapod vision, but <a href="http://what-when-how.com/marine-mammals/vision-marine-mammals/" target="_blank">I found this</a> while looking for information about sea otter vision.  It suggests that their eyes are more similar to terrestrial eyes.  Their visual limitations are probably due to other factors not related to the visual challenges faced by cetaceans seeing through air.</p></div>		</li>
