			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a physiology degree and think this is a fantastic explanation. I believe it clearly explains what's going on without getting overly detailed. Well done my friend. </p>
<p>One thing also is the psychological aspect too. Living with low grade inflammation all the time will lead to an even more sedentary lifestyle and depending on the person more comfort seeking in food. Unhappiness with oneself can cause increased cortisol which will lead to more weight gain, especially around the mid section. Being sedentary for long periods of time makes it harder to get moving again as well. For example, why they start physical therapy as soon as possible after a surgery. Sitting in bed for a month doesn't do anyone any favors. So, being extremely overweight can lead to a prison of obesity where getting out just keeps getting harder and harder. </p>
<p>So between the continual inflmmataion and pain, atrophy in muscles and stress on joints which causes more pain when people attempt to get active, and the accompanying depression when attempts to get healthy fail can really result in a nasty spiral. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also good data to show that inflammation is a major contributor to dementia.</p>
<p>I'm surprised that the top commenter was able to so succinctly sum up the benefits. You could write books about this topic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's good data that to show inflammation is related to a lot of different conditions. Inflammation is a good defense against pathogens and damaged tissue, but as with anything -- too much of a good thing is not good.</p>
<p>Inflammation occurs when PAMPs (pathogen associated molecular patterns)  and DAMPs are detected by PRRs (pattern recognition receptors - basically receptors all over the body that detect things that don't belong). The cells that detect PAMPs and DAMPs release cytokines that attract other immune cells, such as IL-1, TNF, IFN-gamma.  Immune cells, chiefly neutrophils and M1 macrophages, are recruited to the site of infection or injury to trap foreign material,  ingest and/or destroy foreign material, further ramp up the inflammation, and/or process antigens to present them to naive T cells.</p>
<p>After PAMPs the and DAMPs are cleared out, the process of tissue repair begins. M2 macrophages are recruited and release IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, among other anti-inflammatory cytokines and promote tissue repair mechanisms and stop the inflammation.</p>
<p>The problem with having conditions that elicit continuous inflammation is that the PAMPs/DAMPs are never cleared out and the tissue repair phase of inflammation is never initiated. The first stage of inflammation can be quite aggressive and not only destroy foreign material, but self material as well (i.e. neutrophils release proteolytic enzymes that aren't specific to any protein, but all protein). This can exact considerable tissue damage and be very stressful for the body over long periods of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was one of the most profound effects of my personal weight loss. I was obese for about 9 years following a very difficult pregnancy and find in retrospect that my judgment, intellect, and reasoning were all impaired as consequences of maintaining an overwhelming amount of tissue. It impaired my movements both inside my mind and in the physical world and eroded my options and hope because in order to maintain safety at that weight I had to push myself into rigid circumstances. At some level I sensed this then, but I stayed too drained to address it for many years until I (in large part subconsciously) built and enacted a strategy to overcome it after I injured my back and just said “no more!” The execution was so sloppy at first it sparked some realizations  about why so many people, myself included, start that process over and over. Unique circumstances aligned to help me keep going, but it made me think how beneficial it would be to see weight loss from the state of obesity as a recovery process that is, like any other, delicate and benefits greatly from adequate support. </p></div>		</li>
