<p>Tell that to Dell. I've gone through 2 chargers in less than a year with my XPS 13. Then again, the screen has also died once, the keyboard had a broken button on delivery, and the laptop overheats so much (from Day 1) that the i7 is totally useless. I have never owned a worse laptop. Total junk. My colleagues with the same laptop have similar issues, so I can only assume all the positive magazine reviews are either bullshit or paid for </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually haven't had a laptop charger last significantly more than 2 years. I went through 3 chargers on my old HP in the 5 years I've used it (on the fourth for that laptop). I've also had the charger fail on my Asus less than two years after buying the laptop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm at the opposite end of this. I've been using laptops for about 15 years and never once had a charger fail on me. I usually keep each laptop 3-4 years</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's strange. Which model do you have? I have a Dell (I think 7000 series) for 7 months now, and it has been relatively fabulous. I spilled soft drink on it soon after purchase, they replaced the KB for free in two days. It has had a freezing issue twice in the last year, but both times I was guided through removing and reinserting the battery by the customer care. Quiet as a dead man too. They even understood when I explained how I had repartitioned the HDD and reinstalled Windows.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Asus I had before this had an issue where after one particular update, the screen switching off due to inactivity results in the whole screen flashing red. That was not fixed despite over a month at their service center. The fuckers even had the gall to reinstall stock windows and send it back, <em>despite me saying that a windows update caused it</em>. You can guess what happened when I updated it again. It couldn't boot anything from a USB either.</p>
<p>And the Lenovo I had before that had a screen which kept on coming loose from its housing, and Lenovo did not even bother to fix it. Same for the keyboard. The construction was not reflective of its high cost (hardware was top notch tho).</p></div>		</li>

<p>To me this sounds like a sarcastic way of saying &quot;customer support did absolutely nothing&quot;, but other than that you sound sincere. Can you elaborate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had one of their workstation models (Dell Precision M4800) for a few years (I think going on 4?) and it's been really amazing. No issues with the power cord despite traveling with it extensively and not always being the nicest to it. I've had some issues with the keyboard, but I bought the warranty and Dell professional support has been fucking incredible. The first time I had a problem, they shipped me a new one, no questions asked. The second time, they sent a tech out who ended up replacing the motherboard and they keyboard, no questions asked.</p>
<p>Contrast that with my old Acer laptop that I had to send back 5 times before they finally fucking listened to me. That was an absolute nightmare. I will never buy from them again. The worst communication from a company I have ever experienced and they were completely and totally incapable of properly doing a QA check on their own work on top of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, really? I've never noticed any issues with my XPS 13 and I've had it for all of this year. Sure, I've noticed my laptop getting warm sometimes but mainly only when I game on it(and you shouldn't anyway). I can't say quite the same as I've got the i5 with the Intel 620 graphics, but mine is performing fine for its job (uni)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, notebookcheck said the i5 actually performs faster than the i7 in the XPS 13 because of how poor its thermal design is. The i7 gets throttled down almost instantly..In my view that is completely unacceptable, seeing as how the i7 is significantly more expensive in order to BE faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. I’ve been using the same charger on my 2008 MacBook since, well, 2008. I’ve had to replace the battery, but the charger itself continues to work perfectly.</p></div>		</li>
