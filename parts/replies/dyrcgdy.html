			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple years ago, after my first northern winter (-30°f peak, -15°f average for the past few months, ~10°f past week or so) I flew to California to visit family for Easter</p>
<p>It averaged 70-80°f while I was there. I had my heater set between 55-60°f for the past 3-5 months</p>
<p>My first three days of the trip were miserable at best, starting and ending with cold showers, had heat exhaustion quite a bit too</p>
<p>When I flew back north, I missed spring and jumped right into the nice Midwestern 80% humidity at 60-80°f</p>
<p>I don't like flying between seasons anymore</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funnily enough, when I went down to Florida for vacation from Canada in January I absolutely loved it. A lot of people seem to hate the humidity, but it was nice not having to slather lotion every two hours or go through a chapstick a week. And my hair was silky smooth despite not using a drop of conditioner the whole time I was there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an Australian I can't comprehend that. 70-80 °F is only 21-27°C  which is nice Autumn or Spring weather. Heck it's the middle of Autumn now, heading into Winter, and it's 24-31°C all this week. 50-60°F are temperatures only for the darkest depths of Winter i.e. roughly 2 weeks in Australia haha. Anything lower would be in my coldest nightmares. It's currently 19°C (66°F) at 11:23 PM and it's cold so I'm wearing a long-sleeve shirt, a hoodie jumper, thick tracksuit pants, long socks, and wool ugg boots. Any colder and I start blasting the heater</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I'll have a crack based on my own knowledge (I've got a Zoology degree).</p>
<p>Humans are relatively recent migrants to most of the places in the world where hibernation is seen in the mammals there.</p>
<p>We are evolutionarily distinct from those mammals, at a point before hibernation developed, as we are a late comer to that habitat, and our origin is in Africa, a place where a bigger concern would be having 'too much sun' rather than 'not enough'. </p>
<p>We are adapted to produce our own vitamin D because it's an energetically cheap method, when you can use sunlight which is plentiful and 'free'. Other animals such as deep sea dwellers, or those with thick dense fur, do not produce vitamin d because the light is not enough, they must obtain it by diet, which is makes it more difficult to obtain but is the 'best' method for that situation.</p>
<p>Therefore I think it's safe to say that Seasonal affective disorder is only a hangover from vestigial traits in that we still rely on a method to produce vitamin d which is most effective in a different habitat to the one humans in low light conditions occupy now. We are working with tools that were made for a different situation, and those tools fail when we don't have the proper resources to use them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I looked this up once and found <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/life-sciences/biological-anthropology-and-primatology/seasonality-primates-studies-living-and-extinct-human-and-non-human-primates?format=PB" target="_blank">Seasonality in Primates: Studies of Living and Extinct Human and Non-Human Primates</a>. It's pretty rare in primates, only seen among strepsirrhini, which are small primates like lemurs. It's hard to know if an ancient hominid hibernated because that wouldn't show up in fossil evidence, but if we try to infer based on related modern primates, it would have been very far back. Strepsirrhini diverged from other primates pretty far back (55 million years ago ish). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, your mitochondria actually decreases in efficiency during the winter. Now I'll explain. The mitochondria provides a lot of energy to the cell through the electron transport chain (fun fact: plants chloroplast also have this). What happens is the mitochondria produces an electron/proton gradient in it, by letting the electrons escape by using the motor-like ATP synthase, the electrons &quot;spin the motor&quot; as they attempt to get away from the negative charge of their side to the positive charge of the other (this generates energy for the cell).</p>
<p>HOWEVER, mammals have something pretty cool. They have these little pores in the mitochondria that allow electrons to escape, but they don't produce chemical energy for the cell. Well, if the cell can't use these electron movement for energy what's the point? Well, the first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, yet these electrons are losing potential energy, so some energy change must be happening. </p>
<p>The truth is, by letting electrons escape through the pores, the electrons release heat energy. Remember how mammals can keep a near constant body temp? This is why. Now, I'm not 100% sure if more pores are created or if the mitochondria becomes less efficient, allowing more electrons to escape (some drugs actually do decrease mitochondria efficiency, leading to the person's body temperature going up), but one of these two occur in winter time, allowing the body to produce more heat.</p>
<p>TLDR: You're mitochondria changes in the winter to be less efficient so that you produce more body heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sources? afaik electron leakage has primarily to do with production of ROS and consequent oxidative damage--you're most likely thinking of <em>proton</em> leakage as a result of uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis but its pattern of expression has mostly to do with species-dependent prevalence of brown fat tissue that greatly diminishes with age, not seasonal changes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to read more about this look up &quot;brown fat&quot;. It's a type of adipose cell that, IIRC, has a higher concentration of the mitochondria you describe, and as such have a higher basal metabolic rate/heat production.</p>
<p>Fun facts: babies have a relatively high amount of brown fat to keep them warm (because they don't have the muscle mass yet to adequately keep them warm). It decreases in adults but it is directly influenced by outside temperatures: studies have shown taking daily cold showers increase the amount of brown fat you have.</p>
<p>Tbh I was fairly surprised nobody mentioned this yet... </p></div>		</li>
