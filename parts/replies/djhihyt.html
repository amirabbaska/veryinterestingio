			<div class="markdown"><p>Primitive mammals such as otters during the post-cambrian era evolved emotions as a way to convey messages among groups without the need of verbal communication, making it easier for the otters to stalk their prey and guarantee a meal for the day. These emotions have progressed over billions of years which has lead to humans having an intertwined connection between emotion and facial expression due to being so deeply embedded into our DNA. Think of it as the primitive mammals developed emotions as a foundation which modern mammals have built upon causing it to be engraved in our very being.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Otters are definitely <em>not</em> primitive mammals. They are within the family Mustelidae (weasel family) within the order Carnivora, which didn't radiate from most of the other major placental mammal lineages until after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction. And while it did technically occur after the Cambrian period, we're talking about a very big gap in time between the Cambrian and the Paleogene, as in almost all of the Paleozoic era and all of the Mesozoic era (close to 400 million years). Mammals themselves appeared in the late Triassic period in the early Mesozoic, but that's still a gigantic time gap between both the Cambrian and the Paleogene.</p></div>		</li>
