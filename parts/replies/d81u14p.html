			<div class="markdown"><p>to add to this, certain configurations are much more unstable than others. so if you're just adding stuff together there is a good chance that items will decay, especially at the larger end of the size spectrum. so for larger atoms, people need to figure out how to jump to &quot;islands of stability&quot; where we can potentially have a useful atom that doesn't decay in nanoseconds</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great question, which is really tricky to answer. I'll give it a go, though. </p>
<p>The periodic table is a really amazing tool. There's a TON of information there, if you know how to read it. You can see the atomic number (the number of protons in the atom), usually an integer below and to the left of the letters, and atomic mass (the number of protons and neutrons in a typical atom of that element) is at the top left, and is usually <em>not</em> a whole number. </p>
<p>What gives? Why isn't atomic weight a whole number?</p>
<p>Jump now to the chart of the nuclides. This shows the known isotopes of the elements, as well as how often and in what way they decay.</p>
<p>Decay is (largely) due to how the neutrons and protons fit together inside the nucleus. A guy named Seaborg (there's an element named after him for this) theorized that there are discrete arrangements inside the nucleus that have different intrinsic stability. This makes sense in a philosophical way- every time we look more closely we find order, and that order has implications- but it was really amazing how he figured it out.</p>
<p>Anywho, those arrangements can be more stable or less stable. Let's go back to the periodic table. </p>
<p>The lower rows- not the Lanthanides and Actinides which are separate at the bottom, but all the mysterious ones at the bottom of the main body- are  cosmically weird. We don't find them naturally, but all the rules that the periodic table hints at says that they should be at least theoretically possible. So, tying in OPs question, we try to make them. Problem is, we know they have to be super duper unstable based on their nuclear arrangements- millionths of a second unstable. So we crunch the numbers based on Seaborg's (and brilliant others') work to try to find something that will last long enough to actually observe. </p>
<p>The places where this relative stability is calculated are our &quot;islands of stability.&quot;</p>
<p>Let me know if that helps!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to all of this, all the regular elements you know and love are obviously pretty damn stable. If you can shoot protons (hydrogen) and at each other in an accelerator, in theory you could create any element on the periodic table. Of course, the yield is going to be stupidly low. From brute force fusion, you can start walking up the periodic table. Of course, firing heavier elements at each other probably has a better chance of moving backward down the  periodic table than farther up it, so it's going to take a very long time. </p>
<p>Who knows though, give it a few centuries and we might be creating matter from empty vacuum. It's still going to be a costly endeavor energy wise though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically it's interaction between the strong nuclear force and electrostatics. At very small distances, the SNF is powerful enough to overcome the magnetic repulsion between protons, but as nuclei get larger the SNF becomes more and more inadequate at holding them together and clusters of protons and neutrons begin to escape the nucleus in the form of alpha particles, which is a helium nucleus stripped of its electrons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a routine occurrence. Many large hospitals own and operate their own cyclotrons to create radioisotopes for nuclear medicine. </p>
<p>The Fluorine-18, used as a positron-source in Fludeoxyglucose for PET scans, can be created either by bombarding Neon-20 with protons or more commonly water containing Oxygen-18 with deuterons.  </p>
<p>Radioactive decay is nothing more than elements transmuting into lower, more stable forms. Since Technetium-99m used in gamma scans has a half-life of about six hours, radioisotopes are shipped to hospitals in generators that produce it through the radioactive decay of molybdenum-99. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that <em>fission</em>, splitting atoms, helium into two hydrogen?</p>
<p>Fusion reaction from hydrogen bomb doesn't really illustrate the amount of energy needed to make a new molecule because it is making billions of molecules. There is not one giant explosion with a single or handful helium atoms left over as a result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the suggestion he was making (which isn't quite true, but close enough) was that the energy required for fusion is roughly equivalent to the energy released by fusion. thus you need a nuclear explosion level of energy to create particles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Either way, no. A standard nuclear bomb/atomic bomb is fission of either uranium or plutonium, not helium. A hydrogen bomb explosion is caused by the fusion of hydrogen atoms, and it really does show the energy needed to make new molecules because it takes a regular fission bomb to initiate the fusion process.</p></div>		</li>
