<p>The ball would be much heavier than the sun, as the sun is mostly plasma and humans are mostly solids, even off-setting the smaller volume. Humanity would be crushed into a slurry as gravity pushes us together, heating up and splitting us into our constituent atoms, the heavier of which would congregate at the core, and the lighter elements in rings around. Seeing as humans contain considerable amount of water, and thus hydrogen, in addition to a lot of other fusion-viable elements and only a tiny amount of non-fusionviable elements, the resultant mass would likely ignite into fusion and become a star.</p>
<p>EDIT: I've been corrected by u/N8CCRG , seems that the density of the sun is greater than that of humans. The total mass is still fuseable though, as its above the <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/06/11/the_brown_dwarf_limit_astronomers_have_found_the_smallest_star_known.html" target="_blank">brown dwarf limit</a>. But this is why un-sourced non-expert answers can be bad, I suppose.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's true, but this takes into account the whole volume of the Sun, including the non-fusing outer layers. A bit unfair to the hard-working core, but technically correct.</p>
<p>Another comparison: it's the same volumetric heat production rate as a lukewarm heap of compost slowly rotting in your backyard.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And the sun is underestimated by a lot of folks in it's ability to hang onto it's heat. Aside from the light given off by the fusion process, the sun's atmosphere loses excrss heat through the same slow process of black body radiation that makes keeping spaceships cool a problem</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blackbody radiation isn't inherently slow.  In particular the power emitted via blackbody radiation is proportional to T^(4), as compared to transfer via conduction which is proportional to just T.  So yes, at low temperatures blackbody radiation is slow, but as you heat up blackbody radiation becomes extremely fast.  The problem is the temperature at which spaceships like to operate (human temperature ranges) is pretty low.</p>
<p>If the total power production inside the sun doubled, the surface temperature would only increase by about 19% (2^(1/4)), because of how quickly blackbody radiation scales with temperature.  Put another way, if total power production of the sun increased by a factor of 100, surface temperature would only increase by about a factor of 3.</p></div>		</li>
