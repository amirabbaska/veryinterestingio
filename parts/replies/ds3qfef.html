			<div class="markdown"><p>By definition, charges can move freely in a metal. When the microwaves (composed of oscillating electric and magnetic fields) hit the metal, then these electric fields in the microwaves accelerate the electrons in the metal. This can lead to a separation of the positive and negative charges (essentially all electrons are on one side of the material leaving positive ions on the other side), if this is large enough, then sparks occur to neutralize the object (actually similar to process of lighting on a smaller scale). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. What then, makes this lighting 'bad' in the context of heating up food?</p>
<p>What's detrimental about your food being heated surrounded by tiny lightning bolts in an aluminium tray?</p>
<p>Is it bad for the food, or the microwave, or only bad for the tray?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lighting won't really heat up your food, it will burn it. It also won't heat up your food entirely, only pretty much the surface.
I accidentally did this before, and the food gets this plasma flavor that doesn't taste too good.
The aluminum also fries in the process, burning and also shrinking, which then compresses your food.
The microwave wave's circuits can and will also get fried, damaging it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure of all the physics, but one time I accidentally microwaved food wrapped in tin foil and there were arcs of electricity between it and the microwave, which ended up with burnt spots even in the few seconds between turning it on and rushing to turn it back off again.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh yeah, I mean, I've seen it. I've even microwaved CDs for the purpose of destroying them. I just don't know why it happens. What is it about metal that makes it so incompatible with being heated in this way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's because the magnetron uses strong and rapid magnetic oscillations to vibrate food molecules. But in the case of metals it makes the electrons move around and sometimes arc over the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to defrost frozen capri suns in the microwave for a slushy as a kid knowing full well not to put metal in there. Worked a few times until i heard the popping and looked in to see a small lightning storm and was like oh fuck! Oops...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assumed the Microwave Radiation might bounce off the metal;  Possibly change shape (frequently, amplitude);  Then pass through the door, harming people outside the microwave oven.  I'm not sure if this is true.  I know the inside of the microwave is made out of metal but it's shaped nice to keep the microwave radiation inside the microwave oven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you don't have to worry about any of that.  The metal screen blocks the microwave radiation from escaping.  The wavelength of microwave radiation is much larger than the holes in the metal window screen, so it is not able to pass through the holes at all.</p>
<p>The radiation won't be altered by bouncing off surfaces, just like light isn't altered by bouncing off a mirror.</p>
<p>The real danger is the fire hazard created by sparks that arc from points on the metal.</p></div>		</li>
