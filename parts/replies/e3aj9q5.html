			<div class="markdown"><p>I can try:</p>
<p>F=G Mm/r^2 is wrong. </p>
<p>It's very nearly right and in almost every use will get you very very close to the exact answer, but it's not quite right (nonetheless almost everyone can get away using it because either something else will give you bigger errors first or you don't care enough about the difference). In fact this is true of almost all of Newton's mechanics (maths of how things move).</p>
<p>According to Newtonian mechanics, light should not bend because of gravity at all, and instances where light bends are proof that there must be a more accurate description of what is happening.</p>
<p>Einstein made some more accurate descriptions with his theories of relativity, but they can't really be ELI5ed.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the notion that everything in the universe with mass is pulling on/interacting with everything else with mass even just the smallest amount still true? I remember learning that in high school and been saying it for years. But if the Newtonian equation isn’t exactly right then I don’t know what backs up that notion anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's still basically true. More precisely, everything in the universe with mass or energy is affecting the curvature of spacetime everywhere, which affects how other things move through space (whether or not they have mass).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is really just a result of what mass does to space. Mass squeezes space together, like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg" target="_blank">bowling ball pressing down on a trampoline</a>.</p>
<p>When light goes through &quot;squeezed space,&quot; its path will curve. (At least, it's curved to an outside observer.) This is exactly what happens to you or me when we get close to a massive object, like the earth. We're in a part of space being squeezed by the mass of the earth, so we stick closer to it.</p>
<p>Newton thought that gravity was an invisible force that made massive objects get closer to each other. So, in order for light to be pulled toward an object by gravity, it would need mass. (Surprisingly, Newton was criticized for developing a theory of gravity that was too similar to an &quot;occult force,&quot; and therefore non-Christian.) </p>
<p>Einstein figured out that gravity isn't really a force. At least, not in way that Newton described it.</p>
<p>P.S. I'm simplifying. As it turns out, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Georg_von_Soldner" target="_blank">some 18th and 19th century theories</a> predicted that light would indeed have been affected by gravity, even assuming that light had no mass.</p>
<p>Also, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_general_relativity" target="_blank">relativity</a>, mass and energy are equivalent in many ways. As Wikipedia says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In relativity, mass and energy are two different ways of describing one physical quantity. If a physical system has energy, it also has the corresponding mass, and vice versa. In particular, all properties of a body that are associated with energy, such as its temperature or the binding energy of systems such as nuclei or molecules, contribute to that body's mass, and hence act as sources of gravity</p>
