			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on day three of what I figured was a cold and I'm anticipated it'll basically have run it's course by tomorrow.</p>
<p>Definitely not an allergy, no itchiness or anything like that. Started with a tingly throat Monday night, a sore throat Tuesday, painful sneezing and coughing Wednesday, and less pain but more congestion today. </p>
<p>That's what I've always considered a &quot;cold&quot;. What is it then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you have a cold, your mucus membranes essentially have a &quot;rash&quot; and depending on how much you've been coughing, sneezing (your body's way to &quot;scratch&quot; the rash), and a 100 other factors, you won't feel well again until the tissues have been repaired.  On top of that, you can get a secondary infection if those mucus barriers are compromised severely.  My point is, its complicated.</p>
<p>There are likely thousands of cold viruses, which will affect every person differently.  Even if you give 10,000 people the same exact strain of a virus, a portion of them won't get sick at all, others will develop cold symptoms for 3 days, some for 2 weeks, and still others will develop complications that require hospitalization.  Usually the coronaviruses and rhinoviruses are implicated in &quot;the common cold&quot;, but SARS was also a coronavirus, and 10% of people diagnosed with that strain died. </p>
<p>Sorry to give a wishy washy answer, but I don't think we have enough information, aside from your symptoms and their duration.  It sounds like you have a cold, but don't take any of our words for it.  We are just internet people.  Hope you feel better very soon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>99% chance its just a viral infection i.e a cold. Viruses and colds can be anything from asymptomatic to symptoms lasting weeks. Like how their symptoms can vary so much depending on the virus and the host. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I get a cold, it takes a week for symptoms to completely vanish, but the symptoms improve considerably after a couple of days, so maybe they mean the more acute phase of the disease where it feels like a living hell. </p></div>		</li>
