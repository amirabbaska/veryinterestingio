<p>&quot;A total of 500 tonnes of Russian warhead grade HEU (equivalent to 20,008 nuclear warheads) were converted in Russia to nearly 15,000 tonnes tons of LEU (low enriched uranium) and sold to the US for use as fuel in American nuclear power plants. The program was the largest and most successful nuclear non-proliferation program to date. The first nuclear power plant to receive low-enriched fuel containing uranium under this program was the Cooper Nuclear Station in 1998. During the 20-year Megatons to Megawatts program, as much as 10 percent of the electricity produced in the United States was generated by fuel fabricated using LEU from Russian HEU.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the deal was called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatons_to_Megawatts_Program" target="_blank">megatons to megawatts</a>, and it was a 20 year agreement signed between the US and Russia.</p>
<p>For much of that time, the fuel from former Russian warheads was powering up to 10% of the US energy grid.</p>
<p>This is what surprises me so much about the “Uranium One scandal”. Russia was sending the USA their nuclear weapon plutonium for twenty years, yet somehow it would be a giant scandal for Russia to buy Canadian uranium?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the Wikipedia article says, recycled Russian plutonium was powering 10% of the US grid. There was most certainly a sizeable chunk of plutonium going to the US.</p>
