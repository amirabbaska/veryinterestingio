			<div class="markdown"><p>The Soviets backed a bloody coup against the secular American-supported capitalists <em>(with ties to the United States having grown increasingly deeper since the 60s, much to Soviet irritation)</em>.</p>
<p>Within a year or two the new socialist regime murdered tens of thousands of civilians, from the urban elite to the rural tribal leaders <em>(anybody who was even SUSPECTED of dissent)</em>, crashed the economy with idealistic impractical policy, completely trashed the local credit system which rural Afghan sociey depended on in the process &amp; even murdered the American ambassador in a ambush.</p>
<p>The Afghan socialists also couldn't stop couping each other, forcing the Soviets to invade to try &amp; salvage what they could. </p>
<p>And by salvage I mean they couped the socialist Afghan dictator who couped the first socialist Afghan dictator <em>(whom couped the American-supported government)</em> so they could install their own hand-picked socialist Afghan dictator.</p>
<p>Of course, overall, them bombing the ever-loving hell out of all the infastructure <em>(much of which was built with American aid in the 60s &amp; 70s)</em>, mining every field they came across &amp; burning down everything that even looked green didn't much help either when it came to winning hearts &amp; minds.</p>
<p>And all of this was before American support for the opposition even really got going in the way you imply it. lol</p>
<p>I mean, all those pretty pictures of Kabul from back in the day that you see floating around on the internet? That was during tue seculat, American-supporter capitalist regime. Almost from the moment the socialists launched their <em>&quot;worker's revoluton&quot;</em> there, everything went to shit &amp; hasn't been good since. lol</p>
<p>The Soviets &amp; their socialist proxies turned that country into a chaotic, politically unstable dumpster fire where the government was utterly alienated from the peolle &amp; spit directly in America's face while they did it <em>(and, like I mentioned before, they did it all within the timespan of only like ayear or two which...is kinda impressive to be honest Lol)</em>. </p>
<p>We helped throw fuel on the fire afterwards, and we should be critisized for that, but don't sit here &amp; try to whitewash the socialist Afghan government &amp; Soviet occupation which not only caused the whole thing, but was the driving force for it's very existance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think poverty and rural existence plays a part. Growing opium is not a great way to boost GDP, it just attracts criminals.</p>
<p>Also eastern orthodox religion vs islam is why former soviet states don't want to get involved. They are too far away culturally.</p></div>		</li>
