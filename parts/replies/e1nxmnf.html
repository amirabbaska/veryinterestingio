			<div class="markdown"><p>You are certainly correct, however, my point had more to do with the structure of the cities which have geographic layouts that are more spread out. New York and Chicago have more or less geocentric shapes whereas San Diego and Seattle do not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a better comparison would be like Denver (or a modern, grid like city (leads to easy navigation) like Denver) to Boston, a city that has more of an old world designed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seattle itself has only 83 sq. miles. Compare this to NYC's 304 sq. miles and Chicago's 234 sq. miles. So when you refer to Seattle being spread out, were you including the surrounding towns like Kirkland, Bellevue, and Redmond? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Boston, New York City, Philadelphia and Washington DC have pretty good transit systems. It's entirely possible to live indefinitely without a car in any of those cities (I've done it in two of them). These systems, with the exception of DC's, were all built before the rise of the automobile, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read and observed, it seems that #3 is the largest factor. There were suburbs even before cars came to be thought of as the standard of movement in the US, like the rail suburbs in the Chicago area or around the old electric rail stops in Portland, Oregon. Once you were in one of those rail suburbs everything was much more compact than you'll find in post-auto suburbs. They would be scattered nodes/hubs of density instead of a the fairly uniform &quot;sprawl&quot; that came after the shift to cars. </p>
<p>There is also an intermediate level of density between the walking/horse/train-era downtown and the post-auto sprawl in places like Salt Lake City, which is the area that had a trolley system.</p></div>		</li>
