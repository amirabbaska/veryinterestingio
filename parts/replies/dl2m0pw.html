He's saying a rich guy can offer $5 for your proof of voting for candidate X, and another rich guy can offer $6 for your proof of voting for candidate Y. Candidate Y gets more votes, because lots of people wanted to make a quick buck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesnt mean anything.  The reason voting machines arent up to date is...there is no reason.  There is no reason to build high security ones outside of moral obligations.  If you havent been to the US, morals come to the bottom of the list of importance when it comes to production.  No one is going to make money off of investing in new machines.</p>
<p>If vote fraud / manipulation is such a &quot;huge problem&quot;, would they have not already solved it?  Of course not, its not actually a problem because no one is losing money from it.  If anything, people MAKE money off being able to exploit a system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And many states don't force you to register for either party and still vote. Most states are open or semi-open primaries. In Massachusetts, there's no reason to register for a party at all; you're just limiting yourself when it comes to the primaries. A registered Republican can't take a Democratic primary ballot but an unenrolled voter can.</p>
<p>And people don't always vote for their party. Lots of folks voted for Obama twice and then voted for Trump. </p>
<p>Voting history and party affiliation are certainly helpful tools but certainly do not <em>prove</em> you voted a certain way. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Can confirm.  I live in a heavily red district, so my vote for a blue candidate in a local election is basically meaningless.  I am registered republican so I can at least use my primary vote to pick the least dick-ish option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can register to vote (and actually vote) without declaring a party affiliation.</p>
<p>Just because most people give up this privacy through party registration (and Facebook posts, and political signs/bumper stickers), doesn't change the fact that we need to be <strong>able</strong> to do it anonymously, if we want to.</p>
<p>Also, in addition to there being &quot;legitimate&quot; reasons to register for the party you do not support, somebody could hold a gun to your head and make your register for a political party, and they could check public record to make sure you complied. But they could NOT check who you actually voted for.</p>
<p>Similarly, your <em>own political party</em> can not deny you membership, publicly humiliate you, or otherwise retaliate if you register but don't vote for them, because they can't know that. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not at all true.  A simple receipt that shows only the time (to the closest minute), voting machine ID number, and the votes cast would be enough for a voter to validate their vote, but not enough to prove to a third party how you voted- you could have picked the receipt up off the floor, for example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Uh, if it doesn't show who you voted for, then all it does is prove that you voted, which means the machine could be hacked and flip your vote.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't there be a code assigned to each machine that represents the candidate based on the time of voting? Say...</p>
<p>12:00 - 12:30 voters</p>
<p>Clinton 00123 </p>
<p>Trump  00124</p>
<p>12:30 - 1:00 voters</p>
<p>Clinton 7782</p>
<p>Trump  7783 </p>
<p>The machine keeps the logs of the codes, and you get issued a copy of it.</p>
<p>I mean he'll, each individual voter could get their own randomized code stored inside the machine.</p>
<p>Voter # 455999</p>
<p>Trump 00084736262
Clinton 99937261679</p>
<p>Your receipt looks something like</p>
<p>Voting Machine # 11294 </p>
<p>Time: 12:45</p>
<p>Vote Code: 99937261679</p>
<p>Thanks for voting! </p>
<p>So if anything gets brought into question, you can bring it to the machine and check that indeed vote code 99937261679 matches with the one in the machine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty amazing how in one subreddit we could solve a national problem when the government has been probably at it for 50 years spending millions of dollars. Honestly I wonder how a country would do if they literally elected an average citizen who has no corporation or business ties. Like tomorrow, we just make you president without any reason. </p>
<p>Edit: |This is English|. I am ENCOURAGING that we update old polling machines that haven't been touched in 50 years.      </p>
<p>Edit2: I seem to have touched Reddit's sarcasm side, splitting the community in two. No this comment wasn't supposed to be sarcastic. Every president we have had in modern day (speaking for the US), was sponsored by a committee and normally has ties to bigger businesses or organizations. (this isn't sarcastic) I am curious what it would be like if we put an average citizen as president and disallow any business or organization donations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, the comment you're replying to didn't make any improvement on the system.  Showing that you voted is all fine and dandy but to verify that no tampering has occurred we still need to know HOW you voted.  THAT is the problem, if we make it possible to link a vote to an ID then the system isn't annonymous and this enables votes to be directly bought.  If we don't link a vote to an ID then we can use the receipt system to verify that the <em>number</em> of votes cast is correct but we have no way to decipher if individual votes weren't manipulated.</p>
<p>If you can get into the inner workings of a machine then you can redirect votes for one candidate to another and no ID system or timestamp will reflect this change.  Sure, you can then go back and <em>ask</em> people what their votes were or re-do the election if you're suspicious... but this doesn't guarantee you can replicate the <em>true</em>, original result.  People may unwittingly or intentionally change their vote or malicious voters may lie outright to cast doubt upon an outcome they disagree with.</p>
<p>It's a total catch 22.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's worth different amount to different groups.</p>
<p>Say I work for Company 'X', and my boss 'encourages' people to vote for Candidate 'A'. So a vote receipt showing a vote for 'A' is valuable... to me, and my co-workers.  But for everyone else in the city/county/state/country, it's worthless. So, the vast majority of people will throw it away, thus allowing me and my co-workers to grab the ones we need.</p>
<p>And, in any case, election tampering is illegal. Simply record your boss's 'offer', and report him. End of problem.</p></div>		</li>
