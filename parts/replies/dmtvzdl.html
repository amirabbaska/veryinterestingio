			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain how the nautical miles relate to the coordinates of the earth?
Having multiple miles, multiple knots, multiple tons and multiple pounds was one of the many weaknesses I perceived with the imperial system. I always imagined many of these units were made up as part of some scam (e.g. &quot;Hey, that shipment of wheat you sent me wasn't a thousand pounds!&quot;, &quot;No, it was, it was a thousand welsh pounds!&quot;). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coordinates on the surface of the Earth are labeled by latitude (north-south) and longitude (east-west). The standard units for these are degrees, (arc) minutes, and (arc) seconds. One degree of latitude is 1/90^th the distance from the equator to the north pole. One minute is 1/60^th of one degree, and one second is 1/60^th of one minute. <strong>A nautical mile is defined to be one minute of latitude.</strong> Basically, suppose you are handed a sheet of graph paper. It makes sense to choose your standard unit of length to be the same size as the length of a box edge. Same rational applies to the nautical mile. The inconsistency is that the Earth is not perfectly symmetric, so where you measure your minute changes the length of a nautical mile. The difference, however, is ~1m, so the error is about 0.0004% (the current international standard nautical mile is 1852m). It is unlikely that this error would have caused much of a problem considering, that over the course of even a few days, the error in distance would be less than that of the error in a sextant measurement.</p>
<p>The problem with multiple values for various units isn't really the problem with The Imperial system having various values, but rather there being multiple Imperial systems. As long as you kept track of what system you were in, there was no redundancy. Of course, in this day and age with globalization and high precision measuring systems, it's best to have consistent definitions for weights and measures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the clarification, very enlightening. Though I can see how this benefit only extends to the north-South axis, not to longitudes (even in the equator since the earth is not a perfect sphere).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A nautical mile is (or was) 1 minute of longitude at the equator, so the circumference of the earth is 360 * 60 = 21600 NM. I don't think it's a very good reason to keep using it, but there's no industry that has more inertia in these matters than aviation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One example is air and maritime navigation, which typically uses a nautical mile</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nautical mile is defined as exactly 1852 meters. So even that measurement is defined from a SI unit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I kinda wish Fahrenheit was a scale of 0 - 100 that covered 0C to 37C specifically for the weather aspect. Basically you'd end up with a scale where below 0 its so cold you can die from exposure, and above 100 its so hot you can die from exposure.</p></div>		</li>
