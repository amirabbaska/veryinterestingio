			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more one long continuous sonic boom so long as the object keeps going supersonic. But if you're on the ground you only hear it once as the wave passes over you, then it moves on following the the object. You'd only keep hearing it if you were traveling along with it, but then you'd also be going the speed of sound, so...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is the cockpit of the plane aware of the sonic boom? Since the waves are pushing out from around them, they wouldn't be hearing it, or am I way off?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is also the reason why supersonic aircraft like the Concord weren't allowed to fly supersonic over land, since <em>everyone</em> living along the flight path would hear the loud sonic boom. Instead the Concord flew subsonic over land (which was very inefficient and consumed a lot of fuel) and only flew supersonic over the ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so if you have people standing far away from each other but both at points where the object going supersonic passes, will the person at point A hear sonic boom and then when it passes over to person B will they also hear one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There can be. The pressure ridge that 'whyrat' is talking about continuously rolls off the planes surfaces like the wake of a boat. Which by the way is caused by the same principle as sonic booms in air. The water wave is slower than the boat is moving. In a 3D situation like an aircraft the wave rolls off as a cone away from the plane. It is continually expanding behind the plane. When the wave hits the ground the pressure rise follows along at the same speed as the plane. When it crosses your location the sudden rise and fall of pressure is heard as a boom.</p>
<p>A diagram of that wave. the line of coherent waves from an expanding cone of pressure behind the plane. The cone angle gets narrower, the faster the plane goes.</p>

<p>It turns out that these waves also come off from other parts of the plane, including the rear of the plane. So you can hear one boom from the front of the plane and one from the rear of the plane. Also since the conditions of the air are not constant, different parts of the other portions of the waves coming off the plane can be bent and arrive later. leading to rolling thunder sounds. </p>

<p>Note the shock waves coming off this plane from parts all along it. </p>
<p>Here is a picture of the shock wave from the back of the plane hitting the water under it as well as causing the air to undergo what is called a Wilson cloud effect. That splash will follow the plane as long as it is supersonic. Also note a Wilson cloud just behind the canopy.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there's actually multiple form one object, one from the front where it's pushing the air out of the way, and another form the rear where air is able to return back to where it was.</p>
<p>But for that level of detail you'd really be best served by a physics lecture on the matter. Or, here's an ~5min TED video for a starting point: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JO4_VHM69oI" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JO4_VHM69oI</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's the wikipedia explanation. Thought it might help explain it from a different angle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When an aircraft passes through the air it creates a series of pressure waves in front of it and behind it, similar to the bow and stern waves created by a boat. These waves travel at the speed of sound, and as the speed of the object increases, the waves are forced together, or compressed, because they cannot get out of the way of each other. Eventually they merge into a single shock wave, which travels at the speed of sound, a critical speed known as Mach 1, and is approximately 1,225 km/h (761 mph) at sea level and 20 °C (68 °F).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the analogy, and it brings to mind a question about sonic booms in water (or whatever the equivalent would be called, &quot;aquatic booms&quot;?)</p>
<p>Water is super incompressible, right? I imagine that would make sonic booms more dramatic. So how fast would the &quot;sound barrier&quot; be in water and what does it look and sound like? Where do I find tons of cool videos of demonstrations of vehicles traveling past this speed underwater (ooh, and <em>on</em> the water!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-would-a-sonic-boom-look-like-if-it-occurred-under-water" target="_blank">this</a> you'd have to be going 3316 MPH or 5336 km/hr underwater to create a sonic boom. Makes me wonder if cavitation would prevent it, that's just layman speculation though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good ELI5 answer.  I'll add that &quot;likes&quot; to move is how fast it can move due to a pressure wave (calc fans, that's the partial derivative of pressure wrt density).  </p>
<p>You can think of it as pebbles dropping in a pond, and each ring the sound wave moving outward.  Then continue dropping a pebble on the edge of the previous ring.  As you keep dropping pebbles that edge is going to get stronger and stronger until it's a 'shock'.  edit: from /u/DubDubDubAtDubDotCom , a nice graphic which is standard in some form in compressible flow texts <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/X2dlm.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.stack.imgur.com/X2dlm.jpg</a></p>
<p>Incidentally, shallow water resembles compressible flow oddly well.  Ever notice those ripples in shallow sheets of water?</p></div>		</li>
