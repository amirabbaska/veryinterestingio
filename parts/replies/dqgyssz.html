			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with these comparisons is that solar effectiveness varies a lot by country and so is wind but wind is slow to build and takes a lot of space (which Scotland has, England not so much). In the UK nuclear is vastly better than solar. Thereâ€™s no ultimate answer unfortunately (except fusion). So ideally there would be a combination of renewables and fission, but a lot of people seem to be under the impression that places with a population density like England (which has twice the Australian population) can go full renewable if the government tries hard enough, which is not happening in several decades. In fact, unless there's a massive break through, England would go through the lifespan of a newly built fission station before going full renewable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not a problem with the comparison so much as it's a problem with trying to extrapolate the comparison to every possible scenario - which would be a silly thing to do.  There are a lot of reasons we can't go full renewable yet anyway - location is certainly one, storage is another, production capacity a third, transmission capacity a fourth, and so on.  </p>
<p>What the study shows is that solar is so much better than fossil fuels that we should use it wherever feasible - but that doesn't do much for the places where it <em>isn't</em> yet feasible.</p>
<p>In theory, I'm also in favor of fission for electrical grid base load.  But in practice, I'm a lot less sure.  The technology is sound, with most engineering problems long solved - but the <em>people</em> problems are, as usual, the limiting factor.</p></div>		</li>
