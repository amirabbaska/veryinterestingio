			<div class="markdown"><p>That knot or trigger point is considered an output as a result of information being sent to the brain by various receptors. If we change or alter the input (manual therapy, massage, dry needling, e-stim, etc) then hopefully we can achieve a different output (decreased localized tone/the knot decreases or goes away).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You likely have. We know that 'knots' respond to pressure being applied (massage, SMR, trigger point release, accupuncrure, etc), we also don't know why they respond the way they do (several THEORIES). The thing is, those knots are formed normally from a stimulus, either active or passive (incline bench press, or sitting over a computer will both result in shortened pec minor/knot). If you are always in the same position, ie go to work and sit at a computer for several hours, or go to gym and smash out heaps of bench press, they will return, regardless of if you have them broken down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shame though, that shows how the Reddit vote system can screw with things. The post sounds plausible (and I assume it's a plausible hypothesis, just not proven?), gains traction and is now the top comment, gilded. If I hadn't scrolled down and noticed your comment I would have thought his was the right answer. Shame that post doesn't add a bit more nuance to the story.</p></div>		</li>
