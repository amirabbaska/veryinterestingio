			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look really close you do see a slow down in the motor, but it is connected to the AC power grid which has many much larger spinning generators. In addition the generators you are connected to will notice this tiny change in frequency and spin their generators slightly faster to compensate.</p>
<p>Imagine throwing balls up so that a car is driving into them. They bounce off the hood and pick up the say 60mph of speed. The car can speed up many balls before it is at risk of slowing down much, and if the driver is careful to add speed with the engine the car can stay at an almost constant 60mph. The baseballs are the energy we use. If you throw balls at the car they will be sped up to the same speed as long as they are small relative to the car, and as long as the car's speed is being maintained we can just ask for as much power as we need.  </p>
<p>Turns out elevators are small even when full.</p></div>		</li>
