			<div class="markdown"><p>25m/g*1.6km/m ~= 40 km/gallon.</p>
<p>40 km/g / 3.8l/g ~= 10.5km/l</p>
<p>1000km / 10.5km/l ~= 95 l</p>
<p>95 terabyte hard drives if we assume /u/aggasalk is correct that 1 liter of gasoline powers the transmission of a terabyte. </p>
<p>Edit: After checking he said &quot;a few terabits&quot; with each terabit = 0.125 terabytes. We'll highball it because I'm lazy. I tried looking up the storage value of an eight track tape, but I can't find enough details to convert terabyte hard drive into eight tracks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Firstly what does IPv6 have to do with hop count? Most ISP networks that have deployed native IPv6 will be dual stack. Secondly, average path length of 3.5 hops? It's one hop to your default gateway, 1 hop to your ISPs edge, that leaves one and a half hops for it to reach the destination...</p>
<p>Also the hops you are seeing in a traceroute are not an accurate representation of the amount of devices your traffic is actually traversing due to tunneling or devices not decrementing TTL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Also devices like switches wouldn't be accounted for either. Then it seems the comment was figuring for copper and not fiber. The biggest issue is what someone started another comment for and that is all these devices are powered up anyway. So are we just measuring the amount to push 1 packet at the wire  level? Are we accounting for increased cpu usage on firewalls/routers for things like firewall, QoS, shaping, profiling, etc? There is really some complicated stuff going on so trying to calculate the chunk of energy to take from everything for one packet is difficult to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An easier way to calculate it would be to go with averages.</p>
<p>Determine the average number of packets a backbone router processes in an hour.  Same for switching.</p>
<p>Determine how many routers and switches it passes through on its path.</p>
<p>Determine how many watts each of those devices consumes in an hour.</p>
<p>Average it out.  The result would be very, very tiny.  I have no idea what any of these numbers are though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's 3.5 companies/networks that it goes through, not 3.5 hops. So like going from an AT&amp;T network to TWC would count as 1, even though they'd have several hops in each. I can understand where he got confused though. IPv6 isn't going to really reduce hop count. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chances are the low hop count with IPv6 is due to lack of peering. Most ASN's just pass IPv6 traffic off to transit (cogent, he, ntt/gtt, etc) which may also be providing service to the destination ASN.</p>
<p>Source - &gt; Cogent - &gt; Destination; 3 ASN's. </p></div>		</li>
