			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here looking for something like this. You sound like you know a thing or two. I'm currently a week off of a heavy Heroin/cocaine addiction (mostly the former), and have been taking 5-HTP to try to alleviate some of the emotional effects of withdrawal (physical withdrawal is minimal at this point). But I'm looking into options of supplements to increase/retain dopamine, since I feel like I've probably just about depleted my resources. Do you have any experience with this type of situation, or any recommendations? Is it pointless to go and take supplements when my brain is so accustomed to massive amounts of dopamine and constant opiate-induced pleasure patterns? I mean I'm not expecting, or looking for, any sort of &quot;high&quot; or &quot;euphoria&quot; in any sense, I'm way past that point. Just trying to level out the reward systems in my brain to re-train myself to crave other, more natural/healthy things. Any help would be appreciated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can think of your brain as a system that seeks the highest average rewards of your environment and acts to guide you toward them. It's good to exploit rewards you know, and it's good to explore to see whether there's something better out there. When you've abused opioids (heroin e.g.) the system registers natural rewards as &quot;lower than average&quot; because it is used to artificial rewards. A reward is basically something that activates the nucleus accumbens. This nucleus responds to the registered size of rewards and thus is keen to the relative difference between rewards rather than the absolute value. This is why some people are never happy unless they are relatively better off than their neighbors.</p>
<p>The key is that your nucleus accumbens is blind. It has no clue what you've just done--all it knows is that it has received a reward, and it knows whether it is bigger or smaller than average. If it receives &quot;smaller&quot; rewards, the system interprets this as being in a &quot;bad&quot; environment and tries to make you go somewhere else. If you put rats in a cage with just small amounts of food and a running wheel, they will develop anorexia. This is because their system is blind--it is using a very simple algorithm: if it receives &quot;smaller&quot; rewards, motor activity (running) becomes more rewarding than eating. This is so the rat will run until it ends up in a &quot;good&quot; environment.</p>
<p>So what am I saying? I'm saying that using artificial rewards to level out the detrimental effects of artificial rewards isn't a very good strategy. Your system needs to learn that the right rewards in your environment are social support, pride, and other good stuff. A way to do this is through what is called &quot;environmental enrichment&quot;--exposing yourself to a lot of stimuli. Go to art shows, talk to strangers, do a lot of different stuff you've never done before. Show your system that there are a lot of different things out there. Natural rewards. Eventually the system will accept the new &quot;average reward&quot;, and you will be able to feel joy.</p></div>		</li>
