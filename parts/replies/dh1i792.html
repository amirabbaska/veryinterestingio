			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to know your source for this, because you say a few things which are not true. For example, the brain is beyond a simple feedback loop mechanism, not to mention that an actual feedback loop in the brain is very different than whar you describe. Perhaps you limited the information for the sake of brevity. That aside, you are right in that areas of the brain are being triggered at the wrong times. However, when you say it is the auditory loop is part of this, that is not true for schizophrenics. Their voice is clearly in their mind the majority of the time, and only in the case of auditory hallucinations (which are not as common for schizos as voices)  is what you said true. The question is about voices in the head of schizos, no auditory hallucinations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course I simplified the functions of the brain for brevity. I believe I even stated this in my post. This is an ELI5-topic answer. I obviously was not writing a scientific article here. I think that's pretty clear, isn't it?</p>
<p>Furthermore, you seem to have your own facts wrong...</p>
<p>First, the topic says &quot;mental illness&quot; not just schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Second, auditory hallucinations is basically the clinical name for &quot;hearing voices&quot;. Why are you acting like they are different things? I'm confused by your argument.</p>
<p>Third, a voice &quot;in the mind&quot; and... Whatever 'not in the mind' might mean to you aren't really separate things either. You're trying to make a distinction where a distinction is not due. Furthermore, people with schizophrenia can and do experience voices and noises which they experience externally 'outside of their own mind'. There are even some people in this very topic stating that is how they experience their own schizophrenia.</p>
<p>And I want to really emphasize that making such a distinction is completely and utterly misguided. If you've understood anything about what I've just explained it should be that -Everything you experience- is within your mind, no matter where it appears to come from or what its actual, original source was. </p>
<p>P.S... The term you used &quot;schizos&quot; is derogatory in nature. I thought you had a degree in psychology? I'm hoping they taught you, at the very least, how harmful derogatory names are for people with mental illnesses... Come on now...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My apologies, I've been writing for such a long time I forgot the topic was mental illness in general. Most people here turned the conversation towards schizophrenia after I used it as an example.</p>
<p>I did not say schizophrenics don'd experience auditory hallucinations, only that in most cases, they perceive them within their mind and thus not as an external source, so if the pathways for the external stimulus is being activated, then your mind would perceive it as such.
Definitions are necessary, and understanding them completely prevents misinformation. Auditory hallucinations compared to voices you perceive in your head, but identify as coming from within are are not quite the same. The distinction between outside versus inside necessitates a differentiation. All we have is our own perceptions when it comes to describing our experiences, so it is important to define them in a general way so that as many people as possible can understand. I know that perception is inside your mind regardless of external stimulus, but since perception can be different, the definitions must be different, just like how Bipolar I and Bipolar II differ in the intensity of manic and depressive episodes, as well as duration. A number difference carries enough information to determine them as different. Likewise, auditory hallucinations versus internal dialogue.</p>
<p>There have been plenty of schizophrenic people on this post, and nobody has spoken up about being offended. Not all will, and not all can, but there is no need for you to speak up for others in this case. Schizophrenia is a long and difficult word to type so taking a shortcut which simply shortens the word hardly seems like a derogatory term. </p></div>		</li>
