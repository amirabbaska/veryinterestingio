			<div class="markdown"><p>Furthermore, if I code a web page that gives you a button to press and generates a GUID in response, since each GUID it generates is never going to be indexed by a search engine, the incomprehensibly vast number of unique pages it COULD render become part of the deep web's content. </p>
<p>In fact, I'd say that dynamic content means that the deep web isn't 90% of the web but more like 99.9999% of the web. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The irony is that is probably most accurate to just state &quot;There is no such thing as the dark/deep web!&quot; But you say that and most of reddit has a fucking aneurysm as they spasmodically link to multiple news articles written by people who got their information from the very shows you're talking about. </p>
<p>The web is the web. Not being listed on a search engine doesn't make it part of <em>some other web.</em> Prior to Google most of the web wasn't listed. When I started in computers, there was no such thing as a search engine. You have to find pages on other pages. Everything was dark! </p>
<p>I run my own &quot;dark website&quot; from my evil basement. It hosts a minecraft server for my son. So when someone mentions the &quot;dark web&quot; keep in mind they're talking about a 9yr olds minecraft server. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a better naming convention would be &quot;listed&quot; and &quot;unlisted&quot; sites. I think it's fair, because &quot;unlisted&quot; sites don't imply something nefarious- they just aren't there for the &quot;general public&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're misunderstanding. Your kid's minecraft server would be part of the &quot;deep&quot; web.</p>
<p>The dark web is stuff accessible through other things like TOR, places like dark net markets. </p>
<p>So what I'm getting at is that the dark web is not some fairytale, but it's definitely not what people crack it up to be</p></div>		</li>

<p>If y'all don't get it, machine 2 machine equals the entire internet. This policy rolled into early 3G evdo . Motorola Q days. </p>
