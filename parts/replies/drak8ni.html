<ul>
<li>press windows key + r</li>
<li>type &quot;cmd&quot; then press enter</li>
<li>in the black screen that pops up type, &quot;tracert reddit.com&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>replace reddit.com with any other website.  The first couple hops will probably always be the same.</p>
<p>It took me 12 hops to find Reddit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to simplify and go deeper into what phobos was saying, each one of those is a computer of sorts that your packet ( the information you sent) reached. Your packet contained instructions to have those locations send their information to you.</p>
<p>so your first line is going to look something like:     </p>
<blockquote>
<p>1ms &gt;1m 1ms 192.168.1.1 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>the first number &quot;1ms&quot; si the time it took your packet to reach your router, the second is the turnover time, if I'm not mistaken. the third is the time it took for their message to receive you. the last is the ip address. in this case 192.168.1.1 refers to your home network or your router.</p>
<p>Then you are going to see a series of steps it takes through places titled with a bunch of random leters and numbers, a city or state, and your isp, finally a ip address. these are switches along what I refer to as the great internet highway. these for the most part are likely located in those giant green cable boxes along streets, and have the job of receiving reading and directing your packet to the next location on it's way to its final destination. It's kinda like the pony express.</p>
<p>The end result gives me 151.101.129.140, and if I type ping reddit.com, it will return the same IP address. </p>
<p>Unfortunately I can't give you more information as I can't remember most of the networking stuff as I've been out of school and practice for a long time. I thought there's some sort of whois command or dns lookup that will pull a bunch of public information on the website for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of like traveling a long distance without a map or other navigation. If you ask someone where to go, they probably won't give you a detailed instruction, but say something like &quot;just follow the road to city X and ask again there&quot;. After a few stops like that you'll find someone that can point you to your destination.</p>
<p>What you see in a Traceroute is basically a list of addresses where your network-traffic stopped along the way to ask for directions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add a -A to see the AS (Autonomous System/network) they go through. You can look that number up to a company on sites like bgp.he.net.</p>
<p>It's worth noting too there can be hidden routes inside there, some starred out, but some just invisible hops not reported back.</p></div>		</li>
