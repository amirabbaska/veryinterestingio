			<div class="markdown"><p>And acording to my calculations, that is about trillion times more than the largest observed black hole, and almost the mass of our entire observable universe excluding dark matter and energy.</p>
<p>So im confused what are you referring to with your awnser. Ofcourse formation of a black hole that big is compleatly impossible. But also GR puts no limit to the mass of a black hole. Granted, what you are talking about is already beyond my level of comprehension, but does it mean that in the de sitter spacetime you referred to, we cannot model a singularity with a mass greater than 7 * 10^52kg? Or does it just refer that an outside observer cannot see such an event horizon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>is it impossible tho? I am not certain on the math but if we are already engulfed in a black hole how would you know? would it feel different than normal space if its properties were normalized across the universe?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Our universe may have been create by a 4D star collapsing into a blackhole and could be the &quot;3D wrapping around a four-dimensional black hole's event horizon&quot; </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is true in a spacetime that consists of just that black hole, like a Schwarzschild spacetime or a Kerr spacetime. Those types of black holes can have any positive mass you want according to GR. But if this black hole lives in an expanding universe like ours, there <em>is</em> an upper limit to the mass of a black hole. Since the expansion is dark energy dominated, the expansion is well-approximated by an exponential scale factor, which corresponds to de Sitter space. If we put some plain old uncharged and non-spinning black hole in this spacetime, then we get a de Sitter-Schwarzschild spacetime. We then find that there is a maximum possible mass of the black hole.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you some more details... </p>
<p>The Schwarzschild metric is characterized by the function f(r) = 1 - 2M/r, where <em>M</em> is the mass of the black hole. In a de Sitter-Schwarzschild spacetime, the analogous function is f(r) = 1 - 2M/r -r^(2), where all extraneous parameters (the gravitational constant and the cosmological constant) have been non-dimensionalized. It turns out that as long as 0 â‰¤ M &lt; 3^(-3/2), there are two positive roots to the equation f(r) = 0, which correspond to the black hole event horizon and the cosmological horizon. If M = 3^(-3/2), both roots (and hence horizons) coincide. For M &gt; 3^(-3/2), there are no positive roots of f(r), and, in fact, f(r) &lt; 0 for r &gt; 0. So the maximum mass is M = 3^(-3/2).</p>
<p>The paper /u/rantonels linked requires some knowledge of GR to get through, but that's the gist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like a very long winded way of saying you can't have a black hole bigger than the universe.  Am I right or wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's roughly that. But it's important to emphasize that &quot;the size of the Universe&quot; is that of the <em>observable</em> Universe, and the size of the observable Universe in turn is given by the rate of expansion. Which in turn is determined by dark energy.</p>
<p>So really it's you cannot have a black hole larger than the typical length scale determined by the dark energy density.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait. Are you assuming that dark energy density is increasing, thus leading us into big rip?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We should make clear at this point that this only true if dark energy really acts like a cosmological constant. But on fundamental level we have no idea what DE is. Therefor its energy might very well vary over time (the expansion may increase even faster or slow down). We also don't know the equation of state parameter <em>w</em> with enough precision to exclude a 'big rip'. So this is more an educated guess than a scientific fact.</p>
<p><em>irony on</em>
I suggest /u/rantonels develops string theory into a working theory of quantum gravity, including dark energy and multiple experimental tests. Then answering the question would be a lot easier and much more certain.

			<div class="markdown"><p>The irony is that people have tried to find a theory of quantum gravity for more then 50 years. I am basically suggesting /u/rantonels does what many great scientist have failed to do for decades. Now that I have to spell it out like that it does not sound funny or ironic anymore...</p></div>		</li>
