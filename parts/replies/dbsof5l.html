<p>The exact shape is still a matter of debate in physical cosmology, but experimental data from various, independent sources (WMAP, BOOMERanG and Planck for example) confirm that the observable universe is flat with only a 0.4% margin of error</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because our observable universe appears virtually perfectly flat, that doesn't mean the universe as a whole is. It just means that the 4+dimensional &quot;horizon&quot; is farther away from us than the current age of the universe has allowed light to travel to. If you were on a virtually perfectly flat plain of grass on Earth, and the distance away from you that you could see was for some reason limited to, say, three feet, you'd have no reason to assume that Earth is round, because the actual horizon is a lot farther away from you than you can see. There really is no way to confirm that the universe is flat or round.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry but I don't know why you got gold, as much of your second paragraph is at the very least pure speculation given our current observations.</p>
<p>Firstly, &quot;physicists&quot; do not claim we live in 10+ dimensions, only string theorists/string theory supporters would. This is an important distinction, as we as of yet have no proof of this and string theorists make up a small portion of physicists (Not to say do not trust them, I'm studying to become one myself one day hopefully, but the theory is far from complete)</p>
<p>Secondly, all evidence points towards the universe being flat. So at the moment it seems as if we would not loop back around if we travelled on forever. Further, there is also no evidence that we are embedded in 4d space (and fairly good reason to not believe it is so). Again, the string theorists would say that we may live in 10+ dimensions, but we are not &quot;embdedded&quot; in this space, but rather they are just tiny extra dimensions (smaller than anything you could imagine) on top of our usual 3 spatial + 1 time (the 6+ more are all expected to be spatial as well, extra time dimensions would prove very hard to make work).</p>
<p>Lastly, while hard to picture and even harder for me to explain, we do not need to be embedded In 4d space to loop back around anyways. General relativity does indeed say that 4d space-time is curved, but not that it lives in some higher dimensional space, rather the curvature is intrinsic -youll have to search that up yourself as I don't have a good way to explain it myself.</p>
<p>Your post is Interesting, but a mind fuck would only really happen if there was reason to believe what you said is true, which I don't believe there currently is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I couldn't make it past your third paragraph. The title of this subreddit is &quot;explain like I'm five&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but I didnt make a post with the purpose of an ELI5, just to briefly explain where his answer goes wrong. There are some other good posts that do a simpler job of explaining the more correct answer.</p>
<p>His post may be interesting, but if it has little basis In reality then it doesn't constitute a good answer, and therefore doesn't do a good job answering op's question as all it does is mislead. </p>
<p>If he made it more clear it was more of an opinion piece than an answer then it would a good conversation piece to explain where he is confused and what's the correct answer is and to explore a very interesting question, but as it stands it states some things as almost matter of fact that aren't actually accepted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly what's wrong with eli5... an answer that is understandable but incorrect (or at least wildly speculative) ends up much higher than one which is correct but complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure there are many who don't subscribe to a certain extent to string theory. I'm not a scientist, but my understanding is that there is no alternative model to string theory, it just happens to be the best we've got, and it's by no means near complete or accurate. Physicists may not all specialize in string theory but I'm doubtful there are many physicists who don't at least recognize the importance of string theory but differ in how they approach parts of string theory. I would expect higher dimensions are something that most physicists accept for the time being. There was a similar post the other day, maybe here or on ask science, in which someone asked for alternative all-encompassing theories to string theory. The consensus was that there aren't any. There are conflicting theories in regards to smaller parts, but string theory as a whole has no replacement as of now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd be surprised, I definitely know people who question is validity. We have no experimental evidence of small dimensions so us saying &quot;oh they're just even smaller&quot; does seem like shifting the goal posts a little. I don't agree that it is, but I understand why many are skeptical.</p>
<p>The problem is that it's just such a damn hard problem, the hardest we've ever tackled maybe, so while it may be the only working candidate that doesn't mean everyone should accept it. You shouldn't dismiss it, but I understand why people are skeptical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain how it's possible that two-dimensional things exist? That probably sounds so dumb but I can't wrap my head around it because I don't get how something that has length and height couldn't also have depth. Like if something is on a plane with x and y, I get how it could move in either of those directions, but it can't be perfectly flat, can it? Wouldn't it have to have a super-minute measurement on the z axis to be visible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just a metaphor. He's not saying 2d beings exist, he's saying that we as 3D beings have a relationship to the 4th dimension that is analogous to a 2d being's relationship to the 3rd. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well - visibility requires more than two dimensions. </p>
<p>Every two-dimensional thing would be imaginary, think a geometric triangle: You know triangles exist and you can do maths with it and locate it in a x-y-diagram, but to make it visible you would have to draw it on a three-dimensional thing like a sheet of paper or project it on a screen. You can observe it from your own location on a z-axis coordinate <> 0.</p></div>		</li>
