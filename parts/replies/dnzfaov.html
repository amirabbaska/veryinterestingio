			<div class="markdown"><p>The purpose of the SCOTUS is to set legal precedent by interpretation and understanding the intent of what laws currently exist. Some of their decisions could create new laws and or change how current laws are applied. Which is why it is a semi-political process to be appointed.</p>
<p>HYP3RION probably said this best. The majority of SC trials involve multiple and complex interactions of laws, often in opposition. They may also involve situations in which laws do not yet exist. An interpretation is being called for to set future precedent.</p>
<p>Presumably if a completely impartial decision could be made, it would have been decided by the lower courts and any appeals within a strict interpretation of the law would have been rejected.</p></div>		</li>
