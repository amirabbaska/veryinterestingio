			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't exactly correct. The hormone powder you are thinking of is rooting hormone it causes the meristematic tissue (the part of the plant where cells actively divide) to change from stem tissue to root tissue causing new roots to form from areas where shoots would have typically formed. This is very helpful in rooting cuttings not so much in helping wounds to heal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, and since I am old sometimes my memory is faulty. Is the hormone powder used for grafting?
Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Rooting hormone is used to create roots on stem cuttings, this allows you to produce new identical plants to the original. There are no hormones that I know of that are used in tree grafting. There are different products (Wax, paste, elastics, clips) used to help the grafting wound from drying out and keeping the vascular tissue lined up. Grafting is at the very basic level just an operation, if you line up the plumbing properly and keep the wound clean then it should take. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you mean the practice of grafting, it is usually done when you want the roots and stem/leaves/flowers to different characteristics. For example plant variety A might have strong-growing roots that can withstand extreme cold, or it is fast-growing. Variety B has red flowers that plant A does not have or it has tastier fruit. So you graft branches of variety B onto the trunk of variety A to get the benefits of both. Weeping cultivars of cherries and Japanese maples are often grafted onto striaght-growing variety's stems because otherwise they would be trailing on the ground instead of spilling out from the top of a straight trunk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the tree and how old. Certain trees the trunk is mostly dead already but by the nature of what it's made of will still pull water up from the bottom</p></div>		</li>
