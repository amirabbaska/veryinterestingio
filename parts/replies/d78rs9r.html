			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of tradition and practicality, a scale - which means a key - consists of all seven note names, each one either flat, natural, or sharp.  </p>
<p>One reason for that is that our standard musical notation, using the staff, only has positions corresponding to those 7 note names (in multiple octaves). You can get a sharp or flat by explicitly putting a ♯ or ♭ next to the note head on the staff, but that gets tedious if you have to do it every time. With a standard key that has all seven note names, all you have to do is once, at the start of the staff, indicate which notes are sharp or flat; that's called a &quot;key signature&quot;. Then you only have to mark individual notes when they deviate from that pattern.</p>
<p>If a key had both A and A♯, you couldn't do that; you'd have to mark every single A note as either natural (♮) or sharp (♯).  You'd also have the B line sitting there unused, since there are no B's in that version of the F key. But in the standard F key, you just put a ♭ on the staff line that corresponds to B, and you're done.</p></div>		</li>
