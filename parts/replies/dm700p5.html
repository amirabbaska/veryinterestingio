<p>Fun fact, hair lost isn’t actually “dead” but is just in a really long resting phase. Your hair is constantly going from growing, falling out, resting then growing phases. Eventually your hair just rest permanently then you have balding in that area.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without clarification, this isn't true. And it's definitely not true that minoxidil is stopping your loss.</p>
<p>When men lose their hair, it is gone. For good. Forever. It will never come back.</p>
<p>But hair has a cycle pattern of growth. It grows for a period and then rests for a long period (like a year or so). Each follicles has its own time period or humans would all go bald for a year as their follicles rest.</p>
<p>What Minoxidil does is force all the follicles to grow at the same time to give you a thicker mane of hair. It doesn't actually stop MPB, though. Instead it is an illusion. You will still lose your hair through regular MPB but it won't be so obvious because your hair is thicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest contributor to hair loss is genetics and treating it permanently would likely require some gene editing or treatment outside the norm of modern medicine. This would be highly dangerous, especially considering it would involve messing with a persons genes and hormones for something non-life threatening that is not yet fully understood. Also, every gene we have is like a double edged sword, turning some on or off may have dire consequences. For this reason, most current treatments simply focus on treating the symptoms and can’t really solve the root problem. </p>
<p>Everything outside the big three treatments are big YMMV, and even the big three don’t work for everyone. The current treatments and how they work are:</p>
<p>Minoxidil works by increasing blood flow to the follicle and helps keep the growth cycle going but doesn’t treat the root cause, hence your hair will gradually start to fall out if you stop using it. Propecia alters your bodies production of testosterone and can have negative effects of libido and other issues for certain people (the original use for Propecia/Proscar was for enlarged prostates, a sign of too much testosterone). Hair transplants work by getting more durable hair from the back of the head, that is less likely to fall out due to DHT, and places it in the crown of the head. This hair may too fall out though.</p>
<p>Note: I am certainly not a doctor or in the medical field by any means, but these are what I found in my research. My philosophy is you should try out safe hair loss treatment options if you’re willing to put in the work then hope for the best. Some people think you should just embrace baldness and that’s cool, but most treatments are preventative so the earlier you start the better your results will be. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Just wanted to correct this a bit. It doesn't alter production of testosterone, rather it alters the rate of conversion of testosterone into DHT by binding to an enzyme. </p></div>		</li>
