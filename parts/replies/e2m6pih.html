			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not. But your stomach is always angles to the left. If you sleep over it or on your right you create a pressure for food to go back to your mouth. The only reason food doesn't do it is because you have a sphincter muscle to stop food. For some people the muscle has problems and they get a reflux.</p></div>		</li>
