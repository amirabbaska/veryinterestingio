<p>This logic doesn't apply in government or the nonprofit sector, because spending usually doesn't pay for itself, even if it accomplishes something useful or important.</p>

<p>How is higher test scores not a direct repayment since those test scores give the school more funding?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That feedback loop, if it even exists, doesn't work because of budgeting pressures. There are always places that are underfunded and repaying teachers is pretty low in the list when it comes to priorities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one popular option for providing direct incentives for academic performance, but it's not used everywhere. It has some downsides because a high-stakes test tends to dominate the curriculum--the administration will sensibly want to maximize funding for the school. But the test might not be a perfect assessor of real performance, or it might not include subjects that people still find important. (It also encourages abusive practices like expelling poorly performing students or arranging for them to be absent on test days.) When you tie funding to tests, any flaws in the test tend to become flaws of the school.</p></div>		</li>
