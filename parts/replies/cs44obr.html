			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to ask a follow-up question. How related are we all? Like, is there an &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; of humanity -- two people that we can trace all of humanity to? Or are there several different people responsible for the modern world? </p>
<p>I guess I'm wondering, basically, if I look at a cave painting, how likely is it that the person who drew is my ancestor? Is it possible they're not related to me at all? Or if I go far back enough, will my genetic lineage converge back to that person, or someone in that person's family?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, to trace the entire species back to two individuals, you'd have to go much farther back than anything we'd call &quot;people&quot;. It's possible to estimate, from modern genetic diversity, the smallest that the entire population of humanity has ever been in &quot;recent&quot; evolutionary history; estimates vary widely, but are generally in the low thousands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a little confused. I first heard about Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam back in high school, but an implication just occurred to me.</p>
<p>According to the Wikipedia pages, Y-chromosomal Adam likely lived thousands of years earlier than Mitochondrial Eve.</p>
<p>By definition (someone please correct me if my interpretation is incorrect), Y-chromosomal Adam must have had at least two sons, each of whom have an unbroken male lineage surviving to this day. Also by definition, Mitochondrial Eve must have had at least two daughters, each of whom have an unbroken female lineage surviving to this day.</p>
<p>And yet, according to Wikipedia once again, our Most Recent Common Ancestor lived only ~3000 years ago. So despite Eve living 100-200 kya and Adam living 200-300 kya, literally everyone alive today is descended from someone who lived around the same time as King Solomon or Zoroaster.</p>
<p>All of these paragraphs are completely unrelated to each other, in retrospect. Sorry for the tangent.</p>
<p>But... How cool is that? 1000 BCE doesn't seem all that long ago, especially on an evolutionary scale, and yet we are <em>all</em> descended from one single person who existed then. Shiiiit. It would be cool if that one person was actually Zoroaster, hahaha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really interesting, studies have shown a common ancestor between all living people today lived only ~3,400 years ago.</p>
