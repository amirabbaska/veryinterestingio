			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, Thanks for the great question. Fuel Cell vehicles are currently commercially available, for example Toyota is selling the Mirai internationally and here in the U.S. Here is a link <a href="https://ssl.toyota.com/mirai/fcv.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://ssl.toyota.com/mirai/fcv.html" target="_blank">https://ssl.toyota.com/mirai/fcv.html</a></a>. Honda has their version too (<a href="https://automobiles.honda.com/clarity-fuel-cell" target="_blank"><a href="https://automobiles.honda.com/clarity-fuel-cell" target="_blank">https://automobiles.honda.com/clarity-fuel-cell</a></a>).  GM is working on their fuel cell vehicles and the US Army is testing them (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/10/this-beast-of-a-chevy-colorado-is-hydrogen-powered-will-be-tested-by-the-army/" target="_blank"><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/10/this-beast-of-a-chevy-colorado-is-hydrogen-powered-will-be-tested-by-the-army/" target="_blank">https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/10/this-beast-of-a-chevy-colorado-is-hydrogen-powered-will-be-tested-by-the-army/</a></a>). There are many other companies that have FC vehicles available now or are currently planning on releasing them soon. As the hydrogen refueling infrastructure expands, so will the number of vehicles. </p>
<p>In addition to vehicles, there are over 20,000 fuel cell powered fork lifts or backup power units on order or to be deployed without any DOE support (<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/10/f37/fcto-progress-fact-sheet-august-2017.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/10/f37/fcto-progress-fact-sheet-august-2017.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/10/f37/fcto-progress-fact-sheet-august-2017.pdf</a></a>). Also, fuel cells are gaining in popularity for stationary power, auxiliary power units in medium and heavy duty vehicle applications, and there is development for their use at ports for various applications. You can find out more at the DOE-Energy Efficiency Renewable Energy Fuel Cell Technology website <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/fuel-cell-technologies-office" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/fuel-cell-technologies-office" target="_blank">https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/fuel-cell-technologies-office</a></a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be blunt, it's the cost.  The Mirai is a 55-60k car that makes 152 horsepower.  A Civic has a 19k msrp and makes 158 horsepower.  There's just no way you can sell a car like that.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why semis are the first big story - lifetime cost of ownership is down; like electrics, less maintenance and more torque, but unlike electrics, same or reduced weight to ICE and no trade-off to refuelling time, resulting in at the target cost point a 5-15% lower lifetime cost of ownership vs. diesel, with the potential to increase that to 30% or more. Also, the Mirai isn't in mass production - there's no hard stop to scale cost reductions except Pt (current gen Mirais are over-built to spec) and the fuelling infrastructure limits potential for market penetration and realizing these scaling cost reductions. This is why the Honda Clarity model is so clever - same chassis as alternative options and you can get a lot closer to scaled cost reductions. </p></div>		</li>
