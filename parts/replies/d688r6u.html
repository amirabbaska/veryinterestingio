Shotokan for instance, one of the most popular and widespread forms of karate, only stretches back to WWII, roughly the same age as American Kenpo Karate. In many ways karate is Japanese for, &quot;This is totally not kung fu, because we hate the Chinese, we came up with this on our own&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>American Taekwondo is like the Cutco or Advocare of martial arts. You can easily get into it and get a black belt (how the fuck is any 8 year old disciplined enough to be a black belt?), then to advance in belts you have to bring in so many students and pay so much money. My friend just hit &quot;master&quot; which is 6th degree black belt and he had to document how many students he had and pay a bunch of money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most popular Kung fu is wing chun. It mostly focuses on punches and elbows but can incorporate kicks in different forms. It is about training to be highly relaxed and use the least amount of energy possible. It is designed to counter brute force fighters. Wing chun is a great starting point to understand chinese Kung fu</p>
<p>Edit: wing chun is a highly adaptive style and throughout the years grandmasters have put their own twist on things. The most notable example being yip man. I was reading his sons book and he stated that when he went to read learn from his father the training was completely different and so much had changed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wing Chun is awesome, but when most westerners (at least most Americans) say &quot;kung fu,&quot; they're generally thinking of Southern Style Shaolinquan (famous for different animal styles). In my experience, people generally just say &quot;wing chun&quot; when they're thinking of wing chun. </p></div>		</li>

One of the best analyst is Firas Zahabi who is the coach of arguably the greatest fighter ever in GSP.. he frequently do videos on techniques and breaks down  street fights on his youtube channel named tristargymchannel.. according to him the best single style for a one on one fight against a bigger but untrained opponent is BJJ.. against multiple untrained opponents its Muay Thai.. but against any trained opponent you should atleast be trained in one striking discipline  (boxing,muaythai,karate) and BJJ.. the better wrestler basically decides where the fight takes place.. its goes without saying that its best to train in full MMA..if u like reading about whats works and whats bullshit read Jack Slack's work at Fightland..!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i feel like those styles work in a ring, maybe not so much a real actual fight. a match does have rules you have to abide by. a structure in place. i'm more interested in ending a fight quickly. not going for a submission, or any of that. you can't be too vicious in the ring. no eye gouges, can't rip off your opponents ears or snap their clavicle or any real oh fuck you techniques that tend to end a confrontation super damn fast. i mean do you know how many times i've seen a BJJ wrestler get kicked right in the face when he tries to take someone down? i mean like front snap kick right to the grill. </p>
<p>fuck an arm bar, if you want someone to leave you alone the human ear detaches with about as much force as opening a bag of chips. rip that little fucker off and throw it in their face. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I wouldn't even classify ninjitsu as a martial art TBH, it is much more than a martial art.  More of a lifestyle that can encompass other martial art techniques to make it unique.  Technically any hand to hand and weapon combat style could be used in ninjitsu.  It's more a term for ninja training which involves more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All these people here saying that ninjutsu is gymnastics or spy training don't know what they are talking about. </p>
<p>There definitely isn't any one particular martial art that you could call &quot;Ninjutsu&quot;. If you look at modern schools such as the Bujinkan, it claims to teach 12 different lineages of martial arts. Only 3 of which were strictly &quot;ninja&quot; while the other 6 were samurai.</p>
<p>There were lineages of historical ninja that employed techniques associated with the black clad assassins that everyone is familiar with. But that isn't really what &quot;ninjutsu&quot; is. It's more of a philosophy that says &quot;I am going to survive, and I am going to employ any means necessary to accomplish this&quot;. </p>
<p>This is why historical &quot;ninja&quot; used dishonorable methods of fighting and tactics against their enemies. They were also very big into using deception against their enemies. Because their only concern was survival. They didn't care if their samurai enemies thought they were weak cowards who fought unfairly. And they loved it even better if their superstitious enemies thought they were demons or magical beings. </p>
<p>If you go to a modern school such as the Bujinkan you will definitely see them practice traditional &quot;ninja&quot; fighting methods like employing kusari fundo or metsubushi. However, they do this more out of tradition and less out of real world modern day application. Many of the associated black clad assassin techniques employed by medieval ninja do not have modern day application. And the Bujinkan knows this.  </p>
<p>The Bujinkan wouldn't teach their students to carry an egg of blinding powder in their jacket. But the concept still remains the same. You could just as easily use throw an ash tray in someone's eyes, to distract them for a second shortly before swinging punches at them (inb4 pocket sand). Krav Maga might even teach this as well. </p>
<p>Regardless, you ultimately don't care about appearing tough or validating your own ego. You just care about winning. </p>
<p>So the most important thing to understand about ninjutsu is that not only does it not encompass one specific martial art, but the philosophies and tactics taught in ninjutsu aren't even unique to ninjutsu itself. Many other cultures and martial arts both modern and ancient have employed what could be considered aspects of ninjutsu. </p>
<p>That being said, a modern school like the Bujinkan definitely has their own fighting techniques and they refer to it as budo taijutsu. And it uses many of the same old school fighting techniques that Judo and Aikido borrow from. You can see many of the same throws in the Bujinkan as you would see a judo practitioner use. Many of them would be referred to by the same name. All the same joint locks that you would learn in Aikido you could learn in the Bujinkan as well.  Or probably any Japanese martial art that has mainland medieval roots. </p>
<p>The difference is judo says &quot;Tripping or throwing people to the ground is effective. Let's build an entire combat sport based off of this.&quot; </p>
<p>Aikido says &quot;I can redirect the attack from my opponent and break his wrist after he lunges at me gracefully in a straight line. This is effective. Afterwards I will be merciful to him and hopefully make him question his choices in life.&quot; </p>
<p>Ninjutsu says: &quot;I've thrown my attacker. Now I'm going to stab him in the eye.&quot;</p>
<p>Ninjutsu says: &quot;I've broken my attacker's wrist. Now I'm going to break it more. Maybe some more. Then I will stab him in the eye.&quot; </p>
<p>Hope that helps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ninjutsu is basically what you would call &quot;spy training&quot;, because that's what ninja basically were - spies, saboteurs. It incorporates/incorporated combat training, but since actual open combat is not necessarily the best thing to do in sabotage/infiltration scenarios, it was not the main emphasis.</p>
<p>Legends surrounding the ninja aside, ninjutsu may be thought of as a catch-all term for &quot;training ninjas&quot;, which historically involved anything from combat to stealth to climbing to engineering to actor training. Basically anything that might be helpful to assassinate someone, steal something, infiltrate a place, set something on fire, destroy the enemy's resources, and so on. Just like today, a spy might very well need, say, accounting skills (to give one example) rather than the ability to fight, depending on what they are assigned for, similarly ninjas were (probably - we don't have that much hard, verified into on historical practices of the ninja) trained in any number of skills that don't necessarily fit the pop-culture image of a Japanese assassin.</p>
<p>In modern times, what is taught as ninjutsu is basically the fighting, climbing/acrobatics and stealth parts - other things, like guerilla tactics, military strategy and such (to say nothing of other skills that a ninja would likely have, like etiquette or whatever abilities the person he was posing as would have, which could be anything from painting to farming) would be irrelevant and outdated today, outside of their original purpose and context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, a lot of these martial arts had many many different schools teaching pretty different systems under the same umbrella name. I am most well versed in Japanese arts where the different school would be called &quot;Ryu&quot;s. Two school both teaching Karate or Ninjutsu or even Judo might be teaching very different things (which they would usually be very happy to explain over the course of many hours). There are several international organizations trying to unify individual arts especially when there is a sport competition version like in Judo.</p>
<p>The basic differences OP outlined are a serviceable explanation of the large differences but I would caution you against thinking you understand any of them without more study. A practitioner of any of the above might be insulted if you reduced their art to those fundamentals. </p>
<p>I'm not suggesting you were about to go around insulting people, just pointing out that if your interested there's a <em>lot</em> more to learn. If you'd like to learn more about ninjutsu I'd be happy to go into however much detail you like. It's one of the more misunderstood (sometimes intentionally) arts out there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, it's not the same. Karate comes with different styles, yes. Kung fu is not a name of a martial art. It literally means Martial arts (or 'skill' ) in Chinese. For example, we would call cooking skills as Cooking Kung fu (厨艺功夫), usually used to describe expertise in cooking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually isn't true. Karate does have distinct different roots-- The region of Naha learned different Chinese martial arts than the region of Shurei and both are different from Tomari.</p>
<p>This is why Kyokushin (which primarily is a Naha style) looks so different from Shotokan (which came from mostly arts learned from Shurei).</p>
<p>To add to the confusion, most Goju (Naha) schools have adopted the tournament style made for Shotokan, so they LOOK like Shotokan now. Kyokushin looks more like older Goju-Ryu than most WKF Goju schools.</p>
<p>Kempo is even MORE different as it started as a (likely) Shurei based karate but it's masters have added a significant amount of modern Chinese influences to it.</p></div>		</li>
