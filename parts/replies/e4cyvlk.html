			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to also protect the electronics, though.  Most mil-spec chips are only rated to about 125C.  So yeah, you could pass something through it with a very high melting point, but it won't matter if you deep fry all the electronics - might as well have just launched a dead hunk of metal into the sun then. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard of a Venus probe proposal that’s basically a clockwork probe. Testing various things and visually signaling to a probe in orbit to send the data back to earth. All because the high temps would cook any electronic systems. Could theoretically do something similar with the sun, however IMO the temperature difference between when electronics fry and when the whole craft melts is low enough that it wouldn’t garner much improvement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems like an idea that sounds sort of reasonable at first, but falls apart under a little bit of scrutiny. How much could you realistically test in any reasonable amount of time without electronics? Theoretically you could design purely mechanical systems to take various measurements, 'communicate' them to the visual signalling system, and then have it signal to the orbiting probe, but doing anything even mildly interesting that way would result in an absolutely huge and ridiculously complicated system of moving parts. Then you add in the fact that it needs to be able to survive a rocket launch, extended space travel, atmospheric entry/landing on Venus, and then operate in Venus' insane surface conditions. It's hard to imagine it as anything than an entirely massive and failure prone machine with no way to fix it when it inevitably ends up somehow broken, likely well before it ever gets to transmit any data. </p>
<p>Compared to that, the idea of designing some sort of cooling system to maintain an electronics package long enough to transmit thousands of times as much data sounds pretty darn easy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could detach your heat shield from the spacecraft (so it's floating free but between the probe and the sun) so there's no conduction of heat between the two. The shield would eventually heat up and re-radiate thermal radiation at the probe, but the 'air gap' (euphemistically speaking - there's no air) would help protect the craft longer than an integrated shield. Of course, your heat shield blocks your probe's visibility of the sun itself, but you could still have gravimetric, magnetic, etc sensors aboard that might be able to gather useful data.</p>
<p>Keeping your heat shield aligned properly might be tricky. Depending on the material, as it begins to fail bits might be ejected from its surface (ablation) which would cause it to shift (the ablated material being reaction mass and thus effectively propellant). I would think you would want your outer layer to be something that would liquefy rather than crack/split/ablate, (like metals) to minimize this, and inner layers of high-temp ceramics or the like. </p>
<p>I think such a setup could be very effective. There's no 'ambient' heat in space - everything is heated by radiation, and as long as your shield holds, your probe isn't experiencing any such radiative heating. Eventually the shield will become red hot and re-radiate, and the probe will catch that heat, and eventually fail altogether and the probe will catch direct solar radiation. But I think you could last for a surprising amount of time. </p>
<p>There's a lot of other clever things you could do to increase the life of your heat shield, such as itself consisting of 'air-gapped' layers, or active cooling using things akin to peltier effect devices that convert heat to electricity and dumps it into lasers to 'zap' the excess energy away, venting away of gases (gotta deal with the 'reaction mass' issue),  etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems incorrect. The heat around the sun is not just direct radiation emitting from the direction of the sun, but a swirling convulsing field of gases and plasma which the probe - shield detached or not - would be stewing in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point being though if you can reflect the heat away, or absorb it into the outer shell when transiting close, it should protect the internals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yeah - I suppose if the transit time is short enough and you slow the heat absorption, then it would work out.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was from some of Stephen Baxter's books, can't remember which ones now. Used a wormhole inside the sun, and transferred material, and so heat, to the other wormhole outside of the sun, to protect the device they were using.</p>
<p>If you like science fiction, especially space based, can't go wrong with Baxter.  Full of really interesting concepts like these. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Unfortunately, that's all he has going for him. Characters and dialogue are awful and the plots are mediocre.</p></div>		</li>
