			<div class="markdown"><p>If dark matter is particulate stuff, then - like I said - it could be captured by black holes. However, once stuff falls into a black hole, it all becomes plain mass. Nothing else remains of it.</p>
<p>Well, electric charge remains also, but you'd expect that stuff to be overall neutral.</p>
<p>&quot;A black hole has no hair&quot;. That's actually a theorem in general relativity. It means a black hole has only 3 attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>mass</li>
<li>electric charge</li>
<li>angular momentum (spin)</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing else matters to a black hole.</p>
<p>Two black holes that are exactly equal in those 3 attributes, are essentially identical, no matter how they were formed.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>(Actually this explanation is a little old school, since there are some debates as to what happens to all the information carried by stuff falling into a black hole. But from a purely general relativistic point of view, this is close enough.)</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dark matter isn't necessarily some exotic particle. Like said, we don't know <em>what</em> it is. There's another theory that it might be primordial black holes - that is to say, normal old boring matter that doesn't emit light and is difficult for us to &quot;see.&quot;</p>
<p>You're over thinking it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding of Dark Matter was that it is distributed throughout the observable universe in relatively the same locations as normal matter, just massively more of it. Wouldn't black holes accounting for that extra mass result in more discrete points of concentration due to the nature of a black hole rather than the more distributed model that we see for most Dark Matter representations? Or are our gravitic measuring tools just not good enough to tell the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dark matter may <em>be</em> black holes. <a href="https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:James_Salsman/BHDM" target="_blank">Many experts think it is</a> but it's still a minority belief.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a minority belief because there's a very small set of black hole sizes that could account for dark matter without being detected, and that set doesn't entirely work with our current (very limited) understanding of how such primordial black holes would have formed. It's not to say the theory is wrong, it's just that while it's plausible it's certainly not complete yet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definition of &quot;accretion disk&quot; re: wiki: </p>
<p>An accretion disk is a structure (often a circumstellar disk) formed by diffused material in orbital motion around a massive central body. The central body is typically a star. Friction causes orbiting material in the disk to spiral inward toward the central body.</p>
<p>Definition of &quot;conic curves&quot; re: wiki: </p>
<p>In mathematics, a conic section (or simply conic) is a curve obtained as the intersection of the surface of a cone with a plane. The three types of conic section are the hyperbola, the parabola, and the ellipse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not fully accurate because it assumes that dark matter does not obey Pauli exclusion.  If dark matter turns out to be composed of fermions, it will obey Pauli exclusion and one could possibly push it with nothing in the way of a classical electromagnetic interaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it interacts only gravitationally, then you would not see it, would not feel it, and it would not interact with your hand at all - except via the super-tiny amount of gravity that your hand produces, which let's face it is basically zero.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh, I was thinking that kinetic motion was part of the gravitational force, not the electromagnetic force. Side question if you know the answer, are interactions at the atomic level gravitational or electromagnetic (or both)?</p></div>		</li>
