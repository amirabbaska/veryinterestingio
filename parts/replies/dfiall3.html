			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest change for me was humbleness. </p>
<p>I'm a professional software developer with a degree in Computer Science. And I understand barely more about what goes on in my computer than the layman. </p>
<p>Yes, the sum of my knowledge about what goes on in my computer is many times that of the layman. Sure, I have a big-picture understanding of most of the architecture and mechanics. But 99.9% of what goes on in my computer might as well be magic.  The system contained in any consumer-grade computer is so tremendously, awesomely complex that it defies understanding. It's like a fractal of complexity. When you think you have a handle on what goes on in a little part of it, nope, there's whole new thing over there that is so complex and huge that it would take months of learning to grasp how it works. </p>
<p>Your computer contains millions of lines of software code painstakingly developed through the collaborative efforts of untold thousands. This runs on hardware that is tiny, fast, and complex to a degree that you and I are literally incapable of wrapping our heads around. There is not a human being alive, nor has there ever been, that understands more than a fraction of the workings of your computer. The whole thing is a patchwork of tiny pieces sitting on top of each other that have no idea how their neighbors work, that somehow manage to harmoniously come together to make your computer work pretty much flawlessly most of the time. </p>
<p>And here I am, sitting on top of this giant fucking thing, trying to get my piddly little pile of code to do what I want it to do. And to do that, I rely on a tremendous collection of utilities, libraries, compilers, and programs (every single one of which is a complete mystery to me, but does it's job flawlessly almost always) that do 99.9% of the work for me. </p>
<p>This revelation of just how little I truly understand of my profession was extremely humbling for me. Even in the field I work and have specialized education in, the area which I spend my entire professional life working in is a tiny little corner in a huge tapestry. And this is just one field of knowledge among hundreds. There are so many jobs, specializations and areas of knowledge of which I am completely, 100% ignorant. There are people every bit as clever as me working in <em>those</em> fields. They face problems and tasks which I have absolutely no idea about. </p>
<p><strong>tl;dr -</strong> other people's jobs probably aren't as simple as you imagine and you should probably be more patient with them</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think this is very much an example of Socrates' definition of a wise man - he knows what he does not know. The layman doesn't know enough to truly understand how bewilderingly complex a computer is. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a box full of switches man.  It's infinitely simple.  The complexity is humans and their damned fingers.  </p>
<p>All 1010 of them...</p>
<p>See...  You got five fingers per hand.  In machine language, that's 101.  For a machine to add 101 and 101, it just switches the switches...  Off + off = off.  Off + on = on.  On + on = off, and the next higher bit turns ON.  This makes 101+101 come out to 1010, and you, as a human, think &quot;yep, 0+2+0+8= 10&quot;, and you just borked the whole thing...  </p>
<p>You see, we didn't add in 4 bits, we added in 3.  The 3 bit output is 12.  The switches say you have 12 fingers, and they aren't lying, they aren't borked, it's not a bug, they did the operation exactly as should happen, and got the right answer.  <em>That's all your computer does</em>...  </p>
<p>All the craziness that you can't comprehend is humans trying to get that box of switches to somehow admit that theyve been wrong the whole time and we really have 10 fingers...  But dude.  It's just a <em>box of switches</em>... </p>
<p>The number of switches and the scale is astounding, but all of the complicated part is <em>us</em>...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really like this answer. I've had that experience with my code and with points that challenge my understanding.</p>
<p>It's really changed how I look at problems, any problems, from applying my understanding to oppose a point to trying to understand the basis for a differing viewpoint. I want to know, as best I can, that I'm not missing information that would change how I think.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That being said, I have a tendency to over analyze things, which bugs my PM cuz I occasionally will eff up a time line on a story lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In one of my high school engineering classes we had to code a simple machine. My code was less than 20 lines. Seems simple to debug. But hell no. I spent 2 days staring at those 20 lines. Eventually I gave up and called my friend, who is a god at coding, over. He stares at the screen reading through it for a couple of minutes. &quot;Here, let me try something&quot; <em>presses spacebar twice, then backspace twice, the  hits complile</em> The damn code compiled and worked perfectly. I had to leave the room for a few minutes. </p></div>		</li>
