			<div class="markdown"><p>My spouse has this condition. Had the major surgery. More than 10 years - still in incredible pain every day. I feel so bad for him. He never complains, just carries on. I remember a story in the news about a man who killed himself due to the pain. It must be awful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is just reflux a thing? Not acid reflux, not GERD?</p>
<p>All my life food, no matter what, comes back up, not necessarily acid. Some things make more acid though, so I stay away from those. It could even be water and it'd come back. I've tried changing my diet (gluten free now) and that doesn't do anything so I feel like this is a surgery-only fix. A doctor told me its progressed to barretts, but that if this has happened and not become cancerous up to this point it probably won't.</p>
<p>And I'm talking at least 50 times a day, I had a counter to see if it changed with the new diet.</p>
<p>Only time it doesn't happen is on a relatively empty stomach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like Laryngopharyngeal reflux. And with that amount of reflux I'd say you should see another GI doc because you might need surgery. That doc sounds crazy saying something like that, that's not how cancer works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Barrets is a precancerous condition that has a good chance of progressing to full blown cancer. You should consult a gastro specialist and be put in a monitoring program with an endoscopy (even better if they have narrow-band imaging) where you should go back and repeat it every few years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a lynx implant.  A little ring of magnets around the valve at the base of the esophagus.  It’s been a few years and it’s been awesome.  And unlike other surgical options for this, it is fully reversible.  They can remove it if it ever causes a problem.</p>
<p>And it still allows for normal burps and vomiting, which the other procedures do not.</p>
<p>It has been life changing though.  Before I could only exercise on an empty stomach.  Couldn’t even drink water.  I have not once had any indigestion or reflux since.   I can lie down on the couch after eating if I want.  Definitely could be something to look into.  Your doctor might not know about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if reflux is something they check heavily for with astronauts.  I can't imagine sending them up if the esophagus is just going to leak acid all the time to the throat in zero-G.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn’t really be any worse in space because the esophageal muscles would just keep pushing it back.  And the air in the stomach probably wouldn’t rise to the top,which is often what triggers reflux.   I’m guessing astronauts don’t belch often.   But with gravity added upside down, if it happens, it is worse because gravity allows extra stuff to exit.  In space it would just be the normal forces.</p>
<p>It’s not necessarily a weak valve.  The valve just opens at incorrect times.  </p>
<p>This is all just supposition on my part.  I have no firsthand knowledge of this other than my own reflux.</p></div>		</li>
