			<div class="markdown"><p>Skin contact with VX is less dangerous than you might think.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16119248" target="_blank">This paper</a> quantified the absorption rate of VX through skin at 661 +/- 126 Î¼g (cm)^-2 hour^-1. A lethal dose (<a href="https://fas.org/programs/bio/chemweapons/cwagents.html" target="_blank">on the order of 10mg</a>) could likely be achieved by coating square of skin, 4cm a side, with VX for an hour.</p>
<p>Also, from <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=gugwlufvShoC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=he+would+sometimes+partially+immerse+one+finger+in+a+small+beaker+of+pure+VX+for+a+few+seconds&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ydysaw2U_7&amp;sig=nFrO-ivOPuszZmqwyirO6njKtX0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjyl6Tg2oTeAhXTdt4KHc-dD80Q6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=he%20would%20sometimes%20partially%20immerse%20one%20finger%20in%20a%20small%20beaker%20of%20pure%20VX%20for%20a%20few%20seconds&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Chemical Warfare Secrets Almost Forgotten</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While addressing a spellbound audience of young officers, he would sometimes partially immerse one finger in a small beaker of pure VX for a few seconds. Without interrupting his lecture, he would then amble to a nearby sink and casually wash the deadly chemical from his finger. The teaching point was that VX could not enter the skin instantaneously, and that accidental exposure of a small area would not be harmful as long as the site were promptly and thoroughly decontaminated.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As noted elsewhere, VX is a liquid.  It is persistent due to low volatility so it tends to hang around for a while.  The frequent military objective of this agent is not necessarily to kill the opposition, but to deny access to a strategic location or facilities/equipment etc.  The low volatility also makes it not a vapor hazard, like sarin or HCN gases, as long as it is not aerosolized, by let's say, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmLW1Jb1cIs" target="_blank">an artillery shell</a>.  Breathing of aerosolized VX will cause much more rapid toxicity effects than skin exposure due to the high rate of absorption of the aerosol that occurs in breathing. (see goat)  If you do happen to walk by VX in an open container without making contact, you will not die.  The problem is, since it is persistent, if it ends up on a surface, it can be easily spread to areas likely to make human contact.  This can cause delayed death, sometimes much later than initial contamination.  A &quot;drop&quot; could be 20-100 mg.<br />
Obviously, VX isn't used in tire production, but in the spirit of the OP's question, an unnoticed droplet of VX that splashed on you, left unattended, would likely kill you within 24 hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to also remember that weapon ttpe nerve agents have a &quot;denial of area&quot; use.</p>
<p>They're not primarily designed to kill people outright.  They're designed to slow down and encumber advancing armies:  its hard to fight effectively in full MOPP(chemical) gear, especially when you have to keep stopping to treat people already doing the  kickin' chicken.</p></div>		</li>
