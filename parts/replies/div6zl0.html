<p>Shortly before the first field test (you realize that no small scale experiment can be done—either you have a critical mass or you do not), a man asked me to check some arithmetic he had done, and I agreed, thinking to fob it off on some subordinate. When I asked what it was, he said, &quot;It is the probability that the test bomb will ignite the whole atmosphere.&quot; I decided I would check it myself! The next day when he came for the answers I remarked to him, &quot;The arithmetic was apparently correct but I do not know about the formulas for the capture cross sections for oxygen and nitrogen—after all, there could be no experiments at the needed energy levels.&quot; He replied, like a physicist talking to a mathematician, that he wanted me to check the arithmetic not the physics, and left. I said to myself, &quot;What have you done, Hamming, you are involved in risking all of life that is known in the Universe, and you do not know much of an essential part?&quot; I was pacing up and down the corridor when a friend asked me what was bothering me. I told him. His reply was, &quot;Never mind, Hamming, no one will ever blame you.&quot;</p>
