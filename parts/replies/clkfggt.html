<p>Yes. I owned a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Game_Gear" target="_blank">Game Gear</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was involved in a robotics project that used a battery of about that size, which could deliver about 600 amps at about 8 volts for brief periods. That is 4.8kW from a pack of cigarettes.</p>
<p>We joked that if we ever needed to do some emergency arc-welding we could use it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amps are a unit of current. Power is voltage * current. Without knowing the voltage, current tells us nothing about the power.</p>
<p>Additionally, the more important unit for talking about &quot;battery power&quot; is really energy. Power describes how much energy is happening &quot;right now&quot;, whereas energy takes time into account. For example, units of Power are Watts (W), and a common unit of energy is a Watt-second (Joule) or a Watt-hour (Whr). </p>
<p>For example, if someone says I have a 500W battery, this means nothing as we don't know long the battery can produce 500W of power. Now, say that same battery can produce 500W of power for 0.5 hours. So, 500W * 0.5 hours = 250 Whr. The 250Whr is now a useful measurement of how much energy is stored in the battery. Now if we want to use the same battery to power to power a device that only needs 250W, we can determine how long the battery would last. 250Whr/250W = 1 hr. This makes sense, as a device using half the power with the same battery would last twice as long. </p>
<p>(Hopefully this helps! This is my first shot at posting in here.)

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amperes only measure current, so to say something produces 300amp is not giving us much information. However, for a battery that size, it likely means a crazy peak-power output.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, anybody who's familiar with how quickly batteries used to degrade or become damaged if you didn't treat them <em>just so</em> can appreciate just how much better batteries are these days than they used to be. It's like people who are still worried about plasma burn-in even though they solved that problem years ago.</p></div>		</li>
