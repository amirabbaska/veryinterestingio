			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a citrus fruit intolerance. I notice if someone's eating an orange within a few rooms of me (but not the direction), and if someone's eaten an orange I can't stand being in that room for a couple of hours. Can you explain that one for me, please? I mean it's specifically oranges. The smell of lemons, limes, and pineapples isn't pleasant but doesn't affect me as strongly (might not even notice the smell unless I'm within a couple of feet of them), even though if I ingested them I'd be unwell. Even orange adjacent things like nectarines i notice the smell if someone opens one but after all evidence has been consumed/removed I wouldn't notice it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah the craziness of allergies. Did you know that people who are allergic to horses will get an allergic immune respons from seeing a picture of a horse? The explanations isn't always easy or straight forward. It could be that your body have drawn a line between the smell of oranges and the allergic respons, so you are now hyper aware of that smell. The smell of oranges could be your version of the picture of the horse. You may unconsciously be looking for that smell and therefore react at the odor detection threshold. </p>
<p>I don't really have an answer to your question but citrus fruits are special. If you want to measure the VOC (volatile organic compounds) no citrus fruits can be present in the room or they completely ruin the sample by being so abundant in the air. </p>
<p>A VOC measurement is about detecting which organic compounds are present in the air. The problem with these measurements are that we react so widely different to different compounds.They have different potency to us. So simply knowing which compounds are present in which amounts isn't getting us very far. We also have to know at which levels different compounds will affect us and we really don't have that data. </p>
<p>And if someone is pealing an orange there isn't just one compound thats being released. There is an entire bouquet of compounds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bravo! Given how allergies themselves work bodies being weirdly melodramatic about even the smell makes perfect sense. Thank you very much for clearing that up for me; the orange/nectarine difference was driving me bonkers.</p></div>		</li>
