<p>The leading thoughts on CTE is not that it's caused by Concussions and big hits to the head where a player is knocked out or gets up woozy.</p>
<p>It's from small blows that no one cares about. This is why it's far more common in lineman (knock heads every play) than WRs (take big shots occasionally) </p>
<p>There is a lot of talk about removing heading the ball in youth soccer as it is believed to be a cause. </p>
<p>Any type of  sport or profession where the head is constantly getting hit will likely cause CTE. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scored a header at like 11-12 in a tournament and was sent out of the game for it and the goal was taken away. That was the angriest Iâ€™ve ever seen a coach. He was an older guy who played over in Europe as a semi pro. He obviously was a better coach than most of the coaches in youth soccer. Unfortunately for him this resulted in a bunch of scrutiny from the refs. </p></div>		</li>
