			<div class="markdown"><p>The Transverse. The muscle most men actually want when they say they want that pack. I should also mention that working out that muscle was the last and most difficult thing I every did. I wasn't pregnant (guy) but had been obese for years earlier in life. When I lost weight the effect was essentially the same (minus a few important things); that ligament was 'soft' and everything sort of dropped. No amount of weight loss or cutting would tighten it. Over the years I did manage to get a 'flat' stomach with no definition but I would occasionally still get lower back pain despite being in otherwise good shape. Then I met 'one of you' and they concluded I had somehow managed to avoid the transverse entirely. Within a month I had what it took me years on my own trying to develop. Plus no more pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what can I do about my diastasis recti if I'm in a developing country with no trained physical therapists? The only lady I tried told me I need to do crunches and I was like, ummm pretty sure that's the opposite of what I need. My OB said she's been trying to find a PT who knows how to work with diastasis recti for years.</p></div>		</li>
