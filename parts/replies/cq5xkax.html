<p>There is a difference between being trans as an endocrine condition and having gender dysphoria as a state of being mental ill. Trans as an endocrine condition requires lifelong hormone treatment and possibly surgery. Gender dysphoria as a state of mental illness typically requires social gender role transition and treatment of any associated depression, anxiety or other co-morbidities.  </p>

<p>If a person believes that they are of a different gender than their biological one</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not that a trans person is &quot;a different gender than their biological one.&quot; We don't have any definitive measurement of a person's &quot;biological gender&quot; since gender exists as an emergent property in the brain. The best measurement we have of a person's biological gender is their subjective self-reporting. And we don't have very good measures of biological sex either. So here's what's happening. </p>
<p>When a person is born, the midwife looks at the babies genitals and if they look like a vulva, then the baby is assigned female sex and girl gender. That simplistic observation is currently taken as if it were some precise, definitive measurement and it's not at all. It's just a guess. The child could have internal ovaries, or they could have testes, or they could have ovotestes. The baby can't say if it is a boy or a girl, but they are branded as boy or girl based on the guess about their sex. </p>
<p>I believe that I was born with the girl gender, but I was assigned male based on the observation of someone I will never meet. So I was born with my biological gender girl. <strong>BUT</strong>, I was assigned male sex, and therefore I was assigned the boy gender role. That mistaken sex assignment ruined my life. </p>
<p>My mental illness developed over a long period of time where I tried to live in the assigned man gender role and I did not fit there at all. It drove me insane. While some people feel the need to totally reject gender roles, I've chosen to carve out my own gender role as an independently thinking woman. </p>
<p>I hope I'm being clear here, I know the nuance can be tricky to navigate. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You're absolutely right in saying that biological gender is not well defined.  When we discuss gender, we're really discussing many distinct concepts.  There's a person's view of what gender they are, their view of what gender they should be, there's the phenotype of the primary sex characteristics, the phenotype of the secondary sex characteristics, the genotype, etc.  All of these exist on a continuum as well.  For many people, all of these genders agree, but for many they do not.  When these genders disagree, we tend to use a hierarchy in order to determine a persons &quot;true&quot; gender.  (Thus we say things like &quot;that guy is really a woman&quot;.)   The hierarchy is different for different people, and different if you are looking at yourself versus someone else.  So, for a person who has genders that disagree, it can be common to be labelled as one gender by society and a different one personally, thus leading to a crisis of identity and a resulting mental illness.  </p>
<p>But of course you already know all this.  :)  Good luck.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of people do hierarchize the elements in the set of concepts concerning gender-sex. So for some, the genitals are the top of hierarchy, for others the gonads. My belief is that hormones would typically be near or at the top of the hierarchy, since sex and reproduction depend on the correct hormone. But the fact is that many elements are needed for successful reproduction. No one can correctly say that the whole of gender-sex can be reduced to any top element, or any single element of the whole edifice. The fact that there are several variables required makes for a complex structure which demands interpretation when some of the variables conflict with others. </p>
<p>But yeah, it's a good observation that the identity crisis of gender dysphoria seems to arise from social interpretation of an individual clashing with that individual's interpretation of themself. </p></div>		</li>
