<p>Further down on the wikipedia page has the animation that shows the composite waves (eccentricity and obliquity).</p>
<p>If you really want to have fun with the equation of time, the Clock of the Long Now needed to make a device to handle the equation of time over 10,000 years.  Instead of a flat equation of time depiction its a 3d object - <a href="https://vimeo.com/54309045" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/54309045</a></p>
<p>P.S. - the daylight savings thing... that's relatively recent.  2007 in fact.  <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/us-daylight-saving-extended.html" target="_blank">https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/us-daylight-saving-extended.html</a> .</p>
<p>From 1970-1973, daylight Savings was 26 weeks (or a week longer depending on the calendar).
1974 with the oil crisis made it 42 weeks, and then it was 35 weeks in 1975... and then it settled back down to 26 weeks until 1987 where it became 29 or 30 weeks... until 2007.  That's energy policy - not astronomical.</p>
<p>Back in the 70s, the northern hemisphere daylight savings was synchronous with the southern hemisphere.  But then everyone started doing their own thing.</p></div>		</li>
