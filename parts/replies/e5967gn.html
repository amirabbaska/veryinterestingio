<p><a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1996-02664-011" target="_blank">Behavioral and glucocorticoid responses of adult domestic dogs (<em>Canis familiaris</em>) to companionship and social separation.</a> Is the one they are referring to.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume this is because of our selective breeding of dogs, or is there a more natural reason for this? Do wolves have the some positive reward for completing tasks for humans? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question, I'm sure someone with more information could provide a more detailed explanation. I actually read it originally in a magazine, I edited the source into my OP. However there seems to be a decent amount of evidence that we selected dogs that preferred us to their fellow wolves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more complicated than that. Primative dogs were not and still are not obedient and don't have the desire to please owners like modern dog breeds.</p>
<p>Selective breeding for obedience is a more modern activity. Modern as in hundreds or thousands of years.</p>
<p>30-50k years ago they didn't really document breeding, and if it was even selective.</p>
<p>There is also a lot of speculation that wolves who had lower amounts of fear actually came around human camps, then the cohabitation formed. Without documentation from 50k years ago, it's a bit of a chicken or the egg argument. Did we seek out dogs as companions or did they seek us out as a source of scrap food?</p>
<p>And wolves from 50k years ago in Africa and Asia are vastly different from wolves today. Many aren't even around anymore due to hunting practices and other causes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's forget about wolves for a moment and consider <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160912-a-soviet-scientist-created-the-only-tame-foxes-in-the-world" target="_blank">the experiment for domesticating the Siberian fox</a> . The thing is that fixes are very nervous around people, even if raised by them. Going through a selective breeding program over a good 50 plus years has resulted in animals that had no problems being around humans.</p>
<p>[We domesticated wolves at least twice over the last 40000 years]( <a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-07-dog-domestication-theories-wolves.html" target="_blank">https://phys.org/news/2017-07-dog-domestication-theories-wolves.html</a>). Would we have known enough to select the cute wolf cub that was not scared around humans? The Belyayev fox experiment was by modern geneticist not primitive man.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the wording is a bit farfetched. <em>completing tasks for humans</em> could also just mean <em>doing their part in the group</em>.</p>
<p>A dog that belongs to a pack of dogs would probably get more reward from following the pack leader and doing collective actions than to complete a task for some human. </p>
<p>The thing is that most dogs consider their owners the pack leader and look at other dogs as outsiders, belonging to rival packs. </p>
<p>Except when you see someone walking their dog and the dog is dragging the owner along, then the dog considers himself the pack leader. </p></div>		</li>
