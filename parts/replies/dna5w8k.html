			<div class="markdown"><p>That mass transfer thing is very important. If you want to burn yourself with 200° air, use a fan. Try holding your hand in front of a hair dryer. The air coming out may only be 140° - 160° but there's so much of it, it feels really hot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the size of the bath of water.  Thermal conduction through a non-viscous liquid is extraordinarily fast.  Heat transfer coefficients for convection of gases depend more on fluid velocity than those for liquids.  So you're absolutely correct, but it's not as apparent with liquids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, we've finally found an experiment I'm not going to run.  I actually don't know the heat capacity of mercury, and I'm running late to the lab but this certainly sounds right.  </p>
<p>I use this principle all the time to defrost chicken quickly. Run hot tap water in a baking dish, place frozen chicken breasts in the water.  Have fully thawed chicken 7-12 minutes later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While there certainly is correlation between density and the rate with which heat transfers, why use a proxy variable instead of the actual metic, heat conductivity? For example: wood, also commonly found in saunas, has a density comparable to water, but won't burn you the way water would.</p>
<p>&quot;While the temperature of the water and the air is the same, water conducts heat much better and therefore burns you quicker&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
