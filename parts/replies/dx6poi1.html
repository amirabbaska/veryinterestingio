			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypothesis: the requirement for insulation from the cold (hair, fur, thick skin, layers of fat) directly opposes the effectiveness of venomous bites and stings, and so venom provides less survival advantage in cold climates.</p>
<p>Thoughts? Any supporting evidence for this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you say that it is, however, correct to suggest that terrestrial Arctic dwellers are, on average, less venomous, due to the fact that they're mostly endotherms, and endotherms are less likely to be venemous?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Then there are some jellyfish, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion%27s_mane_jellyfish" target="_blank">Lion's mane jellyfish</a> which are present. There might also be other venomous marine taxa of note.</p>
<p>It's also worth taking in consideration that the arctic is mostly marine and occupied by the Arctic Ocean (as opposed to the Antarctic which is a continent).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm being a bit pedantic here, but arent &quot;under ground&quot; hornets called yellow jackets? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most venomous/poisonous animals are not birds/mammals. Birds and mammals are the only animals well suited for polar regions.</p>
<p>Most venomous/poisonous animals selected that characteristic as a defense or predatory mechanism due to small relative size (larger snakes reticulate), and most polar animals tend to be larger (see polar gigantism and its antithesis insular dwarfism). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you explain what you mean by this please? I thought reticulate referred to the net-like pattern on pythons.</p></div>		</li>
