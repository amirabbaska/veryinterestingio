			<div class="markdown"><p>That's strange because there is a prescription medicine called desoxyn, <em>in which the active ingredient is methamphetamine</em>, <a href="https://www.drugs.com/comments/methamphetamine/desoxyn.html" target="_blank">here are some reviews from several patients on the drug</a> (it is usually reserved for patients who other medications do not work for them). Most prescription users of the drug, experience little to no consequences, on the other hand they actually experience very positive effects towards their conditions. </p>
<p>Here is another example of it's medicinal use: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584615000469" target="_blank">The neuroprotective potential of low-dose methamphetamine in preclinical models of stroke and traumatic brain injury</a></p>
<p>The risks associated with methamphetamine abuse come more from the <strong>dosage</strong> used (several hundred milligrams are consumed in recreational users vs. 5-30mg in prescribed dosages), the <strong>route of administration</strong> (abusers smoke the drug, prescription users take it orally), staying up for several days on the drug causes <strong>sleep deprivation</strong> that comes with it's own set of effects, and individuals with methamphetamine use problems <strong>disregard personal health and hygiene</strong> (i.e. stop brushing teeth, showering,etc). </p>
<p><strong>Those factors alone without the methamphetamine would still induce many of the issues associated with methamphetamine abuse.</strong> The fact that the drug is prescribed and a safe, useful medicine for some; supports the fact that <em>we need legitimate drug education globally to prevent the abuse of these drugs and promote safe usage to avoid serious consequences in drug users.</em>  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a psychedelic user I must highly disagree with substances having such a high risk of dependency being &quot;Safe&quot;. If you can get physically addicted - it's not safe. That's a risk you have to manage yourself by reducing your long term exposure to the substance and controlling your dosages. I say &quot;as a psych user&quot; because the lethal dose range and addiction potential for psychs is slim to zero. I would very much like to draw that parallel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And because I need to explain it to a 5 yr old, here is the simplified spiel. You naturally have detoxers in your body because you deal with poisons and radicals every day. Oxygen becomes a radical when your body wants to kill something foreign. Look up asbestos, and why people die due to inhaling a non-living fiber. Your body keeps doing the radical shooting at the foreign substance thinking its gonna die, but never does. Your normal cells then gain these radicals and you start fucking up stop and start mechanisms (there are many) and so you end up getting cancerous cells. Now your detoxers regularly deal with other things like bacteria or virus you encounter. They are your garbage people of the body. Now imagine throwing 50x more garbage in your body than you're used to. THere's no where to put it, and some of that stored stuff mutates skin to not regrow. The other thing is that your detoxers help you normally stay young looking by killing cells and other mechanisms help regrowth by keeping them in a cycle. When they are busy with something else, you don't get to turn over your cells for new growth and so you get wrinkles etc. </p></div>		</li>
