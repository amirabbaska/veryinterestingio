			<div class="markdown"><p>You could control for other confounding factors,  such as household income,  family side,  urban vs rural. A study could certainly shed light on whether it's likely cultural difference come into play.  Of course,  it's never 100% conclusive,  but you can certainly make a relatively controlled study!
