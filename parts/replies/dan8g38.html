			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat a myth.  It's going to cycle the air either way.  People tend to over think about hot air rising or pushing the hot air down.  The only difference will be in the first few moments after you turn it on after that the air in the room is going to be thoroughly mixed either way.  Picture a torus that is constantly turning inside out, and take a slice out of that and you've got a circulation path. Profiles of the sliced torus shape: OVO or OAO (close as I can figure up arrow at the moment since the carrot creates ^supertext.) Either way circulates air to more or less even out over time.</p>
<p>The bigger part of it is, is it pushing air precisely where you want air to be pushed?</p>
<p>Explanation: Pulling air up will cause air near the walls to be moving downward.  Pushing air down will cause air near the walls to move upward.  </p>
<p>If you're dozing on the couch that sits right underneath of the fan, it will feel cooler to the person because the air is being pushed directly over them.</p>
<p>If the sofa is against the wall the person lying there won't get as much of a direct blast and will not be cooled as much if the fan is blowing down.</p>
<p>That will be reversed with the reversal of the fan.  The fan blowing up will cause a downdraft by the wall and make that location feel cooler, and the middle of the room will have the most dissipated airflow.</p>
<p>The one exception:  Because the fan is on the ceiling, one direction the fan won't move as much air around all parts of the room just because of fluid dynamics of the air.  If the fan were perfectly in the middle of the room for height, it would be an even flow in most places of the room in either direction(excepting for slight variances if the roof is vaulted vs the flat floor).</p>
<p>If we're going to split hairs that much though, the furniture plays a large part in how the air flows as well as irregularities, such as the fan not being centered in room, or a dividing wall or counter-top island.</p>
<p>Here's another example of the differences it can make.  A fan blowing directly down onto the dining room table will cool off the food much faster.  Blowing up, it's sucking air from all around the table, turbulence may even create a vacuum really close to the table trapping some heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're certainly right about it not really making much of a difference to the mixing of the air - where it does make a difference is the feeling of being blown on. Fans, and people are usually situated more centrally in a room.</p>
<p>In warmer seasons being fanned directly is favourable (although some still don't like that even in summer.) In winter, and especially homes with mixed ceiling heights it's a good idea to use the fan to help circulate warm air, but it can be a bit chilly to have the fan blowing air directly onto the people below.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know that that is a fact.  In a lot of cases furniture, and therefore people, are situated near walls. This is why I tried to explain it both ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much! I get upvotes here and there but don't really care, but a comment really does a <del>body</del> mind good.</p>
<p>I know I am far from the best, but often people don't bother, so eh, I do what I can when the mood strikes.  Sometimes it makes sense and people get it and that's where I really appreciate a positive comment.  Reassuring me that I'm still sane, at least, for now. :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Summer: blow air towards the ground, speed dependent on how hot it is. This helps you feel cooler since you're able to expel more heat by taking advantage of forced convection. Think of a heatsink with and without a fan; the fan helps force air across the heatsink while also carrying warm air away from it.</p>
<p>Winter: blow air towards ceiling, low speed. This helps move colder air upwards, forcing the warmer air down and potentially utilizing forced convection from the attic or upstairs to the room (not sure how significant of an effect this would be). The ceiling helps evenly disperse the air movement (becoming not-very-directional), meaning you lose less heat to the air.</p>
<p>That's how I've thought of it, coming from an engineering background in school. I may be overstating some of the heat transfer effects  so feel free to correct me.     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The winter mode is pretty much necessary for homes which have pitched ceilings or multiple levels (where one level can become noticeably warmer than the lower levels.)</p>
<p>I find even in regular, single story homes that there is an advantage to running the fan in winter - the room does seem to feel more evenly heated.</p></div>		</li>
