			<div class="markdown"><p>They are calling modern humans Homo Sapiens and assigning their time span to the last hundred thousand years.</p>
<p>Before that was Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalis, and others. We descended from tree dwelling primates in Africa. There are many identified species since then. Almost all are gone now.</p>
<p>Homo erectus used stone tools and fire. They spread out of Africa. But our species came out of Africa much more recently. They encountered Homo neanderthalis in Europe. Both species used tools  and fire.</p></div>		</li>
