			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no way to elicit that feeling without doing anything in particular.  You must somehow stimulate the release of the endogenous neurotransmitter.  </p>
<p>As I stated above, one of the easiest and most common ways is to run for enough time to experience a runner's high.  As /u/2014justin stated below, you could also deprive yourself of sleep, which will lead to a hallucinogenic state.  I don't recommend this course of action, as sleep deprivation can be extremely unpleasant.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, but what about the case of inhibiting enzymes that break down a given neurotransmitter?</p>
<p>For example, wouldn't being on a selective fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor cause you to get high on (an otherwise normal amount) of Anandamide because it's no longer being broken down?</p></div>		</li>
