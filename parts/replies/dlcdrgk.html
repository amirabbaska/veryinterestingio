			<div class="markdown"><p>Former criminal lawyer here. To answer the other part of your question, why cant they be used in court? Well they can be, if both parties agree to it before the test. Occasionally we will have clients take the test even if the other side doesn't agree to it in order to convince the prosecutor to offer a better plea or dismiss the case before trial. This happens occasionally in child molest cases, which are by their nature very high stakes, very low on tangible evidence, and highly prone to error. </p>
<p>Without an agreement they are completely barred from use because they are <em>very</em> unreliable. It's legal to use them outside of a criminal case however because the law makes a distinction between the level of evidence necessary to deal with matters of money(civil court, where employment cases are handled) and matters of liberty (criminal court). If you want to get into the civil uses of a lie detector it's a lot more complicated than that and I'm not the one to ask but I think that's a pretty fair simplification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very unreliable is an understatement. They have 43% accuracy. Which is lower than flipping a coin. Polygraphs are one of the most stupid inventions that people actually believe, </p></div>		</li>

<p>Coin flips would be more reliable. Just get a witch doctor in the courtroom for more believable results. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to piggy back on this - they're very unreliable and a jury is very likely to take a polygraph as conclusive. It's the high degree of difference between how accurate these tests are and how seriously people take them.</p>
<p>When used for hiring practices, I would imagine the people who are using them are aware they are unreliable tests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been polygraphed as a private citizen being investigated for a crime I had nothing to do with. I knew damn well the results were inadmissible. They pulled the same bullshit about one of my answers being &quot;inconclusive.&quot; I didn't lie and didn't know anything so it was interesting to see them try to scare me. They were trying to find who robbed the bar I worked at. I legitimately didn't know and didn't care. As far as I know they never solved the crime. </p>
<p>Lie detectors are just an interrogation tool that work on stupid people because they believe they're real and they confess. Cops aren't as good at their jobs as the ones on TV. They mostly just try to catch people red handed or attempt to solicit confessions. If you commit a crime and aren't still there when the police show up you're pretty likely to get away with it provided you don't do anything stupid. Police are too busy writing speeding tickets to put effort into solving real crimes. There are 10 times as many ticket writers as there are detectives. If you want proof just go into traffic court one day and look at all the people lined up to pay fines. The real courts only go through a few cases a day and they're usually people who got caught in the act or immediately after. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Or if you stole from the 'wrong person', usually defined as a person that contributed to the governor's, senator's, or judge's re-election campaign or a close personal friend, relative, or fuckhole of one of the above.  Can also include someone well-connected in the business community that hasn't donated to induce such a donation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I had some stuff stolen from my apartment and I was really suprised at how useless the cops were. The cop's main suggestion was to set up a hidden camera so that I could catch the person red-handed next time they robbed me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is there any benefit at all to using one?</p>
<p>They could just say they hired someone else and that's the end of that. If they need a reason they can say they fit better with the team or something equally pointless? Every other company manages to come up with reasons not to hire people they don't like without resorting to protected classes as a reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Police departments are slightly different than companies in their hiring processes. They have to deal with federal/state/county/city rules and regulations on the hiring of government employees. There are also police unions involved. All of these add red tape, rules and regulations, and recordkeeping requirements. (I know, I know, three things that mean the same thing, but you get the point). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Protection against discrimination lawsuits. If they don't give a reason, then it's left up to the imagination of the applicant and his lawyer, and  other reasons can be interpreted as discriminatory. The poly provides a nice &quot;safe&quot; reason to not hire someone. Public employers seem to be more prone to discrimination lawsuits than private employers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except it is legal in the United States to factor in race or sex when hiring if you can show that the characteristic would significantly impact the ability for the person to do his or her job (as well as his/her safety).</p>
<p>Some common examples are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only hiring a minority (black) male actor to portray Martin Luther King Junior in a biopic would be permissable.</li>
<li>Only hiring a minority male LEO if you're looking to fill an inner-city undercover position.</li>
<li>Only hiring female prison guards to patrol female sections of a prison.</li>
</ol>
<p>The law enforcement agency can't be like &quot;we just want white guys because we're a bunch of racists.&quot;  But if they can make an argument that skin color or gender would significantly impact the ability of the applicant to do his or her job (i.e. ability to fit in and make community connections), then chances are they can allow it to be a major factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tested for Washington State Patrol about 9 years ago. I passed the polygraph and the tester told me I had passed. He congratulated me on making it to the '4th phase' - the physical test.</p>
<p>A few weeks later when WSP sent me a letter telling me I failed the polygraph specifically. I was expecting the letter for the next step but I was floored When I read that I failed.</p>
<p>When I called the WSP contact on the paper and informed them that I had passed; congratulated even, I was told he would call me back. He was surprised I used the verbiage they used for successful completion. He called back and told me I failed but would not tell me why or how when I asked, even though I was told I passed.</p>
<p>Edit: cleaned up wording.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird, where I worked (Maine) our process started with the physical and finished with the poly. </p>
<p>Each state is different, I just know that the PT test wiped like, 75% of the applicants out, so it makes the rest of the hiring process run faster.</p></div>		</li>
