			<div class="markdown"><p>This is known as breaking length. The diameter of the rod doesn't matter as long as it's constant (i.e. not a cone shape). A material can withstand up to a certain stress before failing, stress is force (weight in this case) divided by cross-section area. So:</p>
<p>σ = F / A = m g / A</p>
<p>But mass is density times volume: σ = m g / A = g ρ V / A</p>
<p>And volume is cross-section area times length:</p>
<p>σ = g ρ L <del>A</del> / <del>A</del></p>
<p>σ = g ρ L</p>
<p>So if you know the maximum stress that the rod can withstand (which is a property of the material it's made of), you can calculate the breaking length because it only depends on density and gravity.</p>
<p>L<em><em>max</em></em> =  σ<em><em>max</em></em> / g ρ</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a table of the breaking lengths of several materials. For common engineering metals it's in the order of 10 to 20 km. Note: this is pure theory, we know a shorter rod will collapse in practice because of manufacturing imperfections.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The rod would break under the force of gravity at it's structurally weakest point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. If it is hanging it will be governed by its ultimate tensile strength. If it's self supported on the ground, it will buckle at a much shorter length under its own self weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to consider buckling. For a 10cm cylindrical iron column, the max height before buckling occurs is only 23.74 meters, which is way shorter than the height required to hit the ultimate strength, so buckling will be the predominant failure mode that you have to be concerned about. Wiki has a pretty good page with the relevant equations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-buckling" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have to consider stability as well. This includes buckling, crippling,  etc, <em>depending on cross section of the tube</em></p></div>		</li>
