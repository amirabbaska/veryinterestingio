<p>For the purposes of OP's question, it sort of is. Both are good sources of black-body radiation. A camp-fire is simply too cold to produce a significant amount of UV light.</p>
<p>If you decided to burn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicyanoacetylene" target="_blank">Dicyanoacetylene</a> instead of wood in your camp fire, it would likely produce Vitamin D and sunburns.</p>
<p>As a side note, Camera flashes are generally hotter than the sun and produce significant amounts of UV radiation. Most have a UV filter installed, but the filter can be removed if you are specifically interested in taking UV photographs.</p></div>		</li>
