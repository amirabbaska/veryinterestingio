			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly different. Time restricted eating (Tre) is only eating at certain times. It doesn't mean fasting for longer than traditional fasting. Intermittent fasting (if) is long periods without eating while Tre is windows of eating. Example: Tre =eating at 30 minute windows at 8:00, 13:30 and 1800. While IF is: I'm going to stop eating at bedtime and won't eat again til at least 14:00 tomorrow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that if you keep doing intermittent fasting your body will eventually adjust to that point you neither gain nor loose weight. Can you say something about that? You say that you lost 50 pounds that sounds amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should point out that I lost that weight over the course of like 5 months and I was working out literally every single day. So it definitely takes a lot of hard work and dedication.</p>
<p>In terms of losing weight, it’s all calories. As long as you keep lowering your calories, you’ll keep losing weight. However you will reach a plateau at some point. You’ll drop weight fast at first then it will get harder and harder.</p>
<p>Honestly it’s all about consistency. You can’t falter or cheat at all. You have to stick with it every single day. And working out on top of that will certainly help. Never underestimate the power of exercise.</p></div>		</li>
