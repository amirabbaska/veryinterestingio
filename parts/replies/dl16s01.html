			<div class="markdown"><p>Now, just to be clear that you and I are talking about the same phenomenon, i want to clarify that microsaccades are happening constantly and you probably won't notice them in yourself. You will see it in someone else's eyes if you look closely. If your speaking about a more dramatic and infrequent eye movement, it's something else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I guess we are talking about two different things. This is definitely noticeable by yourself. It is like you have lost control of your eyes and they rapidly move from left to right maybe 5-10 times in a period of 1 sec. It maybe happens five times a year for me. It is so rare and is over so quick (1 sec out of my day) that I never bothered to question it until now. It's looking like there is no term for it unless someone has found something in these comments that I haven't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak for OP, but the same thing I think he's describing happens to me as well. It's very infrequent, but you definitely notice when you lose control of your eyes for the split second. It's a very quick left-to-right around 3 times or so.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not entirely true.  They are most likely to happen when they <em>need</em> to happen.</p>
<p>The issue is that the visual system actively filters out things that stay in one spot on the back of the eye (the retina).  That's because you actually have structures <em>inside</em> your eye that you would see otherwise.  That would be annoying, so the brain &quot;deletes&quot; them from what you see, haha. </p>
<p>Now, when you move your eyes around and look at things, or when you're moving yourself, what your retina &quot;sees&quot;--the image on the back of your eye--is different second to second.  There's no need for a literal eye shake-up, because the scene is changing on its own.</p>
<p>You are more likely to get microsaccades when you focus on one spot for too long and don't move your eyes from that spot.  The brain starts filtering stuff out because it thinks it's just noise rather than meaningful signal.</p>
<p>Try it, reddit: focus on one spot for as long as you can.  You should notice a few things: </p>
<ol>
<li>Objects in your peripheral vision (i.e., off to the sides of what you're actually looking at) begin to fade.</li>
<li>It becomes hard to keep your eyes still.  You may even notice a little shake that brings those fading objects back.  That's a microsaccade.</li>
<li>You'll probably get dry eyes.  That's unrelated, though.  haha</li>
</ol></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fun trick to do is to close one eye and hold the other still by pressing gently but firmly on your eyelid with your indexes. Wait 15ish seconds and you will go blind (temporarily lol) because of sensory adaptation**</p>
<p>**can't remember the exact term but it sounds like that</p></div>		</li>
