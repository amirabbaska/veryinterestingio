			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm.. if the light is redshifted, then it has less energy than it began with. Does the source of gravity then gain that energy? If so, in what form, extra mass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question; but remember that a thing can have different amounts of energy as seen from different frames of reference.  For example, a moving object has kinetic energy, but someone moving alongside it with the same velocity will see it as stationary and therefore not having any kinetic energy.  If you want to talk about a loss of energy that would require something else to gain the energy, you need to specify which frame of reference you're using for the whole calculation.  In other words: the light might not have any less energy than it started with; it's just being seen from a different frame of reference when it arrives, a frame of reference as seen from which maybe it always had that lower amount of energy.

<p>Edit: I tried reading your comment again to see if it would make more sense to me the second time. That was when I realised i am a cat and I should be playing with a ball of yarn and not try to use reddit or understand what particles can and cannot do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>lets say that the light has x amount of energy before it enters the gravotational field of the black hole.You are saying that when it leaves the field it has y amount of energy with y&lt;x meaning that it has decreased frequency? But later it regains the same frequency as when it had x energy meaning  that it received an amount of energy that equals x-y?
If i see this correctly whats the source of that energy? </p></div>		</li>
