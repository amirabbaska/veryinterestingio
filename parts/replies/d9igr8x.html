<p>Edit: Something like ferrofluids and magnets or oobleck and audio excitation might be applicable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that's the right question. I suspect that there are no shortcuts between particle pairs because we're really only seeing two aspects of a single particle. For analogy, consider a universe of coins. It might look like some particles are &quot;head&quot; particles and others are &quot;tail&quot; particles. Entanglement might be like introducing a mirror into the situation and suddenly we see what appear to be pairs of particles that have a magical property of always being opposites of each other no matter how far apart they appear. The right question would then be &quot;Can we create a pilot-wave analog with entanglement-like effects?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there any videos observing more than one droplet at once? I'm probably stating the obvious (or the incorrect), but if you used a two pronged fork to generate two droplets simultaneously, maybe that would create a decent analogy. Or somehow splitting a droplet in mid bounce, like with a hydrophobicly coated razor just above it? </p>
<p>This concept of modeling quantum mechanics is relatively new to me (although I've been a fan of cymatics for some time, since having done an AP physics project on cymatic effects on shear thickening fluid), so I apologize if these suggestions make no sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me this is the main question. As I understand Quantum Mechanics, its main feature is that it works not in our usual Euclidean 3D space, but on a Hilbert space of wave functions. This means that even if oil droplets may successfully simulate single-particle wave-function, it's very unlikely that this will work for a wave-function of multiple entangled particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>for you to make the jump you need to understand chaos theory and the short periodic orbit decomposition. Basically, a chaotic system in 'real euclidian 3D' will generate a set of quantized 'orbits' (in the assumption these periodic orbits exist in that system). Then the decomposition of the path is always 'shadowing' the PO and the set of POs is your 'hilbert space'.  Please do take the time to browse 'chaosbook.org' as it shows this step clearly.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Thank you for the link -- I wasn't aware of this theory. I am sorry for my skepticism, but why is this chaosbook.org look like an amature website from 1990s? Why is it not a normal book or at least a set of journal papers?</p>
<p>Also, do I understand correctly, that you are implying that under QM there may be a classical layer? If so, do you, for example, believe that quantum computer is impossible? (Because if it is, then there's a contradiction: quantum computer can't be efficiently simulated by Turing machine, but classical mechanics can.)</p></div>		</li>
