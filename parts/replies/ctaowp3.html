			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way to get around the re-buffering is to switch to the HTML5 player on YouTube. Simply go to youtube.com/html5 and click on the &quot;Switch to HTML5 player&quot; button. The videos load faster, and once buffered, you don't need to worry about DASH playback.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll take a crack at trying to explain this a bit better.</p>
<p>DASH is a system that lets multiple different &quot;qualities&quot; all exist in the same &quot;stream&quot; (kind of, this is all very simplified). So what happens is first a 480p stream might start, and you will get 10 seconds of that buffered, then it will decide to upgrade you to 720p, and that will start buffering from a point which it will decide so that playback isn't interrupted.</p>
<p>The grey bar only shows the lowest quality stream. So while you may have 30 seconds of 480p video buffered, you may only have 9 seconds of 720p video (which starts 3 seconds from now), and beyond that you may have 3 seconds of 1080p video starting to buffer as well (basically 12 seconds out). So if you click in any parts that don't have the 1080p stream (since you were just upgraded to that, it is what the browser knows is your &quot;optimum&quot; streaming rate), you will have to re-buffer that data (for the first time).</p>
<p>Now imagine you are at 1080p in a video, and you want to go back 10 seconds. You may not have had 1080p at that point in the video, so it will need  to re-buffer that 1080p (again, that it may have never actually downloaded in the first place).</p>
<p>So there are very few places that you actually have the video you are watching cached because DASH playback is optimized to have to send as little of it as possible to save on both your and Youtube's bandwidth.</p>
<p>Edit: to expand, DASH can potentially have MANY different qualities in between the ones you can choose, so there could potentially be 5 720p &quot;qualities&quot; that can be adjusted constantly.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Nuked all my comments, y'all are a bunch of angry motherfuckers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would think it would start playing the bad quality stream then, but even if the gray bar goes from start to finish it rebuffers, or if I rewind back on a portion I have already looked at it might rebuffer. It's just weird.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why don't it play the low quality already buffered while the 1080p is not loaded yet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd rather stare at blank screen than 480p. Is it potentially possible to 'force' the browser to only be willing to accept the highest quality stream, and simply not play anything until the entire video is available at that quality?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So when Magic Actions for Youtube on Chrome gives me the options to always load videos in 1080p it's lying to me and that video is actually only in 720p?  Not disagreeing with you I'm genuinely curious here. I have faster internet now so I would consider getting rid of that add-on if it's only playing in 720p. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See this is one pf those thing to say Fuck you Youtube over, I live out in the sticks, shit internet always. No matter what I can never get 60 FPS or anything over 480, yet now I also cannot preload videos so I can actually watch them, I, if i even try, end up watching a 5 minute video that stalls a dozen times to buffer.</p>
<p>Long story short, a decade ago Youtube worked better and was a more advanced piece of work than today. Fuck their bandwidth, mine, the user, is far more &quot;constricted&quot; than they are.</p></div>		</li>
