			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight clarification - the pit isn't all that 'dangerously' radioactive.  It'd be a very poor design that constantly radiates energy, damaging the pit, setting off little unsustainable fission chains, and generally releasing its energy early.</p>
<p>The whole point of a nuclear warhead is to creative massive compression that makes the mass super-critical, while allowing it to sit in a very safe sub-critical state.  If they didn't care about that, they'd just use a ton of plutonium and make plutonium-bullet type bombs instead of implosion bombs.</p>
<p>Unless you're talking about the Tritium in boosted-core weapons.  But while Tritium is fairly 'radioactive,' the energy of the beta particles released is so low a sheet of paper would be sufficient shielding.  As is your skin.  As long as you don't consume the stuff it's really not dangerous to people at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand your point.  I was trying to keep it at the 5-year-old level.  I could go into a more highly detailed description (as some others have done here) but I think people who use the ELI5 prefix in the title want something that can be understood in a brief reading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fair, and generally speaking I very much prefer people taking your approach - a lot of ELI5 stuff is not written with the proper audience in mind.</p>
<p>It just didn't strike me as a necessary simplification as much as unnecessary misinformation.  Like if I was describing how a car worked and I mentioned filling the gas tank with &quot;dangerous, explosive gasoline.&quot;  Gasoline <em>can</em> explode, but all the same we don't consider it dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pits usually need to be sent to Los Alamos or the Pantex plant to change out the tritium (assuming a deuterium-tritium core) because of its ~12 year half life.  </p></div>		</li>
