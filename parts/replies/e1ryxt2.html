			<div class="markdown"><p>Most probable state being the most stable state was pretty astounding to me. It was some example of a molecular structure and the possibilities of potential structures depending where the sidechain/other molecules were attached. It was super neat that I could physically tell with my eyes and  by just calculating the permutations that certain conformation would be the most stable molecular structure, and that i didnt have to touch energetics at all. </p>
<p>Another thing is that i was able to actually have a visual understanding of entropy by the end of the course. </p>
<p>It’s been five years since the course but stat mech was definitely an eye opening discipline of looking at matter for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait wait wait. Are you talking about <a href="https://www.google.hr/search?q=conservative+forces&amp;oq=conservative+forces&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.6119j1j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">conservative forces</a>.</p>
<p>Does that mean that an exact differential is one where the function is independent of the path between the present and final state? E.g. gravity or electromagnetism</p>
<p>Where the inexact differential would be the opposite? E.g. heat or ...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are related. Stokes' theorem from vector calculus can be generalized in terms of differential forms (see the first equation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem" target="_blank">here</a>). It relates the integral of a (k+1)-form over some volume to the integral of a k-form over the <em>boundary</em> of that volume.</p>
<p>If ω in that equation is an exact k-form, then it can be written as dα, where α is some (k-1)-form. Then since d^(2) = 0, dω = d(dα) = 0, and the integral vanishes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To make this a little more explicit, a 1-form is exact if and only if it is conservative i.e. if the integral over each path depends only on the base points of the path. One implication is shown by Stoke's theorem, the other by explicit construction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stokes theorem is perhaps the most beautiful formula I've seen in the five years studying mathematics. The formula has such a simple form considering the theorem is so powerful and deep. I am still fascinated by the math you need in the proof.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar. The work done by a force is W =  ∫ F <em> dx. In general this depends on the path taken because the integrand F</em>dx is not an exact differential. If F is a conservative force however then it can be written as the gradiant of some potential function, i.e. F = -∇U. Then the work integrand is exact: W = -  ∫ ∇U * dx = - ∫ dU = - ΔU and the work only depends on the path endpoints.</p></div>		</li>
