<p>One reason you might think that all math has been discovered is that you haven't been acquainted with how large and strange the mathematical universe is.</p>

<p>I think that's a large part of the problem with trying to learn mathematics and why a lot of people struggle with it. There just isn't enough context provided to give you an idea of what mathematics is as a whole for the purpose of the parts to make sense.</p>
<p>If more mathematicians spent more time asking &quot;how can I make your first step have as much hindsight as my last step&quot; rather than &quot;how can I fix this proof&quot; then they'd have many more people sticking it out with mathematics and as a result more mathematicians working on the harder problems.</p></div>		</li>
