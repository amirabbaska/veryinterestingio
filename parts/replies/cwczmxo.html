<p>So the only way to make a stocking that won't tear is to either make a thread that thin that will never break...</p>

<p>Would kevlar thread fit this requirement if money were no object?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Making a thread that will never break isn't possible as far as I know, but you can use a thread of higher tensile strength (breaking/tearing due to stretching).</p>

<p>Switching to kevlar would the tensile strength by about a factor of 4, but I'm not sure that material strength is the deciding factor here. There's a whole lot of thread in one pair of stockings and a failure almost anywhere will cause a run so it's likely that the quality of manufacturing is the more significant factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tensile strength alone won't do it, since a thin thread snagged on something sharp is subject to enough concentrated force that even kevlar is unlikely to survive.  Kevlar can be cut with scissors, after all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kevlar is extremely resistant to stretching, 2% or less before it breaks, coupled with it's strength that makes it pretty useful for sails, lines on boats, climbing ropes and bullet-proof vests, but probably not stockings, unless you want them to be all floppy, or like silk, back to garter belts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is, kevlar doesn't stretch. It also tends to fray around the edges. </p>
<p>I had a pair of kevlar shoelaces once, for a pair of shoes that tended to wear out normal laces in a couple months. The kevlar laces were really uncomfortable, as they had no give to them whatsoever. It was like strapping a board to the top of my feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there is a better way of knitting. I have no idea about the correct English translation for it, in German it is called &quot;wirken&quot;. </p>

<p>The products are pretty stretchy (although not as stretchy as knitted) and do not &quot;run&quot;. You can also buy stockings that were manufactured this way.</p></div>		</li>
