			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your answer. I apologize for the lack of clarity. </p>
<p>I had in mind the case of a family I used to hang out with. They had a rare condition that made them grow additional bones.
That made me wonder how do doctors and scientists draw the line between a genetic disease that must be cured and one that is the natural course of evolution. </p>
<p>The same idea in a reversed scenario, a doctor studies an anatomy book from the 16th century. Let's pretend that minor yet observable changes occured in human anatomy in such a short time specifically in that family. How do they know that this family is developping a trait due to evolution (one trait that the doctors and scientists didn't) or that it is a disease that must be cured?</p>
<p>Edit: Their disease was not a source of pain. One of them went through plastic surgery. One of these extra bones in his wrist was &quot;pointing out&quot; thus having a bulge that looked unusual. Nothing health related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the trait allows them to mate more prolifically, and thus create a larger generation of trait holders who in turn mate more prolifically, and this continues until virtually everyone in the species has the trait, then that trait is being selected for in an evolution kind of way.</p>
<p>If the trait doesn't give any mating or survival advantage, and thus does not proliferate through the entire species, then it's an anomaly.  </p>
<p>*edit - If it causes them physical pain, social stigma, or some other harm, it would be treated like a disease to be cured.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then how is being born without wisdom teeth an evolutionary trait and not an anomaly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The distinction here is that &quot;genetic disorder&quot; is a medical term and &quot;evolution&quot; is a biological/evolutionary biology term.  </p>
<p>Fundamentally, something is considered a disease in humans if we don't like it and want to fix it.  Evolution is <em>any</em> change in the frequency of genes in a population.  So the two aren't mutually exclusive.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mutations, or genetic anomalies, occur all of the time.  Mostly they are bad, with cancer being the most common result.  But some mutations are good, some bad, and some neutral.  Natural selection takes over to determine whether the mutation has an effect on the species as a whole.  If the mutation causes you to die before you can have children and pass it along then the mutation ends there.  If it is neutral then it may survive or not as life is somewhat random.  If it is a very positive mutation, by increasing the odds of survival or increasing the odds of it being passed to the next generation, then it may survive long enough to become an established trait of the species.</p>
<p>It should be noted that modern civilization and modern medicine have really changed the dynamic of natural selection as people born with negative mutations may now survive and pass on those negative mutations to the next generation where that probably wouldn't have happened in the past.</p></div>		</li>
