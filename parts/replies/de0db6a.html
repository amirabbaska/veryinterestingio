			<div class="markdown"><p>This also makes sense, thank you for the clear and specific info. However, based on what I feel in my nose (less than entirely scientific), it seems more like the mucous is draining or being absorbed rather than my nasal airways just expanding to bypass it, so I'm not sure if this is a full explanation.</p>
<p>I don't generally <em>sniff</em> capsaicin (if my nose needs clearing, I'll just eat a slice of raw onion), but next time I do this, I will check in the mirror.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this seems like the best answer. often when a nose is stopped up it isn't actually packed full of phlegm, the sinus cavities are inflamed and swollen tight. that's why you can blow your nose and not much more than watery mucus runs out. spicy food, hot beverages, scotch, all help temporarily dilate those channels. as to why that happens, I dunno. science.</p></div>		</li>
