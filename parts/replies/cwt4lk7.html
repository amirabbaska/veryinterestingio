			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there, one point of clarification is that the bags are certainly not airtight. In fact, they are designed to allow oxygen to flow in so that the lettuce can respire properly. All fresh produce plastic packaging is intentionally low barrier because the veggies stay freshest in (edit: specific oxygen/CO2 ) compositions. The temperature is tightly controlled though to discourage growth of bacteria. </p>
<p>Edit: To clarify, the target O2 concentration is lower than that of the atmosphere, but in order to keep it at the optimal level the packaging needs to have OTR (oxygen transmission rate) as close as possible to the respiration rate of the lettuce. If O2 is too high, it causes damage, and if CO2 is too high, it also causes damage. Gotta keep it just right, goldilocks style.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have these now. Ive gotten aquarium fish shipped to me across the country, and they come completely sealed in bags with no air in them at all. The bags are made of a special type of plastic (called breather bags) with pore sizes the right size to make it want to pull oxygen from the atmosphere and put it into the water inside the bag, and to do the reverse with carbon dioxide. Its pretty crazy technology.  They add a couple pieces of chemical absorbing pellets to deal with the fish wastes, and the fish are fine to survive in these two cup of water size bags for days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha I guess. I'd like to explain a bit more, but if you google low-barrier polymers, you can get a wealth of information. The proprietary bit comes into play with how my company combines such polymers and in what ratios and thicknesses. </p>
<p>Perforations are another method to get gas exchange, and that literally just means poking tiny holes in the film, which is not so magical </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every plastic has different gas exchange properties and for every product you pick a polymer for your package that provides the correct gas exchange ratio (as well as the clarity you're looking for and other cosmetic features)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true.  I used to work at a plastic printing company and we made bags for all kinds of vegetables.  It was a common process to have them go through a machine that made teeny tiny holes with lasers for the reasons that you stated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>keeping the 'cold chain' together is very important... (i have about 12 years of grocery experience, and ran a produce department for a few years of that)... </p>
<p>we made it policy that our salads and lettuce had to be put in the cooler within 15 minutes of it landing on the dock. if lettuce gets warm, it will wilt much quicker.</p>
<p>so, when i'm buying a bag of salad, i try to make sure it gets bagged with other cold things, and it's one of the 1st to get put away when i get home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the things I heard from the guys that run reefer rail cars is lettuce has a really narrow storage temp. Just a couple of degrees too hot or too cold and it'll go bad. Get it just right an it'll last three weeks. I can't remember exactly but I think the optimal temperature for transport is 35 degrees which is colder than the typical fridge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Buy the brown paper towel rolls at Costco. Here in Quebec, it's $12 for a pack of 12 rolls. And a roll will last you 3 times as long as normal paper towel roll.</p>
<p>You're joking, but I literally did this last night. I don't have time to make lunch in the morning and I never want to bother the night before. So Sunday night, I prepare everything I'm gonna need to make lunch during the week and bring it to work.</p>
<p>This week I'm making sandwiches. So I tore 5 big leaves of lettuce, ran them through the salad spinner and then just sort of packed them in the paper towel. You just take one long section place a leaf, turn it over and place another one and roll it like that.</p></div>		</li>
