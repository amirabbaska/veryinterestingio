NYC is notable for being over strong, stable bedrock that makes many very tall buildings possible. But for some other cities, the underlying geology may limit the size (and corresponding weight) of what can be built on it.</p>
<p>Others, like Washington DC, also have artificial limits for cultural reasons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much of Boston is also built on filled in swamp land. Look at old maps of Boston as Shawmut Peninsula and then look at the Boston Skyline. It's not a coincidence the city's skyscrapers are built on the peninsula part and not the filled-in land. It's also why the Big Dig was a difficult engineering project.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What we don't see is that there are gigantic foundations under those buildings. Softer ground = less support for the building = stronger foundations are needed. AFAIK, you can build skyscrapers on all kinds of areas, but building on &quot;softer&quot; ground is drastically more technically difficult and thus more expensive. And Dubai hasn't been known for being short on money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. For 50 years the conventional wisdom in San Francisco has been to resist building up because it would destroy the character of the city. Unfortunately the effect of that was for housing prices to skyrocket - they're now more expensive than New York City - which, guess what - destroys the characters of the city because a diverse group of people can't afford to live there anymore.</p>
<p>Things are slowly changing. More and more, people are voting for more housing. The new SF mayor and many in the city council favor removing some zoning requirements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost every city has an institutional anti-development group. That happened because in the 1950s-1970s there was a major trend of tearing apart cities to build highways and parking lots, along with &quot;urban renewal&quot; projects that obliterated city centers to create suburban-style malls and such.</p>

<p>Yes. We have to preserve the <em>character</em> of this city that I purchased real estate in during the 1970s. Increasing the housing supply would lower the value of my property, but that's not the primary reason for why I am against increasing the housing supply, it's because it would be against the <em>character</em> of the city.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Why? Its actually great for everyone in power, those who own the land (higher rent + property values), those in the local govt (higher tax basin), and those living there now (keep the &quot;undesirables&quot; out). Its basically the perfect setup for white collar, gated community workers. The only people who are being negatively effected are those with no power, and historically they will simply be displaced and the same old will keep on ticking. </p>
<p>I have no allusion that things will change there and certainly that anything &quot;has&quot; to change.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But why isn't this true in other countries? I just flew to Madrid and as we were getting ready to land I would see small town after small town. They were all spread apart from each other and each town was densely packed. Like they would have 4-5 story buildings basically built on top of each other with miles of empty land around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also often specific laws restricting tall buildings. In London for example, it's hard to get permission for tall, modern buildings for historical preservation reasons, and new buildings aren't allowed to block certain views of St Paul's Cathedral.</p>
<p>As a result the skyscrapers are often further from the centre, rather than where land prices are at their very highest.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Summary: European agricultural towns were built around walkability to the fields/town. American farms took the &quot;homesteading&quot; approach, where the house is built adjacent to the field and trips to town require driving. As a result, European agricultural towns were limited in population to however many people were required to work the fields within walking distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most American cities were built after the car was ubiquitous and there for there was less of a need for the buildings to be closer. Where as in Europe most city center are older than American and build when people either had to walk or use horses for transportation, there for they were build in very high density. </p></div>		</li>
