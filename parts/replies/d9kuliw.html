			<div class="markdown"><p>I once inhaled some chocolate and had a persistent tickle causing me to want to cough the rest of the day after I apparently failed to cough it all out.</p>
<p>I kinda ignored this (like an idiot) and started feeling shitty before bed. I woke up in the middle of the night with a pretty bad fever which went away by morning, leaving me with lungs that felt like burning for about a week. Should have coughed more, coughing is important.</p>
<p>TLDR: if you feel the need to cough, fucking cough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I'm curious if you pulled out the piece of steak stuck in my SIL's brother's throat this past year in TN.  </p>
<p>It was stuck for a few days and he fought the problem thinking it would pass before he eventually started coughing up blood from an internal tear.  When he walked into the ER he apparently projectile vomited blood across the floor and everyone was freaking out as he couldn't really speak.</p>
<p>I saw a picture of the chunk afterwards and good God....</p>
<p>He's lucky it never dislodged while asleep or elsewhere choking him, esp since he was home  alone a few nights that week.</p>
<p>---And before anyone says something about him, he actually is an intelligent individual functioning as the CEO for large company. He was just stubborn about it having had smaller items get stuck and pass prior to this event.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A pulmonologist from Japan I know has said he sees his fair share of fish bones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is it when I eat too big of a bite (or something too dry like bread) and it goes down the right pipe, but hurts like a motherfucker going down? Is there a way to push it through quicker or make it less painful? I've had times where it gets so bad that I'll either voluntarily or involuntarily make myself puke it back up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting! I guess comparing NYC and Japan in regards to the bones, frequency of occurrence in diet must be having more of an effect than the fact that fish bones are harder to see. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have above average paranoid anxiety and eating my multivitamin pills is one of the hardest things to do daily. I get panicked for about 5 minutes before swallowing some because I always imagine I'd die from some freak accident where my epiglottis cramps up or the pills just end up NOT down my esophagus.</p>
<p>This thread is definitely not helping!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, most people who think they swallowed a fishbone that got stuck actually swallowed a fishbone and it lacerated the oesophagus on the way down, but it's not impacted. </p></div>		</li>
