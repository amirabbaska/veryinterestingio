			<p>I once inhaled some chocolate and had a persistent tickle causing me to want to cough the rest of the day after I apparently failed to cough it all out.<br><br>I kinda ignored this (like an idiot) and started feeling shitty before bed. I woke up in the middle of the night with a pretty bad fever which went away by morning, leaving me with lungs that felt like burning for about a week. Should have coughed more, coughing is important.<br><br>TLDR: if you feel the need to cough, fucking cough.</p>		</li>

			<p>Is there another flappy thing further down the esophagus that can get confused and stick shut with even tiny pieces of food? I've had miniscule amounts of food completely prevent then reject swallowed liquids from going all the way down, but the airway is never blocked. It hurts like hell when it happens and the only thing that fixes it is waiting for it to magically give with no effort at all. Barium swallow showed nothing abnormal. </p>		</li>
