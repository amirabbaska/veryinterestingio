It sounds more like a regular electrical engineering problem with the signals of the controller port and the memory port interfering with each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crosstalk is due to electromagnetic interference. Think of it like that you unintentionally made a radio transmitter and receiver and as a result are not getting the intended data. </p>
<p>So, not due to quantum effects unless you consider radio to be due to quantum effects.</p></div>		</li>
