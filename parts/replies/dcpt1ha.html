			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the energy is lost in cosmic redshift. Conservation of energy doesn't apply on a cosmological scale, because it's expanding. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/oa2jx/when_light_gets_redshifted_due_to_the_expansion/c3fl2qn/" target="_blank">Here</a> is an AskScience post on it, and <a href="http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/02/22/energy-is-not-conserved/" target="_blank">here</a> is a good entry on it by Sean Carroll.</p></div>		</li>
