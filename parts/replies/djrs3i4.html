			<div class="markdown"><p>depends on how rigid the creature being sucked through is.  considering space is a practically perfect vacuum and we are normally around 15psi atmosphere which is the same for our space station, a hole with 1 square inch of opening size will pull with the force of a 15lb weight pulling down.  So assuming a flexible enough body it would continue to pull little bits through with a constant 15lbs until the whole thing went through.  Having sharp edges on the hole could help to if it could cut the tissue as it is pressed against the hole, cutting it and making it easier to squeeze through.  What normally causes the catastrophic failures. is when a hole weakens the structure so the wall can't hold back that 15psi around the weakened edges, so the small hole grows bigger now there is more weak edge so it grows bigger and so on.  Now you have a hole that is 100 square inches and a body shoved up against that hole will have 1,500lbs of force shoving it through the hole. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would only happen if the pressure was enough to break skin, which it wouldn't. I believe astronauts have had punctures in their suits before, and your skin is strong enough not to break, and your body's circulation is enough to prevent your blood from boiling and killing you. This is what would have actually happened in The Martian when he uses his suit to propel himself to the ship.</p>
<p>In alien, I don't think the monster would have even been stuck, he could push himself away and kill everyone else on the ship by letting the air escape. He probably would have survived because Aliens have survived in space before</p></div>		</li>
