			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the only answer that makes any sense to me, but it's still really hard for me to understand it from that perspective. I mean, some people have lived for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/us/10mason.html" target="_blank">as many as 60 years</a> in an iron lung. I just can't wrap my head around how that can be preferable even to a risky and/or invasive surgery (though that is a matter of opinion of course)</p></div>		</li>

<p>she preferred the iron lung to newer ventilators as it didn't require intubation, surgery, or hospitalization.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you've worked with these, I have a question for you. I just assumed that a patient would be confined to the machine 24/7, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Middleton" target="_blank">this Wikipedia article</a> claims that June Middleton &quot;spent up to 21 hours a day in the iron lung.&quot; Does that mean she was able to remove herself from the machine for three hours each day, or am I reading this wrong?</p></div>		</li>
