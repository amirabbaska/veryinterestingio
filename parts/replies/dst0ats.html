E.g would anti-protons be ok impacting electrons? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anti-protons cannot collide with electrons because they are both negatively charged, and they repel away from each other. The very light electrons are pushed away from the anti-protons and exchange momentum, slowing the anti-protons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a bit more complicated. Antiproton+electron doesn't have any possible reaction (at low energy), but antiproton+neutron has, for example (they annihilate to a couple of pions). If we limit it to everyday matter and its antiparticles: positrons only annihilate with electrons, antiprotons and antineutrons annihilate both with protons and neutrons each.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“opposite composition” is really unlucky choice of words.
Some quantum numbers are opposite. We are talking mainly about elementary particles positron and electron here, no composition whatsoever.</p></div>		</li>
