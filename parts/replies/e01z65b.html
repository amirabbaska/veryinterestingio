			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it not just that zebras don't get helicobacter, use NSAIDS, drink or smoke which are far more common causes of ulcers than stress? While the stress response stuff might well be right I'm very unconvinced by the claim that they don't get ulcers for those reasons when there are so many more reasons why humans get ulcers which are obviously not applicable to zebras. (Although I am enjoying the mental images of groups of zebras loitering about smoking cigarettes and having a beer).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plenty of well written and well researched scientific books, articles and even papers have comedic, hyperbolic titles. Even scientists have a sense of humour, and afaik it's widely understood; not many people will read the title of that book and conclude that zebras don't ever get ulcers because they're stress-free, but it catches the eye and attracts interest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is It's just a catchy book title judging by the Amzon link I clicked on.
Not a scientific article on the exact causes of ulcers In zebras and how that compares to humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The title is not meant to be taken literally.  Sapolsky's larger point is that zebras aren't subject to the same types of stress-related mortality that's seen in the highly social primates, not that they don't get ulcers.  I definitely recommend pretty much everything he's ever written; he is way way smarter than you are giving him credit for here.      </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's due to the constant stress of being on the low end of a social hierarchy. However, this is culturally learned and can be culturally unlearned.</p>

<p>Their problem wasn't that they were at the bottom of the hierarchy but that hierarchy was pathological. Hierarchies aren't culturally learned and they'll always be there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you in part. The problem is that they were at the bottom of a pathological hierarchy. You are correct that they did not get rid of hierarchy. Perhaps I misspoke. But it's how they expressed that hierarchy that mattered. And being at the bottom absolutely did matter. His point is that you're always stressed if you're at the bottom of a pathological hierarchy. That might be something he gets at more in his book. His memoir of that time is also a great read.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, this is culturally learned and can be culturally unlearned. Serendipitously, he wound up studying a troop where all the aggressive males died at once. The only males left were social and nice, both to one another and to the troop's females. This changed the culture of troop. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, it didn't change the culture of the troop per se, it changed the dynamics of the remaining individuals.  Aggressive males have higher serotonin levels, they're natural born leaders.  It's not like some social worker came in, gave a seminar and everything was nicer.  Sapolsky is quite clear he has no real solutions for reducing stress levels, he's merely describing the endocrinological mechanisms of stress responses.  In fact in the last chapter he ironically says he's an atheist but believing in God seems to be the only sure fire way to protect oneself from stress.  </p>
<p>He does say exercise, meditation, etc. are useful tools.  </p></div>		</li>
