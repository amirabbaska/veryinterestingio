<p>The gel makes is so that the waves don't have to travel through the waves and go directly from the gel to skin, which have similar values for Z</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how non-destructive testing works too!  You need couplant to get the soundwaves into the material you want to inspect.  Then you can analyse the signal for thickness, cracks, or any number of defects that could be in the thing.</p>
<p>Pretty useful stuff!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer, and should be higher up.  This is exactly why voices above the water sound muffled when you go underwater.  The high frequencies get reflected off the surface and only lower frequencies make it through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Kinda.</p>
<p>Sound, as a wave, refracts on changing media. Opposite from light tho, as light travels slowly con denser material, sound travels faster. So sound refracts to the opposite angle of light.</p>
<p>For internal reflection, yes, it also happens, but you also may account for critical angles for sound to travel into the other material as transverse vibrations on it. Remember you can have reflection, no change en media; refraction, wave passing thru and changing direction; absorption, wave transformed into heat, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sound being a wave still gives a snell law for refraction, which would lead to total internal reflection of sound if it was going into a faster medium above the critical angle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I have a follow-up question, if you wouldn't mind?</p>
<p>Do you know if the volume would be affected? Since water is a much denser medium than air, I imagine the driver has to work harder to produce the same amplitudes as in air. But, then in a denser medium, are the same amplitudes required to make as &quot;loud&quot; a sound, given that sound is pressure waves, and pressure is mass over area. Denser medium = more mass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I deleted a previous comment because I lost my confidence in my expertiece in this area, I'm afraid my answer would only constitute speculation. I do know that the physics are more complicated than what you describe but I couldn't give you a comparison about acoustic attenuation in air and water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The volume of the sound will be relative to the pressure change.  Changing the pressure underwater is obviously gonna require a lot more force, since water is relatively incompressible.  The property describing this is the bulk modulus, which is 142 kPa for air and 2,200,000 kPa for water.</p>
<p>It's not a direct change, since the speaker will react to the increase, as will your ears.  The speaker will draw more current to try to exert the higher pressure, and your ears can close up to increase the amount of sound they can gather a little.  But sound will definitely be quieter underwater, for instance the minimum detectable threshold underwater is louder than in air.</p>
<p>This will also cause the speaker to burn out eventually.</p>
<p>Edit: I think my explanation was a little light.  The speaker moves its cone back and forth, at a distance proportional to voltage.  That distance-moving very quickly transitions from physically moving fluid into a pressure wave (where fluid particles move relatively little).  Since water is so incompressible, the speaker isn't strong enough to create a loud pressure wave.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the second part about loudness - </p>
<p>Human hearing threshold is about 3.5 times higher at 1kHz underwater - so you would need more amplitude underwater to obtain an equivalent perceived loudness. However we can hear much higher pitched sounds underwater, so at high frequencies we would need less amplitude underwater to achieve an equivalent loudness.</p>
<p>Interestingly measurements on marine mammals have suggested the same sensitivity at 1kHz and an increased sensitivity at high freuencies underwater.</p></div>		</li>
