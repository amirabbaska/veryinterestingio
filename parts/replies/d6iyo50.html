			<div class="markdown"><p>If you do this, you might want to do it several times, and controll the temperature differently each time. The growth mode of the bismuth crystals is related to the undercooling, so if you keep the system just below the melting point you'll get crystals that look significantly different than if you quench the cup in ice cold water.</p></div>		</li>
