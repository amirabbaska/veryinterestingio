			<div class="markdown"><p>Researchers also found a lymphatic system in the brain, named the glymphatic system. The lymphatic system clears out the liquids that the cells bathe in, which is where cell waste is excreted to. They found in mice that these glymphatic vessels are only active at night (or their flow doubles at night). They run along the blood vessels in the brain which hid them from scans and surgeons for decades. So we have all but confirmed sleep is at least partly for clearing waste. </p>

<p>So is it for clearing “cognitive” or “physical” waste?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because they stimulated sleep in the mice. It does not matter that the mice are nocturnal, because they still operate on the 24 hour clock that our braind follow. The mind must be asleep because the areas between the cells increase 68% to allow the cerebro spinal fluid from the glymphatic vessels fill the surrounding areas.</p></div>		</li>

So it’s not <em>entirely</em> accurate to say that all cognitive performance declines when we’re tired, but mainly analytical performance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't do that. Itd be impossible to really perform any major surgery on a cetacean or try to knock them out. In zoos and aquariums they have aggressive preventative care and are trained to assist in their own health care by presenting certain body parts and remaining still but anything really invasive would get tricky.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please excuse the hair splitting, but drowning generally implies inhaling water. Because their breathing is voluntary they won't drown, they'll just suffocate.</p>
