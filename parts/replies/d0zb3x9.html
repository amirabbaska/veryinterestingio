			<div class="markdown"><p>Your car  (toy or otherwise) has wheels. You measure how wide the wheels are (diameter). Now you know if your car goes forward and your wheel spin once you moved forward pi x wheel width. (If it was square it would move 4 x width, but it wouldn't roll well, that comparison is useful when talking about how off it is that it's not 3 times but it just works)</p>
<p>If your wind up mechanism can spin the wheel 10 times, your car can only move 10 x pi x width forward (about 31 times the size of the wheel). Place 31 wheels on the ground to give the idea. You can also bring a bunch of wheels of different sizes and a tape and show that if you wrap the tape around then measure against the wheel, you get 3 times the size and a bit left over.</p>
<p>The area formula is harder to explain. You'd have to talk about buckets of water and cubes of water or some such.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With pi comes diameter, radius, and circumference.  Polygons in general, and <em>gasp</em> trigonometry (I don't expect your third graders to know that, no worries).  Since pi is so heavily tied with trig you can say everything that uses triangulation is a result of the usefulness of pi.  Cellphone GPS?  Triangulated, and only exists because of the awesomeness of pi.  Rockets and space ships?  Pi.  You can keep going with that :)  Hope that gets some ideas rolling for you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to rely on other people to supply real world examples; You can create some yourself. What would you like to talk about? Rockets, space probes? Fighter jets, cooking, video games, fashion, sports, graphic design? Any of those things could be modeled mathematically, and I bet most of those models have pi in them (for good reasons).</p>
<p>If a rocket needs a certain amount of fuel (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation#Terms_of_the_equation" target="_blank">which by itself is a fun problem</a>) and is roughly cylindrical, then how much sheet metal do you need in order to make the rocket skin in order to get the necessary volume of fuel? That problem (surface area and volume of a cylinder) needs pi.</p>
<p>If the International Space Station orbits at 4.75 miles per second, and it's 250 miles above the Earth (and earth's radius is 3950 miles, i.e. the ISS is 4200 miles from the center), then... how many sunrises and sunsets do the astronauts see per day? You need to convert miles per second to miles per day, then divide out from 4200*2 times pi.</p>
<p>If an SR-71 travels at 1000 m/s (close enough) and can only pull 3G (and R is v^2 / A , where A is centripetal acceleration, and 3G is an A of 30m/s^2 or close enough), how long will it take it to do a 180 &quot;U turn&quot;? Well, if V is 1000 and A is 30 then v^2 / A is a turn radius of 33,333 meters (i.e. about 20 miles). How long will that take to fly? Well, that times pi is 104,700 meters (65 miles), which going at 1000 m/s, will take about one minute 45 seconds.</p>
<p>If you're making rice and you need 2.5 times as much water as you do rice, and you put rice into an 8&quot;-wide pan until it's one inch deep, how many cups of water will you need? Again, cylindrical volumes and pi (like the rocket but without having to worry about the delta-vee). Or; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4aczay/happy_pi_day_everyone/d0zgrrt" target="_blank">if we cut up a piece of pizza into N equal slices, then we need to know how much crust one slice is going to have.</a>.</p>
<p>If you're designing boots and people's calves are so-many inches wide, the amount of leather you'll need all the way around the boot is that leg width times pi... Same for belts, hats, etc. (Yes, I know that in practice you'll measure the circumference of the body part, but we can overlook this fact. Or maybe say that all you have to go on is a photograph: How much material would you need to make clothes for the person in this photo? You'll need the circumference of their body parts but all you can tell from the photo are the diameters...)</p>
<p>And so on and so on. You can pick literally anything in the world. Trees, cars, home appliances, the school building. Someone designed them, or (when it comes to natural things) tried to understand how they grow or had to design something to go on or around them (tree house, zipline, road), and had to do some calculation with pi in it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>trigonometry</p>

<p>That's the <em>sohcahtoa</em> business, right?  Is that founded on the relationship of the radius to the circumference (pi), the pythagorean theorem (a^2 +b^2 = c^2) , neither, or both?</p>
<p>Trig was a long time ago and I while I remember the sohcahtoa ratios, I can't recall if that was actually trig, and if pi or pythagoras were necessary to derive those ratios--or even if pi informs the pythagorean theory, vice versa, of if they're not related.</p>
<p>tl;dr High school maths are a long ways away and it's a muddled mess now, but Pi day made me think about it again and I'd appreciate some help untangling it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's exactly that sohcahtoa business!</p>
<p>Trigonometry is <em>kind of</em> hard to define exactly. The most general definition would be along the lines of any theories created exclusively using the comparison of triangles, circles, or any subsection of each (this is where angles come from, the subsections).</p>
<p>The pieces we learn in high school are immensely specialized areas (we learn this specialization early because it has so much general use).  Pythagoras actually created his theorem without trigonometry, but the usefulness in making trig calculations makes it the foundation of trigonometry.</p>
<p>Both sohcahtoa and Pythagorean theorem only cover a tiny portion of trigonometry.  It's the trigonometry of triangles with one angle being 90 degrees.  General trig covers ALL triangles (not just right ones).</p>
<p>As far as <strong>pi</strong>'s role in all this? It's the tool that makes life simple for <em>all</em> these calculations.  Over two thousand years ago someone decided to chop the circle up into 360 pieces.  It turns out that this number doesn't exactly &quot;flow&quot; with the nature of circles (a large part due to the <em>exact</em> nature of the number).  Because of pi's unique value and it's relationship between radius and circumference, it naturally makes calculations easier.</p>
<p>Pi is the equivalent of learning how to multiply rather than adding the same number over and over and over (as far as trig goes). We could live without it, but it would make calculations a whole lot harder if we had to.</p></div>		</li>
