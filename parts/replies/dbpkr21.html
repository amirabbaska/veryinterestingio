			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohm's law is a <em>constitutive equation</em> which describes the response of a medium to some external stimulus. Other examples would be Hooke's law for springs, <strong>D</strong> = ε(<strong>E</strong>)<strong>E</strong>, <strong>B</strong> = μ(<strong>H</strong>)<strong>H</strong>, etc. </p>
<p>Often a first approximation for any constitutive relationship is a linear one.</p>
<p>Ohm's law is a linear constitutive equation for conductive media. It says that:</p>
<p><strong>J</strong> = σ<strong>E</strong>,</p>
<p>where σ is a constant called the &quot;conductivity&quot;. In an isotropic medium this is simply a number, in general it's a rank-2 tensor.</p>
<p>Constitutive equations are generally not derived from anything, but they're empirically motivated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Robus is Correct.</p>
<p>For those non-believers of Ohm's Law, understand that if the physical properties of the circuit under consideration are non-linear, heterogeneous, anisotropic, or inelastic the system will misbehave or not act accordingly to the established first-order relationship. This behavior is consistent with data implied by OP and several replies commenting on variability of temperature and resistance..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lets look at it other way for a bit. </p>
<p>So certainly something like Ohm's, Hooke's etc are rules of thumb, but their wide applicability across material types is reflective of some general underlying 'non-empirical' phenomenon right... </p>
<p>So For hooke's we'd talk about inter-molecular forces and how they are linearly dependent on separation at the scales concerned, thus giving rise to Hooke's in the bulk case. </p>
<p>Any insights/thoughts on the clearest or closest equivalent to what drives Ohm's in most materials?</p></div>		</li>
