<p>The upper and lower limits are defined by the designers and engineers, and aren't intrinsic to battery chemistry. There are tradeoffs between overall capacity and battery life.</p>
<p>Even if there were no technical hurdles to assessing the exact chemical status of the battery, the relation between that status and a total state of charge would remain a socially-constructed definition, not a matter of exact science.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Eh, yes and no. The upper and lower limits are based on the charichteristics of the cell's chemistry. Obviously, yes an engineer has to pick the high and low limits, but if you graph the voltage vs SOC (as measured by the number of Amp Hours charged or discharged) you get charichteristic curves. At the low end the voltage tends to drop off a cliff and may not be sufficient to provide power to the device. The SOC your device reports usually comes from plugging the voltage into a function derived from the SOC curve. Set your lower limit too low and you'll get lithium plating on the cathode and anode any time you over discharge. This takes lithium permanently out of the places where it belongs and lowers your capacity. Do it enough times and the lithium buildup can stretch across from cathode to anode and short the cell, resulting in venting or fire. Over charging can also result in fire, though you only have to do that once to get the result. So knowing that, you have to pick starting and ending points that won't damage the cell, but still maximize the usable range of SOC.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

<p>There isn't a single state of charge that doesn't damage the cell. The damage gets a lot more rapid as you approach the end points, and you've mentioned a few mechanisms that only kick in at the extremes, and there's a sweet spot (usually between about 50% and 80% of charge, using the limits engineers typically pick) when the degradation rates of the all mechanisms are relatively balanced and also fairly slow, but any Li-ion battery kept at room temperature will only have a few years' service life. There's no range that actually stops cell damage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So your battery could be half empty while the indicator purposely shows it at 80% or something. Presumably to prevent you from getting &quot;range-anxiety&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is only increasing the range anxiety as you never know when it starts dropping rapidly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve always noticed that the battery percentage lowers very slowly soon after a charge and then drops precipitously once it gets lower - this explains why!</p></div>		</li>
