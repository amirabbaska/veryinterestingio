<p>2, No!</p>
<p><em>However!</em> When you see the ”calories” on a food item it lists the usable calories, so both these things (though good questions) are already accounted for.</p>
<p>3, Absolutely, all kinds of work requires energy, but the difference is small enough that it’s not very important. There has been debate about this in recent years by the way, some people suggested that maybe weight-lifting was more effective for burning calories than was previously thought due to this effect. (I think they called it the ”afterburner theory” or something like that.) Ultimately it was shown that the effect was small and weight-lifting is still blown out of the water by things like distance running if the goal is to burn calories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the effect isn't that small the afterburn effect or EPOC is still significant, mainly if you do exercises that are good at inducing it, HIIT exercises for one, weightlifting too. I mean even if it only increases your burned calories by a 100 for the next day, then that shit can add up pretty quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can never be fully accurate. Everyone uses apps now that do the math. For myself, I err on the side of caution, underestimating my calories burned and overestimating my consumed. I've lost 25 pounds in 2 months, so it's working. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s a lot easier to properly count calories than you think. If you’re diligent, you can be pretty damn close to spot on, and the difference is likely negligible. </p>
</li>
<li>This is also easier to estimate than you think. Especially with current technology. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just started using my Fitbit in tandem with MyFitnessPal to better track macros and ensure I’m eating a 300 - 400 cal surplus on lift days while trying to stay neutral on off days. Wondering if you do something similar and have success as far as better understanding actual calories burned throughout the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without going in a metabolic chamber, the fitbit way can be off by more than 10 or 15%. The fitbit is probably within 10%, but food calorie counts I think are often a lie that is not in the favor of someone cutting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like, all of the things you buy from a store is not exactly identical but the amount of calories won't wary that much. And to measure the amount of calories the company csn do it easily by taking a portion of whatever it is and use a calorie meter where you use the food as fuel and burn it to heat water etc. Maybe this isn't the exact way they do it but it's totally possible. For better results they might have values for most ingredients already and the amount of it and then they just add it up.</p>

<li>Well, if you lift something or walk up stairs you need to put a minimal physical energy that's for increasing the potential energy of your body or the weight. But then you have a efficiency in your muscles that isn't qt 100%. So say you do some exercise that requires 10 calories, then you need to divide that with the effect of the human body. Don't remember the percentage, but say it's like 20%. Then you need to use 50 calories for something that needs 10. </li>

<li>Yes it’s called the thermic effect of food</li>
<li>No - the human digestion system is about 97% efficient</li>
<li>Kind of - after you finish <em>intense</em> exercises, you have an increased oxygen consumption rate which means you burn calories. </li>
