<p>Not even &quot;painlessly&quot;. It's an advertising feature that they won't pull the wrong fucking teeth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, dentistry wasn't a thing until pretty recently in our history. You'd basically just wait until your teeth were rotten and painful and then go have them pulled, most commonly by the local blacksmith but as this picture suggests, all sorts of other trades got into the tooth pulling game.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Drugs used to come in bulk, in big bottles and cases and then the pharmacist would take part of that and give you the drugs you wanted in a paper bag, wooden case or glass bottle. It wasn't like today where everything is all neat and tidy in their own little box and single packaging pill sheets. So you had to get everything dosed out manually by the pharmacist who worked behind the counter. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pharmacy tech here, just want to put out there that this is still exactly how (most) pharmacies are run today, with getting drugs in bulk and having the pharmacists (or more accurately the techs) count everything out. There are a few things we receive in prepackaged doses, but for the most part you'll only see those blister packs in over the counter stuff and hospitals/ hospice care.</p>
<p>Edit: I should note that this is in American pharmacies. It has come to my attention that most other places have pre-packaged pills,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in the UK I find that these days getting a prescription that's actually being filled from a bulk supply at the pharmacy is no longer the norm and I can't remember the last time I did.</p>
<p>Whether it's pain meds, antibiotics, even antibiotic suspensions all come prepacked doses that the pharmacist just dispenses. </p>
<p>Maybe it reduces the chances of errors or is actually cheaper taking into account their time dispensing? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Most human drugs are dosed very vaguely on body weight, so they can get away with this much easier </p></div>		</li>
