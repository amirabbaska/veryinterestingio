			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you elaborate a bit more about there being no races, and about the genetic evidence you speak of?</p>
<p>I'm aware that skin colour is controlled by a handful of melanin-producing genes. From what I've seen the argument is that different groups of humans (ie: Europeans vs. Africans) evolved under different circumstances, some of which may have favoured intelligence and cooperation more than others. Genetic drift may have also played a role in providing more beneficial mutations to certain groups.</p>
<p>On the surface it seems plausible. If there are aggregate physical differences in people of different races (ie: incidence of diabetes, lactose tolerance, blacks being better at long distance running, etc.), why might there not also be neurological differences as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Put simply, the genetic difference between two people from Europe or between two people from Africa can be much greater than the genetic differences between a person from Europe and a person from Africa. Put another way, the genetic diversity within a 'race' compared to the human population as a whole means that trying to define sub-groups by 'race' is meaningless.</p>
<p>Your example of &quot;blacks being better at long distance running&quot; is actually a perfect example of why 'race' doesn't work. People from the Kalenjin tribe from a specific part of Kenya are statistically more likely to be excellent distance runners, but not all of them and certainly not all black people. Someone from the next tribe over may have no running ability at all. So geneticists can and do comfortably talk about how Kalenjin genetics may help some show incredible performance in marathons, how the Amish are especially likely to suffer from a variety of genetic disorders, or how any number of sub-groups differ. These groups are relatively small, relatively more homogeneous populations, so there are meaningful comparisons to make. The problem is when you try to go from talking about a small sub-group to a much much larger group. When you lump those Kalenjins in with other people from Kenya or Sudan or Ghana or anyone else who would be considered 'black' (sometimes even including people like Australian Aboriginals who have something like 50 thousand years of genetic separation), the statistical differences lose all meaning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honest question-why are there more physical variances in caucasians than other &quot;races?&quot;</p>
<p>I know about the black people with blue eyes on that island or whatever, and I know it's easier to recognize minute differences in your own race. But you don't need a degree to see that caucasians have many different eye colors, hair colors, heights, body types, noses, etc. Was there some massive inbreeding event that just fucked up our phenotypes? Or is there a reason we can be as white as marble or easily mistaken for a latino/middle eastern? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you have said is the right explanation. The amount of genetic variation within a sub-population is higher than the amount of variation between sub-populations. Therefore human sub-populations are more similar than we are different. In addition the amount of loci that are strongly selected for, or against, in these sub-populations are few and far in between. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cognitive Scientist here (we deal with information processing in the brain). Adding a bit on what others have said with non-genetic information: generally, the older studies of intelligence utilize some form of IQ-test. </p>
<p>However, IQ-tests do not test actual intelligence, but a subset of skills highly relevant in our Western society. Giving this test to non-western cultures indeed results in poor performance. But this is <strong>not</strong> evidence of lower intelligence, only evidence that these cultures value the development of other skillsets than we do.</p>
<p>Edit: For another flawed methodology used a lot &quot;back in the day&quot; to &quot;establish&quot; white supremacy, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology" target="_blank">Phrenology</a>. It's pretty easy to see how this is flawed, although it was used for a long time, for example to show that hypothetical skull shapes in Africans naturally made them obedient and fitting for a slave role.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's all well and good, but when someone makes a claim like that, the burden of proof is on them.</p>
<p>If they think Europeans have some kind of &quot;high intelligence&quot; gene, then they need to identify this gene. They need to show that Europeans have this gene, that Africans do not, and that the presence of the gene actually <em>does</em> affect intelligence.</p>
<p>If they cannot do that, then their hypothesis has no legs. Then they're just making shit up to suit their preconceptions.</p>
<p>And so far, they haven't been able to do that.</p>
<p>Saying &quot;I bet there's a gene that does X, but I haven't actually found it&quot; is not science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the thing is, research requires funding and no one is going to fund studies that might show racial differences in intelligence.</p>
<p>Disclaimer, I think the biggest determining factor is socioeconomic status, however, adoption studies have shown <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Transracial_Adoption_Study" target="_blank">black children tend to do worse</a> Of course there are many confounding factors so there is no clear cut interpretation</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry to burst your bubble, but you should read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genetic_Diversity:_Lewontin's_Fallacy" target="_blank">this</a> Wikipedia article on &quot;Lewontin's Fallacy,&quot; which is the idea that races cannot be identified genetically.</p>
<p>Here is a quote from the article I linked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>while Lewontin's statements on variability are correct when examining the frequency of different alleles (variants of a particular gene) at an individual locus (the location of a particular gene) between individuals, it is nonetheless possible to classify individuals into different racial groups with an accuracy that approaches 100 percent when one takes into account the frequency of the alleles at several loci at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously I'm <em>not</em> advocating racism of any kind, just trying to shed some light on the matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note: I may be misinterpreting your question. </p>
<p>Species and subspecies categorization are a topic of much debate in the scientific community. Now that gene sequencing is so cheap, people say that there has to be a certain amount of genetic difference (I don't remember the percentage, unfortunately) between regional populations of a species that can interbreed, but don't, for them to be considered subspecies. Humans are actually quite inbred, as far as species-wide genetic diversity is concerned, so we do not have subspecies.</p>
<p>Every single description and set of rules for categorizing species and subspecies always has exceptions, so take them with a grain of salt. For example, there used to be other prehistoric human subspecies, neanderthals and denisovans, and we can tell from gene sequencing that all modern humans besides those with ancestry solely from Africa have evidence of interbreeding with those other human groups. Yet we still call them separate subspecies, because fossil evidence shows them being morphologically distinct from us. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you using heterozygosity as the measure of this?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>So what is the criteria then?</p></div>		</li>
