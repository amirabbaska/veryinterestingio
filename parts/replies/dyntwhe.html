			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not so much about how many is in a herd but how big of a area does that herd range. You could have hundreds of individuals in a herd but only a herd for every hundred miles or it could be two to a herd but a herd every few miles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know how to phrase this question succinctly. </p>
<p>When looking at the history of Buffalo - you hear stories of herds being in the thousands to millions. (Same with other migratory animals.)</p>
<p>Wouldn’t the excess oxyogen and other environmental factors change the Trophic Levels? Animals throughout time seemed massive to today. </p>
<p>So wouldn’t there be more energy on earth during that time? (Also, shouldn’t metabolism be a huge factor? Shrews are tiny, but require massive amount of calories relative to their size. Alligators can be massive and sustain themselves for a very long time between meals.)</p>
<p>Edit: u/skwrl71 took the next logical follow up question about dinosaur metabolism! Follow his post for answers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m pretty sure the size of the herd would also be limited to the energy they can get by grazing a surface per time frame.
Something like
If one Dino grazes 1/4 acre per day. We can have 4 dino’s per acre per day, then calculate the time that acre needs to grow back to calculate the total grazing grounds for 4 Dino.
If in 4 weeks that patch is back, then at a minimum they would have to have a grazing area that allows them to be back at the same spot in 4 weeks while keeping them fed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bison are large herd animals (although obviously tiny compared to sauropods) and still the great plains supported an estimated sixty million of them back when America was just getting started. If plant growth was robust then a reasonably-sized population of sauropods wouldn't be too shocking.</p>
<p>Not my field of course though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup exactly what I meant when I brought them up! Then you have animals like shrews with these massive metabolisms, and require to eat over 3-4 of their body weight per day. Ones that can starve within an hour or two if they don’t eat! </p>
<p>A lot of plains or Tundras could/can support massive populations of large, energy hungry, mammals. </p>
<p>I wonder what the population was with the massive mammalian predators that once occupied NA. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sixty million number was also a population explosion due to the diseases that had ripped through the native Americans before the Europeans arrived, wasn't it?  Too few hunters so the buffalo grew unchecked?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently the newer explanation for those massive bison numbers at that time is the arrival of eurasian diseases wiping out huge portions of the native population and removing most of the predation from the bison population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any truth to the idea that there was more energy available? In other words, my perception is that everything seems more massive. So, yes, there would have been less T-rex than the herbivores, but they could have been more dense comparatively than mountain lions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ultimately all the energy in ecosystems is solar energy, which hasn't significantly changed since the paleozoic.  The size of sauropods suggests that they were either unusually efficient at digesting plant matter, or that the plant matter was unusually nutritious (perhaps a little of both).  Certainly many modern flowering plants, and especially the grasses, are much more difficult to metabolize and require specialized teeth and gut features not seen (or at least confirmed) on dinosaurs.  Tangentially, a recent study of t-Rex skulls suggests they were particularly suited to hear infrasonic frequencies.  Infrasonic communication is used by elephants and whales today to communicate across vast distances.  It is likely that t-Rex (and perhaps its prey items) had a comparitive sparse population and needed to make long distance calls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently the level of atmospheric CO2 in the Jurassic was <a href="https://www.livescience.com/44330-jurassic-dinosaur-carbon-dioxide.html" target="_blank">5 times higher than now</a>.  That much CO2 in the air means massively exuberant vegetation, which can then support more animal life.  I'm not sure that it was necessarily the case that Jurassic conditions could support higher population densities of carnivores, but the skyrocketing CO2 levels during this period would support such a hypothesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an important factor that is often forgotten. The earth was a lot more lush due to more CO2 and resulting higher temperatures. Due to the way how land masses were during those periods, large portions of the earth were jungles and wetlands. Large dinos like sauropods thrived because they could eat massive quantities of food without even moving. Their long necks basically allowed them to reach vegetation all around them without taking a step for hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As mesotherms (and it's unclear that <em>all</em> dinosaurs were), they would use less energy than warm-blooded, but more than cold-blooded reptiles. Given similar metabolisms, a dinosaur would use less energy than a mammal, pound for pound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That said, T. rex was thought to have been the only, or one of the only, large carnivores in it's habitat, so their population flourished more than average due to lack of competition.</p>
<p>Compare mountain lions, who compete with wolves, coyotes, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how you define &quot;large carnivores&quot;. Tyrannosaurus lived alongside Dakotaraptor (18 ft long) in the northern part of its range, and Quetzalcoatlus (wingspan 36 ft., 500 lbs.) in the southern part. While only a fraction of the size of Tyrannosaurus, they were still large predatory animals.</p></div>		</li>
