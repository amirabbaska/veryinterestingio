			<div class="markdown"><p>So would a vitamin supplement or infusion help counteract the deficiency?</p>
<p>Edit: I suppose vitamin was the wrong word, I did mean electrolyte solution. I more meant would it take immediate effect or would food still be off the table for a while?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Infusion of the necessary elements does just that. There are other deficiencies that are vitamin-related with respect to starvation. This is why flour is enriched with thiamine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, vitamins are strictly speaking organic molecules required in little amounts to help some metabolic functions. OP said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your blood levels of potassium, magnesium and phosphorous go into dangerously low levels</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What you need is electrolytes (salts dissolved in water), not vitamins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you drink too much water, those important vitamins leech out of your body.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdote alert. Once in the heat of an Aussie summer (42°C, 107°F) I walked a good half hour from the tram stop to home. It was an hour fifteen travel time all up and I was quite thirsty when I got home. Chugged about a pint of water (chilled and filtered) and doubled over in pain immediately. Was stuck on the floor for 5 minutes until my body sorted it out. Since then I only drink room temp water on hot days and make damn sure I keep my fluids up. Dehydration is no joke, vision was going gray at the edges</p>
<p>I don't think there is any point to this story I just wanted to share.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So you're all good. Something doesn't have to be understandable by a five year old, just by a laymen. </p></div>		</li>
