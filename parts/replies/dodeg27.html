The machines at work use less energy, clean better, dry faster, and don't even use soap -- our stuff is made out of this amino acid/microbial stuff that works so good it hurts. I could pour it out on your grass after and it'd be like adding fertilizer. -_- </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is actually the opposite of what conductivity does.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is exactly backwards. The lower the conductivity, the LONGER it takes to lose themselves energy (and also the longer it takes to GAIN thermal energy.)</p></div>		</li>
