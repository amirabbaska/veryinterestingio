			<div class="markdown"><p>i agree with everything above but in practice it doesnt always work that way; eg i was suspended from school twice, both for not coming to school. no medical reason for not going, i just didnt want to go, so they gave me a 3 day then a 5 day suspension as a 'punishment'. literally all it did was put me behind in work (which at the time i didnt care about) and give me time to play games, watch tv or do a hobby</p>
<p>most schools where im from have detention as initial punishment, a weeks detention for further punishment, suspension if the detentions dont seem to have worked and expulsion if you have 3 suspensions. this is for any basic infractions, obviously it escalates faster if the 'crime' is more serious</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact it put you even further behind in schoolwork is an interesting one. Jail is a bit like that too, in that it can actually trigger the situation they're trying to avoid by giving people a nice big hole in their employment history, as well as taking them away from people in their life who could put them on the right track (if any) while replacing those people with a big house full of shady types - lots of networking opportunities. Not that I'm against jail per se, but there's definitely something a bit backwards with the way it works out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For skipping class, my school gave me in-school suspensions. All we did was sit there silently and scribble on random worksheets that wouldn't be graded. I didn't want to go to class anyway, so I didn't mind the seclusion. My parents never even knew about my suspensions; they were never notified. This was from one of those sought after public schools with good reputations too. </p>
<p>I feel like, at that age, I could have benefited from some actual help/discipline, real stuff, than what I got. With me skipping class, there was more going on behind that than that I just didn't feel like going, but no great efforts were made to see beyond surface glance.</p>
<p>Also, why do we make &quot;disciplinary action&quot; into a bad thing anyway? As something to avoid? What about the students who stop avoiding it? Discipline should sharpen the person and build them up. In that scenario, I got punished, not disciplined, and a weak punishment at that. I get teenagers are difficult, but the way we discipline them seems to just further ostracize them from normalcy. After my suspensions, I dropped out later that semester. (Spoiler: thanks to my father, I graduated college this month).</p>
<p>Also, the person you're replying to gave a detailed breakdown about why suspension is a punishment, but didn't answer why we give students a punishment that they're okay with. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one's saying it's implemented perfectly, and it's certainly not good as the only method. </p>
<p>But if your parents didn't care, what's the school gonna do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>parents cared but there were other issues making it difficult for them and schools stick with this line of punishment as its less work for them, even if it is against pupils interest</p></div>		</li>
