<p>However, the space expanded much faster than light speed and is currently estimated to be about 98 billion light years across. Of which we can theoretically observe only 26billion light years (13.8b in each direction)</p>

<p>How so? If we observe things that are currently 98/2=49  billion l.y. away from us (isn't the number more like 46 btw?), then why say we can observe only 26 billion light years?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your correction. I have made an edit. Also, we can directly observe only 13.8 billion ly away. Which is our cosmic horizon. The objects that were right next to us during big bang have expanded farther to 45.5 billion light years due to expansion. And their light hasn't reached to us yet.  We can observe beyond 13.8 billion ly only as time passes. But then again, universe will have expanded. So it's kind of a race. And light is losing in the race. Which means eventually, the skies will get totally dark with no galaxies to observe because everything has expanded faster than light could reach us.</p></div>		</li>
