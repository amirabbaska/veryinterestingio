			<div class="markdown"><p>IANAL, but my understanding is that any statements made by the accused prior to their interrogation are admissible.  Your Miranda rights are only read to you prior to your interrogation by the police - if someone were to should &quot;Alright, you caught me&quot; during the arrest (but prior to interrogation) that would be admissible as a voluntary statement.  Same goes with the diary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Typically Miranda only attaches if two factors are met:</p>
<p>1) A suspect is in police custody (or reasonably would believe he was not allowed to leave voluntarily)</p>
<p>2) Police are interrogating the suspect, or otherwise asking questions pertinent to a criminal investigation.</p>
<p>Someone stating &quot;Alright, you caught me&quot; would be classified as an &quot;Excited Utterance&quot;, which is admissible in court. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More to the point, a diary isn't a statement to a person in authority. There is no compulsion, power dynamic, fear, intimidation or belief that you are required to answer questions which might render the circumstances unfair or of questionable reliability.</p>
<p>You are under no duty to write a diary at all, and the intention was that what you wrote remain private, so there shouldn't be any fear about the contents being a violation of your rights because the state wasn't involved in producing the writings at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like if they're a minor? Still a voluntary statement of guilt. There's no exception to the exception just because you're a minor.</p>
<p>Keep in mind <em>Miranda</em> only applies when you're talking to an officer of the law (prosecutor, cop, judge, etc.). If you're writing down what you did in your diary, that's you collecting evidence against yourself for some reason. Like, for example, when you plan the crime with accomplices, that's not excluded because you weren't aware of your rights at that time. A good defense lawyer will try to get it excluded if you're a minor, but it's an uphill battle.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. I work offshore in the oilfield and most guys keep tally books to write down information of various kinds. One guy put something that was done which was clearly illegal and when that illegal thing happened to end up resulting  in a death, the tally book was used in court as evidence. We always tell new guys to be careful what they write in their books because it could be used against them in court. </p>
<p>Edit: because of all the replies I'm getting from people who think I'm trying to help people kill others, the one example I gave is in no way related to the next sentence so it was poorly placed. I wasn't trying to make it long. The example was given to prove that what you write of your own volition is indeed admissible in court. The sentence after the example was simply to make them understand that what they write is a legally binding document. We are telling this to guys who haven't commited any wrongdoing. Just an awareness. It could be something that may not be life threatening, but could end up resulting in a fine. Or the loss of your job. I won't go into details because it's too much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yeah, that's the main idea to begin with,  but it isn't always about life threatening situations either. For instance BSEE can now fine individual people and not just the oil company for certain things. If said things are in your tally book and they happen to get a hold of it and you want to fight it in court, you won't have much of a leg to stand on. And we are talking of fines that can range from 5k to 35k per day based off of what the fine is and how many days they can backtrack it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our goal is not to come out here and do illegal things that kill people. Sometimes people make mistakes and those mistakes can end up in a fatality. That's why we double and triple check each other. Hard to explain how many components we have to put our hands on daily but sometimes things get missed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not a criminal lawyer, nor a lawyer in the US, but I would think there are a lot of factors before you can just make this blanket statement.</p>
<p>If the police or a representative of law enforcement 'forced' a confession to be written (in a diary or anywhere else), it may well be inadmissible as coerced confession, if proven.</p>
<p>However, if some's brother forced them to write a diary with a confession, I don't believe that wouldn't make it inherently inadmissible. The question might arise whether it should be given weight or if it was written under duress and is therefore not reliable, but I don't think it's a prohibited type of evidence as distinct from a written statement coerced by the police.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is something that every prosecutor learns to say in response to every objection: &quot;goes to weight, not admissibility&quot;. Seriously, if you pull a string on a prosecutor's back that is what will come out of their mouth.
How do you prove duress? Unless the defendant is willing to testify then it would be hard to show. Prosecutor says &quot;statement by party opponent&quot; and defense attorney says duress, but at that point the burden is on the defense to offer proof.  </p></div>		</li>
