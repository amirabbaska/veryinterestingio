There are nerves in your stomach that tell your brain that it's full. This is one of several processes that your body uses to regulate eating.  Fiber is helpful in this regard as it literally replaces calorie-laden bulk.
Some, but not all, overweight people have stretched their stomach, which causes them to eat more than they need. Fiber can be very helpful for those people by activating the &quot;stomach is full&quot; nerves on with fewer calories.</p></div>		</li>
