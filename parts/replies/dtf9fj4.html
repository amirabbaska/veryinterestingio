			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually pretty reasonable and expected that math be so useful in physics. We made math. Moreover, we made math to be a pattern producing machine. When we apply to physics, it then finds patterns that we couldn't before without the lens of math. It's not surprising when math does what it was designed to do. Furthermore, there's lots of confirmation bias, because you don't really hear about all the times that a math idea found a pattern that wasn't there.</p></div>		</li>
