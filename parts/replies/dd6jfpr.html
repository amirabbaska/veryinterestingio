			<div class="markdown"><p>If they retire or pass away in the next 4 years, Trump will replace them as well. Given that the oldest Justice(84) is a liberal, it's not unlikely that the Supreme Court could be a 6-3 Republican split by the end of Trump's term, with a conservative majority for the next 25 years firmly established</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would depend on the outcome of the congressional midterms, but given the immense focus on the President and complete lack of attention given to Congress, I imagine Republicans will increase their majority.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Remain and likely strengthen.  Gorsuch isn't even fifty yet, he'll be there for at least twenty years.  And it's quite likely that another pick will come up in Trump's first term, possibly Ginsberg.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I think any of the other answers are exactly wrong, the fact is most of the Supreme Court Justices are so old the two liberals that Obama appointed or Bush's mostly conservative appointment Chief Justice Roberts would be the only surprises. </p>
<p>Trump would need another term to really push the odds of a 6-3 conservative court.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Senate is required to confirm the President's nominee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clarification: nominees to the Supreme Court must be confirmed by the Senate before they can take office. The Senate is not only under no constitutional obligation to confirm any particular nominee, it is under no constitutional obligation to even consider a nomination. It is generally expected that it <em>will</em> consider and confirm nominees, but this is a matter of historical custom and practice, not constitutional/legal requirement. </p></div>		</li>
