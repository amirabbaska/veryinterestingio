			<div class="markdown"><p>Great questions! While I don't think there's any one silver bullet to science communication (because everybody is different thus every audience different), the one thing I stick to is to be as genuine as possible. I really do geek out and get excited by all this spacey stuff, and I'm not afraid to put that enthusiasm front and center.</p>

<p>I've had some great opportunities to consult on a few different film and TV projects, and every one of them is different. In some cases it's just a single phone call with a writer under a deadline trying to come up with something mildly plausible, and in some cases I get to work with the creators as the concept is coming together. Either way, I always ask up front: just how grounded do you want this thing to be? In the end, they're trying to tell a story, not produce a science documentary, so it's about coming together collaboratively in the spirit of Making Something Awesome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So cool! Thanks for doing this AMA. This is certainly an awesome, different angle of scientific communications I hadn’t considered before. I’m a bioengineer by training, now working in clinical trials and would love to be able to consult on films or fiction novels some day! </p></div>		</li>
