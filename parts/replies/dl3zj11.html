			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source for that number of lead in soil? It seems crazy high, considering the maximum acceptable concentration of lead in potable water in Ontario (O. Reg 169/03) is 0.010mg/L or 10ppb </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found another <a href="http://extension.psu.edu/plants/crops/esi/lead-in-soil" target="_blank">source that indicates that it's about 10 to 50 ppm</a> (10-50 mg/kg). Still, remember that elemental lead is non-soluble in water and the concentration of slightly soluble forms of lead, like lead carbonate, are likely much lower than 10ppm. This lack of solubility means that lead is unlikely to leech from the soil into freshwater supplies. Most lead in freshwater actually comes from the corrosion of lead pipes and other lead-based metal fixtures and lead soldering. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://extension.psu.edu/plants/crops/esi/lead-in-soil" target="_blank">http://extension.psu.edu/plants/crops/esi/lead-in-soil</a> says average amount of lead is 10 to 50 ppm, not 50 to 400.</p>
<p>A microgram is about a thousandth of a milligram, so the total mass of lead in the basement from radon would be 0.001 ppm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But for calculating ppm or ppb shouldn't you be using molar ratios? In that case the number would likely be around a factor 5 smaller, off the top of my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finnish legislation considers 60-200 mg/kg as elevated levels, 200-750 as contaminated and 750+ as heavily contaminated. That fits pretty nicely on the 50 ppm upper level you got there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That number is wrong. Official average background here in Texas (according to TCEQ) is 10 ppm.</p>
<p>Sure, it varies, but not enough to make an overall average of 400.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On that  note, a blood sampling of an average 10-year-old child in 1969 was 10 micrograms per deciliter. It's estimated that a child would lose one iq point for every two micrograms per deciliter. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/publications/books/plpyc/chapter2.htm" target="_blank">Here's a source from the cdc</a></p></div>		</li>
