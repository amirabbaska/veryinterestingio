			<div class="markdown"><p>This depends on how cold you need it to be. The above is true but the same physics will cause the tea-milk mixture to quickly find equilibrium. The milk is much colder than ambient air, so adding the cold milk will result in a cooler milk-tea mix much faster than air could, especially because the milk is seeing more of the tea's surface area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but after letting the milkless tea cool rapidly, he's going to add the cold milk.  He's not concerned with how quickly the heat is lost, rather how quickly he can get the finished product to a drinkable temperature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Note: The numbers are made up, but the concept is what matters. Method B will have a short term edge over method A, but there is a &quot;sweet spot&quot; where method A is preferred. This points out the fact that you would want to run some experiments to collect real data to determine if Method A overtakes Method B before or after the <del>100 degree</del> target temperature mark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP is asking two different questions, though. One question, their title, does not make time a constant. The other uses time as a constant.</p>
<p>The reality is that we don't know what temperature OP likes to drink their tea at. They say they don't like &quot;extremely&quot; hot tea. At what temperature is tea no longer extremely hot, though? That is up to OP to decide.</p>
<p>So, I think we all agree that if OP waited 3 minutes, then put milk in, their tea would be cooler than the cup where OP put milk in immediately. What will that temperature difference be, though, and when will the tea become drinkable?</p>
<p>What if OP likes their tea at 75C? It's possible that if OP adds milk immediately, their tea will be drinkable before the 3 minutes is up, which would make that the winning choice of the two options.</p>
<p>The reality is that the fastest possible option for OP is to let the tea steep for X amount of time before adding the milk to get the combined temperature down to 75C. That might mean letting it steep for 90 seconds, then adding milk, letting it steep for 10 minutes before adding milk, or somewhere in between. The lower the temperature OP likes their tea, the longer they should let it steep without milk in it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Beg to differ.  He is certainly concerned with how quickly the heat is lost.  He wants the heat to be lost as quickly as possible.  This is done by waiting to add the milk, as thermodynamics says the hot tea will lose heat more quickly than the tea-milk combination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume that stirring is part of the process, which makes the milk-to-tea temperature equilibrium happen almost instantly regardless of when you put it in. The point is the tea loses energy more quickly when it is really hot, so leave it really hot until the last moment when you add your cold milk.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The question isn't which cools the the tea more, adding cold milk or being exposed to cold air. The question is, is the result different depending on the order in which these two are done, and the answer is yes. Letting the tea sit before milk is added (when it is hotter) cools it down more, because hot tea sitting leaks more heat than lukewarm tea sitting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it accurate to say that method A will cool the tea the most over 3 minutes and one action of pouring cold milk. Where as method B may bring it to drinking temperature quicker which may be higher than the total change in temperature from method A.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not arguing but wouldnt it be more appropriate to use Newton's Law of Cooling? That being said, we've only been studying convection for about a week and I also understand that conduction still happens in liquids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if we have constant heat transfer coefficient in this case, and I would not assume it without proper insight first? Although it still deeply depends on the temperature difference so the conclusion is the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I would agree in assuming that we dont have a constant h(r) which is what makes convection so much trickier than conduction. What people dont seem understand is that fourier's law will tell you pretty much the same behaviors in heat transfer as Newton's Law of Cooling. Thanks for the edit, that cleared things up really well!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If this milk is sitting in the fridge the whole time, you are correct. If the milk is sitting out of the fridge in a milk jug and warming up while OP waits the 3 minutes, it's going to depend on the air temperature and initial temperatures of tea and milk, and relative sizes and shapes of the teacup and milk jug. But in the typical case it's still better to wait before pouring in the milk.</p></div>		</li>
