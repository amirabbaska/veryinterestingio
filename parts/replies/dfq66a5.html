			<div class="markdown"><p>I always use low power, long times. Then when I'm heating food up for the wife she's like &quot;just microwave it normal.&quot; Yeah, if by normal you mean like a half witted food prepper. I'm a microwave chef here, let me use my tools the way I know how.</p>
<p>When I sit down with my reheated mashed potatoes and meat, I don't burn my damn tounge and I don't have to get up and put it in for longer because my shit ain't cold in the middle.</p>
<p>Power button for life. It's the best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you adjust the times?</p>
<p>Normally my hot pocket goes in on high for 90s then I flip and put another 90s.</p>
<p>How would you microwave it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always microwave on high, but I do it in short bursts of time. That is actually all the microwave's low power settings do. I just prefer to do it manually. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the convenience of hitting &quot;go&quot; once and being able to walk away until it's done.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful at work where my desk is up on the 2nd floor but the microwave (and bathroom) are on the 1st floor. Start the food heating, go have a pee, grab a couple things from the lab that I'll need later, and then the food's ready!</p></div>		</li>
