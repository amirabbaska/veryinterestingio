<p>A) Is there a general sense of what the French national reaction will be? I remember September 11th. By the end of the day there was a basically universal consensus that we were going to war with somebody. Are the French feeling the same, or would they prefer to stay out of Syria / Iraq?</p>

<p>It's very hard to say where the West will be after this, and it's difficult to know where/who to fight. The Middle East is an absolute quagmire with proxy wars within proxy wars so a military intervention will be unlikely to create anything sustainable. I am not French, I cannot speak for them but as an American who has friends coming back from the Middle East I can't say I'm eager to see anyone sent back. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>B) If France undertook military action against ISIS, what would our (American) NATO obligations be?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We would be supporting them, if not simultaneously leading our own front. This is most likely the best time for unilateral support of a military answer to ISIS as the Iraq war was very much the Americans show.  It would be uncouth to refuse to assist them considering how much they've done to assist America in the Middle East, especially recently with bombing raids in Syria. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm, that's going to be downvoted, but as a french, I'm not as worried about terrorisme as I'm worried about what the governement is going to do. I'm very afraid of what the terror is going to justify. I'm concerned about the state of emergency. I'm concerned about some laws that could be voted because everyone is afraid.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to say this, but 120 dead people is not much. It's terrible and really sad, but let's not forget it DOES NOT force anyone to go to war. I'd like people to be able to THINK before they FEEL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If one NATO member is attacked then the other members of NATO are obligated to come to their aide in all capacities. This was originally intended to be against state actors, primarily the USSR, but was most recently loosely applied to 9/11. You have to have someone to retaliate against. With 9/11 it was the Taliban, a government in the area we call Afghanistan that was shielding al queada. </p>
<p>So if this is ISIS and a NATO clause of is invoked then it would lead to retaliation against ISIS led by France or whomever takes the lead. But the USA and other NATO members have been combating ISIS already so the most likely scenario would be an escalation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They could invoke Chapter 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty just as the US did after 9/11, &quot;an attack on one is an attack on all&quot; and call for a response. </p>
<p>Now if it was ISIL then since the US is already heavily involved along with France likely not much will change, but nations like Canada who were trying to draw back will get put on the spot as it were. </p>
<p>But if this was perhaps the result of Al Qaeda in the Maghreb which France spent many years fighting in Mali, separate from NATO it is more up in the air what the US and NATO response might be. </p></div>		</li>
