			<div class="markdown"><p>Until refs start protecting players especially goalies (which I see get run at an alarming rate) with game misconducts fights will be needed. It's to easy for a 4th line guy to take 3 penalties while playing a top tier team and running the goalie to get in his head. </p>
<p>I played goal in AA and I would usually let it go if a guy was trying to score or its the first time his run me, but I have broken ankles with slashes because a ref will refuse to call him for it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a fellow non-NHL player who was always one of the smaller guys until about age 17, I disagree. Fighting should never be taken out of the game unless it becomes a non-contact sport all together. In which case it ceases to be hockey and instead is just a game of shinny. </p>
<p>Refs can't catch everything, and fighting keeps players honest. Or, it's supposed to and generally does, I think. Sure, some fights are unnecessary and/or absurd, but remember that time when your starting winger, top scorer, and generally the star of the team got cross checked from behind and sustained a season ending injury? The guy who cross checked him remembers. He got his ass beat because of it and ever since, thinks twice before laying a dirty hit. </p>
<p>Fuck with our goalie? Be ready to drop the gloves, no one fucks with anyone's goalie without retaliation. The enforcer role has been diminishing over the past 10-20 years, but fighting still has its place in the game. You take away fighting and it either becomes a much more dangerous game or a non-contact high level game of shinny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with what you're saying, but only to a point...</p>
<p>I love a good scrap that is a part of the game.</p>
<p>When I started to look differently at fights (somewhat) is when almost all of the fighting was done by guys who were pushing 250+ pounds, and were shitty hockey players at every level of hockey growing up.</p>
<p>It got to be absurd. These goons got so big (and so one dimensional) that they ruined real hockey fights (where the actual players who are playing the game would drop the mitts and settle scores. </p>
<p>Because of these one dimensional guys, it virtually eliminated the real, old school power forward from the game altogether. </p>
<p>I love seeing a real fight between guys who are part of the game, and part of the play. </p>
<p>A lot of people think that the guys from the 80's were one dimensional goons...but there was a difference; most of those guys were still legit hockey players even up to and including junior hockey, or the minor leagues. The only exception I can think of was Dave Brown. </p>
<p>Semenko, Behn Wilson, Bob Probert, Gino Odjick, Willi Plett, Tim Hunter, Chris Nilan, John Kordic, Joey Kocur...no one was confusing them with being stars (Probert, Wilson, maybe even Plett as a rookie were valuable players even without the fighting), but those guys were still accomplished players before making the NHL.</p>
<p>Some of the guys more recently (although they have since kind of gone extinct) were scoring 1-2 goals a season playing Junior B. They were putting up 3-4 point seasons in the ECHL!
That shit ruined fighting for a lot of people that otherwise loved it.</p>
<p>Those guys are almost all gone now. Maybe there's a resurgence in fighting amongst the real skaters who feel a lot safer playing physical now that they won't have to fight a guy 50, 60 pounds heavier than them. I'd like to see that.</p>
<p>I agree that guys should be held accountable, and that refs can't (and often won't) do it. </p></div>		</li>
