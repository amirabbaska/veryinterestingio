			<div class="markdown"><p>might be an issue in old copper cables, but fiber is completely immune to all EM noise. And it is certainly possible to make equipment resistant to EM pulses. there just isn't any demand for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, as long as your Faraday cage doesn't melt from all the current induced by the EM pulse. Hence thicker cage. Hence expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. I'd be worried about a digital camera suffering sensor damage from the initial blast or electronics damage from the emp / radiation. Even with a long cable to a safe data storage unit there's a risk that the camera won't be able to get useful footage between the explosion and the arrival of the shockwave</p></div>		</li>
