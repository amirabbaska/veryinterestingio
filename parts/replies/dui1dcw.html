			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes a powerful sensor to expose the darkest shadows and the brightest of highlights, it takes an experienced cinematographer to expose those details or light for those details correctly, and it takes an experienced colorist to decide what the best balance of range is for the scene.</p>
<p>So even if a camera can shoot a wide range, the cinematographer still decides what to do WITH that range. Err on the side of darks, or play in highlights? Or both? The colorist (with the eye of the cinematographer) then take the image in post and see what needs improvement, maybe bring up the highlights a bit more, maybe expose the actors face a bit more too, maybe we don’t need to see all that detail in the shadows, and are better off losing some of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The range in the darks is really important. It allows you to (optically in the past, digitally today) overexpose the image and reveal more and more detail in the shadows as opposed to dealing with a solid area of black.   </p>
<p>In digital vfx, that dynamic range is expressed in bit depth of a digital image.  The more the better. In my last studio the image was expressed as a floating point expression rather than a set of discrete levels (256, 512, etc).  I don’t know all the guts of it but it allows someone in compositing and color correction to balance the image with a far greater range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dynamic range comes from the quality of your camera sensor. It determines how much detail you will be able to capture from the darkest points up to the brightest points. For example if you are shooting a subject with their back to the sun so they are heavily back lit, with a low dynamic range camera the image would look like a black silhouette with overexposed highlights from the sunlight. A camera with high dynamic range, you would be able to see the subject clearly in the shadows and the highlights from the sun properly exposed. This cannot be replicated in editing. Although everything can be adjusted in editing, the information has to be captured with the camera in order for it to be adjusted in editing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of being in a garage with an open door on a very sunny day. High dynamic range is being able to see the brightly lit outside and the darkened interior at the same time. </p>
<p>Lower dyanamic range means you have to compromise. Either you adjust the sensor to see the bright outside and make everthing inside just black, or you set it to see the darker inside and have everything outside be a white light. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>dynamic range is how much light information can be caught in an image between pure black and pure white... when you go outside at night, you can probably see lots of detail in shadows and inside your house if the window lights were still on, thats because an actual eyeball with a brain on the end of it can see a lot more information than a camera's sensor or a piece of film. </p>
<p>Cheaper cameras have sensors that aren't as sensitive and they have less dynamic range. Film is the best (or used to be) but now digital cinema cameras are pretty equal or even exceed film's dynamic range in some cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dynamic range is dependent on well depth (number of electrons in a pixel well) and not sensitivity (which determines the smallest amount of light detectable through noise, currently researchers are approving single photon levels).
Also cheaper cameras have a lower bit depth (on the AD-converter) of 8 bits, meaning that if they had large dynamic ranges, the intensity jumps between each bit value would be to large, resulting in a strange image. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's basically the amount of detail that can be caught at once.</p>
<p>the more dynamic range you have, the better your shadows will look when it's super bright.</p>
<p>Have you ever takena. picture where you can see what you're taking a picture of perfectly, yet it won't really show up on the camera?</p>
<p>that's because ours eyes have MUCH more dynamic range than a camera sensor.</p></div>		</li>
