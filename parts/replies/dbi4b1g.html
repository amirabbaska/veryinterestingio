			<div class="markdown"><p>That reminds me of this Star Trek: TNG episode where Picard essentially lived another life while being unconscious for a few minutes. He experienced 40 years while minutes passed for his crew. </p>
<p>I find the idea somewhat fascinating...experiencing another life while asleep or unconscious due to other circumstances. I actually have a recurring dream that progresses each time I have it...almost like I'm getting a glimpse of my life in another reality/timelines.</p>
<p>That being said, I'm sorry that your father and family had to go through that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did Salvia once in college, and had this exact experience except in reverse. I was the captain of a spaceship, and my crew was calling my name. &quot;What happened? We've been trying to get your attention for 5 minutes&quot; they said. &quot;Sorry I was day dreaming about being in college, it's weird, it felt so real.&quot;
And then I went on to command the ship. It was very strange and intense, because I felt very comfortable in that situation. I even had memories of my crew and felt different relationships with different crew members ie. A few were great friends and some were just subordinates.
To this day it feels like I tapped into an alternate reality of myself. Pretty neat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did salvia once and I had the opposite effect. My vision went black and I felt as if I was in another universe where everything was the same but could only be viewed in a weird block form that sort of spun around in circles. All I could remember was saying, &quot;No...NO!&quot; </p>
<p>I felt as if I had lost my body completely.</p>
<p>According to my friends, I started screaming at the top of my lungs and I ran inside. I then began to say my own name as if someone else inhabited my body and was trying to bring me back in by calling out to me. My eyes looked like a dark madness.</p>
<p>When I regained a conscious view of the world, which is how I would describe coming down, I was in on the floor inside my house. I had no recollection what I did or any time that had passed. I can honestly say it was one of the worst experiences of my life, but I'm glad your experience was positive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Good times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It remind me of a story I read here on Reddit when a redditor had an injury and lived a full life getting married with children and woke up to realize it was just a dream, that's terrifying and amazing at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading that too. I think he was only unconscious for for 5 or 10 minutes, although I could be wrong. I think he wound up getting some serious therapy for it too, considering he lost his wife and kids which he never actually had.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I almost got there: About 10 years ago, I was taking Chantix for a few months, along with Effexor (absolutely not recommended), I would sleep for much of a day, living a completely alternate life. I would stay in that world as long as possible-- everything worked out really great most of the time, I had friends, and a great job, and it felt so comforting. Every time I went back to sleep, it was a continuation of the last experience. And then, gradually, as my beatific happy alternate states got more comfortable, I decided that I wanted to stay there forever. I lived near the ocean at the time (irl), and I figured I could just walk into the ocean, and go back to being in the alternate state full time. It was all quite positive, and made perfect sense. One night when I was awake doing some internet researching, a headline said &quot;Chantix causing suicide in patients on anti-depressants!&quot; So I called the doctor's answering service, and was like &quot;hm, I don't know, maybe this is happening to me? bc I feel like I'm just going to take a little walk into the ocean.&quot; You bet I got about a thousand voicemails the next morning. Got off the Chantix immediately, bought a pack of cigs.</p></div>		</li>
