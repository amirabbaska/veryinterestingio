			<div class="markdown"><p>This is largely to make the window stronger, the tempering makes it so you can hit said window with a hammer and not break it, it takes a sharp localized force to start the shatter then all that stored energy is what fragments the window making it much safer as a byproduct, instead of a long shard to the juggular. </p>
<p>Front windows are also tempered but are as others mentioned laminated with plastic binding he two layers, this is to again help with impact survivability so when you hit a bird or rock that gets kicked up it doesn't fly through the window and kill you. </p>
<p>The tempering is for impact strength, the byproduct is safety, </p></div>		</li>

<p>Obviously depends on the energy going in, a 70 mph brick is probably going to make it's way through just fine. Tempering can only do so much. </p>

<p>That would have to be a hell of a scratch. Even as thin as 3mm takes a decent hit on a corner to pop &quot;easily&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
