			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good top post to get the &quot;No&quot; out of the way immediately. I didn't intend to give people the false impression (or hope) that this sort of system would be stable or persistent in any way. The long-term stability presented in the game is wholly untenable short of space magic. </p>
<p>In the early thread I was seeing a lot of conjecture and misinformation about other concepts that I wanted to help clear up. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Nobody in the real world has done a dive on pressurized gas to a depth greater than 700 meters, the people who've done it to a depth below 100 meters only do so with hours of preparation, a special gas mixture, and slow cautious pressure changes, and even then many of the people who've tried to dive below 300 meters have lived. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm kind of confused by this. Did you mean <em>not</em> many people who have tried to dive below 300 meters survived? Or did you just mean it's survivable if you put in the prep work? I haven't played the game but from the rest of the post it came off like it lets you dive unrealistically deep, not unrealistically shallow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moon pools can be done, but only if the air in the compartment is at the same pressure as the water outside.  That's easy enough in shallow water, but at depth that means breathing in your base has the same biophysical problems as scuba diving.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They are solvable. I remember watching a video where a few technicians were doing week-long deep dives and living in a pressurized chamber underwater to avoid slow ascents every day. Can't find a link though.</p>
<p>edit: found it, it's called <em>saturation diving</em>, there are many videos for this request.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't played so I don't know how the moon pool looks from the outside, but I've seen a screenshot from the interior. Could you not fit the module with an airlock, but it's really a waterlock? What I mean is, have a dome on the outside large enough to contain any people or equipment that need transfer. When the door closes, the water inside the dome should be normal. Then you can open an inner door to get stuff inside. This inner door can be closed and the outer door opened so you're not dragging water with you for no reason.</p>
<p>To maintain the aesthetic, the inner door can be below the surface of the pool</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Subnautica moonpools likely have some sort of shielding, being a futuristic setting, so the lack of realism with them is pretty passable.</p></div>		</li>
