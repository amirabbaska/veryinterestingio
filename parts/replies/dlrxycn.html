I think every time you unknot a lace someone else's lace becomes knotted. That is why I prefer generic white velcro sneakers. Also because that is what the asylum issues me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends. If it's from work or something that you have to do, yes. If it's from stress, maybe, depends on how your stress is. If it's from an injury, sudden motion, or something similar, only if you do it again. </p>
<p>You can massage the knots yourself as well, it's about moving the myosin / calcium mixture (chemical that causes your muscles to contract) away from the minor injury to allow it to relax. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It only &quot;depends&quot; because you might go through similar circumstances and a similar knot will appear in the same location though, right? I mean, once a knot is gone, it'll stay gone. The way I understand it, it's not a unique object in and of itself, it's just contracted muscle tissue. So while your lifestyle might mean that you'll work up more knots later in the same places on your body, the ones that are gone will stay gone. </p>
<p>It's like getting a small bruise that eventually disappears. If you get hit again at the same spot, it's not really the same bruise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Saving what? Money? You don't need a massage. If you're fit, and stretch often, you don't <em>need</em> massages. Most people go their whole life without getting a massage. Massages are more of an enjoyment than a need. If you want to save money, don't get any massages. You'll do your body better if you spent that money on yoga classes or something. Obviously it's more work, and more effort, but also much better for your body.</p></div>		</li>
