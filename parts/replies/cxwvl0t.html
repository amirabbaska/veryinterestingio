			<div class="markdown"><p>Up until a few years ago, the <em>vast</em> majority of Scientologists didn't know a thing about Xenu, didn't know the significance of the volcano on the cover of Dianetics, etc. Like someone else posted, it took <strong>years</strong> of time and millions of dollars to reach the levels within Scientology where you learned the <strong>TRUTH</strong>. The info was out there - I remember a religion teacher in high school telling us about it 20-ish years ago - but it wasn't widespread and there were no credible sources. </p>
<p>Edit: And if you don't happen to have the $millions, you can always sign a contract for a <strong>literal</strong> billion years of indentured servitude (I mean, it's not slavery if you agree to it, right?). </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not slavery, no. It's also not enforceable, not by a long shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a belief only exposed to people after they've paid a metric ton of money into Scientology and they spent a lot of time as Scientologists.  The majority of Scientologists were unaware of the whole Xenu thing.</p>
<p>Remember L. Ron Hubbard was a Science Fiction writer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite L. Ron Hubbard quote is from a Science Fiction convention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don't get rich writing science fiction. If you want to get rich, you start a religion.  </p>
<ul>
<li>L. Ron Hubbard, 7 Nov. 1948</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And my second favorite</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN CONTROL PEOPLE IS TO LIE TO THEM. You can write that down in your book in great big letters. The only way you can control anybody is to lie to them.  </p>
<ul>
<li>L. Ron Hubbard, June 1952 (<a href="http://www.matrixfiles.com/Scientology%20Materials/index.php?dir=Scientology+Journal%2F&amp;download=Journal+of+Scientology+Issue+18-G.pdf" target="_blank">Journal of Scientology issue 18-G</a>)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So like, nobody who's a scientologist has the ability to google? Of course all of us want to say that every Scientology convert is clearly retarded and must not have a basic understanding of the Internet. The thing is that it's a cult, and cults can get anyone. Even if you're far gone enough to think &quot;all those documentaries are just part of the conspiracy against the perfection of Scientology,&quot; you'd still think they'd Google the gist of what their church is founded on. Then again I have to wonder how well people understand even their own religion and how much they looked up themselves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There was also one episode where they parodied the pulp fiction scene talking about europe vs America, but comparing Krusty Burger to Mcdonalds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the example from Robot Chicken where they wanted to have Superman fart the National Anthem b/c they thought it'd be funny &amp; their lawyers were like: &quot;No, that's not really parody because there is no connection on <em>why</em> you're using Superman to this fart joke.&quot;  So they had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBALo49Yt5Q" target="_blank">Uncle Sam</a> do it (which actually had a connection of the character to the joke).</p>
<p>But when they did a super hero <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tE46dXpAWY" target="_blank">Real World</a> were Superman was just an asshole, lawyers were like &quot;Yeah, that works, because of the context of how you're parodying Superman.&quot;</p>
<p>Or something like that... it was on an audio commentary &amp; google isn't helping me.</p>
<hr />
<p>edit: Tagging OP /u/killerbekilled92 b/c I feel like it might get lost in 700+ replies, but I think Robot Chicken is a good case study.</p></div>		</li>
