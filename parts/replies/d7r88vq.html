			<div class="markdown"><p>Truth is you <em>can</em> get your own internet if you want. </p>
<p>Set up a web server and connect it to a home network, connect your other computers to it, now you have a small network.<br />
Add two more switches and pull cables between them, these will have to be able to recognize multiple connections to the same network and handle that. Add some more machines to these two switches.</p>
<p>Now you have a mesh network, now your other computers can reach your web server by means of multiple routes, if you remove one cable between the switches you still have two more &quot;lanes&quot; to pass through.<br />
There's much more to it that this but this is the core principle of the internet. A vast and redundant network where automated machines (routers!) help you take the fastest route to your destination.</p>
<p>To end, you know that Wi-Fi router in your home? That's actually using a &quot;public IP&quot;, basically it's as much a part of the internet as Google's DNS server (IP 8.8.8.8) although not sharing even remotely the same purpose of course, however you <em>could</em> technically do that yourself no problem.    </p>
<p>In the end the internet is as simple as it is complex. The technologies available to us means we could build our own internet infrastructure as much we want. Would be like constructing your own road; not the same quality but it'd get the job done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Say I do this and I have my computers all connected over my private network with my own cables and own web server (how does one acquire and set up a web server anyway?), does this mean I'm not connected to the rest of the internet? How could I access google if all my computers/switches/routers are just connected to each other?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehhhh... they have man traps, eye scanners, and key cards... but they aren't really <em>that secure</em>. You could pretty easily break into one with a pistol and/or some social engineering, but it's not like a military facility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wireless Internet transmission via dedicated microwave technology is pretty hot right now. I worked for an WISP that employed this technology and we were able to compete with the big boys for MDUs (large apartment complexes) and corporate buildings.</p>
<p>We were able to compete mostly because point-to-point microwave transmission of Internet allowed for dedicated speeds that were comparable to FIOS.</p>
<p>We just needed to lease rooftop space from tall buildings to position satellite dishes for a mesh network. This way, we were able to avoid the costly expenses associated with wired infrastructure. We would just wire the target building and at the roof would be satellites for point to point connections.</p>
<p>There's another transmission tech called point to multi-point and we DID NOT use this.. this doesn't provide the dedicated speeds that &quot;point-to-point&quot; transmission provides.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even then, you would just get bought out by the larger companies. They do it all the time.</p>

<p>A lot of people who start businesses do it with the hope that a big company will buy them out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most business owners realize they need some sort of &quot;exit strategy&quot;, but many would prefer to pass the business on to their children over selling out. </p>
<p>I'm kinda in this spot myself. I just have a couple of rent houses; no big business. I'd like to have my kids inherit them someday, but when I talk about the business, their eyes glaze over. </p></div>		</li>
