			<p>No, that was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder" target="_blank">O'Neill Cylinder.</a> Bishop rings are, in theory, open. The whole thing is spun to create a comfortable artificial gravity and that spin gravity holds the air in. You could literally climb a wall (in a pressure suit), let go at the top and you'd be in space. Or, more practically, you could fly your spaceship in, match velocities, and land. No docking/airlocks necessary. Same concept as the Ringworld, only it's vastly smaller. The Ringworld had a 1 AU radius. A Bishop Ring is generally envisioned as something in orbit around a gas giant. Big by modern human building standards, but utterly insignificant compared to a Ringworld.<br><br>An O'Neill Cylinder is enclosed. Think of it as being shaped like a pill. The thing is spun about its long axis, again creating spin gravity, but the air is kept in because the whole thing is pressurized. In order to get in or out you'd have to dock at one pole or another, and go through an airlock. At the center you'd be in 0 g, and then you'd climb down to the inside of the cylinder. This concept is very common in hard Sci-Fi. Rama was a cylinder, Interstellar had one as you mentioned, Babylon 5 was one, etc.</p>		</li>

			<p>Anathem by Neil Stephenson does something similar to this, except the cylinder is surrounded by twelve giant spheres half full of water with cities floating on the water with the cylinder acting as a central hub which all the sphere habitats could reach using smaller cylinders designed as transport corridors. <br><br>Keep in mind that all of this is inside of a massive icosahedron shaped space vessel smaller than Earth's moon which propelled itself by ejecting nuclear payloads out of a small hatch on the back which would then detonate and the shock wave would transfer kinetic energy to a dish structure on the back of the icosahedron which was designed to catch the force of the shockwave. </p>		</li>

			<p>The Culture's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_%28The_Culture%29" target="_blank">Orbitals</a> were the inspiration for the HALO structures.  The solve a few Ringworld problems.  <br><br>They're smaller and thus orbit the star like a planet and are stable without a control system.<br><br>Orbitals are also tilted slightly with respect to the orbital plane around the star, and their rotation (for gravity) gives a natural day/night cycle.  This is a bit more elegant than the Ringworld's shadow squares on an inner orbit.<br><br>So if you build an Orbital 3 million kilometers in diameter, spin it so that you get 1G, it turns out you'll also get a fairly normal day/night cycle.</p>		</li>

			<p>Nope!<br><br>For small numbers of rings, it's pretty similar to just having one ring - any little shove will amplify and cause the thing to crash into the Earth. But if you add enough rings, you're approaching a Dyson sphere. And the gravitational interaction between a Dyson sphere and a planet or star inside is zero - if there's a little instability, the Dyson sphere will just slowly float towards the ground until it hits it.</p>		</li>

			<p>Just a short follow-up, the reason the spherical case works is because of a classical result called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_theorem" target="_blank">shell theorem</a>, which says that the gravity <em>at any point</em> on the interior of a spherical shell is zero. The idea, is that if an object is closer to one side of the shell, the stronger attraction to the closer side will be exactly cancelled out by the weaker attraction to the further side, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/VRzlmrd.gif" target="_blank">as shown here</a>.<br><br>This argument may at first seem obvious from considerations of symmetry, but it's actually not so simple as OP's example shows. The reason the cancellation works out in 3D is because just as the force of gravity scales as 1/r^(2), the area intersected in the diagram above scales as r^(2) and the two cancel out. On the other hand, for a 2D system, this will no longer be the case and an object closer to one edge of the ring <em>will</em> feel a net gravitational force pointing towards the closer edge.</p>		</li>

			<p>Serious question here, since I've thought about this a lot and never been able to ask.  <br><br>Ok, so if you were standing on the sphere which way would gravity pull you?

			<p>Yes, usually we say proportional to the distance form it's center of mass, but that implicitly assumes that no point of the object extends past us in our direction (so the object is completely on one side of us....as in you can separate yourself and the object with a plane).</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ClintonCanCount" target="_blank">ClintonCanCount</a>
			<p>That concept breaks down once you are inside the sphere, unfortunately.<br><br>What does work is pretending the sphere is a two dimensional surface with a weighting function, for simplicity.<br><br>A relatively easy way to think about this is with multivariable integration; simply integrate over a sphere the distance to a point inside the sphere, or outside, squared.

			<p>Uniform density and equal thickness of the sphere is necessary, yeah. If there's a small difference, say you stand on one side of the sphere, there will be an attraction between you and whatever is inside, but only you and whatever is inside.<br><br>So similar to the ring system, you'd probably need some kind of propulsion or rotation to keep the system stable, but unlike the ring system, you only need the difference in mass between the two sides.</p>		</li>

			<p>For a solid shell Dyson sphere, yes, it'll fall into the star eventually.<br><br>But in &quot;practical&quot; terms (as far as &quot;practical&quot; goes for a Dyson sphere), what you'd actually do for a Dyson sphere is what you might call a &quot;Dyson swarm&quot; - you have a large enough number of little planetoids orbiting the star at all angles that it completely covers the star all the time.
