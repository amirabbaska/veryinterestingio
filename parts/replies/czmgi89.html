			<div class="markdown"><p>The Culture's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_%28The_Culture%29" target="_blank">Orbitals</a> were the inspiration for the HALO structures.  The solve a few Ringworld problems.  </p>
<p>They're smaller and thus orbit the star like a planet and are stable without a control system.</p>
<p>Orbitals are also tilted slightly with respect to the orbital plane around the star, and their rotation (for gravity) gives a natural day/night cycle.  This is a bit more elegant than the Ringworld's shadow squares on an inner orbit.</p>
<p>So if you build an Orbital 3 million kilometers in diameter, spin it so that you get 1G, it turns out you'll also get a fairly normal day/night cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope!</p>
<p>For small numbers of rings, it's pretty similar to just having one ring - any little shove will amplify and cause the thing to crash into the Earth. But if you add enough rings, you're approaching a Dyson sphere. And the gravitational interaction between a Dyson sphere and a planet or star inside is zero - if there's a little instability, the Dyson sphere will just slowly float towards the ground until it hits it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a short follow-up, the reason the spherical case works is because of a classical result called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_theorem" target="_blank">shell theorem</a>, which says that the gravity <em>at any point</em> on the interior of a spherical shell is zero. The idea, is that if an object is closer to one side of the shell, the stronger attraction to the closer side will be exactly cancelled out by the weaker attraction to the further side, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/VRzlmrd.gif" target="_blank">as shown here</a>.</p>
<p>This argument may at first seem obvious from considerations of symmetry, but it's actually not so simple as OP's example shows. The reason the cancellation works out in 3D is because just as the force of gravity scales as 1/r^(2), the area intersected in the diagram above scales as r^(2) and the two cancel out. On the other hand, for a 2D system, this will no longer be the case and an object closer to one edge of the ring <em>will</em> feel a net gravitational force pointing towards the closer edge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I love that sort of fanbase-- people who love the work dearly, but are also simultaneously having a grand time pointing out all its flaws.  But even more than that sort of fanbase, I like the sort of author who can take the criticism as the rabid fans intend it-- as a sort of weird nerd-obsessive compliment-- and then run with it rather than taking it as an insult.</p></div>		</li>
