<p>However, what people are missing is the fact that the PS2 (or any console) has a very specific way of doing essentially everything. </p>

<p>An analogy I always liked: </p>
<p>Suppose you have a modern PC that's designed to draw squares. It's super good at drawing squares -- it draws a billion of them every second. But squares are all it understands.</p>
<p>Now suppose there's a 10-year-old console that doesn't draw squares at all. It draws circles. If you want your PC to emulate that console, how do you do it? You have to tell it to recreate every circle out of a thousand squares arranged in a circular shape. It takes a thousand times more processing power to do it, and if you look closely the circles aren't quite circles at all...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meh, the analogy works better with triangles and squares.</p>
<p>You can make it look perfectly like the correct square, it just takes more effort (processing power). Otherwise, you get pretty close square-like objects.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That thing is the biggest hassle in creating ps2 emulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blast processing is just a buzzword (well, words) that really only refers to the 68000's higher clock speed when compared to the SNES's CPU. The Emotion Engine on the other hand is an actual hardware architecture unique to the PS2, and a rather complex and unorthodox one, when compared to the Gamecube's Power-based CPU or Xbox's Pentium III.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but they have still some exceptions and peculiarities to make it different enough to not be &quot;easy&quot;. The original xbox is also more or less a specialized pc and is not exactly easy to emulate (but to be fair, there is also not much interest from people to get original xbox emulation so we won't ever see a lot of progression there)</p>
<p>But the PS4 and XBone are MUCH faster than these old consoles as well. You still have to emulate them at full speed for an enjoyable emulation so even IF it's easier in general you still have to do more in the same time.</p>
<p>Like: instead of lifting 100 kilos 10 times you now have to lift 30 kilos 200 times.
And: 30x200=6000 &gt; 10x100=1000
-&gt; Overall work still increased a lot even if the individual tasks are easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The PS4 runs a custom OS (Orbis) based on FreeBSD. It doesn't use GL, instead opting for it's own graphics stack (GNM). Et al.</p>
<p>So there's no way to test the software in a vanilla manner. Sony does provide an SDK that allows you to create / run software on a PC, but it's handling those API call conversions for you.</p></div>		</li>
