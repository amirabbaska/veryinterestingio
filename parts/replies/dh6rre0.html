			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up convergent evolution.  The ancestors of whales evolved over millions of years to have their muscles optimized for swimming in a structure quite similar to fish. However the earthy red and &quot;firmness&quot; of the meat, as seen in many land animals, is clearly seen as evidence of the terrestrial past of proto-whales and other sea mammals.</p></div>		</li>
