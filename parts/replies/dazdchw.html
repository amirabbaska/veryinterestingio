<p>To add on to this, to win a constituency, you have to get the most votes. So if a MP gets only 15% of the vote, but everybody else has lower amount of votes, he wins anyway.</p>
<p>Now imagine if all the representatives win this way, and all belong to the same party. It's possible to have a government that was only wanted by 15% of the population. Even though it will probably never happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I like the preferential voting system Australia has.  </p>
<p>If there's no clear winner you knock off the person with the fewest votes.<br />
Everyone has said who they like second best, so the votes then go to that person.<br />
Repeat until you've got a winner.  </p>
<p>It takes longer to count, but it helps people feel like their vote counts, and you can't &quot;waste&quot; your vote, as it'll eventually hit someone anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>UK had a referendum to switch to that system in 2011 but didn't win due to a FUD campaign from it's opponents (NOtoAV) who put up posters everywhere saying <a href="http://leftfootforward.org/images/2011/02/No2AV-baby-poster.jpg" target="_blank">babies</a> and <a href="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2011/2/25/1298628970292/no-to-av-baby-campaign-005.jpg" target="_blank">soldiers</a> would die, and that under AV the loser can come first, and various other bullshit. Interestingly same people who ran that FUD also ran the official brexit campaign.</p>
<p>I think had AV got through brexit probably wouldn't have happened due to people having fairer representation in parliament and not needing to protest vote.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, worse, you could have 51% of constituencies win that way, so the government would be backed by 7.5% of the population, and have absolute power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Extreme examples aside, it's realistic to score around 38% of the popular vote and have 55-60% of the seats in parliament which is a sizeable majority. Arguments for this include creating strong governments reflecting the general will of the people without needing fractious coalitions or minority administrations that can't get much done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The us republican party is a good example. </p>
<p>The primaries were between four men, all closely matched. However one guy kept coming out ahead. It didn't matter that he only got 30%, because that was more than anyone else. As a result, he got all the delegates up for grabs in each state that he won.</p>
<p>Very quickly he had an insurmountable lead and got to run for president. </p></div>		</li>
