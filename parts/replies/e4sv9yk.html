			<div class="markdown"><p>More than a couple, I would think. Keep in mind that the first mutant would have had one fused chromosome, but his/her matching chromosomes would still be unfused. Takes a while for genetic drift to make sure every remaining copy is fused, especially since only half of that first mutant's children would carry the fused chromosome.</p>
<p>The other reason your objection is a good one is that we know of populations of some animals (can't find the research while on my phone) where individuals can have different numbers of chromosomes and still mate just fine with usually-fertile offspring. So I'm skeptical that the fusion leading to chromosome 2 would be such a clean-cut answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the only difference is a chromosome fusion (or splitting), fertility is only minimally affected. What happens is that the unfused chromosomes pair with the homologous parts of the fused chromosome and meiosis is able to proceed successfully. There's still a slightly higher rate of nondisjunction, but the individual is still fertile.</p>
<p>Differing chromosome counts have often been associated with reproductive barriers between species, but that's really a correlation rather than a causal link. Lineages that have become fixed for different numbers of chromosomes have generally also developed lots of other structural mutations during their isolation. It's those other structural mutations <em>within</em> the chromosomes that make homologous pairing and meiosis fail. The chromosome count itself is not directly related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because speciation is rarely instantaneous (single generation) in animals. There is one mechanism of single generation speciation called allopolyploid speciation in which an infertile hybrid offspring is formed and then undergoes a whole genome duplication that restores fertility, but only with itself and its progeny. This mostly only happens in plants, though, because they have the ability to propagate vegetatively in the period between the initial hybridization and later genome duplication and then the ability to self-fertilize after the genome duplication. These traits are not common in animals so allopolyploid speciation very rare, though there are a couple cases, mostly in amphibians.</p>
<p>In general, though, speciation is a process that takes place over hundreds of thousands of years, not a single generation event.</p></div>		</li>
