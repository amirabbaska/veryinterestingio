<p>I don't necessarily see any conflicting statements between top-level responses, but there <em>is</em> some confusion about the meaning of dimension, black hole, and event horizon. The event horizon, at each moment in time, is unambiguously two-dimensional. The horizon is topologically a sphere and can be embedded only in three-dimensional (or higher) space. This is why some people are claiming the horizon is three-dimensional.</p>
<p>The term &quot;black hole&quot; is ambiguous. If you mean the interior region inside the event horizon, then, for each moment in time, this region is three-dimensional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what I've gathered is: The event Horizon is two dimensional because it has no depth, it's merely the 'border' of the object. However if you include the distance between the singularity and the event horizon as being part of the black hole, it is overall a 3D object that is homeomorphic to a sphere.</p>
<p>Is this correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Sphere&quot; means the surface. If you mean the solid Earth, the term is &quot;ball&quot;. The interior region within the event horizon is actually not homeomorphic to a ball since it's not contractible. But that's a very advanced and technical statement to explain. I doubt the explanation would give any layperson much intuition about what a black hole is.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's just best to explain in terms of Earth. The surface of Earth is topologically a sphere. The entire planet is topologically a ball.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The term &quot;event horizon&quot; may also mean the points <em>in spacetime</em> that separate the interior and exterior region. The set of those points is actually three-dimensional, but not because &quot;a ball is 3-dimensional&quot;. Those points really consist of the surface of the black hole throughout all of time (so 2 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension).</p>
<p>So I keep writing &quot;at a moment in time&quot; to emphasize that we are taking a snapshot of the black hole right now and saying &quot;the event horizon is some 2-dimensional surface in space right now&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can it be 2d and be topologically a sphere? Is it just because the event horizon is the boundary of a region so has no thickness?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Where do you see conflicting statements? A three dimensional object with a two-dimensional surface if you treat it as object in space (which is a bit simplified, but works in the context of this question).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This answer is the simplest answer to understand because that's what the Earth is.</p>
<p>So a black hole is essentially a midnight coloured sphere with strong gravitational pull?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you took the Earth and you shrink-wrapped it with a perfectly flat, 2-D material. This material has 0 thickness at all and therefore zero mass. Now remove the Earth and you're left with this 2-D shell in The shape of the surface of the Earth. This is a &quot;three-dimensional object with a two-dimensional surface&quot; as mentioned here, not a solid sphere like the actual Earth. This is the shape of the event horizon. It's not a solid object, it's a two-dimensional surface which encloses some region of 3D space. This boundary has 0 thickness so a point can only be either outside or inside the region at any time, nothing in-between.</p></div>		</li>
