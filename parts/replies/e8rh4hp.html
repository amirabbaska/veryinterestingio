We got to talking about the squiggly lines in our eyes and I'm like, &quot;Yeah I hate when the vortex shows up.&quot; And she was just like, &quot;wut&quot;</p>
<p>We googled it and it turns out I have monthly to bi-monthly ophthalmic migraines. No pain. Just visual distortion. Happens mostly when I am driving.</p></div>		</li>

There was a main spot that appeared before the headache and grew around your peripheral vision until reaching a limit, and after a few hours it disappeared but left my vision wonky for about half a day.</p></div>		</li>

It gets bigger until it takes over my vision, a shimmering fractal rainbow, and it goes away in an hour. No pain, just rainbows. And disorientation. If it happens while driving I MUST pull over or I WILL crash. I'm literally blinded.</p>

<p>Question for you though-  even though there is no pain does your head feel 'weird'?  Almost like muscle fatigue, but in your head?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have exactly the same thing. Never diagnosed but I've had it happen for the last 25 years. I can go a year without an episode but then I can have two or three a month. I have to stop what I'm doing (a pain if I'm driving).  I pop a couple of tylenol just in case it's a precursor to a migraine. It usually goes away in about 30-45 minutes. For me, I can only describe the auras as seeing non-existant ceiling fans spinning in the corners of my eyes.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the opposite, and for years I didn't think what I actually had counted as migraines because I never understood what an 'aura' was. I remember spending a while doubled over in pain at my desk at work, thinking &quot;but at least it's not a migraine.&quot; Eventually I go to the doctor for it, and he's like &quot;Yep, migraines.&quot;</p>
<p>Now if only I could get him to do anything aside from saying &quot;Stop eating chocolate&quot; (tried it, no significant change), &quot;Stop drinking soda&quot; (tried it, no significant change), &quot;Drink more water&quot; (went up to 4L a day, just had to pee a lot), &quot;Get more sleep&quot; (tried it inasmuch was possible without medical leave, no significant change), &quot;Try massage therapy&quot; (my back felt nice, but I don't know if there was real change).</p>
<p>I asked for better pills, cause it can't be good for me to take 2-4 extra strength ibuprofen/naproxen a day (I switch every so often, in hopes of minimizing organ damage/sterility)... Doc said &quot;Well, do they still work?&quot; &quot;Well yeah, but I'm taking so many&quot; &quot;If they work they work.&quot;</p>
<p>People keep asking why I &quot;haven't got the wafer things.&quot; I would need a prescription for wafer things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been in a very similar situation with my migraines. I get about 25 migraines a month.  Taking 4-8 Advil/ibuprofen a day, then triptans if the pain got worse or going to the ER when I can’t stop vomiting and can’t walk or speak from the pain.  My reg doc really didn’t do much for me or know how to help me work to decrease my migraines.
I recently got into a headache clinic at University of Washington. I now have gone from 25 migraine days to 10-12 migraine days per month. </p>
<p>First the Advil/ibuprofen and triptans taken daily cause more migraines or rebound headaches. You body essentially get used to them and “needs” them. The first thing I had to do was “detox” from any and all ibuprofen and triptans(that sucked the first few weeks!) The neurologist at the headache clinic has me doing a few things to help me reduce the amount of migraine days I have.
Here is the list:</p>
<ol>
<li>No ibuprofen or triptans </li>
<li>Supplements that help your body/brain build the right chemicals to help fend off migraines
-SAM E (builds serotonin and dopamine)
-Vitamin B12
-Boswellia (an anti-inflammatory herbal supplement similar to turmeric)
-magnesium </li>
<li>Diet. Trigger foods are different for each person so I am told not to necessarily cut out certain food but to stay away from foods that can cause inflammation.
I am on an Anti-inflammatory Diet. Essentially you don’t eat processed foods and there is a lot of meal prep involved. It’s similar to Keto diet. You eat better foods that are less processed and your gut/stomach is happier. Cutting edge research is showing a direct link of gut health to brain health. </li>
<li>Sleep. 7-8 hours of sleep is essential to help your brain reset its self. </li>
</ol>
<p>The supplements, diet and better sleep habits and removal of ibuprofen has made a huge impact on how many migraines I get per month. </p>
<p>NOTE: I’m not a healthcare practitioner in any sense, just someone who is doing anything I can to regain my life back from this debilitating illness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Find a different doctor. There's a metric shit ton of migraine treatments out there that don't destroy your stomach or liver. There's beta blockers, anti seizure meds, nerve pain meds. And those are just the preventative meds. There's a ton of emergency treatments too.</p>
<p>There's also Amovig, which is a once monthly injection that prevents migraines and reportedly has like 4 side effects and 0 contradictions.</p>
<p>Obviously you want to find your trigger and avoid it, but for some people, like me, there is no one trigger. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right, taking so much ibuprofen is really bad for your stomach. Please go to a neurologist that specializes in migraines. My neurologist has saved my life. He put me on a blood pressure med that is better for migraines, mementine to help with the foggy brain, and recently got me on aimovig, which a monthly injection to prevent migraines. Holy mother of god it’s the best medicine ever. In the 2 months I’ve been on it I’ve gone from migraines 20 days out of the month to maybe one a week, and then they are mild and I can take an excedrin rather than my maxalt. He is planning on decreasing my other meds as the aimovig builds up in my system.
There are several new preventives coming onto the market soon, also, so a neurologist will have more knowledge of those meds than an internist. Good luck to you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to get “normal” migraines, the kind people with regular headaches claim to have when they’re being dramatic and don’t know what they’re talking about.  For the last fifteen years or so I’ve only gotten “visual” migraines.  Just the aura, then fog and nausea for the rest of the day, then for the next day or two any time I cough or (god help me) sneeze, it feels like somebody is stabbing me in the <em>back</em> of one eye.</p>
<p>It’s still a shitshow when it happens, but I wouldn’t go back to the “don’t touch me, turn on the lights or make any noise or I might vomit on you” sort.  It’s hard as hell to explain to most people that, yes, I’m having a migraine, and yes, it’s going to fuck me up a bit today, without it being “a headache” as such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a doctor, but my mother-in-law is an anesthesia tech and subscribed to a pain journal.  She gave me the latest issue because it has to do with migraines.  It mentioned that a lot of the stomach issues that coincide with migraines are because migraines typically cause your digestive tract to kindof freeze (acute illeus?).  This is also speculated to be one of the reasons why pain treatment during a migraine is so difficult, since you're not going to be able to absorb much from your stomach for as long as you're suffering.</p>
<p>Not sure if this relates to your issue or not, but I know that during and after my migraines for about 24 hours, my stomach growls and churns violently pretty much constantly, and then goes away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. I was diagnosed with migraines several years ago and I only had visual auras while sleeping. I learned to wake myself up, but it was always a sickly purple and white light that flashed like police lights, usually in tandem with sleep paralysis. I never considered them migraine auras at the time, but that makes sense. While awake it was extreme vertigo but no pain. Thankfully I've been migraine free for a few years. </p></div>		</li>

The day after, I will feel literally hungover (I haven’t drank in almost a decade) and any movement like a cough, sneeze, bending causes pain where the migraine occurred. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It took me a really, really long time to be diagnosed with migraines, because my symptoms weren't typical. In fact, the neurologist basically ended up saying it was the only possibility left. You can try a google image search for &quot;migraine aura...&quot;  I remember wondering what that meant, too. Sounds like it's actual light or patterns overlaid on your vision, but varies from person to person.</p>
<p>I had the &quot;elevator drops&quot; with mine. It felt just like dropping a few feet, sometimes also spinning, with the fright/adrenaline response and everything. Then for a few hours I'd be really out of it, like I could get through the day but feel drugged and apart from reality. Super bizarre.</p>
<p>BUT! I was put on Topomax for two years and never had another episode. I'm off of it now and have been dong fine.</p>
<p>Good luck with yours!</p></div>		</li>
