<p>Most of the rings is just dust</p>

<p>So which one is it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes i am sorry, I was inacurate. I misremembered that. However his sources are still outdated. Subcm particles have been found in the A and B and C rings using diffraction. However submm do not appear with a significant amount.<br />

Furthermore some of the other rings are primarily composed of dust. e.g. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14476" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14476</a><br />

Also, all of these values need to be taken with a grain of salt. None of them are in situ measurements, they are all based on models and remote sensing. While these can give good results, we don't have the means currently to validate them directly. Cassini did cross some of the outer, dusty rings though.<br />

But it is correct that the A, B and C rings are mainly composed of medium sized ice clumps and rocks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Saturn's rings are mostly made of car to truck sized rocks made mostly of water ice.</p>
<p>Here's a slide from an older paper than the one O quoted listing the particle sizes of Saturn's rings. The main rings are A, B, and C.</p>

<p>And here's a 3D animation of what the rings look like:</p>
