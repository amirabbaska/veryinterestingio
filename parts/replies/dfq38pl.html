<p>The moon being 1261164698 feet away is 63,058,235 (I rounded) times further away than your TV.</p>
<p>So you will be watching Alf for 0.0000000206 seconds after your TV explodes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just that, but our the nerves from our eyes take time to send the information to our brain and our brain takes time to create the image we see from the really low resolution our eyes create.</p>
<p>The time it takes is enough that we would not be able to catch a ball, if our brain was not constantly predicting what was going to happen a very short amount of time in the future.</p>
<p>IOW, what you see is also your brain's prediction of the future.</p>
<p>This possibly explains deja vu, your brain predicted a familiar situation, which did not actually eventuate so you end up all confused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The time light travels from the object is just a tiny fraction of the delay in our vision for most objects(excluding stars etc.). It takes a lot longer for our eyes and brain to process the information before we &quot;see&quot; something.</p></div>		</li>
