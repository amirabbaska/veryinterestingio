			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting thought. I wonder if the same reasoning could be applied to other animals as well. </p>
<p>If it was true, something like a Gorilla would have the opposite effect, smaller variations in lifting capacity but greater variations in running. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that gorillas we've tried to test the strength of outperformed the tests very casually (like 1 arm lifts with weight we couldn't scare doing) or get pissed and break things. I would love to see this as well, but I'm not sure their natural behaviors lend to human-like workout routines very well. </p>
<p>That said, I've never found a substantial source on things other than them essentially deadlifting 200 lbs doors to grab bananas, so hardly the feat of strength we know they're capable of</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we usually also learn running quite early and practice it a lot. Performing heavy squats requires lots of muscles which take time (and nutrition) to build. Olympic lifts such as the snatch or clean and jerk are also very complex movements which require not only strength but also speed and balance. Which again requires quite some time to train.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the first website I found : <a href="http://www.seeingdoublesleddogracing.com/dog-faqs.html" target="_blank">http://www.seeingdoublesleddogracing.com/dog-faqs.html</a></p>
<p>These dogs can run somewhere between 8-12 mph. While that might be slightly faster than a human over an ultra marathon distance, the website also states they typically cycle equal run equal rest. &quot;Beyond that, it is not uncommon for a team to run 100 miles or more without a substantial break.  The general rule of thumb on long distance races is to maintain an equal run/rest schedule.  So if you've been going on the trail for 4 hours, try to take a 4 hour break at the next checkpoint.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't know what a &quot;substantial break&quot; is but an ultra marathon runner can also go 100+ miles without a substantial break, and with a rest period like that a human runner would easily outpace the dog team over 12 or 24 hours.</p>
<p>Of course, that is a dog team with gear, in the arctic, but I would still put my money on a (physically fit) human for long distance races.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a reference to speed but to endurance. Humans can run longer than every other animal on the planet. No other animals runs for the sheer amount of time that humans run for without stopping. I've heard before there are/were actually tribes who just chase down fast animals until the animal is exhausted and can't run anymore. </p></div>		</li>
