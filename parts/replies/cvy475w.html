<p>or you might have heard of the old english letter thorn (þ) coming to be written like a 'y' (hence 'ye olde shoppe')</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's something that I was shocked to learn: that the &quot;ye&quot; is the word &quot;the&quot; and was <em>not</em> pronounced with a leading &quot;y&quot; sound!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Ye&quot; is also sometimes used to represent an Early Modern English form of the word &quot;the&quot; (traditionally pronounced /ðiː/), such as in &quot;Ye Olde Shoppe&quot;. In this transcription the letter which resembles a 'Y' is actually a thorn (þ), the predecessor to the modern digraph &quot;th&quot;. The word &quot;The&quot; was thus written Þe, never as ye. <strong>Medieval printing presses did not contain the letter thorn, so the letter y was substituted owing to its similarity with some medieval scripts, especially later ones.</strong></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question! I'm not a linguist so I don't want to guess at that answer. I do know that there were many legit uses of the letter &quot;y&quot; -- it wasn't solely substituted for thorn, so I don't want to jump to conclusions. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable will chime in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, thou was another word. What's going on with 'ye' is that modern people have looked at old writing, seen the word 'the' written with what <em>looks</em> like a letter 'y', and copied it for that old-timey feel. In fact, there was already a word 'ye' - it's <em>another</em> declension of the word 'you' (distinct from 'you' and 'thou') and you might recognise it from the phrase 'hear ye!' and suchlike.</p>
<p>What happened is that two distinct letters - y and þ - came to be written the same, so what were originally different words (ye and þe) were the same when written down, causing confusion to later readers.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/English/DiggingDeeper1/Winter2015/about" target="_blank">You should see if the Stanford course, Digging Deeper is still available.</a> It would probably be too low level for you, but it was definitely a really great introduction to the topic.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/medievalspain" target="_blank">There is also a Coursera paleography course that you may find interesting, though I haven't gone through it.</a></p></div>		</li>
