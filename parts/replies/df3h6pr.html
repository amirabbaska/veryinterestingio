			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know if this is the process in all countries, or if it is specifically the US? I know in a lot of countries, personal bankruptcy will mean you'll get by on the absolute minimum for the rest of your life, paying debts with the rest. In your example it sounds like you could have a normal life even after racking up all that debt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Germany, it's limited to 8 years (I think) . Basically that's the punishment for not paying back personal loans, your life will not contain medium to large amounts of money for 8 years. </p>
<p>Business bankruptcy doesn't entail that if you're a limited liability business. And if you're a bank, hedge fund or car manufacturer, bankruptcy just means that the government pays your bonuses for the next couple of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the Netherlands, it's a bit reversed: You're prohibited by law to just hand out credits to anyone without doing background checks. There's very strict rules for mortgages, credit cards, even phone subscriptions which include a lease on the smartphone. Limits are directly based on income, and are very restrictive. If you own a credit card for example, the limit on it is subtracted from your mortgage limit.</p>
<p>For this reason, credit card usage is a bit of a rarity here. We do not have a system where you build up a credit score. When you get into debt problems, you get a &quot;defaulter notation&quot;, which means no one is allowed to loan you any money until you've fully paid off your debt. If you fail to pay off debts, someone usually takes over your finances (voluntary), leaving you with nothing but a small monthly personal allowance. If you are structurally in debt after that, a judge can discharge (parts of) your debt -- but that's up to the judge, not something you can count on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>Despite what people think one of the worst things for your credit is having money you owe and not paying it consistently. </p>
<p>Bankruptcy is an option to forgive debt. There are many loopholes to jump through and you are banned from using it again for a certain number of years (7 years for most). </p>
<p>When you go through bankruptcy it will hurt your credit. Bankruptcy is a court case. If you &quot;win&quot; then you get a discharge. The discharge is the forgiveness of debt as in you owed money before and now through the power of law you don't. </p>
<p>This means that you have freed up debt obligations. Meaning that you ought to have more money, with more money and no debt you are advantageous to lend to. </p>
<p>To make it simple, if you have to to go through bankruptcy than no one will loan to you <em>already</em> because you can't pay back back what you <em>already</em> owe, if you win and get a discharge then some people will give you loans because you don't have anyone else to pay back. So you were spending $700 a month to pay back loans, now that the loans are forgiven you have $700 a month freed up, in a sense. </p>
<p>Going to court in bankruptcy and not getting the discharge is possibly the worst thing you can do to your credit, getting a discharge means that you no longer owe substantial amount of money, thus can pay some new loans. And you no longer are getting hit with non-payments strikes every month thus you can &quot;build&quot; your credit easier. </p>
<p>TL:DR</p>
<p>If you qualify for bankruptcy that means you have not been paying loans and are unable to pay them. Filing for bankruptcy hits your credit, getting a discharge, &quot;win&quot; the court case, in the vast majority of times will improve your credit because credit, in theory, is a measure of what you earn compared to what you owe, when you owe less through a bankruptcy discharge than you are more credit worthy because the earning vs. debt ratio has changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a credit underwriter, I can tell you that seeing debt on a credit bureau that was discharged through bankruptcy was an immediate red flag and 99/100 times the applicant was turned down.</p>
<p>To go back to the ELI5 response, lets say there was 4th sibling.  After seeing how the brother and sister didn't get their money back, why would they trust giving out their allowance? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: I'm a real estate agent and ran a background check for a couple wanting a lease home a few weeks ago. They had declared chapter 7 in 2015. One of their credit scores was 729. How is that possible? I thought declaring bankruptcy killed your credit. The owner let them lease no problem. </p></div>		</li>
