			<div class="markdown"><p>I am more of a human brain kind of girl, but my suspicion is that there are too many different variables at play to make sweeping generalizations. I know there has been some research rebuking the idea that certain behaviors are learned and suggests instead that some animal behaviour changes previously attributed to learning are actually more spontaneous, simply the result of hitting a development milestone. On the other hand, there is also cool research on things like [grizzly habitat preferences] (<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0053721" target="_blank">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0053721</a>), which suggests the ideal habitat choice for raising young is perhaps partially learned from the mothers (father grizzlies do not rear young). </p>
<p>So to give a thoroughly unsatisfying answer: it may be more true in some groups and less true in other groups.</p>
<p>I would also hypothesize that since learning capacity varies, what one animal can learn would of course come down to capacity and their brain. But who knows. In ten or twenty years, what we know about other species might be totally different! We used to think reptiles were dumb as rocks, but it turns out they aren't quite the neurological slackers once thought even though their brains are primitive. We used to think fish were nothing more than swimming poop-machines, but they are actually rather smart and have good memory and exhibit signs we might call depression when they lose a friend. (And they can remember and recognize human faces, so don't piss off your fish). We don't fully understand our own brain. But that's what's neat--what we know changes all the time.</p></div>		</li>

So you're telling me that when Bruce from Finding Nemo says &quot;fish are friends, not food&quot;, its an embellishment from the writers and not true to facts? </p></div>		</li>
