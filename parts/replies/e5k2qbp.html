			<div class="markdown"><p>And I assume caffeine tolerance is related to how used to it your receptors are? What makes it so I can drink 4 coffees and go to bed while my girlfriend drinks one and stays up for a week?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few mechanisms for this. Most relevant are that your body can acclimate to long-term caffeine use by expressing more receptors, so that it takes more caffeine to block them all up. </p>
<p>But there's also genetic differences in how quickly people metabolize (break down) caffeine, so slow metabolizers will have caffeine linger in their system much longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really &quot;how used to it your receptors are.&quot; You can think of it like this. When your body is in a normal state, it expects there to be some baseline reaction to a particular amount of adenosine. As you drink caffeine, the adenosine receptors become bound to the caffeine, not letting the adenosine in. </p>
<p>Your body no longer has the reaction it expects from that amount of adenosine. Rather than just making more adenosine, which wouldn't do anything, it actually causes your neurons to produce more receptor sites. That way, if you consume the same amount of caffeine, the same total number of adenosine receptors are being antagonized (blocked,) but then the new receptors can be agonized (activated) by the adenosine. </p>
<p>Therefor, you up your dose of caffeine to get the results you're expecting, antagonizing all of the receptors again. So, you and your body have a back and forth, upping the number of receptors and the dose of caffeine, until there isn't any more room on the neurons to produce additional receptors. </p>
<p>Simultaneously to all of this, your neurons are down-regulating - that is to say decreasing the total number of - norepenephrine receptors. Norepenephrine is a natural stimulant that our bodies produce regularly. </p>
<p>So you, drinking coffee all the time, have a whole lot of adenosine receptors and few norepenephrine receptors. Your girlfriend, rarely consuming coffee, has comparatively fewer adenosine receptors and more norepenephrine receptors. When she drinks coffee, every last one of her adenosine receptors gets blocked, which means that her norepenephrine receptors get bombarded longer and harder than yours do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body doesn't like to do too much of something.  If it's getting more signals from something than it is supposed to, it turns the volume on the speakers down, so to speak. The amount of signal reaching the speakers is the same, but how much is allowed to be processed into sound is less.  </p>
<p>Receptors are brought from the surface of the cell back into the body of the cell as if you brought your arm into the main body of your shirt from the sleeve.  You can't shake anyone's hand if your arm isn't exposed.  Or, rather, you can only shake hands with one hand rather than shake two different people's hands at once.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is what made me finally give it up entirely. I set my own hours, so instead of caffeine i just take naps.</p></div>		</li>
