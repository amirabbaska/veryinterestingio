			<div class="markdown"><p>They are producing a little less power each year due to two reasons. I'll break down what /u/Phage0070 said to explain.</p>
<p>The first reason is directly tied to how the generators work in the first place. They are powered by Plutonium-238. Plutonium-238 slowly decays into Uranium-234, through alpha decay. In simplistic terms, this means the nucleus spits out a helium atom to make itself smaller and more stable. Each nucleus that decays produces a little heat, but each nucleus that decays also means there's a little less Plutonium. Pu-238 has a half-life of 87.7 years, meaning half the Plutonium will be gone in that time, and generators would also be down to half power in that time.</p>
<p>The second reason the power is going down is because of how the heat is turned into electricity. The generators use parts called &quot;thermocouples&quot; to do this. Thermocouples are made from 2 metals touching each other. When you choose the right metals, heat applied to the metals will create electricity between them. The thermocouples in the Voyager probes have been slowly breaking down over time, so they aren't converting heat to electricity as well as they used to.</p>
<p>So, 2 factors: less and less heat over time, and less and less efficiency at converting the heat to electricity. When they launched in 1977, the Voyager generators produced 470 Watts. By 2001 they were down to about 315 Watts, and as of January 2015 they were down to about 255 Watts. I think it's pretty amazing, actually, that a sealed generator created 40 years ago would still be cranking out that much usable power, even if it's down to only half of where it started.</p>
<p>As /u/Ninjapig151 points out, they have turned off most systems, but that doesn't exactly &quot;save&quot; power: the generators make what they make no matter whether it's used or not. The engineers just have to decide how to use the power that's available. Currently they have an operating margin of about 23 Watts. When the power gets below about 232 Watts, maybe around 2025, there won't be enough Watts to run even what's left, and they will end the missions. But, the generators will still keep generating electricity, unused, just producing less and less over the centuries.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if they end the mission in 2025 there would still be power, just not enough to run any systems? So would that mean we would lose a signal? </p></div>		</li>

<p>these seem really convenient.  why can't i just put a bunch of these in my basement and power my house forever?  </p></div>		</li>
