<p>Insurance companies give you the illusion of choice. You can't really change since it is via employer, the plans are only marginally different, you are limited in who you can see by your network, and getting new family members on is up to them.</p>
<p>I would rather be given no choice compared to crap we have now where my only choice is the size of my copay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh, no. Insurance companies aren't going to authorize a hugely expenaive treatment for one person on a 50 life group. They don't make enough money on a group that side. </p>
<p>There is a good chance that the guy who owns a 50 life company has seen his highest expense after payroll increase at 10% a year for the past decade. Sometimes 40%. </p>
<p>I am an insurance broker. This guy you think is in it for his own selfish motives? I've made him cry, literally cry when I gave him his renewal. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Let's say you're a senior partner in a 50-person law firm. Your firm offers excellent health benefits. More importantly, you personally have decision authority over those benefits. </p>

<p>I have sole decision authority over the benefits for my 55-person firm, and I have no idea what you're getting at with this example.  Is it that my pride in having my calls returned may be threatened, so as a result I would be opposed to single payer insurance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what they're getting at is, in example 1 you can say &quot;we want ____ or else myself and the other 55 customers are leaving&quot;</p>
<p>where example 2 leaves you with &quot;well I'm leaving!&quot;, which is a lot less money to the company than if 55 people were saying it. </p>
<p>Though, /u/ViskerRatio, if I'm wrong let me know and I'll remove my nonsense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's that you have considerably more clout in your personal negotiations with the insurance company than the average citizen.</p>
<p>As the average consumer, your 'negotiations' with your insurance company are largely just a matter of them telling you what they'll pay for and you dealing with it.  The friendly voice on the other end of the phone could care less if you're happy with their service - their job is minimize outlays and follow the rules by the book.</p>
<p>In contrast, small businesses have account service representatives who get paid - in part - on their ability to recruit and maintain relationships with those small business accounts.  While you're still not able to call up the CEO of a multi-billion dollar insurance company and demand they dance to your tune, having that representative within the company who is automatically on your side is a big deal.  It means that when you ask what the best possible outcome is, you get someone who actually tries their best to find that for you.</p>
<p>You might not have encountered this situation.  Maybe you haven't been put in that position.  But if you <em>are</em> put in the position where someone close to you becomes seriously ill and you need to run up huge bills to keep them alive, you chance of getting a positive result from your insurance company is significantly better because you've got that inside track.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's some bullshit.  If one of my kids got seriously sick today, there's no hotline I could call at Cigna and demand some special treatment.  I'm on the same plan as my employees, and I can assure that a company of 55 people is a drop in the bucket to any major carrier.  There's shockingly little negotiating to be done.  We can shop around, but there are compromises everywhere, and I have no access to anything my employees don't have access too.</p></div>		</li>
