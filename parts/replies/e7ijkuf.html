<p>Remember our brains are designed to be able to tell people apart by minute differences as is required in a social species. Can you tell two chimps apart? They are 98% the same as humans. They can tell each other apart but you are not designed to.</p>

<p>I don't know how to ask this without sounding racist, and I'm just curious, but does this extend to different races within humans as well?</p>
<p>Like, I can't tell apart people from different races as well, but after spending a certain amount of time with them it appears so clear how they are different physically.</p>
<p>But at first glance, show me 5 asian people for example, and there's no way I can tell them apart if not looking at height.</p>
<p>I mean no offence by this, it's just that I was wondering if there is truth to the sterotype.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. This depends a lot on where you grow up.</p>
<p>Your brain is designed to be as efficient as possible. If you are surrounded by non-Asian people and come across an Asian guy your brain saves the information about him as &quot;that Asian guy&quot; and that's it. No need to save any more information about his features as they are so distinct. And then your brain does the same thing until you meet and/or interact with enough people that look Asian and it matters that you remember them individually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, we have what I can only explain as different levels of memory. From what is &quot;familiar&quot; to what is &quot;strange&quot;. It is the same reason we don't commit to memory say leaves blowing across the road on a random day but we remember a rocket launch. Our brain &quot;categorizes&quot; things as important or unimportant. This means that when you meet someone in passing regardless of race you won't remember them, naturally. If you meet someone of Asian descent and then meet them again, and again, their face becomes imprinted so to speak. That person has registered in your important memory bank. Think of it like photography where the focus is on the foreground and the background seems blurry, when the background approaches the focal point they seem to almost appear out of the unfocused distance. At the same time, neurology is still a lot of guess work. This is what we understand of it, and not necessarily the way things work. It is one of the final frontiers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not racist thats a solid question. Racism involves some form of hate related to it. People are different and it's normal for people to be different, so it's ok to ask as well.</p>
<p>Your brain can only work with the information its given. If you are around people of the same race you will get good at identifying them. </p>
<p>It will be harder to identify people of different races but it can be learned just by spending more time with them. For instance you understand that peoples noses come in 5 different types (this is just one feature to illustrate the topic). You can easily categorize the people you are around based on this key feature. Bob has a type 1 nose, Jim a type 2, Sally a type 3, etc. Now you interact with someone of a different race their nose does not fit your list of known noses so they are all kind of lumped into the category of other. The reality is they have 5 different kinds of noses as well and they lump yours into the category of other. When you spend enough time with other races you start to grow your list of known noses eventually you will have 10 to choose from. Think of it as your brain makes a list. With training your list will grow from 5 and an other to 10 and an other. </p>
<p>The way you perceive the world has little to do with how the world actually is. The human brain has huge amounts of processing power but it still needs to take shortcuts and it will take them anyway it can.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this stands alone for a group of people with similarities. I'm around a lot of white people, but if you give me a list of famous people named Chris that are also white, they look largely the same. And a lot of people report the same.</p>
<p>The one that I can point out is Chris Pratt, only for Parks and Rec. I can recognize him very well, but everyone else looks identical, but you can see how he'd be added because of his features.</p>
<p>This might be just me, but when I meet new people, and there's more than one with a similar attribute (mostly hair and height), memories will purposefully merge them and I won't know which one is which, despite them having drastically different facial features. It only takes me getting to know them to differentiate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not quite what it is. Down Syndrome is trisomy 21, meaning instead of having 2 copies of chromosome 21, they have three copies. There's not a whole extra pair.</p></div>		</li>
