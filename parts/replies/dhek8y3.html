			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's a great way of catching criminals. What more proof can there be than someone caught red-handed in the act?</p>
<p>Even if they push it a bit by &quot;baiting&quot; or &quot;trapping&quot; with a more flashy set of wheels - The criminal is still committing a <em>crime</em> or <em>felony</em>.</p>
<p>In my opinion the more of these thieves are caught the better. Who wants to have to go through the pain-staking process of talking to their insurance and waiting 14 days for the police to either find it or not just to then go to the next stage of waiting for paperwork and all the other bullshit. Just for the sake of some little <em>twazzock</em> going for a joyride or making a few extra bucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Especially considering the low rate of car recovery. They may find the vehicle once ditched, but catching a thief redhanded in a private citizen's vehicle basically means the thief has to get pulled over in a traffic violation.</p>
<p>That's why thieves still certain makes. Steal a Honda civic: how are the police supposed to find it? Pull over every civic that looks like the same year and color?</p>
<p>Better to unambiguously catch them redhanded, with video and audio of the whole theft. It's clean. It has a high success rate. And it's funny.</p></div>		</li>
