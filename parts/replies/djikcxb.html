			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I might have some relevant knowledge for you!</p>
<p>When food is absorbed through the intestine and into the blood, 90% of that nutritious blood is immediately directed to the liver. The liver has many functions, one of which is to change toxins in our blood into a chemical that can be excreted more easily. This is called first-pass metabolism, and is often a two step process that occurs in the liver. The family of enzymes responsible for this transformation are called cytochrome P450 enzymes, and their roles are super interesting! at least, I think so. Once these chemicals are metabolized in the liver, they become water-soluble. This means that they'll be carried off by the blood effectively, from which the kidneys can start to remove them from the blood and concentrate them into the urine.</p>
<p>The fact that blood goes directly to the liver after being absorbed from the intestines helps to explain why the smell is present in the urine so quickly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/12/14/505420193/we-unravel-the-science-mysteries-of-asparagus-pee" target="_blank">not everyone can smell asparagus pee--it's a genetic trait.</a> There is a genetic variation in smell detectors and only about 40% of people smell it. </p>
<p>EDIT: Together our articles provide more information on asparagus pee than a human should know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even more interestingly, not everyone <em>produces</em> asparagus pee.</p>
<p>So there are people that are not excreters, and not smellers, people who are excreters and not smellers, people who are not excreters and smellers and finally people  exreters and are smellers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, everyone does produce asparagus pee. The studies finding people who didn't relied on self-report, so there were non-smellers reporting that their smelly pee didn't smell.  It wasn't until an Israeli research team thought to have non-self smellers that this was discovered. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As somebody who used to work in a pub which had an asparagus themed menu for 2 months out of the year (everything had asparagus in it, there was an asparagus spirit, and even asparagus flavoured ice cream), my god the bathrooms smelt. Interestingly (or not), the male and female bathrooms both smelt different but still noticeably asparagus based</p></div>		</li>
