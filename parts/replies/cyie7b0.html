			<div class="markdown"><p>That explains it really well. Growing up, I'd always imagined Chinese to be, reserved (for lack of a better term) and that they simply preferred less children. Didn't realize bearing children was actually encouraged back then. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Polygamy was not very much a thing in 1950s. If you were rich and could afford it, you can take on concubines. You only really ever had one wife, but you can have multiple concubines. The Communists actually greatly improved the rights of women in China, and they banned the practice of having concubines.</p>
<p>Polygamy =! concubinage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>China used to be very rural; having a lot of children would provide them with a lot of support to manage the farm. There's old Chinese saying that having more children means having more good fortune.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Children also act as &quot;pension&quot;/financial support upon the parent retiring/being to weak to work (eg. till the field or deliver goods). The more boys the better in this sense because they stay in the family as opposed to &quot;joining her husband and her inlaws.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>From the 1950s onward, Asian countries that legalized and then promoted abortion did so with vocal, deep-pocketed American support. Digging into the archives of groups like the Rockefeller Foundation and the International Planned Parenthood Federation, Hvistendahl depicts an unlikely alliance between Republican cold warriors worried that population growth would fuel the spread of Communism and left-wing scientists and activists who believed that abortion was necessary for both “the needs of women” and “the future prosperity — or maybe survival — of mankind,” as the Planned Parenthood federation’s medical director put it in 1976.</p>
<p>For many of these antipopulation campaigners, sex selection was a feature rather than a bug, since a society with fewer girls was guaranteed to reproduce itself at lower rates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>National Security Study Memorandum 200: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests (NSSM200) was completed on December 10, 1974 by the United States National Security Council under the direction of Henry Kissinger.</p>
<p>The basic thesis of the memorandum was that population growth in the least developed countries (LDCs) is a concern to U.S. national security, because it would tend to risk civil unrest and political instability in countries that had a high potential for economic development. The policy gives &quot;paramount importance&quot; to population control measures and the promotion of contraception among 13 populous countries. This is to control rapid population growth which the US deems inimical to the socio-political and economic growth of these countries and to the national interests of the United States, since the &quot;U.S. economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad&quot;, and these countries can produce destabilizing opposition forces against the United States.</p>
<p>The report advocates the promotion of education and contraception and other population control measures, stating for instance that &quot;No country has reduced its population growth without resorting to abortion&quot;.</p>
<p>It also raises the question of whether the U.S. should consider preferential allocation of surplus food supplies to states that are deemed constructive in use of population control measures.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad, especially from less developed countries [see National Commission on Materials Policy, Towards a National Materials Policy: Basic Data and Issues, April 1972]. </p>
<p>That fact gives the U.S. enhanced interest in the political, economic, and social stability of the supplying countries. Wherever a lessening of population pressures through reduced birth rates can increase the prospects for such stability, population policy becomes relevant to resource supplies and to the economic interests of the United States. … The location of known reserves of higher grade ores of most minerals favors increasing dependence of all industrialized regions on imports from less developed countries. The real problems of mineral supplies lie, not in basic physical sufficiency, but in the politico-economic issues of access, terms for exploration and exploitation, and division of the benefits among producers, consumers, and host country governments&quot; [Chapter III, &quot;Minerals and Fuel&quot;]. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also important to consider that the views on abortion back then weren't the same as they are now with certain political factions. Up until the late 1970s, conservative religious factions like the [Southern Baptists] (<a href="http://billmoyers.com/2014/07/17/when-southern-baptists-were-pro-choice/" target="_blank">http://billmoyers.com/2014/07/17/when-southern-baptists-were-pro-choice/</a>) were in favor of abortion and keeping it legal as a means of effective family planning. For other ideological reasons, they shifted their position and now abortion is the contentious topic it is today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tactic of human waves makes for interesting reading, but let's get real here. Large families have been the pride and joy of Chinese traditional culture for hundreds if not thousands of years. One of the primary responsibilities of a man (and his wife) was to produce sons and carry the family line forward. For example, China's population more or less doubled during the Qing Dynasty even though it could not feed, govern, etc. so many people. The tradition carried forward under Mao into modern times until the One Child Policy. I'm sure Mao encouraged big families for his own ambitions for the country, but it was already deeply ingrained in the culture. </p></div>		</li>
