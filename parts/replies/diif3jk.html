<p>Now you can have twenty people to a line and there's no new cashiers to be found.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When i worked there they had a rule that anymore than 3 people in a line required a new line to be opened.  They never followed it because people will bitch to each other but never to corporate.  If they started getting enough complaints it would be taken care of.   The problem then is the way it would be taken care of is pulling associates from other departments so now those areas would be understaffed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I patronized K-Mart until the very end. There were 2 Kmart's in my town until the first Walmart opened up. In less than a year, the first Kmart closed. The other Kmart struggled for the next 3 years before calling it quits. It was really sad to see Walmarts parking lot full and never more than 10 cars in the K-Mart parking lot. I grew up going to Kmart and miss it.</p></div>		</li>
