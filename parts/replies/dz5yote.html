<p>It's good that he survived, and it's unusual for a piece to pop out in a situation when you're being lowered like that, but if you know you're going to be bailing you better leave a bomber anchor. Gear can be replaced, your life can't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True there's always a risk. I should have qualified as 'very dangerous'. The cause was the rock itself, it was too brittle and broke. He was a very experienced climber and I was a relative beginner, and I assumed he was taking the right approach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ouch, that's rough, I've climbed rock like that and nearly killed my belayer, it's a new sport crag in NY that can't take trad gear. I was top roping a route and my left foot slipped off a little corner hold on a roof that was about the size of a quarter, and when I went to go put my foot back I noticed the hold was missing, then that's when I heard the crash and noticed a 2x4' section of rock that landed a few feet away from my belayer as well as two other climbers that were part of a different group. I never felt so awful in my life, normally if rock slips you shout &quot;ROCK ROCK ROCK&quot; but I wasn't even aware that anything broke off until it hit the ground.</p></div>		</li>
