			<div class="markdown"><p>This also helps to control how the glass breaks under impact and makes it more predictable.  Essentially it creates localized stress points that fracture in a relatively predictable pattern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL! I bought a new pair of sunglasses which are polarized, my old ones weren't. I started asking my wife if she could see the grid pattern and she couldn't with her sun glasses. It was a trip the first time I saw them.</p>
<p>Now I'm wondering if my screen on my phone is polarized too because if I'm using my phone outside and I tilt it to landscape, the screen becomes significantly darker with sort of a moire pattern overlayed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your phone has an LCD screen then it is polarized. The crystals in the liquid crystal display adjust the polarization of the light when they are powered on or off, causing it to either be blocked by or pass through the polarizing filter on the front.</p>

<p>If you remove the top layer of polarizing film all you see is white light. You can even make a monitor you can only see with polarized glasses this way: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL_HAmWQTgA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL_HAmWQTgA</a>\</p>
<p>Edit: Apparently even <a href="https://technology.ihs.com/509943/why-all-amoled-is-applying-polarizer-suppliers-of-amoled-polarizer-and-compensation-film-for-polarizer-technology-trend-of-amoled-use-polarizer" target="_blank">OLED screens have polarizers</a> on them but just to help with reflection. OLEDs function differently than LCD screens and don't need a polarizer to actually produce an image. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think most phone screens are tempered glass, so if the way tempered glass is created is what causes the patterns, it makes sense you'd see it on them too.</p></div>		</li>
