			<div class="markdown"><p>It all depends on the materials you use.</p>
<p>Low-e coatings are reflective mostly in the IR because we like cool buildings with lots of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it works both ways. By reflecting ir they help eliminate heat transfer through thermal radiance. So reflection prevents heat from coming in when the inside is cooler, and helps reflect the heat back in when the inside is warmer. We like to maintain a thermal gradient whether it be cooling in the summer or heat in the winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The coatings are applied to the interior side of an &quot;insulated glass unit.&quot; Most people call them double-panes Windows. Like I said the coating is on the interior so you...or anything else for that matter, can't touch it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone that has put together windows with low e glass, you would be surprised at how opaque it really is. Low e can be VERY dark next to clear glass, but when it is installed in your house, the amount of ambient light outside is enough that you don't notice.</p></div>		</li>
