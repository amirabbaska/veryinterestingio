I did my Masters in Science, media and  communication, and from my research universities and scientists themselves have to bear some responsibility as well as the media. A lot of press releases talk up the science to the point they almost misrepresent the findings.</p>
<p>A lot of papers aren't really publishable quality, especially in the psychological and bio sciences, but postdocs feel the need to publish. Many papers I saw were what I would regard as a preliminary study which could serve as a prior to a full investigation. These prelim studies which contain many caveats still get published with press releases and that's some of the reason they get picked up by the media and we get what seems like conflicting science.</p></div>		</li>
