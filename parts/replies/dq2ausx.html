<p>Conclusion: whether or not the volume is infinite or whether it is actually well defined is really a matter of definition. I believe that if you must assign the word &quot;volume&quot; to something, then yes, it is infinite. But the situation is much more subtle than the rubber sheet would have you believe, as is always the case.</p>

<p>Why should we just arbitrarily say the volume is infinite? In Gullstrand-Painleve coordinates (those of an infalling observer), for instance, the volume inside the event horizon at a particular instant in time is just what you would expect: V = 4Ï€R^(3)/3 with R = 2GM/c^(2). The truth is that the volume is not coordinate-invariant; it can even be infinite or not defined for certain observers. So we just leave the volume undefined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's a good point. In my defense, I did say that there is no unique notion of volume; I missed the fact that there are slices with finite volume.</p></div>		</li>
