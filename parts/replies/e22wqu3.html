			<div class="markdown"><p>If I may piggy-back on your comment, sadistic types of emotionally abusive people <em>tend to</em> have personality traits that make the relationship complex. Some know instinctively how to manipulate vulnerable people, to the point of destroying the victim’s support system; preying upon the pre-existing low self-esteem the victim; and crushing the very spirit of a person. It’s an insidious kind of abuse, the victim being under so much stress that he/she can’t think straight or perceive any reality beyond the relationship. It causes great mental and emotional confusion for the victim, in part because there are times when the abuser is a different person, being affectionate and attentive. Then, BAM. The switch is flipped, and all of a sudden the monster is back.</p>
<p>This kind of behavior is sometimes used in an official capacity as a manipulation and/or torture method. A mild implementation is Good Cop/Bad Cop. But it’s also used to break down prisoners to get them to talk. (I always imagine a sadistic nazi fucking with someone just for the sake of pleasure.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly.  Stockholm syndrome is believed to be an evolved response to surviving while being held captive.  The ability to side with and forgive ones captors greatly increases chances for future offspring production/survival.  OP's question doesn't necessarily have anything to do with survival so much as it is just the general lack of self esteem and increased anxiety that follows an abusive relationship.</p></div>		</li>
