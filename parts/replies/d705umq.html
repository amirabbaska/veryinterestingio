			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this also why joints are sore to bend if they have been in the same position for a long time? </p>
<p>(For instance, if you sit with your legs up and your toes pointing away from you for quite a while and then you get up, when you bend your ankles to place your feet flat, the joints feel stiff and hurt to move into new angles.)</p>
<p>Or is there a different mechanism for joints?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup same principles apply. It is well known that joints and other connective tissues demonstrate <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6671383" target="_blank">viscoelastic</a> properties. Along with the muscles that surround the joint you also stretch the passive structures such as the ligaments and joint capsule in the area. </p>
<p>Using your example a physical therapist may use this position on patients after a total knee replacement to help regain knee extension.   It works on stretching out the tissue, regaining range of motion, and breaking up scar tissue. </p>
