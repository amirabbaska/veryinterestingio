			<div class="markdown"><p>Scifi question: Can this process be done with more than two telescopes? And is there a limit to its effectiveness? For example, could a sufficiently advanced society 47~ light years away (with an adequate number of telescopes spread out over the requisite distance) observe Armstrong on the moon <em>today</em>? </p>
<p>And if so, is it conceivable that NASA might one day in the distant future send out a vast network of telescopes into deep space in order to get high-resolution photos of (for instance) distant exoplanets suspected of harboring life?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few telescopes far away can give you a good resolution (if you manage to combine their light properly), but they don't give you much light. Armstrong was not bright enough (pun not intended) to be seen by a large interferometer consisting of just a few spread out telescopes, the aliens would need a gigantic dish to collect enough light. Something like 100 million kilometers diameter - if they are at the nearest star! Such a gigantic telescope would be easy to spot by our telescopes, and interestingly this statement is independent of the distance of the alien telescope. If aliens build anything remotely similar to our telescopes in other star systems, then they don't have the capability to watch Armstrong.</p>
<p>Getting some maps of exoplanets that way can be possible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To day 2 telescopes can replicate a single monolithic telescope is not quite true, and there are other non resolution related problems as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you are right, this is a possiblity. I don't know too much about it, I haven't quite gotten there yet. But this technology is only in its first steps so far. We haven't really properly exploited its advantages yet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's theoretically possible, but given the choice: a telescope that sees things really far or one that sees things really close in great detail, why would you chose the latter? </p>
<p>Edit: ideally you get both, but there's a budget.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An ultra-high aperture interferometric telescope can see things just as far away as a regular telescope. &quot;Zoom&quot; is determined by a telescope's focal length and doesn't really matter here.</p></div>		</li>
