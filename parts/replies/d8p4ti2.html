			<div class="markdown"><p>What we consider 3 dimensional space is actually 4.  Up/down, left/right, front/behind, and then forward/backwards in time.  </p>
<p>This can be expressed as a formula:  xyz and lets say t for time.  </p>
<p>In algebra it is really easy to solve for a variable if you know all the other ones.  So if you know XYZ you can solve for T.</p>
<p>This is what every clock on the planet does.  Swing of a pendulum, spring and gears in a watch, electricity through a quartz crystal causing it to vibrate.  These are all a measure of movement through space relative to time.  However, they are all mechanical and are subject to outside forces such as gravity or heat.</p>
<p>What these time crystals allow us to do is measure time with no outside interference and without needing to know XYZ.  And it can be used to complete a circuit automatically without waiting for the pendulum to complete it's inaccurate swing.</p>
<p>Why is this important?</p>
<p>Just about everything important your computer does is restricted by time.  It switches tasks millions of times per second giving it the appearance of doing multiple things at once but is actually just doing one thing at a time really fucking fast.  The computer has a special component to track the time separately.  Each time the computer switches tasks it checks what time it is and performs actions accordingly.  So a million times per second the computer wastes energy and time manually saying &quot;What time is it?  Should I do anything?&quot;</p>
<p>What this allows us to do is have a millions and millions of clocks in a computer instead of just one.  Each one of these clocks can trigger something different.  They will be almost 100% accurate.  And they will be external to the processor - it can do it's own thing and be told when to do things rather than ask.  This will save these millions of operations for other things, increasing performance.</p>
<p>This is just an ELI5 version.  There are more applications than just freeing up some CPU cycles.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Computers need to know time, but they need energy for that. These things keep time, but require very little energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming it's some kind of subatomic little structure made of atoms or electrons or something that scientists make by using lasers and temperature and freaky shit.</p>
<p>It's so small that quantum bullshit happens and it flips over by itself regularly for no reason, so it makes for a good time-keeper for computer things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. This explains it for me.</p>
<p>But it's no more than a clock source, right? Will a time crystal run much faster than a regular oscillator?</p></div>		</li>
