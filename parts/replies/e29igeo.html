			<div class="markdown"><p>Check the response from u/themeaningofhaste. In layman terms, an astronomical event (such as a supernova or a black hole merger) has different emissions, like electromagnetic radiation (light, ultraviolet, xray, gamma, etc), particle emission (protons, neutrons, neutrinos, etc) and gravitational waves. Multi-Messenger Astronomy is basically trying to combine all these emissions to study the event in a more complete manner.</p>
<p>Basically, we receive different 'messages' from an event, and we compare them to check if our Physics models are correct. Astronomy as evolved to the point that we don't just study the light that reaches us, but a lot more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea as the name suggests is to use more than one &quot;messenger&quot; to observe things in the Universe. So for example, LIGO has done a lot with gravitational waves and there was recently a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817" target="_blank">binary neutron star merger</a> that was also observed in different wavelengths of electromagnetic waves, from radio to optical to gamma ray. Using both methods gives you a big picture into what's going on, since the gravitational waves directly probe the dynamics and masses of the sources (the gravity) and the electromagnetic waves show what's emitting (the light). In the case above, they connected neutrinos (well, one, but obviously that means there were many emitted) with gamma rays from a supermassive black hole jet billions of lightyears away. Because neutrinos don't interact well with &quot;normal&quot; matter, it means that we're probing a different emission component than with the other forms of light, which come farther up the jet. Take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus" target="_blank">Active Galactic Nuclei</a> for more on that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Congratulations! Do you have any idea what you’ll be doing? In layman terms, that is. </p>
<p>(I always sucked at Physics, but I always wish I had the brains to understand it, so I’m sort of jelaous. But mainly happy for you.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still a second year undergraduate student, so my knowledge of Particle Physics / Astrophysics is still very limited. My group works with the data received from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Auger_Observatory" target="_blank">Pierre Auger Observatory</a>, so we're talking about cosmic rays. </p>
<p>Multi-Messenger Astronomy is basically trying to compare the different emissions of a specific event (a supernova, for example, will emit light, particles and maybe gravitational waves). My ideia is basically to write some piece of software that checks if our observatory was alligned with an event when, somewhere in the world, that event is detected.</p>
<p>Maybe it's better to give an example:</p>
<ol>
<li>A telescope detects light (or other electromagnetic radiation) from a supernova;</li>
<li>A signal is sent from that telescope to many observatories in the world saying that they saw that supernova;</li>
<li>My software will basically try to calculate if the Pierre Auger Observatory was alligned with that event;</li>
<li>If it was, the researchers at this institution I'm working at will check the data to see if they found something (high energy cosmic radiation).</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are you expecting to be looking for? It's incredibly unlikely that Auger will detect a cosmic Ray event that's coincident with transient events from other observatories, since magnetic deflections add an unknown amount of delay to the arrival time (but usually measured in at least thousands of years), so they almost certainly will not arrive in coincidence with other messenger particles - not to mention the deflections inherently affect the arrival directions.</p>
<p>There is potential with Auger to see an uncharged coincident messenger, but there you're looking for a neutron (needs to be a close source) or gamma Ray (which are not trivial to distinguish from the CR flux with Auger).</p>
<p>Also be aware that the calculation you mentioned can be done in, literally, a few lines of python code!</p></div>		</li>
