			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely with kids and babies. Babies will “drown” in their own secretions not being able to cough it up themselves and they aren’t able to coordinate breathing and eating while sick so they tend to come in very dehydrated and needing fluid blouses. Same with kids, they don’t feel good so they stop eating and get dehydrated, when they finally do come to the hospital they need extra fluid to get them back on track.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If your baby has a head cold, how do you keep them from choking in their sleep?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn TIL if I get sick enough I will not only teleport to a place with proper medical care, I will <em>already be there</em> by the time I reach that level. Technology is amazing</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’m so interested! What’ll happen if they invest liquids? What mechanism causes that? That’s so cool </p></div>		</li>
