			<div class="markdown"><p>First off, thanks for that. I actually learned something today. </p>
<p>But 2nd, I'll ask you this, since you seem to know what you're talking about... </p>
<p>If they are developing a game to run on hardware from the future, how do they do beta testing? Do they just have monster computers hooked together? Do they turn just turn the graphics down? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A console is just a very tuned pc. Most console games are written on special pc's, designed to mimic the specs of a particular console.</p>
<p>Also, game dev companies get early versions if new consoles to build their games on. Wouldn't it be stupid if Playstation didn't let anyone have a beta ps4 to build games on, what would they do on release day when they have basically no games to sell?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To further your point, consoles developers have access to special &quot;dev console&quot; that have high-end hardware much more powerful than what the real console will be. This also allows them to run and test their game properly even if the assets / engine aren't optimized yet for final release.</p>
<p>I don't know how much that's still true, but I know for a fact it was a true a couple of years ago when I was working for a QA company, we had many &quot;debug&quot; consoles which had better hardware than standard ones, but less powerful than the &quot;dev&quot; ones. A debug console would cost us something like 3-5k to purchase. One time they sent us by mistake a &quot;dev&quot; Xbox360 console, which I was told was worth around 20k at the time.</p>
<p>I might be wrong on those numbers though, but that's what my bosses were telling me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And its worth noting that, at least with the Xbox One, every console in the world can become a dev console with a software patch which is provided through a microsoft developer program. This is different than most older consoles which required a separate piece of hardware (you can google &quot;xbox 360 dev console&quot; or really any console to see what they looked like).</p>
<p>The new generation of consoles are closer to being PCs than any generation before them, although their unified memory model is a bit different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Foresight.</p>
<p>Every feature of any software/hardware technology has a development branch commonly available but not yet released, and most have an alpha branch, available (on different terms) to users (game development industry in this case). And the time between releases is vastly greater then, lets say, some app from appstore or googleplay.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, here is the Microsoft post from a year ago, about the DirectX 12 <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/directx/archive/2014/03/20/directx-12.aspx" target="_blank">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/directx/archive/2014/03/20/directx-12.aspx</a>
It is still in development. Exactly this gives time to adjust and plan the engine of a game to be on par with the technological progress.</p>
<p>Another example: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2015/03/31/visual-studio-2015-and-graphics-tools-for-windows-10.aspx" target="_blank">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2015/03/31/visual-studio-2015-and-graphics-tools-for-windows-10.aspx</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is hardware out today that's far more powerful than anything the average consumer will see in their laptops for at least the next 10 years, but it's way more expensive. Game development studios can shell out more for their rig if they want to &quot;develop in the future&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My buddy built a pc four years ago and sprung for the &quot;future proof&quot; hardware. It was ahead of the curve by miles for like two years, and is still really impressive. It inspired me to build my own, although I won't be able to spend half what my friend did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing that &quot;advances&quot; is generally the engine's capabilities. The only thing I can think of that you'd need to redo manually are the models and textures. Models and textures are almost always made at very high resolutions and then cut down, sometimes automatically by a program. So it really isn't hard at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason for that is the voice actor's guild. There is a large minimum payment for a voice actor's services, so it doesn't make much economic sense to bring in a guy to give you a couple of lines. It also encourages voice actors who do a bunch of voices, which was entirely the point: to keep out cheap wannabe actors from lowering the cost of voice acting to the point that established voice actors couldn't maintain their lifestyle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are about <a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Voice_Cast_%28Skyrim%29" target="_blank">70 voice actors</a> who worked on Skyrim, but it seems to me like most of them only did one or two voices.</p>
<p><em>Some</em> major characters have unique actors but a number of important (but not major) characters have the same canned voices as the other 90% of the game. Bethesda has access to talent but under-utilizes some actors and over-utilizes others.</p>
<p>I greatly preferred Morrowind's dialogue, which allowed us to use our imaginations and allowed Bethesda to include far more information and lore presented at a faster pace.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p></div>		</li>
