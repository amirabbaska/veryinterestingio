			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the metal has to be perfectly clean.  Any contaminants, corrosion, etc as you mentioned would prevent this from happening.</p>
<p>This can happen on earth too, it's just that air easily introduces contaminants. But it is a common manufacturing tech technique. You clean the surfaces, and then ultrasonically vibrate them to increase surface contract. This creates a weld with very little heat production.  Perfect for building electronic components. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gold does not react with oxygen according to wiki. At least not without much effort. You won't be able to weld gold this way, because it's dirty. You need to clean it in a cleanroom to get it clean enough. There's also some minimum amount of pressure involved. Cold welding is a serious issue with very clean bolts, because the pressure is so high. The more similar the materials, the more serious the issue. Bolts that are cold welded can only be removed by drilling them out. This is also true for stainless steel, in fact it is especially true for steanless steel. The oxide breaks easily or the metal is simply extruded out of the oxide layer by the pressure involved. I see some comments that cold welding does not apply to steanless steel, but the opposite is true. It's a terrible material. It has the lowest minimum required pressure of all materials I found in some paper by ESA. The fact that it is an alloy does not matter, it's about how well the materials can dissolve into each other, how well an alloy can be formed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even on Gold, you have a few nm of stuff like water molecules on top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, gold does react with oxygen. It's just that gold oxide is transparent or gold coloured or something.</p>
<p>Edit- seems I'm confusing gold and aluminum. Gold doesn't oxidize, aluminum does but aluminum oxide is transparent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to this addition, melting the metal usually gets rid of the corrosion and oxidization, which means it can bond permanently that way. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The impurities within a metal are typically chemically removed through smelting. </p>
<p>Melting is not the same as smelting. </p>
<p>Oxides of most metal have melting point far far higher than that of the base metal. </p>
<p>The reason they &quot;bond permanently&quot; is because it is thermodynamically favourable to form a crystalline lattice as they cool from solid to liquid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As explained in this video (great find, btw), it requires a lot of pressure and perfectly prepared surfaces.  It won't spontaneously occur in space.  The metal brought to space by a space agency will already have surface imperfections and oxidation, prohibiting cold welding from &quot;accidentally&quot; occurring.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>edit:</em> I'll amend this to say the chances of this happening would be very rare, but not impossible.  There is research by a few space agencies suggesting there have been accidental occurrences of contact/cold welding.  I'm sure it's possible, but it also sounds as if an engineer was trying to cover his ass in regards to why his satellite stopped working.  </p></div>		</li>
