			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. There is considerable evidence that increased reproduction (number, attempts, and effort) shortens telomeres and may impact survival (Bauch et al. 2013, Voillemot et al 2012, Kotrschal et al 2007). I think it is likely, however, that there is cost of reproduction, and less so that longevity enhancing mechanisms are 'turned on.' This is supported by the literature thus far. </p>
<p>There is some evidence for this in other animals, that delaying reproduction delays senescence. I referenced it earlier, Steve Austad's work explored the phenomena that hydra do not senesce if they reproduce asexually, but begin senescence once they are triggered to reproduce sexually (don't have a citation, was at a personal meeting). Also, Hunt et al. (2006) showed that the selection for increased longevity leads to decreased reproductive effort - Quote from Abstract: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...we selected directly on adult longevity of male field crickets <em>Teleogryllus commodus</em> and measured the correlated responses of age- dependent male reproductive effort, female lifetime fecundity, and several other life-history traits.&quot;</p>

<p>But is it true that animals that delay reproduction and sexually mature late in life, tend to live longer as well? Evolutionary speaking, would it be beneficial to have some sort &quot;longevity enhancing mechanisms&quot; in case when conditions are not right for reproduction? That way it could be assured that long living species, that mature late and have very few offspring will have a chance to reproduce later in life, if current conditions are bad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't find any sources  or studies on this based in science. Women will continue ovulating as normal and generally enter menopause around the same time even if they aren't getting pregnant. The body doesn't want to miss an opportunity at fertility so I find this a little far fetched. </p>
<p>Pregnancy is definitely stressful on a female body so I could see that it might have an impact on lifespan, but that's a different beast all together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aw sweet, I always wanted to do telomere research but I'm just not a chemist/biologist (robots ftw!) However for the better part of a decade I've had this idea: Synthetic kidney to synthesize telamerase and introduce it directly to the blood stream. People live with one kidney, kidneys synthesize hormones and cycle blood, it's the ideal candidate for a switch-out for different chemicals to make you stop aging. If one could grow such a kidney, is this idea viable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Robots are awesome! I use robots to help with the accuracy/precision of pipetting reagents in my lab work on telomeres, so thanks for your work!</p>
<p>Thats a cool idea, however, a little dangerous in practice since we don't fully understand how telomerase works in cells and affects longevity. Without going into extreme detail, when telomeres shorten substantially that they cannot be rolled and capped, this is seen as DNA damage and triggers a pathway called the p53 apoptosis pathway. This is a tumor suppression pathway and results most likely in the death of the cell. If enough telomeres in a tissue or system shorten and trigger this pathway, the death of the aggregate number of cells causes a decrease in the function of the system (we term this as system senescence).</p>
<p>Telomerase can elongate telomeres. However, up-regulation of telomerase is implicated in about 85% of cancer cases. Telomerase is only active in human stem and germ cell lines, however other species appear to tolerate increased telomerase activity in other cell lines. Up-regulation of telomerase by itself can carry considerable risks, as it puts in jeopardy the telomere shortening branch of the p53 tumor suppression pathway. Should tumorgenesis occur, this p53 suppression pathway could be 'blocked' by the increased telomerase activity, when a normal, telomerase-deficient cell would proceed towards apoptosis.</p>
<p>Telomerase deficient mice have shown recovery of organ activity and physiological 'health,' but the study was only a brief telomerase addition (Jaskelioff et al 2011). While this did not promote carcinogenesis, the author explicitly said that increase telomerase for longer periods of time, especially longer in life would like lead to carcinogenesis. There are some species of bird, however, that can withstand higher levels of telomerase in somatic cells.v</p>
<p>Pro re nata administration of telomerase to healthy somatic cells currently leads to carcinogenesis in all studies I am aware of.</p>
<p>An interesting paper on the topic: Haussmann, M. F., D. W. Winkler, C. E. Huntington, I. C. T. Nisbet, and C. M. Vleck. 2007. Telomerase activity is maintained throughout the lifespan of long-lived birds. Exp Gerontol 42:610-618.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, doesn't a short lifespan mean that a species evolves more quickly?  The shorter a species' generation time, the more chances it has to acquire a potential beneficial mutations.  Evolution would seem to favor whichever species produced the most new individuals over a given time period.  Programmed death would seem to be an evolutionary mechanism to decrease the competition between organisms and their offspring.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For random mutations, as I understand it, yes.  But the force of natural selection might differ between populations based up competition, predation, resource, life-history strategy, etc.  The evolution of whether a species is long or short lived generally is linked to extrinsic factors that affect individual survival like predation rates, food availability, habitat conditions, etc. For instance, in populations without predators, individuals are not under pressure to reproduce rapidly and age more slowly and reproduce later in life. This is not to say long lived species are 'more fit' than short lived species, since both must be equally fit since both exist in nature. I explore this more <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/37gjpv/why_isnt_there_an_animal_that_could_live_for/crmznhc" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>This theory was postulated early to help answer the &quot;why do we age?&quot; question. While in theory this might be a benefit of shorter or limited lifespans, shorter lifespans do not inherently improve fitness.   The programmed death theory is written as if the effect of aging (the replacement of more fit individuals, or decreased competition) drives the phenotype that we observe. In reality, there are no known mechanisms that would drive individuals to simply be programmed to die for a selfless benefit of the population, there would have to be a benefit to the individual. The result or benefit of limited lifespans that you mentioned exists, but its existence is not the reason for its evolution.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are many different reproductive strategies, but they almost all seem to follow the pattern of reaching maturity at the fastest rate that isn't detrimental to the organism's success, then reproducing significantly more often than the replacement rate for that species.  Predators mature slower than prey, because they need an extended childhood, during which they acquire more knowledge, for example.</p>

<p>Don't honeybees and some species of termites and ants do that though?  I thought there were quite a lot of traits that evolved for the benefit of the population while being a detriment to the individual.  Altruism, for example.</p></div>		</li>
