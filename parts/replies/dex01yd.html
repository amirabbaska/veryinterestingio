			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, still licensed and was board certified in internal medicine and pediatrics after residency training  (and oy, I didn't write that bio :-) . Don't practice as actively in the past, but being in the clinic certainly does reveal unmet needs, how tech does and doesn't work (i.e. many EMRs are impediments to care)...    and what we do is not focused on blue sky, but often applying solutions and tech that exist to addressing real world problems today...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dr. Kraft,</p>
<p>I work in the medical industry vendor side doing almost nothing but EMR/PACS/VNA/ETC integrations so I know a lot of the challenges and opportunities firsthand. Since this AMA was a bit backwards, is there another forum to ask you questions and interact?</p></div>		</li>
