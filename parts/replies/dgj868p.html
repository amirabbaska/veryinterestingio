<p>If you read his other replies it stinks of someone with unproven hypotheses from decades ago and opinions which have been heavily debunked (PH levels in the body - alkaline diets and that bollox). </p>
<p>I suspect your answer has similar mechanics to what we see when people get super nervous and be sick, get diarrhoea etc. The body knows something is wrong and is kicking into fight mode. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Early response phenomena.</p>
<p>People click on a question like this because they're curious and they're curious because they don't know.</p>
<p>They read the response -- it really doesn't matter if it's right, as long as it isn't incomprehensible nonsense -- and then think, 'Oh, neat, I learned something.'  Then the click in an upvote.  This in turn pushes up the response and once something starts getting upvotes it takes more and more effort to rebury it.  In turn it buries what might be excellent answers that arrived later.</p>
<p>The cycle is self-feeding and one of the biggest flaws with the scoring system.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct!
When nervous/stressed, your body is going into that fight-flight-freeze instinct. That means you are getting a boost of adrenaline, and a quick hit of endorphins in order to help deal with any pain you may experience. These neurotransmitters move throughout the body, especially to the GI system -- they cause a release of prostaglandins, which are pain-related neurotransmitters and tend to be site-specific (e.g. leg, abdomen). When your GI tract has a high concentration of prostaglandins binding there, you get stomach and intestinal upset.
Hence why many women complain about diarrhea during their menstrual cycle and why when you're going into a stressful situation like a job interview or first date you might have an upset stomach and/or the runs. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally an actual answer. Though the top comment is true, it's only the start of the real explanation. Drawing blood away from your GI does not make someone vomit. Or else you'd be vommiting every time you got a boner. It's the downstream efffefts of the sympathetic nervous system that explain the mechanism. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a former paramedic and this is the <del>correct</del> best answer to explain the original query to a 5-year old.  </p>
<p><em>
Please Note: Blood shunting causing vomiting is the primary cause.  However it's not quite accurate to say that there is no relationship between the stomach &amp; blood PH.  If you are interested in expanding on acidosis there are some great answers by helpful physicians below.  Read on if you'd like a breakdown of blood movement in the body.</em></p>
<p>When a person is exercising hard they are in what you could call &quot;light&quot; hypovolemic shock.  There is simply not enough blood to deal with all of the simultaneous demands of the organs at that moment (primarily acid out &amp; O2 in).  When this starts to happen your brain assumes the worst and goes into survival mode.</p>
<p>Whenever anything stressful happens (cardio, first date, public speaking, brutal hangover etc.) our brain activates the sympathetic nervous system to keep us alive.  Your body will pull blood away from &quot;non-essential&quot; areas like the stomach, the bowel or the skin and shunt it to your brain, your lungs and the large muscles in your legs and back.  </p>
<p>This is the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response and it's designed to help us attempt to outrun the grizzly that's trying to eat us and then lose horribly in a fist fight when it quickly reels us in.  (Note: People who are very anxious also spend most of their time with this system activated).</p>
<p>Throwing up during exercise is not generally a cause for concern - but if you are taking care of someone who has recently been on the receiving end of some sort of light/medium trauma (falls, broken limbs, baseball to the face etc.) they may throw up for similar reasons.  This is generally not a positive sign and at this point you should strongly consider an ambulance (especially with head injuries).  </p>
<p>If the injury is more serious people may eventually lose bowel/bladder control as well, again for basically the same reason.  This is an advanced sign of shock and likely means the injury is more major than minor.</p>
<p>Keep in mind as well that internal bleeding can happen silently and escalate slowly.  Even in the absence of obvious trauma a person could be bleeding on the inside (stroke, aneurysm, punctured lung,  pregnancy complications etc.).  If they are going into unexplained shock they need to see a doctor.  </p>
<p>If someone throws up, loses control of their waste and/or loses consciousness it is absolutely time to call 9-1-1.  Don't hesitate.  It's better to be wrong in the direction of assuming the worst at this point.  &quot;False alarms&quot; happen all the time and paramedics don't even notice.  Mostly they are just happy the paperwork on your call will be light.</p>
<p>In the case of intense exercise you can give this rule a little leeway.  Some &quot;light&quot; shock is normal if you're at the high end of what you can do.  However without any major injury the symptoms shouldn't last long, and throwing up shouldn't be accompanied by loss of consciouness, seizures or shitting your pants.  Otherwise, it's no big deal.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Throwing up during intense exercise is a normal response to blood being pulled away from your stomach.  It is a similar mechanism to other stressful events in life.  The feeling should pass quickly - you should feel better right away or soon after you stop the activity.  If other symptoms accompany it, or if you have recently hurt yourself it could be a sign of something more serious.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body is heating up and it wants to cool down. To do that it expands the capillaries near the surface of the skin and increases blood flow. This means two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>your skin is warmer and can radiate more heat</p>
</li>
<li>your blood is getting closer to the outside air, which cools it down</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the same reason you get blue when you're cold: your body contracts the capillaries near the surface and restricts blood flow to your extremities. This keeps the blood away from the cold outside and prevents you from loosing heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't want to say yes for sure, but it could certainly be causing lowered circulation which could cause those symptoms. </p>
<p>People who are hyperventilating often have numbness and tingling in their extreminties that sounds similar.  In their case decreased circulation causes a buildup of CO2 which is very acidic and bothersome to the tissues.</p>
<p>Hangovers are mostly dehydration (I think).  There is obviously more going on but that's the bulk of the awfulness.  I know we used to spike ourselves with IV's during our poker nights and that always made the next day much better - although you would have to piss almost constantly!</p>
<p>This is all a guess though, like so much of medicine.  The truth is no one is quite sure what a hangover is.  If (when?) some company cracks that code they are going to get very wealthy selling hangover pills.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here. I agree with your answer to the question. It's an autonomic/sympathetic response. Fight or flight kicks in and shunts blood from the digestive system (parasympethetic system) to the main targets of the sympathetic system (heart, lungs, muscles, etc). It's a temporary gastroparesis (long term side effect of diabetes where the stomach does not work properly). The body's response to this (&quot;shunting of splanchnic flow&quot;) is nausea and vomiting of the gastric contents.</p>
<p>However, the stomach can absolutely affect the blood pH like somebody rightly answered below. When you lose stomach acid via vomiting, the body has to make more. The reaction to do this uses carbonic anhydrase (H2CO3 -&gt; H+ and HCO3). The acid (H+) goes into the stomach and the HCO3 (bicarb) goes into the blood. Bicarb is part of the body's buffer system and makes the blood less acidic and more alkaline. TLDR: if you keep throwing up the acid, your blood will become less acidic and more alkaline in order to produce more stomach acid (called metabolic alkalosis). </p>
<p>Also oral sodium bicarb is used to increase the blood pH in certain cases (mostly kidney failure patients). We can absolutely change blood pH via altering the stomach pH. It is absolutely not the body's quickest way of changing the pH though. We can change blood pH very quickly via hyperventilating or hypoventilating. That's a different story that we can talk about later. </p>
<p>Edit: changed one decrease to increase</p></div>		</li>

Voiding your stomach will obviously prevent that.</p>
<p>But apart from that I don't think vomiting is what was selected for during evolution. It seems it's just a sideeffect of drastically reduced blood flow to the intestines.</p></div>		</li>
