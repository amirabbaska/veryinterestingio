<p>There are some funds he can allocate. Obama's EO to allocate funding for research of gun violence comes to mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to be a bit pedantic here. Congress allocates the funds to the various departments, and sometimes to specific things, or with specific restrictions, but there's certainly some discretionary funding that's padded in. The president can then <em>reallocate</em> any discretionary or non-specific/restricted funding within that department.</p>
<p>In situation, I believe there was a block fund allocated for science stuff, and he designated a certain portion to be used specifically for the research into gun violence.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/us/politics/21detain.html" target="_blank">Here's an article mentioning that they stripped, from the proposed budget, the funds specifically intended for closing Gitmo.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/press-releases/senate-passes-ike-skelton-national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2011" target="_blank">And in 2010, they passed an act that specifically prohibited defense funds from being used for that purpose</a></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prohibits the use of DOD funding to construct or modify a facility within the United States to house detainees transferred from the Guantanamo detention facility.</p>

<li>
<p>Prohibits the use of DOD funding to transfer, release or assist in the transfer or release of Guantanamo detainees to or within the United States. </p>
</li>
<li>Prohibits the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to countries where former Guantanamo detainees were transferred and subsequently returned to terrorist activities, unless the transfer is in the U.S. national security interests or necessary to carry out a court order and limits transfers to other countries or foreign entities pending certification of certain elements. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was the argument made as to whether or not Congress could intervene in Obama's decisions regarding Gitmo detainees and whether or not this violated the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branch.<br />
The problem was that there were restrictions on where we could send detainees.  People could not be released/transferred to countries with questionable security where their lives would be endangered, or where they may be tortured, or where their incarceration was not guaranteed.  Those who were not slated for release had to be incarcerated elsewhere... and short of finding nations who would/could take these prisoners, the only other option would be to bring them to the US.  And this is where Congress stepped in and said no.  </p></div>		</li>
