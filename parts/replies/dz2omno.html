			<div class="markdown"><p>The iPhone stock compass actually has a level built into the app. I always just assumed it was their because why the hell not, but this makes a lot more sense. </p>
<p>Follow up question however, does “recalibrating” a compass app account for the localized magnetic declination? (Holy crap I felt smart saying that) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This depends on the software; in many compass apps, you can use your current GPS location to automatically display a corrected geographic north (and often you can switch between geographic and magnetic indication)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would think that because the phone has GPS that it would auto correct for declination, since it knows where the user is.</p>
<p>I've always figured the phone should also be able to use direction of travel to dynamically calibrate the compass.  GPS gives location, direction is calculated during motion, location is used to reverse correct for declination, then the compass calibration correction is made.  Probably a feature without much end-user need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres a publication from 2015 or 2016 iirc which compares geologic compasses to phone apps. The results indicated quite clearly that in science there currently is no way around the old-school compasses since phones are just not as precise. It also depended on the phone model quite a bit. iPhones got much better results than some other, less known brand who's name I don¿t remember right now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are also other brands with similar designs like Silva which are cheaper, but can't take as much of a beating. Bruntons are the standard for American Geologists. </p></div>		</li>
