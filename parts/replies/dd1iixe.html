			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes Mercury concentrates naturally in water and does bioaccumulate in higher trophic level species, but the rate has probably increased because of the dramatic rise in Mercury levels as a result of human activities. <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/humans-have-tripled-mercury-levels-in-upper-ocean-1.15680" target="_blank">This</a> paper from Nature discusses the increase of mercury in ocean surface waters. A little on the older side, but citations to the individual studies at the bottom of the article. Tried to find something a little newer, but I'm tired and will look more tomorrow.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just trying to answer OP's question about before human activity. I know it has increased.  I actually did a special project in college. Using Atomic Absorption spectrometery. Trying to measure mercury in canned tuna. I couldn't detect any. I demonstrated I could detect down to a few parts per billion. Part of that could have been the chemical processes I tried to free the organometalic form, into inorganic ionic form, may not have worked great.</p></div>		</li>
