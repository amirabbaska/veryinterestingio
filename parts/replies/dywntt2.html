			<div class="markdown"><p>A typical hydrocarbon reaction usually results in more gasses than we started with because the carbon based fuel - which was not in the atmosphere (usually) may consume, say, 2 O2 and produce 2 H2O and 1 CO2 or a similar ratio. For instance, methane's combustion is:</p>
<p>CH4 + 2 O2 = CO2 + 2 H2O</p>
<p>Which means more gasses than when we started. This should also be self-evident because when you start, you have a liquid or solid with some gas, and when you finish, you only have gasses, so the solid must have gone somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's less gas... You started with three gas molecules and now you only have one. Even if the fuel were solid carbon you still have:</p>
<p>C + O2 -&gt; CO2</p>
<p>which is the 1 gas molecule -&gt; 1 gas molecule. Am I missing something really obvious?</p></div>		</li>
