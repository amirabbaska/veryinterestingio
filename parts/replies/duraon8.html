			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a similar device and it's been fascinating to see how much power &quot;idle&quot; devices use.</p>
<p>I figured that leaving my monitor on all the time would be a problem, but it goes into standby mode when there's no signal and draws so little power that my device doesn't register a reading.  I'm guessing that the only difference between standby and off is a blinking blue LED.</p>
<p>Plugging my laptop into it is also interesting - the power usage changes dramatically based on whether it's charging or not, but also changes quite a bit based on how much I'm doing with the computer.  Both of these are fairly obvious things, but still fascinating to see.</p>
<p>These are useful tools for other things too.  Want to know if the block heater on your car is working?  Plug it in through the meter and see if it's drawing power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your computer has lots of power saving features. If you go look at the CPU consumption on specialized websites, you'll often see ~3 measures. Idle, heavy load and stress testing. Idle means just looking at windows without anything has anything open, heavy load means like rendering or playing a game, while stress test means using all the available power of the chip. The difference can oftentimes be staggering.</p>
<p>Also, both AMD and Nvidia have adopted some methods to reduce power consumption even in heavy loads when it's not needed. For instance if you have an AMD GPU you can enable a feature called Radeon Chill that provides a dynamic framerate cap that adjusts based on  how much stuff is going on on the screen in a game, so that if you are looking at a wall for instance, you don't get a useless 200 fps. This can cut the power consumption of a GPU in certain titles of as much as 50%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're reliable (had one for years) and pretty accurate (i have other equipment where i can confirm its readings)...</p>
<p>... Down to a point, that is.  Truth is a KAW can't really accurately measure standby power of many devices because <em>it's too low</em>.  So in the context of the question it gives you an answer (nearly nothing) but technically isn't all that accurate down low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Also, hardwired 220 volt appliances can't be measured that way.  They do make more sophisticated devices you can wire into your electric panel and monitor every circuit.  Problem is those devices cost $200.  In my case I worked out, from my utility bill which has daily power draw, my standby power draw when the house is vacant with nobody using any power and everything 'off'.  It worked out to be about 80 watts, or $3.74 a month, or $44 a year.  The monitoring devices are $200 and even if it let me hunt down some unnecessary loads, it would still be nonzero.  Even if I could reduce the 80 watts down to 40 it wouldn't pay for the devices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No longer true.  20 years ago you would have had to spend hundreds of dollars for one. But the Kill-a-watt brand are inexpensive and accurate, under $20.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the realistic amount of energy wasted over a month though? Is $5 a month worth the time to unplug everything? 10? 30? What's the threshold? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much less, think pennies at most if you're just unplugging things that have a standby mode.</p>
<p>Not worth it imho. Some poster farther down had a pretty hefty standby power consumption and it only amounted to ~$3.50 a year of savings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our power company here seems to think it's more significant but I have a hard time believing it.</p>
<p>&quot;These ‘energy vampires’ include electronics or appliances that continue to draw power, even when turned off, and can account for up to 10 per cent of a household’s electricity bill. The average B.C. home has more than 25 devices that draw vampire power, including everything from televisions and gaming consoles to coffeemakers.&quot;</p>

<p>I think 10% is a very high amount but the page goes on to say recycling an old electronic could save you $30 a year. Perhaps this is more of a second fridge in the garage scenario rather than unplugging your cell changer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if it were 10%, my bill is usually 80-90 on an average month. I'm not going to spend time unplugging devices, just to plug them back in to save myself $8-9. Total waste of time for me. </p>
<p>&quot;But that's over $100 a year!!! You could do so much with that!!&quot; Nope, still not worth my time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a modern device (from the last few years) standby power is around 1 watt, probably even lower, so with 20ct/kwh you are most probably looking at 10-14ct per month and device.</p></div>		</li>
