<p>Is it possible to be unaware of one's mortality and exhibit traits related to survival?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unequivocally yes.  Lots of survival traits are basically just pre-programmed subroutines arising from evolution.  Things like herd behavior, aversion to certain patterns (e.g. the shape or coloration of a known predator), disgust response to toxins, trauma, etc.</p>
<p>No consciousness is required for any of these.  Even organisms like mushrooms, which are typically colonies, will have survival-related responses to certain stimuli.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>risk of failing to do any of the above would lead to the end of their species, as death does not allow for the species to continue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evolution does not operate at the species level, it operates at the gene level.  There is no imperative to &quot;preserve the species,&quot; except as an indirect result of &quot;preserve individuals likely to share your genes.&quot;  The difference seems subtle, but it's important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how else would animals have an instilled fear of things that could hurt/kill them, as well as the instinctual need to find food/shelter/and potential mates if they were unaware of their own mortality?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the ones that didn't have those behaviors died, that's how natural selection works.</p></div>		</li>
