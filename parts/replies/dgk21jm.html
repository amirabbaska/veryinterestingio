			<div class="markdown"><p>Einstein did have some serious foibles in life that one would be wrong to overlook in an examination of his character. However, his legacy as a prolific and influential scientist lives on through the application of his published theoretical work to this day. What is amazing to me is that he (and perhaps his collaborators) wrote down equations almost exactly 100 years ago, of which some have required no alteration and that precisely describe the behavior of new objects in the Universe that are being discovered today. </p>
<p>For instance: the awesome discovery in the 1980's of two pulsars orbiting around one another. The measurements of how the stars' orbits changed with time laid precisely along the line predicted by general relativity:</p>

<p>What we are really celebrating this month is the amazing ongoing work and applications that his published theories (in particular, that of general relativity) have led to!</p></div>		</li>
