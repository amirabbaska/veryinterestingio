			<div class="markdown"><p>You've probably noticed how snails are slimy which is because their body is constantly secreting fluid. As such they have a direct opening to their body through their skin, salt gets near (and in) those openings and steals water through osmosis.</p>
<p>Freshwater fish die from osmosis by ingesting it, just like we do</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honesty I’m surprised snails live at all: they seem so delicate. At least this ones I see. </p>
<p>Except Cone Snails - they give me the creeps, because they have a toxic fart. </p>

<p>Edit: Ah. I should proof read. I’m leaving it, but meant to say Dart. </p>
<p>Beware of toxic farts too. Especially silent and deadly ones. They can drop a grown adult human in seconds, and some are more toxic then others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if we apply salt on a permeable membrane of the body? Let's say I stick spoonful of kosher salt in my cheek like a squirrel, will the cells get shredded in the same manner as a snail's body?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Osmosis is also the reason why you can preserve things with salt or sugar. Jam, for example, has sugar enough to dehydrate and kill bacteria. </p></div>		</li>
