			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a little more context than simply: <em>&quot;People were afraid because of Pearl Harbor&quot;</em>:</p>
<p>When fighting the Japanese, it became clear to us how indoctrinated the population was in favor of their God-King emperor.</p>
<p>Days <em>after</em> the Nagasaki bombing, members of the military clique were still discussing methods to achieve victory, including: <em>&quot;Being willing to sacrifice 20 million people in kamikaze attacks.&quot;</em>  Civilians were also being trained in the use of 'primitive weapons' (bamboo spears and sticks) to repel the invaders if they reached the sacred homeland.</p>
<p>And Kamikaze attacks were the least of it.  Children armed with backpack explosives would throw themselves under tanks, or wander up to US marines while concealing a grenade.</p>
<p>Whole families of civilians jumped off cliffs to avoid capture by marines, because of the <em>dishonor</em> of surrender, and because of the horror stories they were told about what the barbaric white-man would do to them.</p>
<p>We really are talking about fanaticism analogous to some of the worst examples you see out of <em>Best Korea</em>.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this information came to us <em>after</em> the internment camps were set-up.  But the United States wasn't ignorant of the cultural devotion to the Emperor. They are good hind-sight examples of the kind of culture we were fighting.</p>
<p>Now that's the Japanese in <em>Japan</em>.  What does that have to do with the Japanese citizens in <em>America</em>?  Quite a lot, actually.  Many of the Japanese in America were first or second generation immigrants.  It was very common for 1st generation parents (and sometimes even 2nd generation parents) to send their children back to live with relatives and be educated in Japan before returning to the United States.</p>
<p>So the Japanese population in the United States showed a significant degree of loyalty to their homeland and their heritage. And both parents and children often grew up and were educated in Japan. And why shouldn't they have been? We were trading with the Japanese for most of the 1930's, and weren't at war with them until the day after Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>But that doesn't change the fact that that loyalty, fanatical as it was in their home-bound countrymen, represented a likelihood of collaboration and sabotage from domestic citizens that, it was determined, could not be afforded.</p>
<p>Now, two things cannot be under-stated.  First, is the remarkable valor and dedication shown by Japanese-American soldiers serving in the European Theater.  The second is the Japanese-American population itself, who largely <em>went along with</em> the internment camps, not just out of fear for their own safety, but out of a respect for the fear others felt about their loyalty.  It was a horrible situation all-around, but there was no better way to demonstrate their loyalty than participating in the camps with decorum and composure.</p>
<p>My mother worked in the bay area during the 70's, and had an colleague who was in fact a child living in one of those camps.  He didn't know what was going on at the time.  He told my mother that his parents did not like the situation at all.  But they didn't resent the United States for doing what they did, because they understood the risk, or at least understood the precaution and fear of the risk.</p>
<p>The history of minorities in the United States has always been one of foreign people asserting, not their own special rights, but asserting rather that <em>they are people, and they are us</em>.  They demand rights not for themselves, but for all people, and for them to be included in that group.  This is one such demonstration of that - the Japanese nationals largely swallowing their resentment at the indignity for the sake of proving that <em>they were Americans too</em>.</p>
<p>People should do well to remember what they put up with, to show they truly were <em>of us</em>.  But people should also remember what conditions were at the time, and what justification there was for fearing sabotage and espionage from domestic ethnic Japanese who were educated in Japan and whose communities had a good chance of containing many people more loyal to their native land than their newly adopted one.</p>
<p>An additional thing to recall, that no one ever seems to mention, is that while race may have played a role, it cannot be stated to be the defining or determining factor in the decision.  Because we had plenty of internment camps for Ethnic Germans as well.  But nobody seems to mention those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a pretty interesting perspective, Hawaii was the one place where Japanese Americans weren't sent off the the internment camps. </p>
<p>It's frightening to think about this in our modern context. I wonder if our treatment of Muslims (especially in the past week) will become our new national shame 50 years from now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, this is sad. I wrote a whole reply, and then dropped my phone, and canceled my reply while trying to catch it.  Here's attempt #2.</p>
<p>Both my husband and I are fourth generation people of Japanese ancestry, born and raised in Hawaii. </p>
<p>One of my grandfathers was a longshoreman and also worked in the sugar plantation camps; he was not interned.  Another grandfather served in the Army.   My step-grandfather was part of the famous 442nd regimental combat team! (&quot;Go for Broke!&quot;)</p>
<p>My husband's grandfathers, on the other hand, were both interned. My understanding is that one or both of them were also transferred to camps on the mainland.</p>
<p>Hopefully this link works: <a href="http://hawaiiinternment.org/" target="_blank">http://hawaiiinternment.org/</a></p>
<p>Because of our family history, we are concerned like you about what is happening now, and trying to help those being discriminated against by remembering the past. </p></div>		</li>
