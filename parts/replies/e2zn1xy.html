			<div class="markdown"><p>Animals groom and “kiss” their offspring, and physical affection is shown in many ways. Cuddling and soothing an infant releases oxytocin in both the infant and caregiver’s brains, which is integral to bonding. Babies that are not touched and cuddled enough will die and children will develop all manner of reactive behaviors if a secure attachment to a caregiver or caregivers are interrupted. I imagine touch is so important because humans are inherently highly social pack animals that bond very deeply to their “pack.”  The huge energy and time required to raise a baby to adulthood is probably also a huge factor in the depth of our bonding behaviors with our children or children that we regularly care for in our lives. </p>
<p>It is essential for children to be secure and feel safe to grow up healthy and happy and be good adults. Kissing and other forms of affection help to accomplish this for nonsexual reasons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that articles entirely wrong. Why is it arguing that it’s “encoded in our genes” while acknowledging it’s not a human universal?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not every culture is down with the full-on mouth kissing enlivened by a wandering tongue. That seems to be a modern, and Western, convention, perhaps from the last 2,000 years, says Wlodarski. A study published in 2015 found that less than half of the cultures surveyed engage in romantic, sexual kissing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to imply that these cultures don’t have “full-on mouth kissing enlivened by a wondering tongue” but maybe they have other forms of tongueless romantic kiss. They do not seem to. I talk more about that study <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4c4gsz/did_people_always_make_out_how_was_attraction/" target="_blank">here</a> in an /r/askhistorians post and here’s another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5xnl2o/eli5_why_is_the_sex_humans_have_so_different_from/dejwmy3/?context=3" target="_blank">longer set of posts</a>. As for tongue kissing, it seems like this may not have even been that common in <em>England</em> a few generations ago! (Oral sex was of course almost completely non-existent.) For those interested, see <em>Sex Before the Sexual Revolution: Intimate Life in England 1918–1963</em> which is a great oral history. And just because I’m linking random things, here’s my /r/askhistorians answer about where the term <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/857tu7/i_saw_an_article_today_claiming_that_the/dvvzu45/?context=3" target="_blank">missionary position comes from</a> (missionaries weren’t actually out teaching it to people). </p>
<p>It haven’t found as definitive answers of where the romantic kiss comes from, but it seems like the maternal (or maybe even parental) kiss may be universal. That’s why some groups (the Nuer of Sudan) traditional rejected romantic kissing: they found it infantilizing because kissing is what your mother does (many other groups just found it dirty). There are theories about the origin maternal kiss—it may aid mothers in picking up whatever microbes are affecting the child and then making antibodies to give back to their child through breast milk—but I don’t think there’s one definitive answer. The familial kiss does seem to be the original one (and the one coded in our genes) and perhaps the romantic kiss is a logical extension of that. After all, what are marriage rituals but really rituals putting two people who were once in different families into the same family? So in a way, kissing is written in our genes... but when we romantically kiss, we <em>may</em> be, in a sense, misreading what was originally intended.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cited book, <em>Sex Before the Sexual Revolution: Intimate Life in England 1918–1963</em> by Kate Fisher and Simon Szreter. Maybe “almost completely non existant” is too strong, but they note that several of the respondents were so in the dark about the topic that they thought “oral sex” was open mouth kissing (pg. 306-7 you see quotes), and how they thought that was gross and dirty (the open-mouth kissing). I think only three of the couples had engaged in oral sex. The modal response was something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>q: Would you ever have engaged in, er, do you know what oral sex is.</p>
<p>a: I know. We’ve, no, we’d never. I still get disgusted with that. I know what oral sex is. I—blimey!—...I’ve never practiced that... I don’t go in for that, er, I used to call it “the rubbish”. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s what you see in most of the answers, that it’s both foreign and repulsive. And is in the context of a lot of very frank answers to other questions about sexual behavior, so i think it’s hard to dismiss it as these people are simply being shy with these historians. I can’t find the section on google books, but I think only three of the people (I think all in the middle class rather than working class half of the sample) had ever engaged in oral sex, and I remember one was after he got divorced and moved and sort of became a hippie. This is out 86 people interviewed (there were 50 people were interviewed in Blackburn, 38 in Hertfordshire, all born between 1901 and 1931, but I think there more like members of 60 couples total—I’m having trouble finding the exact number). On Page 340 they say “oral sex was only engaged in by a tiny proportion of interviewees,” but I’m sure elsewhere in the text, outside the Google Books preview, they give the number. It’s amazing how much sex has changed. </p>
<p>Now, you can argue that maybe oral sex was more common in big cities, and that’s possible, but I think it’s important to recognize how much our sexual repertoire has changed since the sexual revolution. In these interviews, you get a lot of stuff like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We only had dry kisses, never wet ones. I thought that was awful... I mean, you should—you’re swapping spit, germs, and I couldn’t’ve done [that]. That’s me faddiness again. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s hard for us to understand, or at least hard for me to understand, but for a lot of the people in the sample, especially the working class people, even French kissing was seen as disgusting. Most people just weren’t sexually adventurous; they had each other, and for most that was enough for them. When asked about exploring other sexual positions, one of the interviewees said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nope. Nope. No, no, no. I don't think you have to do it if you love one another . . . really and truly my married life was, was lovely with him. He really. He was gentle. He was kind. He was everything that I wanted in a man . . . it was just pure love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authors argue because they had a slightly different concept about what the point of sex was. I think they talk about how sex was about the giving of love, rather than the receiving of pleasure. They also talk extensively about how none of them got any sort of useful information about sex before marriage—they mostly just had to discover it for themselves as a couple. </p>
<p>It’s one of the most interesting books I’ve read. The past really is a foreign country. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a breadcrumb to a much more important point.  The OP primarily asked why kissing became a thing, more or less in the first humans.  From there, its metamorphosis into whatever current form it may have is highly culture-dependent, just as nearly everything else.</p>
<p>Aside: I had a co-worker a few years back going into behavioral science, and he said that a vast number of human behaviors (I don't remember which he mentioned, but laughing was one) are universal, and there are very few that do not cross cultural lines except for the &quot;Indian head-wobble&quot; (not an official term, and certainly not meant as an insult or joke).  Its meaning is extremely specific to that culture and very few have anything similar.</p>
<p>Anyway. The kinds of kisses that become mainstream in a given culture are heavily dependent on the attitudes and histories thereof.  I've seen a lot of porn from Japan where their primary 'sexy' method of oral exchange is tongues fully extended and kinda fencing each other.  'Wandering tongue' kissing is usually called 'french kissing,' I assume, for a reason.  And u/yodatsracist mentions a culture in which romantic kissing is either looked down on or simply doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Comparative culture fascinates me to no end.  In another life where I could stand the drudgery of scientific rigor I was probably an anthropologist.</p></div>		</li>
