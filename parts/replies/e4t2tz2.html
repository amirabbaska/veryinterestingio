			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure if any work has been done with trying to interbreed other primates. A soviet scientist early in the 20th century tried to experiment with human hybridization, but couldn't get ahold of a Chimp and so used Orangutans instead, which are much more distantly related. These days good luck getting the funding for that research.</p></div>		</li>
