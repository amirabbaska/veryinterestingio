			<div class="markdown"><p>So as a smoker who knows how bad this is, I'm glad you're promoting not smoking.</p>
<p>But your analogy isn't really correct in terms of why you want it after food and sex. The reason you want it after food and sex is not that it clogs up the feelgood dust in the drain, but that it adds more on top of the dust you already got. Smoking releases the same feelgood dust as eating and sex and laughing and cuddling and running and succeeding ... you get it, it's dopamine. If you've already got a boost from sex/food, why not amplify it with a smoke (note: please don't do this).</p>
<p>But your analogy for addiction is better, that it makes the drain bigger and harder to fill over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're saying is false. Dopamine is very influential in addiction. Look at common addictions such as cocaine, nicotine, sex, food etc. These all effect either the release of dopamine or inhibit the reuptake of dopamine (meaning more is present in your body for longer) which activates the brains reward center which can directly lead to addiction.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nicotine is actually non-carcoginic, the poison is the other chemicals delivered along with it from the cigarette.  This is the reason that vaping is pretty much accepted as safer than smoking because you only receive nicotine not the other nastiness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the problem is that vaping is not FDA regulated so manufacturers put all sorts of chemicals in the liquid for e-cigs that are just as nasty as the chemicals in cigarettes.</p>
<p>Some <a href="http://www.aaas.org/news/alternative-tobacco-products-may-be-just-dangerous-cigarettes" target="_blank">studies</a> suggest they might be worse than cigarettes, even</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Her analysis of nasal samples from cigarette smokers, e-cigarette users, and non-smokers for a panel of 600 different genes related to immune response found 53 genes suppressed in cigarette smokers. Those same genes were suppressed in e-cigarette users, along with 305 other suppressed genes, Jaspers said. &quot; </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also the reason I dislike cannabis shops. I just wish reasonable health standards were developed and then shops would open. I know this would take far longer, but I enjoy knowing what I consume is safe and it worries me there isn't a federal safety standard. (yet) </p></div>		</li>
