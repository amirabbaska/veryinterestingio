			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you up to the point that you suggest parrots don't use language or speech. They certainly speak to each other and large parrots such as African Greys have been shown to have an understanding of the words and phrases they use regularly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd agree, I think the thing I was trying to say is that when one says &quot;Polly Want A Cracker&quot; its not actually speaking a sentence as we know, with the 4 words all having a distinct meaning, its merely repeating a sound. Now, its ability to use these sounds as part of a basic language is a different thing..</p>
<p>So it can seem that they have abilities to speak far beyond Primates, when it fact its their mimicry ability that is fooling the hearers to an extent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not exactly that. </p>
<p>Parrots are smart enough to assume the sounds we, humans, make are meaningful. Why? Because birds, including parrots, make sounds, and those sounds are often meaningful. So they can assume that if we both make sounds, we both probably attach meaning to the sounds. Intelligence recognizes intelligence. </p>
<p>Anyway, once they make this connection they will mimic our sounds. If we give them a reward they will continue to mimic the sounds they hear.  So a parrot will make the sounds that get them what they want. If the sound “hey” gets you to pay attention to it, it will use the sound “hey” to get your attention. If you hold a treat and repeat “kill all humans” until the parrot repeats “kill all humans” and then you give it the treat, it will use the sound “kill all humans” when it wants a treat. </p>
<p>Here’s the thing though: do you consider it speaking if the parrot then first uses the sound “hey” to get your attention, followed by the sound “kill all humans” to tell you it wants a treat? I do. The only reason the sound “kill all humans” means kill all humans to you is because you learned that. The parrot thinks “kill all humans” means “can I have a treat?” because that it what it was led to believe. Don’t believe? Try the same on a 2 year old human. You’ll have them saying “kill all humans” all day long. (<em>Don’t</em> actually do this with a 2 year old human.)</p>
<p>The sounds of language are arbitrary, to all species. </p>
<p>In this way, the parrots are not JUST mimicking us, instead they are speaking to us as well as they are able, even if it’s only about as good at it as a baby human. </p></div>		</li>

That should count for something</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's simply untrue. Putting Alex aside, there are many examples of parrots and corvids using human words in a <em>meaningful</em> way - for example, a parrot suddenly screaming &quot;MAMA BABY MAMA BABY&quot; when a toddler in the room started to choke (rather than remaining silent or saying some other random words) or ravens at the Tower of London saying &quot;Keep on the path&quot; when people step off the path. </p>
<p>You might say that the first example is ungrammatical and the second is mimicking, and you may well be right... but non-human primates who use ASL do not typically use ASL grammar, and there's some debate as to whether or not they really comprehend it as language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Language&quot; doesn't seem to be an appropriate term to use here. It refers only to the complex communication system devised and utilized by humans. The criteria which you provided are wholly of human fabrication, and are not considerate of any alternate systems which may be in use by intelligent nonhumans - which is reasonable, because &quot;language&quot; is not used by them.</p>
<p>We know that at least some corvids must have a complex communication system, and we know that certain cetaceans must have one, too. Some of their common behaviors too overtly rely on the existence of one for its absence. Crows have been observed acting hostile towards humans with which they've never interacted and whose faces they've never seen - but which at least one other crow in the group had (<a href="https://youtu.be/bOkj7lJpeoc" target="_blank">example</a>). Granted, these systems cannot possibly approach the modern complexity of human language - which, throughout its existence, has evolved quickly alongside an increasingly complex society. But who are we to say that these communication systems in use by corvids and cetaceans are not complex in their own right? Humans use polymorphisms, verbs, and syntax - all of which evolved from more basal forms of themselves at the dawn of language. Even if these features aren't currently recognized in their communication systems, these animals appear to have completely distinct means and methods of communication, which we haven't even begun to understand, decode, or even observe.</p>
<p>As much as we'd like to believe that we can accurately make such a judgement as to the complexity of these communication systems, there are so many other means and processes by which these animals might communicate that it would be naive to apply to them those which define human language.</p></div>		</li>
