			<div class="markdown"><p>It may warm the water, but it wouldn't freeze regardless. The pressures are extreme in the deep ocean.
At 4 degrees Celsius, regular water begins to expand (this number likely changes for salt water, the the principle stays the same), the pressure is too great to allow water to expand, so the lowest possible tamperature for water deep down is 4 degrees (again, for fresh water, salt water may differ). </p>
<p>A fantastic exames of this is an air compressor. If you have an air compressor, look underneath the tank, there is likely a drain valve, if you open it up on a hot day, some water will come out. When you touch the water it will be quite cold, even though the air around the compressor is hot, this is because the air in the tank is compressed with much that it is forced to drop in temperature, because cold air is more dense then hot air. </p>
<p>This example shows how pressures are big factors in the state of a substances temperature. </p>
<p>Water is special in that it expands both as it gets hotter and as it begins to freeze.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all wrong.  Static high pressure will not create a limiting effect on temperature.  The reason that the fluid inside air compressors gets cold after discharging is because the pressure drop inside the container causes the temperature of its contents to temporarily drop.  The contents do not stay cold.  Increasing the pressure in an air compressor (such as when it’s charging) will increase the temperature of its contents, temporarily. </p>
<p>The reason that water doesn’t freeze at the bottom of the ocean is because the water temperature at those depths stays above 0°.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm ocean temps.  I work as a hydrographer; we have a slew of sensors including a Tritech Seaking Bathy which has a temperature sensor. I have measured temps at 2500m depth and the water is always above 4 degrees Celsius. Usually around 4.2. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Been too busy to type elsewhere.  Glad to finally see some facts lol.  Ice can be as dense as water if pressure and temps are changed appropriately along the freeze line, ie if water is supercooled at enough pressure.</p></div>		</li>
