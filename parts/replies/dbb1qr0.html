			<div class="markdown"><p>What about &quot;no spooky action at a distance&quot;?</p>
<p>How Physics define when something is local in the sense of communication through force particles or when a field interacts with particles?</p>
<p>There must be a physical definition of touch so a particle emited reaches its destination. But how to determine that threshold of touch in quantum terms?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In modern particle physics we treat interactions between particles as an exchange of a virtual &quot;force-carrier&quot; particle. So for instance, when two protons repel each other, we describe this interaction as an exchange (or series of exchanges) of virtual photons, rather than the classical notion of the electric field (though this notion is still tied up in the mathematics somewhere, it's complicated).</p>
<p>This is the closest analogy you can get to touching on a quantum level. Remember that it's all about probability with quantum mechanics, and generally speaking, the shorter the distance, the greater the probability of interaction. </p>
<p>So, when two macroscopic objects are &quot;touching&quot;, this is effectively a sharp spike in these interaction probabilities. When you pinch your fingers, the atoms in each finger start exchanging virtual photons, deflecting each other, and keeping distance.</p>
<p>At least, that's my Physics major understanding of it, I'm only just starting to look at particle physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, that works - like when any two physical objects clash, there's some physical transfer of material - from physical damage to colours to scent to molecules to protons? Very ELI5.</p></div>		</li>
