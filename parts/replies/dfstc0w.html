<p>(the prevalence of dental caries in Native American populations really sticks out in my brain)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure.  When Native American groups started making the switch from hunting/gathering to agriculture, the did so by domesticating maize.  Maize is pretty gritty has a lot of sugar in it.  This led to a decline in overall dental health and an increase in the amount of tooth decay and the prevalence of caries (aka cavities) in the skeletal record.  Some of these caries were absolutely huge and would often led to exposure of the nerve and the near total destruction of the tooth.  It had to be painful as all hell. </p>
<p>The indication is that there was a sort of trade off: increased population at the cost of individual health.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was a very cool degree to pursue.  After my studies, I did some fieldwork in Europe before working for a state agency in the US.  After a couple years of that I went into the private sector doing medical cost projection analysis.  Eventually I moved into a sales role.  Now I hardly use my medical skill set except doing very specific types of presentations for clients.  It's funny though, I would probably not have gotten the job I have now if it weren't for my education, though I hardly if ever use my degree now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should also say that most of my class mates went on to pursue their PhDs in anthropology or some other related field.  There were a couple of us who didn't pursue the PhD and mostly we worked in Medical Examiner's offices or as lab researchers.</p></div>		</li>
