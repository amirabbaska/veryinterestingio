			<div class="markdown"><p>The gas station near my house takes advantage of this. There is a machine in the parking lot you can use to put air in your tires and it accepts coins. However, if you purchase gasoline or some snacks from the store, they'll give you some coins to use in the machine but they aren't regular US coins, they have the gas station's logo stamped on them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit. In new Zealand absolutely every gas station offers air free. You can drive in, check your tyres and leave. No cost. Same with water or cleaning windscreen. All the effort they go to creating special coins, just offer free air!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's like that in most places. I'm imagining the smaller family owned gas stations might do this because it still costs money to run the air pump, thus incentivizing you to spend money in store to use it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the area.  Some communities are full of assholes who abuse the free pumps and end up costing the gas stations more money than the extra business they are getting from having the free air pumps.</p>
<p>It's the same reason some fast food restaurants have locked bathrooms, reserving them for paying customers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a courtesy to their customers. I now know that if I need gas, a tire fill up, and I want a soda, I should go to that gas station as I'll get the air for free. There are stations on each corner of this intersection (yes that means <em>four of them</em>) and they all have the same price for gasoline, so this is a small way to entice me to choose them instead of one of the others. </p>
<p>The use the custom coins so that they aren't just giving money away to their customers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In California air is free for customers of the gas station. So this way they can let the customer have a coin for air, that they can't steel and use as money... though I wonder if it'll work in an arcade machine, a game of tekken is a game of tekken. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also has laser etched tiny writing along the edges (So the counterfeiters can't make it that small with a simple coin stamper, which is how they made them before), a hologram and (reportedly, the mint won't confirm) a electrically charged material inside the coin, which vending machines can detect to check if the coin is real.</p></div>		</li>
