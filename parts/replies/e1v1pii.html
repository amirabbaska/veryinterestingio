			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Atomic matter clumps because it experiences electromagnetic interactions with other atomic matter. It may be weird to imagine, but a giant ball of low pressure, high temperature Hydrogen gas that is several light years across still behaves like a gas. The atoms in the gas will still run into each other, they'll even out their kinetic energies in a thermal profile, they'll achieve an equilibrium pressure, and so on.</p>
<p>If you have a gas cloud that is gravitationally bound (all of the gas in it has a lower velocity than the escape velocity of the gas cloud) then the gas won't escape from the cloud, but that's not what causes it to condense into a star (and planets). It's those gas interactions which enable the atoms to cool off via radiative heat transfer, slow down, undergo gravitational collapse, heat up from becoming compressed due to the collapse, then radiate heat away, etc.</p>
<p>That process can ultimately lead toward the formation of stars, but it can't happen with dark matter. The dark matter halo is made out of weakly interacting particles that are zipping around, but at less than the escape velocity of the galaxy. There's no real mechanism for those particles to change their orbital distances from the galactic center. Due to orbital dynamics there's some tendency to increase density toward the core of the galaxy, but not enough to cause the sort of clumping at the level of stars and planets. Think about a particle zipping around the galaxy at 200 km/s. It can't interact with anything else except gravitationally, so it's just not going to slow down much. They won't slow down due to running into anything, they can't slow down due to thermal radiation, so they just keep going. The Milky Way's dark matter halo is like a big invisible ball of yarn with a huge number of particles looping around in their long orbits around the galaxy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aha! So it's the <em>energy loss</em> that causes a gravitationally-bound group of particles to collapse, not gravity itself. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
