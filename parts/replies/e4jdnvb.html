			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it really surprising to learn that elephants communicate? They're considered one of the most intelligent and emotionally bonded land mammals, so I am not surprised that they often show empathy to other animals. I just saw a documentary where a woman who has researched elephants her whole life explained that they could communicate with low rumbling sounds - not just face-to-face, but at a distance of miles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly what this post is looking for but I once heard a story about a rampaging elephant that immediately stopped once it got into the same area as a crying human baby. Seemigly recognizing its innocence and calming down immediately. Wish I had a source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm always suspicious of the implications of these sorts of things. Seems to me like the elphants were just messing around and happened to unlatch a gate which we then anthromorphized. Not carry some grand altruistic plan of freeing antelope...</p></div>		</li>
