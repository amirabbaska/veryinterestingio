			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Steam driven coal and gas fired power plants are more efficient than internal combustion engines because they are massive heat engine generators running at a steady state typically in the zone of peak efficiency, not thermal expansion mechanical engines running at all kinds of loads and speeds. Also at least for coal we are mining it locally so it reduces our need for foreign fossil fuel. </p>
<p>The Japanese car companies like Mazda are working on much more efficient engine technology so that will help as we move ahead. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Bringing back the wankel engine?  Who needs to burn fuel when you can just burn the oil in your engine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Triangles!
Actually the skyactiv X platform is going to be great. Couple it with a Toyota hybrid planetary drivetrain and we might see 60-80mpg real world on low octane fuels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes because your city will generate electricity at a larger and more efficient scale than an internal combustion ever could. In this comparison we can effectively remove the Ev from the equation (since we're assuming the Ev is otherwise identical save for having a battery instead of an ICE and we're assuming that battery will be charged via fossil fuels at a power plant) This makes the question really simple. Will an industrial scale power plant be more or less energy efficient than a single gas generator? What about five million gas generators ? Obviously it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what if let's say a million normal cars with ICEs were swapped out with EVs. Is there any point of time where the scale of the EVs will ever result in more environmental damage assuming the electricity to charge their batteries doesn't come from clean energy?</p>
<p>Thank you for your detailed reply btw :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Firstly wow thank you it's so refreshing to have a nice conversation on reddit. Having a bad day and needed that. :) </p>
<p>I imagine not. Assuming all vehicles are swapped with identical EV models, were simply moving the power generation to a more efficient source. Instead of each vehicle having it's own little power plant that doesn't get maintained, upgraded, or more efficient in any way you've got one large power plant that has staff who's entire job is to maintain, repair, upgrade and optimize it.</p>
<p>I imagine the more cars you replace with EV's the greater the net efficiency gains will be. It's simply a more efficient method of storing and transporting energy. Each car has fuel (gasoline vs electricity) a method of storing it (fuel tank vs battery) and a method of using it (ICE vs EV). The only difference between an EV and an ICE vehicle is that the ICE produces small scale power locally, and an EV which pulls power from a non-local hyperscale source. Besides the benefits of scale, making power generation non local means it can be improved regardless of any arbitrary vehicle which utilizes it. More efficient power sources will be discovered and utilized, larger scales will be achieved and each one of these efficiency gains will result in EV energy efficiency actually going up over time. An ICE vehicle can only ever lose efficiency. These gains will also be applied to every single EV on the road (even old ones) without requiring the owner to do anything.</p></div>		</li>
