<p>To put things mildly... Race theory is a pseudo-science that got its big push by a collection of bigoted Europeans around the 19th Century. </p>
<p>It was meant to explain why European nations were justified in colonizing and enslaving the rest of the world, why Northern Europeans are better than Mediterranean people, why economic or social problems (or even disease) were the fault of ethnic minorities like the Jews and Roma rather than poor governance, etc. </p>
<p>It honestly baffles and embarrasses me that American society has internalized this concept of biological races, and keeps legitimiing it by using it so freely, instead of &quot;ethnicity&quot;, &quot;culture&quot;, or &quot;community&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people use the terms race and ethnicity interchangably, and we all know what they mean. The actual historical meaning of the word race that was intended by the colonizers has been lost of the vast majority of people.</p>
<p>Also, 'race theory' in particular is a movement that started in the 80s which takes an agressive approach to racial relations, similar to Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
<p>If your problem is that people use the word race to mean the same thing as ethnicity, then that is semantics.</p>
<p>Moreover, if the idea that people can be classified into races is untenable, then how is the idea that people can be classified into ethnicities any different?</p>
<p>In 1921, Seumas MacManus wrote a book called 'The Story of the Irish Race'.</p>
<p>Is he racist or wrong to say that?</p>
<p>Race:
each of the major divisions of humankind, having distinct physical characteristics.
people of all races, colours, and creeds
synonyms:   ethnic group, racial type, (ethnic) origin
&quot;the school has pupils of many different races&quot;</p>
<p>Modern scientists do not deny the differences between race, they deny the use of race to describe any significant differences.</p>
<p>&quot;They are different because they are black&quot; is wrong, &quot;they are different because they grew up in African culture&quot; is better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I realize the word race isn't very narrow in its meaning. I was referring specifically to the concept of biological races, which associates cultural traits with physically inherited ones, basically saying your genes define your culture and individual personality traits. That's my go-to definition because most of my family from my grandparents' generation and back were killed in the name of this absurd construct. </p>
<p>I am okay with sorting people by ethnicity, as long as we're sensitive to the fuzzy and dynamic nature of these definitions, and are constantly aware of the limits of this analysis. </p>
<p>I am still very uncomfortable but willing to accept people who prefer to label their own ethnicity using a biological marker such as skin color (e.g. &quot;Black&quot; or &quot;White&quot;), though I prefer to use the geographic-historical labels myself (e.g. &quot;African-American&quot; or &quot;European-American&quot;). </p>
<p>But most Jews would not accept the term Jewish Race, and would hear an echo of 19th and 20th century racism that caused their ethnic group a lot of death and suffering, so I'd rather not use that one.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think it's automatically that sinister. With the exception of Native Americans, everyone's heritage is derived from somewhere else, for ex; African American, Irish American, etc... It's a way to hold onto your heritage and embrace your American side as well. Yes some people are bigoted assholes but I am a bit idealistic and think they are the minority.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ethiopia was Beta Israel (Israel 2).</p>

<p>Black Jews in Ethiopia practiced the earliest forms of Judaism.</p>
<p>The Jewish bloodline is passed through the mother.</p></div>		</li>
