			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the only problem with them currently is because of the energy requirements to fuse nuclei the reactors have a negative net energy. There's been a lot of work and research on lower energy fusion but none of it has resulted in a reliable power source, yet.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes, stars, hydrogen bombs, and other fusion based weapons produce a positive net energy, I was referring to a sustainable form of power generation such as a power plant. If you know of a reliable, sustainable form of fusion reactor that exists today, on earth, I'd love to read about it, and be informed as to why it's not being used to power our cities over polluting sources of energy like oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My comment will most likely be buried, but I'd like to point out a small detail. The energy produced by nuclear fusion is actually greater than the energy we use to induce it. The loss of energy that makes fusion power currently inefficient is not in the reaction,  but in the way we hold the reaction in place.  We use super conductors. Super conductors take a large amount of energy to keep extremely cold so that they don't lose their super conductive properties. So you are still correct.  I just wanted to clarify that the energy loss is not in the reaction, but the &quot;container&quot; of the reaction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>making <em>nuclei</em> touch.</p>
<p>The atom, i'd assume, includes electrons and the nuclei. Its not enough for the atomic radius to touch, you need them to move close enough such that they are on the order of nuclei distances, even then, it still takes tunneling for fusion to occur then. </p>
<p>Just for scale, the average &quot;radius&quot; of a hydrogen atom is 53,000 times its nuclei radii, which can be thought as a bare proton. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, fusion creates a chain reaction, that's what makes it reliable (in theory). So starting fusion is tough, keeping it going is theoretically easy.</p></div>		</li>
