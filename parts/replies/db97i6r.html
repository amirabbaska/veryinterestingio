			<div class="markdown"><p>Black Capped Chickadees are the primary visitor to my feeder/suet (pacific northwest). I was so excited to see my first Chestnut Backed Chickadee last winter stopping by every once in awhile. Last Saturday I counted 8-10 Chestnut Backed alone on top of the 15 or so Black-Capped that frequent it. While I can't directly correlate my feeder to an increase in population it makes me feel good thinking more offspring may be surviving because I am feeding them and the breeding population is increasing as a result. </p>
<p>Of course I'm an ecologist so I obviously think of increased risk of predation, gene flow, inter and intraspecies competition, disease risk, foraging behavior, carrying capacity etc etc. </p>
<p>I look forward to reading more about that study! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in CBCH territory in the winter, and locally there's a fair number of leucistic birds. Just less or no rufous color on the flanks, mostly, but some have more leucism than others. Do you see the same? A few years ago in the Bitterroot Mts. I saw Mountain, Black-capped AND Chestnut around camp. Pretty cool. All the CBCH chirps, squeaks and titters make them extra adorable!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohh that would be a sight to see! I haven't noticed any leucistic birds in my area aside from pigeons but I will keep an eye out! I haven't learned many of the molt patterns yet so I usually write off any oddities as a stage of molt or a color variation. Mountain chickadees are a life bird for me so I'm always on the lookout for an extra white stripe above the eye at my feeder! I live in kind of a rural/foothill area of the central cascades so I'm hoping some will stray from the mountains a bit more and into my yard which is mixed riparian forest. </p></div>		</li>
