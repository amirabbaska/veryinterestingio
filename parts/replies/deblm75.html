			<div class="markdown"><p>I just heard a bit on NPR a week or two ago about battery technology and electric cars. A caller was part of a group that is building batteries made from sea water that can apparently be fully recycled. The major problem is that they're very large to be at all worthwhile, so their only practical application is the grid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in theory if your solar power is so cheaply made then efficiency isn't an issue.  You could store the power in a long term simple medium (oil) and use it when you need it.  Oil infrastructure is already in place  so distribution is already taken care of.  There's merit to the idea, but you either need extremely cheap solar power to warrant wasting a large amount to make oil or more efficient process of making oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this reminds me of when they use surplus electricity to pump water uphill to run turbines during peak times.  Its horribly inefficient but the power would just be wasted otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solar salt is actually pretty efficient, with heat loss of just a degree a day. There are other concerns, like turtle migratory patterns and birds, that interfere much more than heat loss, which is about 0.1% of the stored heat per day.
