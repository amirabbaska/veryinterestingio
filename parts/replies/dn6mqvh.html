			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose you could argue that, yes. Apparently cats survival rate increases past heights that allow them  to attain terminaly so I'm sure there's some truth to that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfect height to reach terminal velocity is the worst conditions. Reach max speed with minimal time to become oriented and prepare for impact. Makes sense that survival rate would increase slightly for cats as they pass terminal velocity heights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the cat survival rate being greater at greater heights was related to how they need to have time to twist their bodies into the correct position for them to absorb most of the shock from falling.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not too high, though: too high and there isn't enough oxygen to stay awake, meaning you can pass out and possibly not be able to do <em>anything</em>. Really high and you could die of oxygen loss before you hit the ground, though that'd have to be pretty damned high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>technically if you were trained enough you could use your aerodynamics of your body to aim yourself one way or another to land on a slope, or best you can. If you are higher up and conscious you have more time to do so. 1500 feet gives you basically no time, if the speed doesnt really matter at 1500 or 33000 feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've actually heard that falling from vast heights gives you a slightly higher likelihood of falling from lower-but-still-lethal heights because it gives you time to prepare for your landing and direct yourself somewhat. If you're falling from 1,000 feet or 10,000 feet, your velocity isn't significantly different but your time to prepare is.</p>
<p>Not that anyone is likely to survive anyway, but being able to direct yourself to that thick bush down slope as opposed to the rocks might change your chance from zero to not zero.</p></div>		</li>
