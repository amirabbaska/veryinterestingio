			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up question:  Is there any preference for which fat gets used first?  This hypothetical fat guy probably has subcutaneous fat and visceral fat, fat on his thighs, abdomen, arms, chest, back, etc.  He has fat around his organs and he probably has non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p>
<p>Which fat disappears the fastest?  Would he get skinny but be left with a disproportionate amount of visceral fat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Way above my pay-grade, but <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18180786" target="_blank">this review</a> states that during moderate weight loss, visceral adipose tissue is lost preferentially, and the preference diminishes at greater amounts of weight loss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good find. I was under the impression that fat is burned from all areas equally. Especially that it's a systematic review, not an isolated study. I have no idea how you are getting downvotes for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dropped from seriously obese to overweight.  I had had a cat scan of my torso a few months before I began the weight loss.  I had a similar one done after losing about a hundred pounds.  The scans showed that most of my loss was visceral fat.  It was pretty dramatic.  The loss was entirely through diet by forcing my body into a ketogenic state, although I did it without starvation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope they weren't just to see the weight differential: That's a serious amount of radiation.</p>
<p>That said, I had one for another reason, and seeing the 'thin guy inside the fat guy' is a huge motivation to my continued weight loss</p></div>		</li>

<p>EDIT: Sorry, that reads more aggressive than I intended. I'm genuinely curious because my uninformed impression was that fat loss was always generalised across the body, and I want to know if there's scientific consensus on the issue.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you die of starvation while still having lots of body fat? Absolutely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It depends on what you mean by &quot;starvation&quot;. As the case study you link demonstrates, if you intake the necessary vitamins and minerals, you aren't going to starve to death until your fat stores are used up.</p>
<p>Under ordinary conditions of starvation you might die of a vitamin/mineral deficiency before fat depletion occurs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree--the term &quot;starvation&quot; is loosely defined in the literature. I was just going by the title. Would an overweight man die before his fat was completely depleted? Very likely, yes. </p>
<p>When dealing with malnourished patients in an acute setting, the ability of the body to continue generating ATP by burning fat/muscle/whatever is of fairly low concern. I'd say that cardiac complications really top the list.</p>
<p>Something I'd like to highlight is that muscle wasting would occur even if vitamins were being supplemented, and the renal and cardiac sequelae could be severe and irreversible. For instance, cardiomyopathies have been noted in patients with anorexia nervosa. Valve problems and systolic dysfunction could certainly result in death before fat stores are used up.</p>
<p>Severe caloric restriction is <em>not</em> regarded as 'safe' by the medical community, regardless of vitamin supplementation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an add on to this, the brain cannot function on ketone bodies alone. It requires a minimal amount of glucose to push the TCA cycle because ketogenesis requires succinyl-CoA. So some amount of gluconeogenesis must be able to occur, or the brain stops being able to use ketones for energy.</p>
<p>So really, a significantly overweight person would die for lot's of reason before ALL their fat is used up. Though, they could get on for a long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen many people who are overweight with feeding tubes (usually J tubes, but some Gs). However, I don't know of any cases of overweight/obese people being on TPN off the top of my head. Are there examples of this and I just have a skewed sample, or is there a reason this is less likely or not likely to occur?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think one way to illuminate these details would be to compare cases of people who live solely on TPN (I.e. NPO and no tube feeds). If you compared people on TPN without lipids to people entirely fasting to people on TPN with lipids, you could see the difference between starving just for fat calories vs. starving for all nutrients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you were severely overweight and stopped eating but had adequate water and took proper multivitamins and minerals you'd be ok until you ran out of fat?</p>
<p>There would be other deleterious effects I imagine though, such as your stomach shrinking (which actually might be a slight positive effect as far as feeling &quot;full&quot; after the ordeal goes) and probably pronounced lethargy, but beyond that what else can go wrong?</p>
<p>EDIT: Never mind, read more below, my questions are satisfied, thanks!</p></div>		</li>
