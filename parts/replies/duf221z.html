			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, it has a very strong history. But there’s a lot of it and it’s varied. In most western schools they may touch on it a bit, but as with all local history that’s no let your own, you’d need to take special classes to learn more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strong as in they had a history we know about, and empires and kingdoms, with battles and actual complex political issues.</p>
<p>The stereotype is that it was all just savages in huts, so I think &quot;strong&quot; was just to counter that notion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'strong' and 'proud' are just meaningless adjectives that are added to sentences when talking about Africa, or its people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that, I believe, is the crux of the issue. They don't have a major shaping influence on the US and as such, don't need to be taught in general education. It's the same with the in depth history of most of Eastern Europe, Russia, China or India. It isn't racism, it's irrelevance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not like in other countries they study the history of every other place on Earth as well. I live in Asia and we are taught mostly about the history of our own country, perhaps a bit about the neighbours and the region and depending on special classes you will learn more about other countries but it's pretty much the same everywhere else. I think in Asia history about Europe or the US is mostly restricted to the World Wars unless you take more classes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same as in the US. Learning about the history of your nation is one thing but in depth history of all others outside specific events is a waste of precious time in high school. Get the basics and come back if to need an elective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, this exactly. But for some reason it's racist that we don't do it over here in the west. I may need to charter a very long 'holiday' to the other side of the planet some day.</p></div>		</li>
