Don't you dare stifle their creativity or their desire to keep working at an activity or a hobby, even if that hobby seems frivolous. The ability to pair an insatiable curiosity with an indefatigable work ethic is what makes a scientist successful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m a HS physics teacher and my credentials are not nearly as cool but my biggest advice to you is to try to encourage that creativity and curiosity at a young age! So much of science is being passionate about learning and seeking knowledge, try to encourage that. </p></div>		</li>
