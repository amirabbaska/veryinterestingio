			<div class="markdown"><p>Animals won't get high from eating cannabis flower. THC is not made until you break off the acid from THCA, which occurs well above 200 degrees. Also, the other cannabinoids are extremely beneficial from a medical standpoint. All that suggests that cannabis wants to be eaten and probably benefits in some way (like spreading seeds).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wild cannabis doesn't produce very much THCA compared to the stuff people smoke to get high. Plus, THCA can be beneficial for animals (though less so than the other cannabinoids). It might be that the benefits of all the terpenes and cannabinoids combined are the reason for THCA production.</p></div>		</li>
