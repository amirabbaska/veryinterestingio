<p>To answer the prompt, there is a little bit of unpacking required.
Calcium doesn't &quot;make&quot; bones, exactly. Bones are gradually ossified from the much more malleable hyaline cartilage precursor: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Bone_growth.png" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Bone_growth.png</a></p>
<p>In this image you see that the structure gathers calcium from the epiphyseal plates which ossify outwardly; when a human bone is discovered, the length of the bone and the advancement of ossification of the plate is how we determine the age of the bone, at time of death. </p>
<p>Calcium, more specifically than u/I_AM_YOUR_MOTHERR stated, is required for all muscle functions of course including heartbeat. This is because calcium is required in the release of muscle tonicity. This is why the heart can only be <em>so</em> fast; there is an ultimate threshold in which, if the heart is required to beat faster than calcium can be delivered to the fibers to make them release, so they can engage again, the heart will fail. </p>
<p>Yes, bones are comprised of calcium. But, they are not &quot;calcified.&quot; Bones are a mixture of calcium in connective tissues, as well as a lot of blood vessels to deliver calcium and other minerals. There are nervous receptors in bones that will detect regular additional stress exerted on each bone. Think of a tennis player -- their serving arm will have much more dense bone because it is used more. This is called bone reformation. There is a very long hormonal pathway that leads to the deposit of, or release of calcium in bones. </p>
<p>Just know that if the chemoreceptors throughout the body, and ultimately in the brain, detect low blood calcium, your body will take calcium from your bones. So, your bones don't only support your body structure, they are calcium banks to ensure your muscles and your nervous system functions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's inaccurate to say &quot;you get plenty of calcium from the food you eat and the water you drink.&quot; This would depend largely on the individual's daily dietary intake. Dairy sources typically contain about 2-3 times the amount of calcium than vegetable sources (such as collard greens, spinach, and kale). Hard tap water contains around 20-30 mg of calcium in 8 ounces, whereas an 8 oz glass of milk contains approximately 300 mg. That glass of milk provides roughly 25-30% of the RDA for calcium (which is dependent on age, but is 1000-1200 mg/day for the majority of the population). Orange juice that is fortified is comparable in calcium content to milk by volume, but a piece of citrus fruit contains only about 20-30 mg. Cereal is also a poor source on calcium, unless accompanied by milk.  A cup of beans contains about 130 mg of calcium. Some fish do contain ample amounts of calcium, but often only if canned with bones, such as sardines, salmon, anchovies. And as someone else pointed out, scurvy is a vitamin C deficiency.  </p></div>		</li>
