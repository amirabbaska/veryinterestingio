			<div class="markdown"><p>My pleasure :) A lot of myths around breath-hold, it mostly boils down to the fact that there is a difference between the urge to breathe and the need to breathe.</p>
<p>The urge to breathe comes (mostly) from CO2, the need to breathe comes from low O2. Until people have done some training it's hard to figure out which is which.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly think this gets at the heart of the question better than my answer, but with a week old account I was really surprised to get off work and find I went from ~30 karma to almost 700 so I'm not going to complain too much, you get my up vote though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any current guess as to the evolutionary benefit for blacking out when low on oxygen? I understand that it saves oxygen. But when would our ancestors have been low on oxygen when not swimming? There would have to have been scenarios in which they passed out and it saved them/improved there evolutionary fitness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd guess that this is the same feinting response as for (probably much more common) scenario of blood loss; if you don't have enough oxygen for the brain, then a reasonable response to such a catastrophic event requires (a) to conserve oxygen by ceasing all non-mandatory activities and (b) move the body to a position where most of (remaining) blood is available for your brain, i.e. definitely not upright.</p>
<p>In an essence this is the emergency override order of &quot;LIE DOWN AND REST, RIGHT NOW!!! You may think that you have reserves, but you really don't!&quot;.  In a similar situation if you were being helped by someone, they'd force you to keep lying down and not moving; they'd also lift up your legs and/or the wounded part but that's not so achievable by hardcoded reflexes and fainting does most of it already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something doesn't have to be evolutionary beneficial for it to be present. Evolution doesn't lead to perfect creatures. Blacking out is just a side effect of the limitations of our oxygen reliance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blacking out to 'save' oxygen seems to be a feature of terrestrial mammals. Whales and dolphins do not black out from hypoxia; they remain conscious and swimming through to brain damage. There are some guesses in the scientific literature as to why this is but no good/well studied answers (yet).</p></div>		</li>
