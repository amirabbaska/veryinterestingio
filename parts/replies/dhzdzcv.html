			<div class="markdown"><p>i also work in internet advertising.</p>
<p>most people hate being sold to. i have a theory that the smarter a person is, the more likely they are to simply avoid advertising altogether (adblock etc).</p>
<p>people like feeling like they made the decision on their own. they seek advice from people they know and people they think are authoritative, and if something even smells remotely like a 'paid shill' they'll completely discount it.</p>
<p>these people are shit leads and i simply don't waste my ad spend on them. </p>
<p>i like facebook because it only really shows ads to people who are likely to care (especially when optimizing for conversions).</p>
<p>(i still like adwords better, due to predictive intent through keywords; but they're different platforms)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you serious that Reddit users are actually hard to advertise to, or are you just being flattering? Who makes these rules about &quot;aren't allowed to be used on Reddit because backlash&quot;?</p>
<p>Recently deactivated Facebook because it's such an echo chamber. Reddit can be too, but at least it's a smarter one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure ask me anything. I don't think reddit has an official list of advertising practices they don't allow (other than the usual things no one allows) but I've submitted ads before that do incredibly well on Facebook but were rejected by Reddit because the users hate them. One example are &quot;Free + Shipping&quot; ads that work wonderfully on Facebook but reddit rejected because the users hate them. But free + shipping is my most successful ad type on Facebook. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the hardest thing you had to advertise?</p>
<p>What are the most successful kinds of ads?</p>
<p>What are some examples of ads that you thought would do well and don't, and what are some that you're like, &quot;I can't believe this worked on people&quot;?</p>
<p>What kind of people/companies hire you to pitch their wares?</p>
<p>EDIT to add: How is the TV consumer base different from working in internet ads? How are each of the user bases you've worked with (Facebook, Reddit...whatever other sites you work with) different from each other?</p></div>		</li>

<p>They didn't reject them a few months ago.  In fact I re-activated my ad-blocker on Reddit because I was seeing so many of them while I was here.</p>
<p>Maybe it's safe to turn it off here again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My 2 cents: from what I saw in the two months that I'm watching Reddit (disclaimer: app, once a day, so I generally only see high-rated posts), the average user seems quite intelligent and down to earth, probably two factors that make for seeing through the message easier.</p></div>		</li>
