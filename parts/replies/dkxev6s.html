			<div class="markdown"><p>Simply put: We don't know for sure but it's a lot lower than 500.</p>
<p>The nuclear limit is where the binding energy cannot hold any more nucleons together, not even momentarily as an unstable nucleus. Instead protons and neutrons will simply 'drip' off at the same rate they're added. I've heard estimates that this limit is somewhere in the 137 to 179 range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that for a spherical nucleus (lowest energy state geometric configuration) is 184 in regards to neutrons. The highest number for protons would be 126, which would result in unbihexion-310. There was an attempt to create this element at CERN in the 70s and it produced evidence that it may have happened but equipment then wasn't able to make the determination.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Lead-208 is the heaviest stable isotope.</p></div>		</li>

Moscovium (element 115) seems to be the last element with a half life of over one second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any concrete reason to believe in the island of stability or is it more of a 'it would be neat, and not impossible, for this to happen' sort of thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Though they are called &quot;magic numbers&quot;, there is a very real and valid science behind it and it a cornerstone in the fundamentals of chemistry and physics. The Island of Stability is a theorized extension of known traits.</p>
<p>We are familiar with the fact that electron shells prefer to have 8 to &quot;satisfy&quot; that particular shell, right? Well, nucleons have their own numbered preferences (nuclear shell model) which are known as &quot;magic numbers&quot;. The highest preferred number (theoretically) for protons is 126 and the highest preferred number for neutrons is 184.</p>
<p>The prediction here is that there is a unique stability at certain nuclear sizes that doesn't match adjacent configurations. For example, super heavy isotopes just below the magic number would have half-lives in the microseconds but once a magic number was reached, the half-life would jump exponentially. Coinciding with increased stability would be much lower binding energies. However, the theory has internal consistency but there is no experimental evidence to confirm as it stands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't it possibly be that they get exponentially larger to where the islands of stability even could be represented by say a neutron star. Just points where the energies of subatomic particles have seemingly stable orbit that isn't in any major reconfiguration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not alone. I mean, what I'm getting at is hypothetically during some massive cosmic event there could be more elements for a split nanosecond than we could ever synthesize.</p>
<p>I know it's not really useful, but the thought <em>is</em> cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there are any stable ones, stars probably cannot produce them in a supernova, or if they can, it is so uncommon that we have not found any yet. In any case, I doubt we'll be running into a stable element above 118 unless they're a ridiculously high atomic number.</p></div>		</li>
