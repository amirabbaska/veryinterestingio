			<div class="markdown"><p>Would note that of all the Attitude Control systems you mentioned, all of them work in tandem to produce highly accurate navigation and orientation control.  Periodic ground ephemeris updates also help.  </p>
<p>One not mentioned, but can work is basic ranging when in contact with a ground based antenna.  It's much coarser, but still effective if your ephemeris ever diverges to the point you can't pinpoint where it is.  To the original question, a system of Deep Space Nodes that emit a signal similar to the L1/L2 of GPS could do so in a way that could aid in navigation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a software limit that receivers sold to the public are legally required to contain. The signals provide all the information you need to navigate under orbital conditions if you can get the government approvals to build an unrestricted receiver. Most likely, the process involves disclosing enough details about your spacecraft design, mission design, and workflow to prove that you're not building a weapon and you can keep good enough control of your components that nobody will use them outside the approved project.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're working as a US company, and/or want to abide by US federal laws, then to bypass this restriction you have to either A.) work with a company that has the necessary waivers/paperwork from the US government to build/sell them without restrictions, or B.) get the waivers/paperwork done yourself. Either way, you have to prove your peaceful intent for the GPS receiver. </p></div>		</li>
