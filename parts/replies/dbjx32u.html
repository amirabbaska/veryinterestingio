			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a famous philosophical problem of qualia -- is the red that I see the same that you see? I believe there's an answer to this in science and I think it has to do with the spectrum and which colors have peak sensitivity and range. It wouldn't make sense for our ancestors to perceive  all different kinds of colors while they're hunting in the bush.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's what the question is asking; it's not whether humans eyes are generally sensitive to the same kinds of light as one another.  It's whether we <em>experience</em> these colours in the same ways - most people i.e. not colourblind can see red, but does it look the <em>same</em> to different people?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Qualia means more than that though. What if the red I see is actually purple in your brain? It's called the Inverted Spectrum argument.  There's no way I could describe red to a blind-from-birth person. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why women (who were  traditionally hunter gathers,  so I've always been told) generally are better at perceiving and naming more nuanced shades of the same color than men are? </p></div>		</li>
