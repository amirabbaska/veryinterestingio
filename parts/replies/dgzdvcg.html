			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're in an environment that needs cooling in the summer and heating in the winter that's a source of inefficiency. While using waste heat is a good use of waste, the simple fact that you need to use it means you're inefficient. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally efficiency is defined as (work done)/(energy in) * 100%. </p>
<p>If the goal is just to make heat then you would do (heat output)/(energy in) * 100%. Some of the energy is going to be converted to sound, light, etc. in any heater I can think of, especially in a laptop.</p>
<p>In this specific case, the waste from some other device is reducing the demand on a specialized heater, which from a technical standpoint doesn't mean 100% efficiency, but from a layman's viewpoint probably does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a poor response. Though all you said is true, OPs insight goes deeper than that. Conservation of energy, and the reasonable assumption that 99.9999% of the energy in an appliance eventually is disposed as heat, means you can heat your house to 68.0000F using an electric space heater, or heat your house to 68.0000F by using your computer, running your fridge, and microwaving some spaghettios. The insight is that scenario A and scenario B would have precisely equal electric bills down to the cent. So, essentially, you're running your appliances for free, and if you define efficiency (which you can) as (net benefit)/(net cost), you have infinity, which is the best you can get, or perfect. The takeaway is that it's pointless to turn your lights and computer off in the winter if you're just going to use the same amount of electricity to keep your house warm anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While what you said is true you are ignoring heat pumps which are able to outperform heating elements by 3-4 times. As you move further north to where heatpumps and no longer able to function efficiently gas becomes the primary form of heating. Gas follows the same thermodynamics of a heating element but is generally cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biff, pow, hurt, ouch. </p>
<p>Let us assume that all the energy is converted to heat. That being so if I were cold I would still rather sit next to a radiator than next to a PC that has some hot internal components but remains cool on the outside. Given an infinite amount of time the processes of conduction, convection and radiation will cause the heat distribute evenly throughout the room but on the timeframe of a day this will not be the case.  My advice would be to turn off all extraneous appliances and turn on a heater that has been designed to maximise heat transfer to the air by convection and the skin by radiation. Ideally one would just heat the air and not all the objects within the room.</p>
<p>Fun fact: many years ago a couple of German scientists hit upon the idea of using low intensity microvave radiation to heat  the skin directly. This would avoid putting energy into heating the air. For some reason the idea never caught on. </p></div>		</li>
