			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, this is why major hospitals will often have two types of anti-venom on hand. Typically horse and sheep anti-venom. If you're bitten by a venomous critter and get the anti-venom, you are actually kinda &quot;immune&quot; to the anti-venom. Your body makes antibodies against the animal antibodies used to fight the venom. So should you have a repeat accident within a few months, you will likely need the other type of anti-venom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the “horse” antivenin is the Wyeth polyvalent and isn’t made anymore. The stuff expired years ago, however the FDA extends the expiration date yearly. The stuff is basically lyophalized horse serum with minimal purification. The “sheep” antivenin is Crofab and is a more modern antivenin with much more sophisticated purification. The Wyeth stuff is hard to use and has far more adverse effects. </p>
<p>Assuming a hospital even has any Wyeth polyvalent left, it would be reserved for non-North American snakes. Crofab is made with venom from only North American snakes. While there is likely some cross reactivity, it is assumed that the Wyeth works better for South American snakes, since two of the venoms used are from South of the border. </p>
<p>If someone previously received Crofab and was bitten again, (besides slapping them up side the head for being an idiot) I’d still use Crofab and just deal with an allergic reaction. The risks of using Wyeth is too high. </p>
<p>When Bioclon’s Antivipmyn is finally FDA approved, we will probably let our Crofab expire and finally toss the last couple vials of Wyeth. We’ll only stock the one polyvalent product. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I unfortunately learned all of this when my then 4 year old son was bitten by a fer de lance (Bothrops) in Mexico a few years ago.  We were ready to air vac him to Miami when the docs there convinced us that we were better off staying in Mexico where we had access to antivipmyn.  It all turned out fine but it was a hell of a ride.  I kept one of the vials initially just to have a record of what was administered but now I have it as a keepsake of what saved his life.  We were able to get to a dinky public clinic in a tiny rural town that stocked the antivenin and had it started within half an hour of the bite.  It had its own problems as you can imagine, but those 5 flasks were enough to stabilize him so we could get to the city 2 hours away.  He ended up needing a second round of antivipmyn and spent a few days in intensive care, but he came through it all wonderfully.
Oh and the bill from the rural clinic? It would have been completely free if we were citizens, but instead I had to pay for the ER visit and medicines.  It was less than 10 bucks. Never want to do it again but the best money I ever spent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crofab has actually been blocking the availiability of bioclon’s antivenom in the US since 2011. Crofab used to be one of the only antivenom treatments availiable in the US. This is why snakebite treatments often exceeded six figures. Their assertion was that the Mexican drug maker was ripping off their proprietary processes by simply using a different animal. </p>
<p>The costs of bringing the new antivenom to the US market have been great for Bioclon. So much so that the price of antivenom in Mexico have risen. </p>
<p>Another case of pharma gred leading to loss of human life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Science uses mice, rats, rabbits, goats, guinea pigs, donkeys and horses to generate antisera for all kinds of applications. Not sure which they would use for this particular one, but a quick look says that it may be a large animal, like a horse, where you can get larger quanities of blood without killing the animal.
This process works well for snek venoms because the toxic bits in the venoms are proteins, which are usually quite good at stimulating an immune response (and thereby generating antibodies). Venoms are by definition injected into the blood supply where they will encounter lots of circulating antibodies.
In contrast, toxins can be anything including small molecules, which are much less immunogenic, and are by definition injested or otherwise absorbed, making it more difficult for your immune system to neutralise them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They're not uber deadly poisonous to adults, but they keep it on hand mostly in case a kid gets stung.   Which is likely since the little  fuckers like to crawl onto the ceiling and drop down into cribs.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: Just looked, and I guess they stopped making it in the mid 2000's.</strong></p></div>		</li>
