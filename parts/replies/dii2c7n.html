			<div class="markdown"><p>Portuguese itself is a counterexample, as the vast majority of European countries do not use -ese. The only other I remember off hand is Maltese, from the island of Malta. </p>
<p>An even more unusual one is Manx, from the isle of Man. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of Italian states of the past used the -ese suffix, like Genoese, Turinese, Milanese etc., and the modern cities use these still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But in Portuguese we do not write our Nationality like that, it's written Português/a (men/women), which does not sound the same as Portuguese, we also write: Inglês/a (English), Francês/a (French), Holandês/a (Dutch), Japonês/a (Japanese), Chinês/a (Chinese) (can't think of more right now). In French English is written Anglais, while Portuguese is Portugais... In Spanish is written in a similar way to Portuguese... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: I'm saying that the word &quot;Portuguese&quot; in the English language is a counterexample to the idea that the suffix -ese is reserved for Asian countries. Not that the Portuguese language uses -ese heavily. </p>
<p>I know that some languages are more consistent about this, but the original question is about the English language. </p>
<p>As far as I understand, German is very consistent about using -isch, with much fewer exceptions than English uses.  </p></div>		</li>
