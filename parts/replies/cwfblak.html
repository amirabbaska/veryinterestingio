			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, it establishes channels where companies are required to report computer security breaches to the government, since there's evidence that some of it is state actors. The issue is with data associated with breaches.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the bill would require companies share information related to security breaches with the government. Companies are supposed to filter out any data that may be private, but it exempts them from liability if they share private data without prior knowledge that it was there. There's a clause, &quot;Notwithstanding any other provision of law,&quot; which, combined with the exemption for sharing data without removing private information, has privacy proponents worried. The implication is that if HIPAA (or some other privacy law) were broken &quot;by accident,&quot; the company wouldn't be liable for giving the government the data. Wired has a good piece on it. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a 10 sentence summary of the wired article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the Senate Intelligence Committee passed the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act by a vote of 14 to 1, committee chairman Senator Richard Burr argued that it successfully balanced security and privacy.</p>
<p>The bill, as worded, lets a private company share with the Department of Homeland Security any information construed as a cybersecurity threat &quot;Notwithstanding any other provision of law.&quot; That means CISA trumps privacy laws like the Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986 and the Privacy Act of 1974, which restrict eavesdropping and sharing of users' communications.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to his website yesterday, Senator Burr wrote that &quot;Information sharing is purely voluntary and companies can only share cyber-threat information and the government may only use shared data for cybersecurity purposes.&quot; But in fact, the bill's data sharing isn't limited to cybersecurity &quot;Threat indicators&quot;-warnings of incoming hacker attacks, which is the central data CISA is meant to disseminate among companies and three-letter agencies.</p>
<p>OTI's Greene says it also gives companies a mandate to share with the government any data related to imminent terrorist attacks, weapons of mass destruction, or even other information related to violent crimes like robbery and carjacking.</p>
<p>He points to the language in the bill that calls on companies to &quot;To assess whether [a] cyber threat indicator contains any information that the entity knows at the time of sharing to be personal information of or identifying a specific person not directly related to a cybersecurity threat and remove such information.&quot;</p>
<p>Cato's Sanchez argues that many companies seeking CISA's security benefits will take the path of least resistance and share more data rather than less, without comprehensively filtering it of all personal information.</p>
<p>Robert Graham, a security researcher and an early inventor of intrusion prevention systems, says CISA will lead to sharing of more false positives than real threat information.</p>
<p>&quot;If we had seen the information from the Sony hackers ahead of time, we still wouldn't have been able to pick it out from the other information we were getting,&quot; Graham says, in reference to the epic hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment late last year.</p>
<p>Graham points to the more informal information sharing that already occurs in the private sector thanks to companies that manage the security large client bases.</p>
<p>&quot;Companies like IBM and Dell SecureWorks already have massive 'cybersecurity information sharing' systems where they hoover up large quantities of threat information from their customers,&quot; Graham wrote in a blog post Wednesday.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>tl;dr: CISA is instructions and funding for the Director of National Security to set up channels through which companies can share cybersecurity intelligence. This is important because modern security is driven through intelligence data.</p>
<p>Full Post:</p>
<p>I've worked with similar things before - specifically the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/files/documents/cyber/Defense%20Security%20Information%20Exchange%20-%20DSIE%20summary%20-%20William%20Ennis.pdf" target="_blank">Defense Security Information Exchange</a> (pdf). I worked as an analyst for a company that participates in DSIE, so let me try to explain what the <em>goal</em> of the bill is, from a cybersecurity standpoint.</p>
<p>Basically the professional cybersecurity world has been changing a lot in the last decade. The vast majority of major companies in the defense industry (Lockheed, iRobot, GE, Raytheon) and the financial sector (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, GE again) as well as the tech giants (Google, Facebook, Amazon) aren't being targeted by the classic hackers like Kevin Mitnick or Zer0Cool or anything like that. They're being targeted by nation-states - essentially the Chinese, Iranian, North Korean, and Russian equivalents of the NSA and US Cyber Command. You can see evidence of that with the news last year that <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor" target="_blank">the US indicted five Chinese hackers</a>. China never admitted it, but the accusation included that they were associated with the Chinese military. These nation states essentially use the same attacks against <em>a lot</em> of companies. They frequently fire identical attacks at many companies across an industry, possibly even spreading to other industries.</p>
<p>The security world changed even more so when Lockheed Martin published their seminal white paper, <a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf" target="_blank">Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense
Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and
Intrusion Kill Chains</a> (pdf). This introduced the idea of basically utilizing Big Data to mitigate threats. Through a number of tools, companies can utilize massive databases to build networks that identify threats and stop them from being acted upon.</p>
<p>This goes against the security model that people had been using for years which was the 'fix this vulnerability' essentially. The problem is that this is incredibly difficult to do in practice when you have code bases as large as Google and as much legacy software as BoA. It is simply impractical to actually patch every possible vulnerability. And even then, as the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/eff-strongly-oppose-cisa-cyber-surveillance-bill-and-cfaa-amendment" target="_blank">EFF even points out</a>, many security exploits happen through exploiting <em>people</em>.</p>
<p>So the new method is that companies see an attack, stop it, add it to their intelligence database, and never deal with it again (ideally...). The problem arises where Facebook might see an attack, figure out how to identify it before it is used again but then BoA will get the same attack, not identify it, and then your financial records get leaked. Which, theoretically, could have been stopped had Facebook simply told BoA of their findings.</p>
<h3>So what is CISPA/CISA?</h3>
<p>CISA, and CISPA before it, are basically instructions to the Director of National Security to set up channels for which companies can share this intelligence data. One argument in favor of this is that things like the Target hack, Sony hack, and others could have been avoided had the companies had access to other companies' intelligence databases. For some of these hacks, I am inclined to believe they <em>could</em> have been avoided, but that is neither here nor there. </p>
<p>Participating in the intelligence network would still be completely optional for companies though so they have a lot of concern with sharing the data with each other - specifically in the event a data dump sent from Facebook to Raytheon might contain something like my job history and current location (without my name or anything else though). To be completely honest - that is still totally identifying information as I am probably the only person in my particular area with my rather unique job history. So CISA grants certain levels of immunity to Facebook in the event something like that does go to Raytheon, which lessens the fear of sharing that data, thus increasing the amount of shared data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you very much. That was both informative and objective.</p>
<p>So, the privacy concern is that Raytheon may have the data you've given Facebook as a piece of the data dump they provided?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not explicitly. </p>
<p>Basically the bill grants those immunities to 'cybersecurity providers' (think McAfee or FireEye) and 'self-protected entities' (Google, Facebook, and others). EFF thinks they've found a loophole in here where the government can be considered a self-protected entity. In fact, that isn't a loophole at all, but a very intentional inclusion. The government is 100% a self-protected entity through the NSA, FBI, Cyber Com, and others. The government is under the same, if not more, fire than any other organization and can benefit just as much from the intelligence gathered (and also many other companies could benefit from the incredible databases that those agencies have gathered).</p>
<p>Many people are concerned that this will lead to the government strong arming companies into sending them non-security information &quot;or else.&quot; </p>
<p>This is pretty Orwellian in practice and, in my opinion, the result of too many movies where the government is portrayed as much more competent than they actually are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bill would set up a more clear-cut dialogue between the federal government and other companies, corporations, etc. The companies would supply the federal government with their data. The government claims that this would greatly increase national security (though, this is yet to be proven). The recent (and previous) actions of the government concerning bulk data collection have been met with concern from the people, so bringing it into written law may be an attempt to justify their actions.</p>
<p>The downside to this bill being signed into law is that you will lose the rest of the control you have with your personal data. Things like your emails, contacts, etc. may be something that the federal government would request.</p>
<p>The real issue here is the incredible bulk collection of data. It really comes down to giving the government the ability to snoop on anyone at anytime without a warrant if they want to. Some will make the claim that you shouldn't be worried if you have nothing to hide. Others retort that it goes against our very rights to privacy (an example being that you would be worried if your mail was always read by someone whom you don't know).</p>
