<p>Is this equivalent to saying that all information associated with the volumetric space exists only on its surface? And thus the inner region of the volumetric space can be properly described as an information-free zone? (If so, what does that imply for measuring the entropy of the interior?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be careful using phrases like &quot;exists only on the surface&quot;.  The holographic principle only says the information contained in the sphere's volume is equivalent to the information contained at its surface.  It makes no prediction about where the information truly exists.  This is the same type of equivalency principle Einstein uses to explain velocity, and that being stationary with an object flying past you at speed X is equivalent to flying at speed X past a stationary object.  Einstein doesn't say who is stationary and who is moving, and his equivalence principle says they're the same thing.  So your question of whether information is at the surface or in its volume is not valid, they're the same thing.</p>
<p>That said, the holographic principle isn't an interpretation or philosophy, because it does make predictions and is falsifiable.  The non-holographic principle predicts that maximal information density of a volume is its Planck cubed volume, while the holographic principle predicts maximal information density of a volume is its Planck squared surface area.  These are vastly different.  Imagine a 10x10x10 meter cube.  That's 1,000 cubic meters.  If the Planck length was 1 meter, you'd be able to store 1000 bits of information.  Or so you think.  The holographic principle says the information of that cube is equivalent to the information at its surface, which is only 600 meters squared, or a maximum of 600 bits of information.  If you can show a cube exceeding that information density, you've proven the holographic principle false.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why is the assumption that the the surface contains a projection of the volume, rather than assuming that the surface contains information about the zero-dimensional singularity, and that the question of the character of the volume inside the Schwartzchild (apart from the singularity) is nonsensical, akin to &quot;what was before time&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't know much about the physics inside the Schwarzschild radius, but the holographic principle is agnostic to that.  A sphere can carry information prior to collapsing into a black hole, and assuming that information is not destroyed, the new sphere, defined by its Schwarzschild radius, carries the same information.  The surface area of this new sphere has to contain the information of the volume of the old sphere.  Both definitions are well defined since neither looks inside the event horizon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deleting a hard drive may make it <em>effectively</em> impossible to recover data, but the universe will still be slightly different in some way depending on whether there was a 0 or 1 there. It's one of the basic laws of quantum mechanics that different states remain different even after time passes, the technical term is unitary time evolution. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2014/04/is-information-fundamental/" target="_blank">this article</a> to answer your question - scroll down to the paragraph &quot;<em>Physicists describe entropy a little differently...</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>From there you will see that when you change the <em>structure</em> of something - be it a computer program, a text, a building - information isn't destroyed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>information is encoded on matter or through light, electricity, magnetic alignments, etc. Deleting a hard drive is just changing it's structure. It is just another addendum to conservation of energy. Information in some forms of thermodynamics is the idea that information is equivalent to energy. It displays quite a few similar properties to it including entropy. </p></div>		</li>
