			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how to eli5 this, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a mathematical operation called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform" target="_blank">Fourier Transform</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Fourier transform takes an arbitrary function and represents it as a sum of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Sine.html" target="_blank">sines</a> and cosines with different frequencies and phases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you record the voice of someone or any sound in general and calculate the Fourier transform, you will see that it has sines and cosines of several hundreds of kHz. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, if you &quot;delete&quot; all those sines and cosines with frequency &gt; 20kHz it won't make any difference for a person hearing it, as we know by experimentation that people can only hear up to roughtly 20kHz. (Varies from one individual to another, I made this experiment once and could only hear up to 17-18kHz)</p>
</li>
<li>If you keep deleting the frequencies of the voice of a person up to 3~4 Khz, you will still understand what the person is saying, although the record quality will be worse.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some caveats on this explanation such as the process of deleting frequencies being a bit more involved, but that's pretty much it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does cave eating lead to FFTs? What's the joke here I'm not getting it. Are you serious that signals can exist using nothing but maths? I thought that electrons made signals? How are we getting people to do that much maths ethically? Anyways, actual electrons leak a bit of warmth so it'd sound better anyways, I think.</p>
<p>I also don't understand how you can just get out the 'above 20,000 hertz/second' using just maths- won't that involve an infinity subtraction? Like, you can just divide the hertz up as narrow as you wish, so there's infinitely many math's you're going to have to do if you want to get out all the soon wave from the signal? Someone told me it has to do with a nyquil limit of your sampler, but I tried feeding my sampler a lot a lot of nyquil and it's still mainly fine.</p>
<p>And, does this transformation have anything to do with the great pacific gyre and it's slow transformation of the ocean into a garbage patch? Fourier told me that something to this effect was going to happen before I went to sleep; though he said it in the most Charles of Charles way, that involved excreta. Why does this have anything to do with soons and cosey soons?</p>
<p>I guess soon has a really narrow bed and that's why it's not cosy until it's shifted 90 degrees?</p>
<p>I don't quite understand why they are any different, really. Anyways, why exactly did we name it after Fourier when Four-ey-eh himself wasn't even the one who invented the magic which translates time to frequency at a reasonably rapid tempo? Why is it called a ffrt? I feel like some people got gypsied out of their deserved credit, they just got trolled with their names being assembled into a fart sound. I don't think we even shipped the credits out to Four-ey-eh.</p>
<p>Apparently he killed himself with aging due to his revolutionary survivor's guilt, or something or the other.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of variation in people.  I worked with technicians who could pick up a dsl line and correctly identify whether or not data was flowing back and forth (I had to use a test set to see if the line had a two-way flow of data).</p>
<p>And regarding variation in human voices, some manufacturers of proprietary pair gain systems claimed that their systems were vulnerable to a phenomenon called &quot;talk-off,&quot; in which certain angry women with shrill voices could simultaneously raise their voices and speak more quickly and cause the pair gain cabinet to drop all the calls it was carrying.</p></div>		</li>
