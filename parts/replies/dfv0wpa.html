However a 911 call connects to the closest mast, no matter who owns it or what service you must have, so you should always be able to call no matter where you are.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If the signal is less than what would represent 1 bar on the phone's display, the phone won't try a call because it knows that it's likely to fail/cause a bad experience for you. For 911 though that rule does not apply. Your phone could have 1 of 10th of 1 bar worth of signal, and it will still try and call 911.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it even goes a bit beyond that: if a weak 911 call (or other emergency number in other countries, i.e. 112 in europo) is received the sender station will boost its sending capacity to maximum and might even shift other calls down in priority or even drop them entirely to make space for your 911 call.</p>
<p>So even if you are in an area where your phone, even one with a carrier, tells you &quot;no reception&quot; you should still try to use it in an emergency, it might be it surprisingly starts to work. </p>
<hr />
<p>Note two things: Due to abuse some countries (mostly in europe) <em>do</em> demand an active SIM in the phone; they do cross-carrier roaming here and connect you to the strongest ones, not only the one your SIM works for. The second issue is that priorisation might not work for other emergency-numers. I.e. in germany it works for the fire/medical emergency call 112, but not for the police-call 110 (if you really need to, you'll probably get the nice 112-people to also notify the police). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just FCC regulations, by the way.  I know not all phones in the US are GSM (or LTE, which is derived from GSM), but it's part of the GSM standard for phones to be able to dial 112 without being unlocked or even having a SIM card.  This is generally implemented in such a way that the local &quot;normal&quot; emergency number gets the same treatment - though 112 usually just redirects to it anyway.</p>
<p>For this reason 112 is <em>particularly</em> worth knowing about, because it's practically guaranteed to work in any country where GSM phones are common, and you don't have to learn about 999 for the UK, and 911 for the US, and 000 for Australia, and about six different numbers in India, and, and, and....  But I digress.</p></div>		</li>
