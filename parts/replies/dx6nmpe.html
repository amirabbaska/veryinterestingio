			<div class="markdown"><p>I would disagree with this. Both ectotherms and endotherms are found throughout all regions of the globe.  And even though venom production is metabolically costly, that fact does not influence a different evolutionary process between ecto- and endotherms.  Other evolutionary factors are at play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vast majority of ectotherms are found in warmer climates, the ones found in colder climates are typically invertebrates. </p>
<p>I'm curious how you think a metabolically expensive process which provides little benefit to the colder climate ectotherms wouldn't affect their evolution? And could you suggest some alternative evolutionary factors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe we're talking past each other a little here.  I was talking about animals as a whole, are you specifically talking about vertebrates?  </p>
<p>As far as energy costs, my point is that metabolically costly traits (like venom production) are costly whether you're an endotherm or ectotherm.  Venom evolution is complicated (see Casewell et al. 2013 above), and ability to regulate your internal temperature is not particularly related to its evolution.  Also, ANY trait that provides little benefit will not be passed on, regardless of whether it's an endo/ectotherm.  It's true that there are fewer venomous endotherms (birds, mammals, some fishes) than ectotherms (all other life), but the trends governing venom evolution (or lack thereof) in mammals and birds are complicated, multi-faceted, and different for different groups.  There's a good discussion of that topic here: <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-so-many-venomous-insects-and-reptiles-and-yet-so-few-venomous-mammals-and-birds" target="_blank">https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-so-many-venomous-insects-and-reptiles-and-yet-so-few-venomous-mammals-and-birds</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! It refers to the fact that endotherms produce heat &quot;within&quot; while ectotherms match the &quot;outside&quot; temperature </p></div>		</li>
