			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally your hot coffee will be ~70 degrees C hotter than room temperature to start, assuming it was close to boiling. The milk will be ~20 degrees colder than room temperature if it's close to freezing. The difference in coffee temperature will be more significant than the difference in milk temperature.</p>
<p>And that's only if you take the milk out of the fridge before combining them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how close both are to room temperature. Lets say we assume that room temp is 24C, the milk is 4C, and the coffee is 85C. The temperature difference between the coffee and air is a lot more than the temperature difference between the milk and air. As long as the mass of the milk is less than or equal to the mass of the coffee (and the surface areas are proportionally similar), the coffee will still lose heat quicker than the milk gains it. I will also add that the coffee will create natural convection over its surface, and the milk will probably not (if they are both in cups).</p>
<p>This leads to the point that the types of containers they are in will make a difference. Because the heat transfer equation takes surface area into account. Milk in a very thin layer on a saucer may have more heat flux than coffee in an insulated sphere.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons that the closed system was proposed in the top comment. The question in and of itself doesn't have enough information to answer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're being pedantic.  Yes, there are probably situations where this isn't true, but you can tweak the parameters of almost any situation to make the common case no longer apply.  The scenario is more to illustrate an unintuitive property of thermodynamics and how it applies to your everyday life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I agree that it's perhaps pedantic, I just (personally) hate these questions.  College professors and standardized tests are fans of putting specific situations in to questions and then pretending that they're (edited) generalizations.  </p>
<p>I know it can be more confusing but I'm a fan of adding the disclaimers that make the point clear, that's all.</p>
<p>If I'm being petty then forget it, I just dislike overly-broad examples that so often come up.  </p>
<p>Edit:  As one of the other posters mentioned about convection currents and some other advanced topics, I don't know that those are topics that someone without knowledge will wonder about.  </p>
<p>I do think that someone who is unfamiliar with the topic might actually ask my above question.    That's my only point, really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: Does heating work in a similar fashion as cooling? Example: In a controlled environment set at 60 degrees, if we have 2 buckets of water, one at 40 degrees and the other at 80 degrees. Will they reach 60 degrees at the same time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, someone might correct me, but I think this is right.</p>
<p>&quot;Heating&quot; and &quot;cooling&quot; aren't that different. It's just energy being transferred to reach equilibrium.</p>
<p>In your example, energy (heat) is leaving the warm bucket of water until the air and the water are equal temperatures. The cold bucket is just taking energy from the air until it is also the same temperature.</p>
<p>That's simplified, but it works.</p>
<p>So the question is: Which is faster, air-water transfer or water-air transfer.</p>
<p>I want to say the warm bucket would reach room temperature first, but I'm not sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hot water bucket will also lose heat from convection, while the cold bucket will develop an insulating layer of cold air over its surface and be insulated/protected from convection heat gain. So in your example the hot water bucket will reach ambient temperature first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to consider is specific heat. The amount of energy a unit of water can hold varies with temperature. So water at 80 degrees F will hold slightly more energy per unit water than 60 degrees F and even more than 40. So as the two buckets attempt to reach the same temperature, the 80 degree bucket has to dump out more energy to the environment than the 40. Just in case anyone was still wondering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of heat contained in the air is fairly low, since air is not nearly as dense as water. Also, the hot water will lose energy due to evaporation, and it's unlikely the cold bucket will gain much by condensation. So it's not quite symmetrical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of misconcepcions in these comments. There's really no notable difference between the two processes. They will reach the equilibrium at the same time.</p>
<p>When heat is transferred from either to the cold or from the hot bucket, heat resistance from the bucket is equal. (VERY small differences from density changes etc.) Convection will work the same way, but air will be moving down beside the cold bucket, and up beside the hot one. Water will also flow in different directions inside. If the bucket is open, water will evaporate from the hot bucket, and condense into the cold one, the first taking heat away and the latter bringing more in. This last process is actually the reason that the end temperature won't be 60 degrees, but I don't have time for that one right now.</p>
<p>EDIT: Other small differences include ground stopping airflow downwards, plus if the buckets are not full then cold air will stay in it more persistently. But overall the thermodynamic processes are exactly the same.</p></div>		</li>
