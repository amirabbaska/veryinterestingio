			<div class="markdown"><p>The Manchu Qing invaders didn't breach the wall.  The Ming dynasty has already been sacked by peasant revolt in a civil war, the capital fallen to the peasant armies, and the Ming emperor hung himself.  The peasant leaders killed the wall guarding general's father and taken his wife.  He got pissed and opened the wall's gate to let the Manchu through.  The Manchu basically walked in a chaotic China without central government and able to seize the moment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Emperor stole his girlfriend. This made him so mad, he opened the gates, and let the Manchus in. They stayed for 300 years.</p></div>		</li>
