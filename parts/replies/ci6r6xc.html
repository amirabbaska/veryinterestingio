			<div class="markdown"><p>What are commonly referred to as &quot;calories&quot; in the food industry are scientific kilo-calories (KCal). 1000 scientific calories (a unit of energy) are equal to one &quot;calorie&quot; that you will see referred to on the back of your Pringles tube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The error you have is capitalizing the c in calorie. One Calorie is equal to one kcal or one thousand calories. One kCal would be equal to one thousand Calories or one million calories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, Calories in the food industry are kcal. kCal would be one thousand food calories, and that is the clarification that /u/DeBryceIsRight wants to know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The intricacies of calorie vs Calorie are discussed below, but I believe he meant 1 kilocalorie (scientific)  or 1 Calorie (food). ~2000 is ballpark per day for what most people need. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>k means kilo, or thousands.  The number given in the linked paper is 290 kJ/kg (kilojoules per kilogram), which gives 31000 calories/pound, or 31 Cal/lb (Cal being dietary Calories, kcal, or thousands of little-c calories).  </p>
<p>So if you want to compare to the calories listed in food nutrition facts, that would be 31 Calories per day for each pound of fat.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's hard to provide a precise answer to; the reality is that you're always in constant flux, gaining and losing bits of everything, but your deficit influences where the balances end up.</p>
<p>A good approximation is that once you exceed your maximum fat metabolism (which is that roughly 30 kCal per pound of body fat per day), you're going to have to start pulling calories from lean tissue. Thus, if you're 180lbs at 20% body fat, you'd never want to try to have a bigger deficit than 1000 calories or so (1080) to avoid losing too much muscle, bone, organ and whatnot. Caloric estimates of all sorts of subject to a lot of error and variability, so going even &quot;safer&quot; from there (say, 600-700 calories) would be a better bet.</p></div>		</li>
