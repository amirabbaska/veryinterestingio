			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't get your hopes up. The hearing aid solution only works for an unfortunately small subset of sufferers.   I have a mutli-tonal version of tinitus that is, according to 3 doctors so far, only treatable with the bullshit &quot;acceptance therapy&quot;  mindful meditation and crap like that. </p>
<p>I  listen to A LOT of Brian Eno ambient music. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up your local audiologist (specialty doctor). There are different options available, to my knowledge, and they can help you select the most appropriate one. Make sure you're working with an Au.D., not just a hearing aid specialist or dispensary. Many ENT practices have an audiologist on staff, and you'll get the best <em>medical</em> advice in that setting. Some private practices and all hearing aid dispensaries tend to make their money on sales, so they are more incentivized to keep the doors open by selling you more than you might need.</p>
<p>You probably <em>do</em> have hearing loss, though, if you have tinnitus, so a hearing aid that's programmed to help combat tinnitus is probably the most appropriate option. But talk to your doctor. It's what they do, and nobody knows hearing disorders like an audiologist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a new way of treatment in experimentation where you pitch in the lab an external signal exactly to your sinitus tone. Then the carry on device will produce a sound signal around the central frequency in a specific way while you wear ear plugs all day and night.</p>
<p>You keep the earplugs on for some weeks and retrain the brain to ignore the central frequency. Results are promising.</p>
<p>Funny info: If you hear a tinnitus like tone the next day after partying it means you introduced permanent damage to your ear the last night.  Over the hours/day the brain will start to ignore it and everything seems normal to you</p>
<p>Funny fact 2: A car crash is super loud even though most people don't remember. Some cars have a system that give a very loud high pitched sound out which triggers a &quot;defence mechanicsm&quot; (something happening in the ossicles) of your ear resulting in little hearing loss due to the following crash and loud metal crashing and bending.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Either way, I hate this post. Because I am to the point after years That I can usually ignore my tinnitus to the point it's not too bad.</p>
<p>But, when it's brought up, I cant do anything but hear it. Takes me a bit to ignore again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor pedantic note: at least some cases of tinnitus are caused by actual, physical sound being generated in the person's head. This is known as<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus#Objective_tinnitus" target="_blank"> &quot;objective tinnitus&quot;</a> to contrast with purely neurological &quot;subjective tinnitus&quot;. The latter is vastly more common, however. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to share a house with a guy who had objective tinnitus.  If you stuck your ear right against his, you could hear a constant clicking.  It was quite weird, both because you could hear this clicking coming from his head and because you then realised you had your ear tightly pressed against his ear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For almost as long as I remember, I &quot;hear&quot; a clicking or popping noise every time I swallow. I typically drone it out, like my tinnitus, so it doesn't distract me as much. Now that I stop and focus on it, it feels weird. The tinnitus feels like a high pitched dog whistle frequency in my head at all times, whereas the clicking when i swallow sounds and feels physical. </p></div>		</li>
