			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the burning sensation actually comes from the alcohol interfering with the temperature sensors in the cell, making it trigger at normal body temperatures.  Not to say there is no additional damage but the sensation doesn't directly mean damage is happening. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I do, in fact, feel that burn. But I've always lived by the &quot;No pain, no gain&quot; motto.</p>
<p>I always assumed the loss of my teeth and gums after excessive Listerine use was the result of my body's natural redistribution of resources for optimal functioning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the problem with c-diff is that if there are dormant spores it is very hard to kill them if not impossible. the best solution to c-diff is to make it go dormant and repopulate the colon with good bacteria to prevent c-diff from overpopulating the colon</p></div>		</li>
