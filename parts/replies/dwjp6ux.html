No matter how many numbers you have observed, it is possible that the next number is the beginning of a repeat. Here I used a repeating pattern as an easy example, but any other predictable pattern would work as well.</p>
<p>The point is, new observations may change your interpretation of the system. You can never prove something is random, but you can observe that it appears to have been random <em>so far</em>.</p></div>		</li>
