<p>What that means is that a photon cannot take any energy value. It can only take multiples of Planck's Constant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't that frequency real-valued, though, meaning E can take any value, not just discrete ones?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is because each particle will have its own characteristic frequency.  So it's not that energy itself can only occur in discrete quantities, but any individual particle will only give off discrete quantities of energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here, we're talking about photons emitted by the transitions from an excited energy state to a lower energy state of an atom. Those transitions are specific for every atoms and unique, thus the energy of the photon emitted (its wavelength) will be unique.</p>
<p>This E=h*v equation shows that no, v cannot take any value but two consecutive values are just reaaaaallyyyyy close to each others (we're talking about Planck's length and Planck's time here which is quite small)</p>
<p>Long story short, Planck showed that matter are not continuous and that everything is a multiple of little packages</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the planck constant isn't a unit of energy.  Photons in general can have any amount of energy (not really, there's a maximum) but <em>light</em> of any specific frequency comes in quantized amounts, aka photons.</p></div>		</li>
