<p>Slight differences in expansion rates</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this mean the female mating piece will alwas expand more than the male mating piece, though? It seems possible the male piece could expand more than the female piece and then be stuck tighter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they have same coeff of linear expansion, then there was/is a gap between the two materials originally, like space between threads. If they all expand evenly, the gap distance will also expand and break the corrosion.  If the inner material expands more, it will crush the softer corrosion and also deform into outer material, when it cools there will be more gap.</p>
<p>But mostly the problem is corrosion &quot;welding&quot; materials together (usually galvanic, or wet rust vs powdered iron oxide). You can sometimes help the situation by hammering head of bolt and vibration will break things up, and tightening then loosening can help fir same reason. Heating may do same thing, in addition to expansion of metal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A bimetallic strip is a strip of metal made from two different strips of metal layered on top of each other.  When heated they expand at different rates, which causes the strip to bend.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you pull off the face plate on an analog one, you can see the spiral of metal with a magnet on the end. When it expands to the correct length for the temperature, the magnet connects, and shuts off the heater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The metals will also accept heat faster/slower due to differences in specific heat capacity. For a drastic example look at differences in cooling rates of metals/water. </p></div>		</li>
