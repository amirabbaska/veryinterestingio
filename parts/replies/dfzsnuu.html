			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly - we (the British) learned this in the Falklands war when we sent Vulcan bombers on one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Black_Buck" target="_blank">longest bombing runs</a> ever to bomb the runway at Port Stanley from Ascension island - we left a single crater in the runway which was repaired well enough to use for c-130 aircraft within 24 hours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it also showed they were falling apart - on the first mission the backup Vulcan had to turn back quickly due to a cabin oxygen leak, and there were no guarantees that the Victor aircraft providing refuelling would be available at the right times in the right places to get each other back, much less the Vulcans. </p>
<p>Still, we managed it and it was a decent demonstration, but we could have accomplished a similar mission by sending in a harrier or two when the task force got in range. </p></div>		</li>
