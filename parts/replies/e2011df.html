			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there is a frequently cited paper that has been confirmed time and again that well off families tend to have more males (as in environmental conditions favorable to survival male offspring represent the best chance of spreading your genes) while those with less tend to favor female offspring (as they are the 'safer bet'). It's slight (only about a 3% difference) but it's been confirmed repeatedly. </p>
<p>As standards of living rise worldwide, the trend toward male heavy offspring occurs, that's what you see in the WHO data.</p>
<p>Edit: found it. It's the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivers%E2%80%93Willard_hypothesis?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Trivers-Willard hypothesis</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Massive underreporting due to trafficking? None of the guys there bring their wives because it's party town?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but that would mean that intercourse closer to ovulation would produce boys, and sex further before ovulation would produce girls, not that more boys would be conceived than girls, overall. This was a theory I read a bit about when I first began my fertility journey years ago, but so far as I know there are no proven methods that couples can naturally choose the sex of their child. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LOL.. I read that as &quot;sex closer to the ovaries&quot;. I was think that men with bigger penises are going to produce boys that don't have far to swim.</p>
<p>No, I agree. As far as I k is, every method of selecting for a child is an old wives take (literally, I guess!).</p>
<p>It is totally random, however small pockets of order in families can trick the mind into thinking there is some correlation. My aunt has two daughters, both of those daughters have two daughters. My mother has me and my brother (two boys), my brother had a son.. It's all girls down one side and boys down the other.  But, I know it's random, the coin flip just worked out that way.</p></div>		</li>
