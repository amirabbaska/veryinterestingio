			<div class="markdown"><p>One particular method using JavaScript is to use the <em>unload</em> event and then use <em>location.href</em> to set the url or open the window again (depending on what you want to do).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The best way to solve it from the user point of view, is to kill the process from the Task Manager (as from memory this won't trigger the unload event).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it is a malicious or ad-heavy website, like the one I got into tonight, you cant always just close the tab. Multiple, rapid popups keep either an overlay or keep the page in a loading process (dont know alot about website scripting) to where you are unable to select the close button. The pop up tabs triggered a security even for me and I couldn't even close the tab from the search bar below. </p>
<p>People are shady af. If they're getting money from ad clicks or are trying to get malware on to your system, they're going to do all they can to keep you on the page and in a frenzy of random clicking. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not possible and hasn't been for a long long time. There are other ways that haven't been mentioned in this thread, but the onbeforeunload isn't one of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The more common way of doing it is a 302 redirect.</p>
<p>Google search results are not always up to date, a website may not directly link to a result that the search returned so you get redirected to something else. Then you realise that the search result you clicked doesn't have what you were searching for and try to go back, but get stuck in a loop of being redirected.</p>
<p>This method isn't intentionally malicious, it's just the search results being out of date and the website providing a solution to a broken link.</p></div>		</li>
