			<div class="markdown"><p>I know! It's a bit weird, and totally ridiculous that it even happened. Basically, the earliest seal fossils were some crappy bits from Belgium/Netherlands, but they didn't help much; some interesting bits came out of the eastern USA (Maryland/Virginia) but were not terribly informative either. The west coast is dominated by sea lions and early walruses (Otariidae, Odobenidae) and so most western seal researchers did not really work on phocid seals. During the cold war a number of really interesting seal fossils came out of Ukraine, Moldova, Hungary, Romania, Kazakhstan, etc. So these fossils - accessible mostly to a handful of eastern bloc paleontologists - really shaped what was thought about phocid seal evolution. There's a lot more to it, including the insistence that pinnipeds are biphyletic - sea lions and walruses evolved from a bearlike ancestor, and true seals evolved from an otterlike ancestor, independently, and thus pinnipeds are not a natural grouping (monophyletic). We now know that monophyly is very strongly supported by every single molecular/karyological analysis ever conducted, and well supported by morphological cladistic analyses as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those soviet idea you mentioned, are those from the days when the soviets went out of their way to pretend genetics didn't exist? Or after they'd finally ditched that particular issue?</p></div>		</li>
