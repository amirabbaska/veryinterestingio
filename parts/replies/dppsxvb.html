			<div class="markdown"><p>I got a door slammed on my toenail at the entrance of a Chuck E. Cheese when I was like 6-years-old and it left a huge crack down the middle. It's gotten better, but you can still see it. Wouldn't the nail just heal itself with the cells pushing each other off the toe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I broke my finger by closing a step ladder on it once. It broke at the tip and the nail came out at the root and it was surprising how far back it went. I'd say it was almost twice as long as what actually shows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In separate incidents, I lost the nail off my left big toe, and the nails from my left pinky- and ring- fingers. In both cases it took about a year to fully grow back.</p>
<p>Not having a nail on one of your toes is odd, but you hardly miss it, really. But not having nails on two of your fingers is definitely a strange experience. </p>
<p>....oh, yeah. It fraking hurt when they came off!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just guessing here, but I believe the bottom cells of the fingernail are all attached to the nail bed up until the point where it actually grows off of the end of your finger. So that bond would keep the nail growing the way it does. </p></div>		</li>
