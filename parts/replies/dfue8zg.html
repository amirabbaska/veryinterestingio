			<div class="markdown"><p>They sometimes do.  A story went past reddit a month or so back about a primate (gorilla of some sort, I forget the species) who got worked up over a long period about a woman who would stare at him and smile.  He then broke out of the enclosure and injured her quite badly.  His behaviour during the breakout was clearly directed at this one woman.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Domestic animals have been bred for generations to be chill around humans, and dogs are pretty good at reading our body language.  Non-domesticated mammals (and especially primates) <em>do</em> sometimes freak out around people, possibly for this very reason.</p></div>		</li>
