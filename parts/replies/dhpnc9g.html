<p>It isn't an organic network of friends like it said on the cover. It is mostly an RSS feed of your favorite bands and shows and people. People don't post anymore. </p>

<p>While the other generalities you posted are basically correct, this is just your experience. Plenty of people still post. It's all in who you follow. If you don't follow bands and other celebrities, you'll be seeing status updates from people you actually know.</p>
<p>Part of it is an age thing. Younger people (below 30) tend to migrate to other platforms (Instagram and Snapchat, primarily). Older people still use Facebook to keep in touch with friends and families. I'm 45 and basically no one I know in my age group in real life uses Instagram. But almost all use Facebook.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yes. That's what I meant to say. :) Thank you. I personally stopped being an active Facebook user after turning 18. My parents now 45 use it all the time.
A better way to say it would be the majority of the initial userbase moved away.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry, these seem like excuses.
Why cant the app include features like &quot;stickers&quot; and calling? Why can't it still offer basic messaging, instead of insisting you install a second app?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It <em>could</em>, but it shouldn't;</p>
<p>If you use Messenger but not facebook, you wouldn't like having to open facebook to chat with people. You'd also need more space on your phone and you might need to give extra permissions to the app even if you didnt want to.</p>
<p>Same way goes for people that use facebook but not messenger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to message people from facebook. I quit because I don't want another app and it's too hard to access on mobile (immediately pops me into the play store, go back to messages, have to switch to requesting the full site, jumps the page back, reclick messages, wait for it to load and then read a message that has a 50% chance of being my mom telling me to forward a chain of angels.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;you'd need more space on your phone&quot; . because turning one app into two apps totally solves that problem. They total to almost 400 MB . Back when I had a budget phone that was about 30% of my usable storage space. That wasn't an issue when it was one app. Granted now I have an s7 so storage has never been an issue but still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess because if it did that people won't install Messenger at all. They probably ignore the additional features a standalone app gives in favour of the simplicity of basic messaging in the main app. </p></div>		</li>
