			<div class="markdown"><p>yup, One problem can seriously bankrupt a company in seconds. which happened <a href="https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/knight-capital-says-trading-mishap-cost-it-440-million/" target="_blank">here</a>   But i think that this was more of a software glitch or a PEBKAC problem instead of a processor mathematical error.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope! They flip some switches to turn off the Xeon specific features and BAM... it's an I7.</p>
<p>Similarly the higher clock speed versions of some of their chips that fail reliability tests will sometimes get the same treatment and end up as a lower spec chip from the same family. So a chip that was built to be 3.4Ghz but only runs reliably at 3.1 might get rebadged as the 3.1 version. At least that's what used to happen, that tech may have changed in recent years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this happens as much any more as the Xeon chips use a different CPU socket and have a different twp, so I doubt they'd be compatible with the i7 chipset, but certainly it happens that high end Xeon's are locked down to sell as lower end Xeon's if they don't make the specs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are no &quot;parts&quot; in a process for the most part.  The die which makes up the majority of the processor(there are some capacitors and power components on the outside but the thinking is the die) is a single piece of silicon that has had chemicals added in specific spots and been etched to run little wires.</p>
<p>You can't break it down into parts that you can use to build another processor, but you can change some internal micro code to shut off bad sections or laser out a bad section.  This is how AMD made the triple core Phenom II processors and why some people were able to &quot;unlock&quot; the 4th core.  AMD was making only Phenom II X4 chips and then binning bad performers into slower models or X2 or X3 chips</p>
<p>Xeon processors are generally significantly different from the i7 variants, significantly enough that they don't get binned down to be i7s, they just get scrapped, this would be part of the higher price on Xeons.  The i7s and i5s will all be made to be the highest performing model and will be assigned their model and clock frequency based on how they perform in testing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Most companies don't actually produce a wide variety of processors. Instead they produce very few, and then when one of them fails QA, sell the processor as a slower or inferious version. </p>
<p>A processor may run to hot or experience errors a given clock speed, but is otherwise fine, so they just dial down the clock speed until it behaves nicely and off it goes. Or maybe you sell a quad core processor but one of the cores is shot. But you've designed the architectures so that stuff is nice and mirrored so you can just cut the bad core out of the loop, disable one of the other three cores and sell it as a dual core CPU. </p>
<p>this happens a lot when dealing with electronics. If you ever get out a bucket of simple resistors for example and test their values, you'll find that the rating on them isn't quite accurate. a 10% resistor won't live in a range of +/-10% but instead from 10% to 5% or -5% to -10%. the company just takes the best of the batch and sells them as  the 5% resistors (and takes the best of those to sell as 1%, etc) </p></div>		</li>
