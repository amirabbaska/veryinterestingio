<p>There's no &quot;Maybe if I complete the song instead of turning it off in between, it will stop.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I so wish this were true, b/c I've tried it so many times, to no avail. I've tried more sinister things in my head as well, to make it stop. Only thing that seems to work is being tired enough to fall asleep, or switching to a different, deliberate train of thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when I was getting my music degree, I wrote half of my material in my head.  I'd have to carry along a notebook to jot down ideas.  I also wrote music in my sleep.  I preferred to write away from a piano.  Instead, I just wrote what was in my head, and later would test it out on the piano to make sure I transposed from my head to paper correctly.  If I wrote at a piano, I could never come up with anything.  My best pieces were written in the middle of the night when going on little to no sleep sitting the kitchen with smokes and coffee.</p>
<p>Then I got away from music (long story) and it stopped.  Then I took a recording class, and it all came crashing back so hard I couldn't sleep.  My brain went on a massive music binge all on its own.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Okay this was certainly an attempt at an answer, but it doesn't quite fit, pretension aside</p>

<p>They're telling about their petty, melodramatic life and you're zoning out thinking about that sick part you just heard, muttering the drum rudiment under your breath.</p>

<p>Ouch, I feel sorry for your friends. Have you ever tried empathizing?</p></div>		</li>
