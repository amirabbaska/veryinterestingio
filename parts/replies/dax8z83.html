			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also like to point out that MRSA isn't limited to hospitals though. There is a good chance that a nasal swab on a person outside of a medical center would test positive for it. We are constantly being bombarded by some bad bugs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's definitely true. I was just making the point that hospital bugs tend to be much &quot;stronger&quot; than your average bacteria. But MRSA and other resistant strains can exist outside the hospital setting for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an important distinction to make.  The vast majority of people with MRSA on their history are the elderly.  Old people in and out of hospitals a lot tend to be people with some of the weakest immune systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really <strong>THE</strong> distinction to make. Staph, methicillin resistant or otherwise, is everywhere, it's just that those groups (who tend to spend more time in the hospital) are much more vulnerable than a random healthy dude who got a nasty cut and performed standard first aid.</p></div>		</li>
