<p>Nope, keep brushing, son.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha same here. I've had a bit of dental with partly because of bad genes but also never brushed long enough. Sometimes that 30 seconds feels like an eternity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 100% convinced that /u/transplant26 has hit the nail on the head.  It's the fact that the timer always runs and therefore anytime you're going to cheat and short change yourself you know you're doing it which essentially turns it into a conscious decision.</p>
<p>Consumer Reports has said in the past that they're basically the same -- electric toothbrushes might have a slight edge: <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2015/08/electric-toothbrush-vs-manual/index.htm" target="_blank">https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2015/08/electric-toothbrush-vs-manual/index.htm</a>  The main thing is that you brush enough.  Thus the timer is key.</p>
<p>So if $$ is an issue, try the setting a timer on your phone or using an egg timer.  The 4-sections thing helps too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno...I 100% cheat on the timer all of the time.  You just hit the button to turn it off...</p>
<p>but I still feel like the sonicare does a much better job.  I have shitty teeth, but new hygenists are always totally surprised by my terrible x-rays because my teeth look so well taken care of...</p>
<p>Maybe it doesn't do better than ideal manual brushing...but do you actually brush with ideal technique?</p></div>		</li>
