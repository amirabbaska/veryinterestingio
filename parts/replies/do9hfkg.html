			<div class="markdown"><p>He framed it kind of weirdly. The slowest you can go, when right against the planet, is a circular orbit juuuuust barely above it (like the ISS). That's frequently called minimum orbital velocity, and that's what he meant by 100%.</p>
<p>If you speed up your closest approach, your orbit gets more and more stretched out, like a comet's orbit, but you are still in orbit. This is the 100%-141% range.</p>
<p>At 141% speed at the closest approach, an extremely stretched ellipse becomes a parabola, and you have reached escape velocity. You are no longer in orbit and will leave the planet. </p>
<p>Note, further-away circular orbits can have slower speeds, but the percentage still applies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you're saying it it's possible to orbit at just the edge of escape velocity. Just enough to not leave. So close in fact a fart could push you away?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a circular orbit at a given distance from the center of the source, there is a specific orbital velocity. It decreases with the square root of distance, so that an orbit 4 times farther away is half the speed. For elliptical orbits, the speed varies throughout the orbit.</p>
<p>So for example, low Earth orbit is about 8 km/s, geostationary orbit is about 3 km/s, and the moon goes about 1 km/s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see, so 100% is circular, less or more are elliptical (other focal point on one or other side of the planet/star) and always around 141% will be escape velocity? (focal point reeeeeally far away)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Elliptical orbits.</p>
<p>This is assuming that 100% means the speed of a perfectly circular orbit. If you speed up to, say, 130%, then it will become a highly elongated ellipse. Your speed along the ellipse will vary depending on altitude, this 130% only makes sense at the lowest point, and at the highest it may get much lower than 100%.</p>
<p>If you reach 141% it becomes a parabola. This is no longer a closed orbit, so you go away forever. Higher than that and it's a hyperbola, you escape faster.</p>
<p>And BTW 141% is an approximation, the exact number is the square root of 2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you had only two objects in your universe, with no external gravity forces, the satellite wouldn't eventually return after escaping?</p>
<p>Assuming you have the earth and a small satellite.  The satellite escapes in this test environment.  Does the gravity not slow it down over time (possibly very long time) and cause it to come back?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right that gravity causes the satellite to slow down. However, the force due to gravity decreases with distance. Escape velocity can be more mathematically understood as the initial velocity such that relative velocity between the two objects approaches zero as the distance between them approaches infinity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If gravity is constantly decelerating the object moving away at escape velocity, and no extra energy is added to the object, wouldn’t the object eventually turn back around?  It might not be a classical orbital, but even with the decreased effect of gravity with distance (assume constant mass), the object wouldn’t slow down and reverse course with enough time?</p></div>		</li>
