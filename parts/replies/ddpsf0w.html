			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the effect I have heard of where you come out of the blackout while still conscious? I've had it described to me as teleporting. It seems to me that if it is just affecting long term memory you would slowly come out of it and not snap out all at once not even remembering what happened 5 seconds ago. Yet people tell me that can totally happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you consume lot of alcohol in a short period of time you can completely block memory generation. It will feel just as you described, at one moment you were doing one thing and you teleported into the future with no recollection of what happened in between since your brain was unable to form memories in the intermediate period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had this happen. My husband and I were at a bar with friends, where I consumed quite a bit of alcohol. Three of us got an uber and went home. A little while later, I'm on the couch with my husband, and he's telling me I was bitching at him in the back of the car for talking to a woman at the bar, saying she wanted his dick. I'm not normally a jealous person at all. I didn't remember any of this, and thought he was messing with me (though that's not something he ever does either). I had to call our friend (who was in the front seat) to confirm. It's a really disturbing feeling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I drink a lot, this happens to me often. Last time was a couple nights ago. I met up with some friends and we started drinking. Next thing I know, I woke up in the morning on my friend's couch. Apparently during the blackout period, we walked to a bar and stayed there for a couple more hours. I have zero recollection of the last several hours of the night. Not even a vague cloudy memory, nothing. To me, it's basically like everything after 11PM didn't happen at all, but it did. </p>
<p>Yes, I know.. something something liver and risky behavior and dying early. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are talking about is called blacking in, and it happens if you're awake long enough to outlast the dunkest part of your night. In other words, sobering up a little before falling asleep. </p>
<p>It's not an instantaneous moment, not even a little bit. It's more like you've just been grooving and riding the drunk and then you start to wonder why it's so late, and you talk with people about earlier parts of the night that you were there for but have absolutely zero memory of doing. Then comes the realization that you were blacked out for a couple hours earlier.</p>
<p>Last time this happened was a couple months back. Around 4am, when I was laying on the couch with my girlfriend after a night out drinking, we were talking about all the things we did that night. I realized I had no idea what we were talking about, and I had no idea who the people in our photos were. Luckily I was just a fun goof that night, rather than done something embarrassing.</p>
<p>It's happened to the best of us. Anyone who says it's instantaneous teleportation is making things up because it sounds &quot;sci-fi&quot; or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk I've had at least 3 people tell me that they have suddenly snapped out of being blackout. I've only blacked out once though and I went to sleep before coming back so it was kinda teleporting but not quite the same way because I felt the normal consciousness coming back from sleep stuff.</p></div>		</li>
