			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't very accurate. You have 4 main receptors in the skin that detect vibration, pressure and crude and fine touch. These sensors are activated and sent along large myelinated A-alpha and A-beta fibres. Think of these as optical fibre sending information at 100Gbps. &quot;Pain&quot; or more accurately nociceptors (danger or noxious) are generally smaller sometimes unmyelinated C or A-delta fibres which signals travel at a snails pace, think of dial-up, compared with alpha and beta fibres. So while a nerve bundle may have multiple nerve fibres, the signal travels at different rates. Also, these different fibres have different routes up the spinal cord to the brain. Touch and vibration gets an express pass straight up to the brainstem before it has to switch over to the other side, pain and heat sensations first have to cross at the spinal cord level before travelling up the spinal cord to the brain. Meaning it has the opportunity to be ignored or be prevented from travelling up to the brain. </p></div>		</li>
