			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. They are called dampeners. Unlike a spring, that needs a specific force for deflection, example 20 lbs of force to compress an inch. Dampeners hold very strictly to a specific movement speed even with increasing force. The door example is great. Those doors will not close any faster no matter how hard you pull, unless you pull hard enough to break the dampener.</p></div>		</li>
