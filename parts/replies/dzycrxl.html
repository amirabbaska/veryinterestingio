			<div class="markdown"><p>The tritone is used to incredible effect in the opening track of Black Sabbath's debut album.  It's just a dead-simple slow repitition of root . . . octave . . . TRITONE.</p>
<p>And in those three notes, heavy metal was born.  You can practically feel Satan himself oozing from your speakers.</p></div>		</li>
