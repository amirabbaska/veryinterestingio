			<div class="markdown"><p>So, is there some unwritten rule that the bad guys won't hurt the documentary makers? Sorta like how it used to be with journalists imbedding themselves in foreign wars? Of course, all bets are off now in that arena. :-(  Hang on to your head, Sekmet19. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a complex and involved process, I gave an overview. You build rapport with a member of the group you want to study.  They vouch for you.  Research protocols and the certificate of confidentiality limit how much information the government can demand of you to prosecute the criminals.  The criminals less likely to hurt you because you are not being compelled to share information on their illicit activities, you developed rapport with them, and you used your common sense to avoid those you suspect would actually harm you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not sure why you find my reference to &quot;unwritten rule,&quot; ridiculous. But that's ok. Thanks for your insight on how you do things. Best of luck.  </p></div>		</li>
