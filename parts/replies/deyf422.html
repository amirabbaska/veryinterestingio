			<div class="markdown"><p>Why sometimes when I'm watching TV or reading (not something boring to me btw) I'll suddenly feel kind of a jolt/spasm like my body was just about to shut off and go to sleep.  I used to think I was narcoleptic because it seemed to happen so easily but I would never actually fall asleep.  And it wasn't like I'd be reading or watching TV for a long time either...seems like it would happen within minutes sometimes and I'd just find it annoying.  It doesn't seem to happen as much these days but what the hell was going on with me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuck me, there's a term for this but I can't remember. It goes hand in hand with those short dreams of falling to your death. Basically, IIRC, as you drift to sleep your body releases various chemicals to paralyze you until the transition from conscious to subconscious control takes over. As imperfect beings though, this doesn't anyways happen according to plan and your conscious mind becomes aware of the transition and basically forces that violent spasm to regain control.</p>
<p>I am paraphrasing A LOT and probably got some things wrong. Someone please correct me where I absolutely butchered this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely these are episodes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsleep" target="_blank">microsleep</a>. They can be accompanied by a more or less vivid &quot;experience of falling&quot; and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnic_jerk" target="_blank">jerk reaction ('hypnic jerk')</a>. Microsleep can be dangerous. You think you don't actually fall asleep but in reality you just don't remember it.</p>
<p>If it happens while you are fully awake and alert (i.e. no drifting thoughts, no &quot;what happened?&quot; feeling but just a twicht/jerk), then I can just speculate: might be by-products of caffeine intake, might be early signs of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourette_syndrome" target="_blank"> Tourette syndrome</a> (but they usually get worse not better) or something completely different.</p>
<p>If they happen again, make sure to have them checked out. Microsleep can be easily diagnosed via EEG nowadays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I experience the decreased perceptual awareness in an unusual way. Whenever I'm falling asleep somewhere with continuous loud ambient noise (like in a jet plane), there's a moment before I'm totally asleep where the sound cuts off completely and I'm aware of the sudden silence. This usually jolts me back awake again. This is one reason I find it really hard to sleep in planes, I can go through a cycle of nodding off, experiencing sudden silence, jolting back awake, many many times before I finally get to sleep. </p>
<p>I also experience the same thing in reverse, when waking up! My first thought will be, that's strange, it was really noisy when I fell asleep, but now it's quiet. And <em>then</em> the noise will kick in.</p>
<p>I've described this to a lot of people, but so far, no one has said they experience the same thing. I wonder how common it is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same!  If I start drifting off while watching tv (or any constant noise), there's a seemingly conscious thought that I can't hear it anymore... which wakes me back up fully and the cycle repeats. </p>
<p>Will have to pay attention to see if it happens in reverse as well.. usually too out of sorts to notice anything immediately upon waking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the sound is the right type of ambience, I get this too. You have to concentrate though as falling asleep seems to give a short bout of amnesia surrounding the action of slipping out if consciousness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too. I don't notice it when falling asleep. But if I am awakening without an alarm, I will be thinking about stuff and looking around. A few seconds later, hearing kicks in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am aware of losing consciousness every night. I feel like I'm dying, every night. It's horrible... The only way I know to stop it is by taking Benadryl, or Lorazepam, to make my body's shutting down more powerful than my awareness of this feeling of losing consciousness. (Trained myself into it as a kid, I think, bc I had terrible nightmares and feared them.) If there is a different way, I sure would love to know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a kid I was terrified at night. I have needed tricks to fall asleep. To name a few: staring at the inside of my eyelids, listening to my tinnitus or traffic sounds, counting, rolling back and forth until I feel physically tired, doing situps.</p>
<p>I'm not into medicine but I can imagine that taking medicine makes it more difficult to fall asleep without. I hope you can find ways to fall asleep more easily. </p>
<p>On a side note, I can feel my different brain parts disconnecting from each other. I find it fascinating rather than horrible nowadays. I try to imagine &quot;the 'me' that is registering this, in which part of the brain is that / am I?&quot;. Don't be afraid of your brain. Try to find comfort I  your bed. How nice and warm it is. How soft and comfy.... I need two heavy blankets to feel safe. Maybe that works for you too. </p>
<p>And sometimes a night just doesn't get better, no amount of hot beverages help and I just shrug, get up and browse the web =) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks :) If I don't take meds, which I sometimes don't, I just don't end up sleeping for a long time :/ I've tried really hard to avoid it. I only go there because I'm desperate. The only time I've slept naturally and easily in my life was when I worked on a farm one weekend. Fresh air and a full day of hard physical work tired me out enough. It's not a feasible job for me, though.</p>
<p>I haven't been aware of my brain parts disconnecting, or maybe I wouldn't describe it like that? I get the hypnagogic hallucinations. And feel like a dark tide is taking over my mind, pulling me down. The bed is comfy enough, it's just beyond what's happening somehow? I'll try a heavier blanket maybe, thank you.</p>
<p>Sometimes I try to distract myself with TV or YouTube videos. Sometimes that helps... more often not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I know this will probably be an unhelpful comment, but I'll share what's helped me sleep like a baby the past 15 years. Marijuana.</p>
<p>If you can't get it legally or don't want to go down that path, I totally understand, but it truly has helped me transition from &quot;Hours laying in bed tossing and turning&quot; to &quot;Out like a light in 10 minutes&quot;.</p>
<p>Sure, it's not for everyone, but it has helped me significantly in getting a good night's sleep for over a decade. Just thought I'd share.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's great that mj works for you! I don't have any problem with it morally or anything, but it does increase my anxiety. I've heard different strains cause different effects, but I don't know - I gave all kinds a good shot in my teens and 20s! Lol :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your vague description sounds a little bit like you might be experiencing symtoms common in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis#Out-of-body_experiences" target="_blank">sleep paralysis</a> stemming from night terrors as a kid. Have you looked into that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry I'm being vague (am on 5 hours' sleep atm :/) - paralysis sometimes happens, it's more just the drifting away from consciousness that I notice and dislike. And the hypnagogic stuff. And hypnic jerks, I get those often but also sometimes seem to precipitate them?</p></div>		</li>
