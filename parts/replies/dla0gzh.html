<p>Only if you have something reflecting the signal strongly, otherwise you simply have waves propagating from the router, with a few weaker reflections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those can ruin your signal, depending on how much conductor is actually in there (aluminium panels, metal coatings, etc.). Generally, it's better not to use those indoors because of this, but on the exterior is fine if you don't mind having a bad connection on the other side of the wall.</p></div>		</li>
