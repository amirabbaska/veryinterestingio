			<div class="markdown"><p>Good series right? Really enjoying it. On the whole it seems like they get the science pretty well spot on, physics of spaceflight is very well represented.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am glad they are sticking to the sci fi elements instead of having it turn too far into something like Helix or The Thing... it's a good blending of genres. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The author of the books the show is based on intended it to be relatively accurate and within the realm of technology that is theoretically possible. Many sci-fi stories/worlds involve humanity spreading within our Solar System (no faster than light travel) or having expanded far beyond into many other Solar Systems and the FTL travel is handwaved and ignored because we don't actually know how its even theoretically possible.</p>
<p>The Expanse takes place in between those 2 categories, during the discovery of some sort of FTL, warp drive, or wormhole travel. I won't spoil HOW its discovered, but its interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that was an accurate representation of what would happen to you. You die from lack of oxygen, and then your body freezes completely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true. Your body does not freeze. You would get cold and have a layer of frost on you from the rapid pressure drop, but beyond getting cool from gases expanding, space isn't actually cold to a human. If you had a helmet on and your body was exposed to hard vacuum in Pluto's orbit, you would not freeze while you are alive. Vacuum is an almost perfect insulator. If it wasn't for your body outgassing, space in Pluto's orbit would feel warm to a human. Your body produces heat much faster than you can radiate it away, and in space, radiating heat is the only way to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Granted, once you are dead your body would eventually cool down to an ambient of a few degrees above zero. While you are alive though, if you can stop outgassing through your skin and stay alive, you would actually be in danger of overheating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's very accurate. I've read somewhere that as soon as you're in space without a suit, all your bodily fluids begin to boil. There is no pressure in outer space, so your eyes will boil, your blood vessels will pop, etc.</p>
<p>I'm almost certain it won't look as peaceful as in the last episode of The Expanse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to this <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/what-happens-to-the-unprotected-human-body-in-space/" target="_blank">CNET</a> article, that wouldn't be the case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After about 10 seconds or so, your skin and the tissue underneath will begin to swell as the water in your body starts to vaporise in the absence of atmospheric pressure. You won't balloon to the point of exploding, though, since human skin is strong enough to keep from bursting; and, if you're brought back to atmospheric pressure, your skin and tissue will return to normal.</p>
<p>It also won't affect your blood, since your circulatory system is able to keep your blood pressure regulated, unless you go into shock. The moisture on your tongue may begin to boil, though, as reported by Jim LeBlanc, who was exposed to near vacuum in a test chamber in 1965. LeBlanc's suit sprung a leak, and he remained conscious for about 14 seconds; his last sensation was bubbling on his tongue</p>
