<p>I got a book for Christmas and put it on my bookshelf. I know it's on the shelf because I can think back to the specific episode in which the gifting occurred.</p>
<p>But I also know I have the Lord of the Rings trilogy on my shelf, because hey, what self-respecting nerd doesn't? It's just a part of my self knowledge by this point. Even though I don't remember the specific instance of receiving LOTR, I know it's there.</p></div>		</li>
