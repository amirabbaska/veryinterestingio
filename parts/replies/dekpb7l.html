			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the thing. Now I'm Dutch and we make macaroni rather blend. Now look what Americans do with it, just google Mac&amp;Cheese recipes and you find a ton of amazing things you can do with your mac&amp;cheese.</p>
<p>My favourite is preparing a small amount of onion/chorizo/canned tomato with some pepper in a pan so you got a neat sauce.</p>
<p>Take out half of your prepped macaroni put that in the sauce. Now prepare a bechamel which I lace with an ungodly amount of cheese, if you got it laying around some Peccoroni. </p>
<p>Now pile tomato/mac sauce on a bowl, put the remaining mac on top of the tomato/mac sauce and put in the bechamel, don't mix just tap the bowl on the counter to let out the air caught in your macaroni. Add some extra cheese on top, put some aluminium foil over the top for 30 minutes, take away the foil then another 15 and you got something amazing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do for mine. I get a box of the fancy Cracker Barrel mac and cheese (white cheddar or bust). From there as the noodles are boiling I'll pan fry some sweet potato, yellow onions, little bit of garlic, peas, broccoli, red pepper, and if I'm feeling frisky some bacon or ham. </p>
<p>The added textures alone make it so good, and the depth of flavor from the ingredients really make it feel more like a home cooked meal than something a sad lonely bachelor eats while waiting between load screens of video games. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the cheap ones it's a powder that you mix with milk to make into a sauce. But you don't need to spend that much if you want to use actual cheese. You can get a pound of American cheese for around $5 and a box of pasta for about a dollar so it's still around the same price.</p>
<p>You could also buy Velveeta which is a cheese made for melting but I'm not sure how much that costs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use some velveeta, milk, and grated cheddar to make the cheese sauce. </p>
<p>Sometimes I put the leftovers in the frying pan in the am, and once it's hot I crack a couple eggs in a mug, splash of milk, pepper, wisk, and drop that in the pan and mix it up as it cooks. </p></div>		</li>
