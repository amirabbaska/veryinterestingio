			<div class="markdown"><p>Beautiful response. In the case of screens like phones, I'm guessing it applies to just about any bring such as video games. Now I'm wondering, does the blue light filter for phones actually aid an individual so they may sleep at night?</p>
<p>Or it it overall better to just cut off screen viewing a good hour before bed? I have intense insomnia sometimes where I can't fall asleep until about 4-6am (normal times are (11-2am).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes. Because the blue light spectrum is the one who that &quot;deceives&quot; the brain into thinking it's still daytime. </p>
<p>You know, blue light makes you so awaken that strong blue light lamps are used to treat patients who suffer from narcolepsy. </p>

<p>Yes. Avoid using your smartphone, computers, tablets etc at night, about 1-2 hours before going to bed. It will make it easier for you to sleep. </p>
<p>If you really need to read something at night, you may use blue screen filters, and if you don't have them, there are other strategies to diminish that amount of light that goes to your eyes: reversing the print so the page is dark and the text is light, or using e-readers such as Kindle Paperwhite (because it's not backlit, the light is directed to fall at an angle on the the screen, it's not coming from behind the screen straight at your corneas). I've been using Kindle Paperwhite to read in bed before going to sleep and it's not preventing me from falling asleep at all. It's almost the same experience as reading a paper book.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you very much for this information. It's certainly going to change the way I do my activities before bedtime.</p>
<p>One last question, is there is negative effect of constant use of blue filter lighting or &quot;night time&quot; mode features? For example, the iPhone essentially allows us to have night shift mode on at any time we want. If I just used it for a full day and so forth, would that have a negative impact on my eyes or my sleeping?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to get up at 3 in the morning for work. So it is always dark when I leave. I often go back and forth between sleeping before or after work. I schedule and plan using math, I have 2 jobs so I am often taking short naps and can end up staying up for more than a day if I am scheduled both jobs too many days in a row. </p>
<p>I still have 2 days a week off both jobs so I sleep a lot on the weekends.</p></div>		</li>
