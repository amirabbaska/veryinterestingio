			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kinda the phrasing of the question.</p>
<p>&quot;How do we know there's a Baryon asymmetry?&quot;</p>
<p>The answer is - we observe more matter than antimatter, all over the universe.  This indicates an asymmetry.</p>
<p>The question &quot;<em>Why</em> is there there's a Baryon asymmetry?&quot; is more difficult to answer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Either way, it's clear to me now, thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean is it not just that we can only see some of the universe? There is a cosmic horizon and it may be that whatever statistical fluctuations going on in the early universe are sufficient to explain the fact that our region is just one of the matter-rich ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And placing that horizon outside of our observable horizon requires an astoundingly large statistical fluke - plus no one ever likes a theory that says &quot;you can't see it and you (probably) never will, but that's how it works&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're confusing the matter/antimatter boundary with the cosmic horizon (the distance at which the expansion of the universe is too fast for light to reach us from any further away) to which I am referring. However, the guy who responded to you makes the valid point that it is statistically unlikely that such a boundary is not visible within our cosmic horizon. How that is calculated, and what parameters/uncertainties are involved in that, I don't know, but I'll take their authority.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every single interaction needs to conserve baryon number (well, almost). So even if there is antimatter hidden outside our observable universe, it doesn't really help us, because that still wouldn't explain why there is so little antimatter in our observable universe. The interactions that created the matter we have in our universe today should have also created equal amounts of antimatter, so we'd expect it to be evenly distributed everywhere, not formed in massive clumps of matter and antimatter.</p>
<p>Another point is that our current cosmological model is based on the big bang followed by a period of inflation; it's not perfect, but it's extremely successful in numerous ways. This model enforces homogeneity throughout the universe, so if there was antimatter hidden away outside the observable universe, the current cosmological model would need extremely serious revisions. Sure, maybe the model is wrong, but it's so successful at predicting so much of what we see in the universe that the focus at the moment is on trying to figure out how the asymmetry could occur assuming the current cosmological model is correct.</p></div>		</li>
