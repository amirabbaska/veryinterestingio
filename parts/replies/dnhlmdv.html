<p>The short answer is nothing directly, because quantum computers will, for any even remotely foreseeable future, be specialized research devices. They will not be in your computers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even with the people I've talked at my lab who work on QCs they've said unless there is a massive breakthrough quantum processors would likely be similar to how graphics cards are now where a normal CPU would do most of the logical calculations and then submit the sections that are suited for Q-CPUs off to the quantum computer.  So if it was inside of your computer it would likely be on a separate card just like your GPU.  </p>
<p>Although the first major challenge with Q-CPUs is just to get them to a scale large enough to even be competitive with a normal CPU on the specialized operations.  It doesn't matter if you can do in 10 moves what takes 10000 on a traditional CPU if your Q-CPU can only perform 200 operations a minute while a traditional CPU can do billions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's a little short-sighted to claim the development of quantum programming languages won't affect the rest. Vizzotto et al. (2006) already noted how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_(computer_science)" target="_blank">type classes</a> can be used to model computation, separating it into pure and effect-ful parts, which, trivially, will allow us to 1. use existing idioms/styles, 2. use existing static analysis algorithms &amp; tools, 3. keep the internal details of QP semantics confined in the compiler, instead of exposing application programmers to it. Quipper already builds upon this result (without a citation, I might add).</p>
<p>If anything, results like this show there's no clear incentive to isolate/separate research of quantum from 'classical' programming languages. It is not a stretch to suggest research into one might be applicable to the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you misunderstand the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0501151.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> you're referring to. This is application of existing PL knowledge (they did not invent arrows, nor did arrows arise from anything quantum) to the task of designing a quantum programming language.</p>
<p>That's the opposite of the direction you seem to be implying (that quantum computing has somehow informed classical programming language design).</p>
<p>(For the record, PhD in PL here. Also, there's not necessarily a missing citation there. <del>It's pretty well-known that arrows can be used to model circuits. That they can also be used to model quantum circuits is something I suspect has been discovered independently a few times. It's among the first few things a PL person would try.</del> edit: the Quipper paper doesn't even build off this arrow approach, so I'm not sure why you thought this was a missing citation?)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm aware of what arrows are. I wasn't implying that it <em>has</em>, I was implying that it most definitely will. I see no fundamental distinction to be made between them. </p>
<p>You could say, of course, that I'm speculating - it's not that I'm an expert in the field or anything.</p></div>		</li>
