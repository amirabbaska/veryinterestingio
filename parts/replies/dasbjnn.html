			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate, basically all mammals have a &quot;suite&quot; of nutrients they need to survive.  If you have all those nutrients, then you can build muscle as long as you take in enough calories.</p>
<p>However, there are two important things that make bison different from humans (and every other animal).</p>
<p>One is that the composition of an animal is genetically predetermined.  If you and a bison got an IV of exactly the correct amount of nutrients, plus exactly enough calories to cover your BMR plus...I dunno, 20%?  The bison would still end up more muscular than you.  Their genetic code results in them being built in a certain way unless they're malnourished or diseased.  There's a reason humans have to put such an insane amount of work into being a bodybuilder.  Genetically we're not <em>meant</em> to have that much muscle, because muscle is very expensive to maintain.</p>
<p>Larger animals need more muscle because muscle doesn't scale well.  I'm sure someone here can link the wikipedia article for the law of physics I'm talking about, but basically if you double the size of a muscle, the amount of force it can exert only goes up by like 1.4 times or something.  That's why very small animals are almost never super muscular but huge animals almost always are.  It's also why small animals can move so insanely fast and lift way more than you'd expect.  The vast majority of a bison's musculature exists to prevent its skeleton from collapsing under its own weight.  For a mouse, all that muscle is going toward making it speedy.  And that's a good thing, because a bison that could move at the same relative speed as a mouse would be beyond terrifying.</p>
<p>The second caveat is that all animals have a different portfolio (that's not the right word but I'm too tired to think of the right one) of nutrients it can synthesize and nutrients it can't.  Nutrients an organism <em>must</em> get via ingestion are called &quot;essential&quot; nutrients.  </p>
<p>For humans, there are 39 of these, most of which are vitamins and minerals.  Dogs have 37, cats have 41. For cats, taurine is essential.  Taurine comes almost exclusively from meat, which is why cats absolutely must eat meat or they'll die.  Most other mammals (including humans) can synthesize their own taurine.  Why some animals evolved to not be able to synthesize some nutrients is a mystery to me, but that's the reason animals all have different diets, and why humans require such a varied diet.  Cats can survive on pure meat because they can synthesize everything that doesn't come from meat.  Humans, not so much.</p></div>		</li>

<p>is there a list somewhere for what animals have what necessary substances?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With enzymes and fermentation you could probably do a lot of things, though the protein in grass would likely lack our essential amino acids.</p>
<p>Definitely not cost effective though.</p></div>		</li>
