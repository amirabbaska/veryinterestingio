When you put aloe on your skin, it helps the skin cling to its neighbors a little better.  It is still shed, just not all at once (peeling).</p>
<p>Your skin cells actually commit suicide when UV radiation causes sufficient damage to their DNA, its a process called apoptosis.  Your DNA is constantly being damaged and repaired, and our cells have numerous failsafes that either repair the DNA, or cause the cell to commit suicide - you likely get &quot;cancer&quot; dozens of times a day, but your body catches it and either kills or corrects it. </p>
<p>Aloe won't impact the rate of DNA repair at all - what it does is reduce inflammation and help speed healing by stimulating cell reproduction.  It's fine to use aloe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aloe does nothing with regards to DNA repair. You can't really do anything in that regard. For that matter, the effects of aloe vera gel on sunburn is disputed - there's one study that found some positive effect, but multiple others that found no correlation. It might make it feel better, but it may not do anything to accelerate healing.</p>
<p>As for your lack of peeling, it may simply be that the burn was not severe enough to necessitate sloughing off the upper layers of the epidermis (due to destruction of lower layers).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763764/" target="_blank">This</a> study by Surjushe <em>et al</em> 2008 outlines the composition of <em>Aloe barbadensis miller</em> as well as pointing out the disputes regarding its uses. Theres also <a href="https://nccih.nih.gov/health/aloevera" target="_blank">this</a> NIH fact sheet, which amongst other things, notes that oral use shows carcinogenic activity.</p>
<p>Thanks for your comment, if you didnt make it then I was going to with this study as an additional source.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I presume Alore contains a lot of good antioxidants. If they penetrate into the skin (tocotrienols do exactely this rapidly ) then they would scavenge many of the radicals emerging from the UV and from the killed cells. Actually a lot of damage is done by cell necrosis. Here's a study from heat damage - might similarly be in UV damage :<br />
