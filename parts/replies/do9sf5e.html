			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I love that you picked up on the mythbusters thing!</p>
<p>With the scale stuff you need to take a momentum approach.</p>
<p>When 2 objects collide, there is a change of momentum, or an impulse. </p>
<p>Because p (momentum) = m (mass) Ã— v (velocity), an object with less mass will have to move faster to receive the same impulse as a higher mass object at a low velocity. </p>
<p>If they did half scale, they would have to double the velocity if they cut the mass in half. So if it was 1/30th scale (assuming the mass is 1/30th), they would need to shoot the car at 30 times the velocity to receive the same impulse... So 900mph.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even still, that isn't the same thing. When you change mass for velocity, you alter the ability to dissipate the energy by deformation and other processes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that's true, I'm speaking from my limited high school AP mechanics knowledge. This is purely theoretical and doesn't take into account a lot of other variables</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that always bugged me. One of the most annoying was the marching bridge test, where they not only used a scaled down version which could not possibly experience the same harmonic motion that a full scale bridge would, but then used such a laughably crude method to simulate marching feet that it was just impossible to pretend they were doing anything but wasting everyone's time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the worst example of that is when they decided to disprove the idea that ships would suck people down when they sank. They put a tiny boat in a pool and determined that it didn't suck anyone down, so the myth was busted. Baloney.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are harping on them, but anything they held back on was a budget constraint. I have no doubts that they would have loved to get a cruise liner out to sea and test it with a dummy. But that's expensive. </p>
<p>And, if anything, their show informed you that things don't scale. They did typically scale it up and get different results; that <em>teaches</em> you that things don't scale. So I'm not sure why all the hate.</p></div>		</li>
