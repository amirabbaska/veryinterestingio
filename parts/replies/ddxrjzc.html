<p>There's one big difference between carbon and silicon and it's that carbon dioxide is a gas, while silicon dioxide is a crystal. What's the reason for that?</p>
<p>Besides forming good structural polymers, carbon also has another great feature in that gaseous oxide. This means the same polymers that are used for building the structure of the living beings can also be used for energy transport. Expelling the gas resulting from combustion is much easier than expelling crystals.</p></div>		</li>

When bonded to carbon, the electrons prefer to hang around the oxygen more than the carbon, and so you end up with a polarised bond. This has interesting chemistry because the carbon is more electron poor, than in a standard carbon carbon bond, which means that highly electron rich particles can attack the carbon (we call these nucleophiles).</p>
<p>The answer to your carbon vs silicon question is slightly more complicated. The answer lies in the fact that electrons do not orbit the atoms like planets around a sun. They are highly probabilistic, and you can define an area where you are likely to find an electron (eg with 95% certainty) as an orbital. You can never have an orbital of 100% certainty because that will extend to the entire universe. Orbitals have reasonably well defined shapes for atoms and simple molecules.</p>
<p>In carbon dioxide, the carbon is double bonded to two oxygens. The first bond is a straight bond between the atoms. This is called a sigma bond. The second bond is called a pi bond and is made up of overlapping dumbell shaped orbitals which are perpendicular to the sigma bond. Both atoms have a dumbell shaped orbital in this case, and we call these p orbitals. The orbitals of carbon and oxygen are similar sized, so you get the possibility of a nice pi bond forming between the two. Carbon dioxide forms nice small molecules, which are held together by weak intermolecular forces which are easily overcome, and so exists as a gas.</p>
<p>Silicon has much larger orbitals than oxygen, so the sigma bond is much larger. As a result, the p orbitals of the Silicon and the oxygen are too far apart for this nice stable pi bond formation. Therefore, rather than forming a double bond, it forms an interconnected network of single bonds. We say Silicon dioxide as a formalism as it is the smallest repeating building block of the structure but in reality the entire system is one giant interconnected molecule similar to diamond. And that is why it forms a solid, because these sigma bonds require a lot of energy to break.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not a EIL5 forum. Metally, samey, blurry are not ways to discuss bonding in metals.</p>
<p>In addition much of what you wrote is just wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what have I said that's wrong?</p>
<p>I gave an answer that was appropriate for the level at which the question was asked. If i'd gone more detailed I suspect we would have lost OP.</p></div>		</li>
