			<div class="markdown"><p>So content creators on twitch only get half of the $5 subscription fee--twitch gets the other half.</p>
<p>However, are you sure it's 35,000 and not 3,500 subscribers? That's an insane amount of subscribers on twitch. The channels with the largest followings only have around 10k subscribers (the guys who have around 1 million -1.5 million followers). That would make a lot more sense of they only have 3,500 subscribers, with it being a similar follower-to-subscriber ratio.</p>
<p>Still, that amount would bring in a lot of money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Summit1G just hit 20k subscribers and it's big news. I'd be very surprised if Geek and Sundry hit 35k, because they usually have about 3k viewers anytime I watch something on their channel. You have to rely on the host to tell you what their sub count is, because it is not viewable on the site.</p>
<p>EDIT: Summit averages 20-50k live viewers when he streams.</p>
<p>EDIT2: G&amp;S subs somewhat confirmed by looking at the number of emotes</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/BuddyTrees they usually have 30k viewers during Critical Role last I checked (I now watch the show on Alpha which is Nerdist/G&amp;S's video custom video platform). They got their first 10-15k by having giveaways during the show that were based on sub counts. Since the show is very long and late at night (10PM to 1-2AM EST), a lot of people use the sub so they can watch the VOD immediately after (if your from EU) or the next day. It seems the show heavily subsidizes their other broadcasting content. </p>
<p>Also keep in mind that their content is D&amp;D and other traditional nerd stuff (e.g. comics and board games). They have varied programming too and a high production value and are more akin to traditional media. Between that and their demographics which are much different than most of Twitch, you can't really compare their sub/follow or sub/viewer ratios to other streamers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They absolutely have 35,000 subscribers. A year ago they had 3,500 when they were barely known. Probably 90% of the subs are there purely to support Critical Role, a live stream show that puts out 4-8 hours of highly niche but popular content on a weekly basis. You'll find most viewers say it's better than anything on TV. To them, $5/month is pennies. Many spend much more on branded merchandise. Nearly 3,500 people showed up at a single live showing of an episode in a theater and that was some time back. </p>
<p>Of course, there's a lot of people involved in making every episode. More than your average live stream. Each episode features 7 players, and that's just people on camera. </p></div>		</li>

<li>YouTube adsense</li>
<li>Amazon Affiliate (which I'm pretty sure they are making less off of now due to some changes)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really feel bad about them losing Vessel.  I was a paying member over there and really felt it was worth the couple bucks a month.  To lose ~12-15% of your revenue on such short notice has to suck, glad it appears no-one got laid off.</p>
<p>They've had a solid steady growth in views though since that vid, over 50% average monthly views since then.  So ad sense revenue likely has grown to at least replace the vast majority lost from Vessel.  If their other revenue sources had any growth at all, I imagine their monthly revenue is higher overall now than in July, but probably not by as much as you'd want over a 6+ month time frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's totally legal to buy an established channel, so not everyone starts at 0. I'm considering buying a channel at around 10,000 subs just to get past the initial hurdle.</p>
<p>But I said big mostly because I'll be hiring 2 full time employees to help run the channel and spending $80,000 on marketing. So it's not your average person just launching a channel and hoping for the best. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered about buying channels. Are most of the subscribers not going to just unsub when the channel they were subbed to completely changes content? The thing I like about youtube is the connection you get to the creator AND their content. Even if its a small team making the videos, it still might feel like just 1 person behind it all. This is very unlike traditional TV shows where you can feel its a big production and the TV networks are involved, etc. I've switched my video media consumption to 100% youtube, and if any of the channels I sub to suddenly changed in content style or producer, I'd be out of there pretty quickly. So are you just planning on producing the same/similar looking content but do it in a better way so the channel grows beyond the 10k?</p></div>		</li>
