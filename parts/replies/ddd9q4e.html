			<div class="markdown"><p>Neuroscientist here.  I don't think your answer really addresses the question very well, and I also think it has a few major factual errors in it.  In particular, the idea that living a fast paced life (or anything else at all, really) &quot;floods your brain with dopamine.&quot;</p>
<p>Neurotransmitters are not hormones.  They do not &quot;flood your brain.&quot;  They get released in many different discrete &amp; independent pathways within the brain.  There is no such thing as a &quot;dopamine rush&quot;.  Dopamine release is not pleasurable, nor does it generally signal rewarding / pleasurable events.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Come on this is Reddit, everybody is a pseudo-expert! There is much about and in the brain that remains a mystery so I wasn't claiming to be a &quot;neuroscientist.&quot; ...I was simplifying things and using figures of speech, as many who talk about the brain are largely using metaphors. Language not being literality at all so things are always easily misinterpreted. But please, enlighten me, there is &quot;nothing pleasurable at all in dopamine release&quot; nor does it &quot;signal a rewarding/pleasurable event&quot;? Then why is it regarded as being crucial to motivation and reward? Why is a spike of dopamine linked with not only something on the verge of being accomplished BUT also with the consumption of cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, MDMA and other highly pleasurable drugs?? Mere coincidence I guess.
Really interested to hear the response on this one.</p>
<p>Oh and I stressed cortisol (yes, a hormone) over &quot;dopamine&quot;, and yes,
living a high-paced, alienated, modern, Western-style life does spike cortisol levels (among other negative things) that lead to defective mental and physical results in the human. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is nothing inherently pleasurable about dopamine. It's used by circuits that help modulate motion initiation (see Parkinson's disease), but nobody goes around saying &quot;dopamine is the motion neurotransmitter.&quot; Dopamine is also used in circuits that help control lactation (see tuberoinfundibular pathway), but nobody goes around calling dopamine the lactation neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a circuit in the brain that is involved in motivation, which includes some dopaminergic neurons. Those dopaminergic neurons do sometimes fire when an unexpected positive event occurs, but ALSO when an unexpected <em>negative</em> event occurs. </p>
<p>Should we then say that dopamine is rewarding, even though many non-reward related circuits use dopamine, and even though the motivation-related circuits you're thinking of use a half dozen transmitters besides dopamine, AND even though that circuit doesn't appear to actually encode pleasure / reward itself?</p></div>		</li>
