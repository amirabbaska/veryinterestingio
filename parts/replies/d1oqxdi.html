			<div class="markdown"><p>So why would a national leader such as Vladimir Putin or the King of Saudi Arabia need to hide their income if, for all intents and purposes, they are the state? In other words, in states known to be overwhelmingly run by corrupt leadership, why would they go through the trouble of getting involved in a massive overseas money laundering company when they can literally just say no to paying taxes?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not true. Putin will almost certainly not be president of Russia into his old age, and no matter how good of a autocrat you are, you cannot predict what will happen 10 years from now. </p>
<p>He's in the best possible position for you to be in if your goal is funneling Russia's wealth and resources into your own pockets. I'm not saying that's his overarching goal but if it was, there is no better place to be in than where Putin is., He's been exposed to have amassed an enormous fortune (my Russian friends say it's in multiple hundred billions, but almost certainly he has more than 10 billion) both directly and through family, friends and associates. </p>
<p>If he's peacefully forced into retirement, his party or close associates may also be removed from government, preventing him from any further embezzlement, at the very least, making it much harder for him do so. So he drains all the wealth he possibly can while he can. </p>
<p>Then again, he might forced into retirement not-so peacefully. Given the history of Russia, a revolutionary shift in power, either through elections, violence or a military coup is not out of the question. In such a scenario Putin could very well find himself arrested, his assets on the books frozen and facing life-time imprisonment or the death penalty by a court of his political opponents. Putin knows this and has done everything he can to prevent such scenarios, but if it comes to that he needs the means to flee Russia and maintain his quality of life abroad. </p>
<p>The same is similarly true for King Salman of Saudi Arabia. The Monarch of SA and his family, just like the Monarch of the UK had been for centuries until very recently, is under constant threat of assassination by his brothers, cousins, nephews and uncles. This is so because the Monarch is the only person between those people and ultimate power. Not only that, but the King also has many political opponents due to his extremely sectarian Wahhabi/Sunni government in a country so sharply divided by sect. Both a political uprising and overzealous family members are extremely real threats to the life and rule of the King Salman. He steals the wealth of the nation and impoverishes it's people to pay for his own insurance policy. Just like Putin, the King must also have the means to flee his homeland and maintain his lifestyle abroad.</p>
<p>What I've said here is true of any leader who maintains their rule through violence and oppression of political opponents. It was true for Mubarak, Saddam and Qaddafi and it is true of Assad, Erdogan, Kim-Jong Un, ... , insert favorite autocrat here. </p></div>		</li>

<p>A number of his close allies are also subject to U.S. sanctions. Since most international financial transactions go through the U.S. banks at some point, it is really hard to engage in any international commerce when you're hit with U.S. sanctions (as a Specially Designated National). If you have an account that hides your involvement, you can potentially bypass U.S. laws. (The U.S. does track financial flows, but that doesn't mean they have perfect information.)</p></div>		</li>

If there is a sudden uprising and they can manage to flee safely, they can still access their wealth this way. At least, that's one reason to get money offshore, it helps with retirement.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends a lot on the country and what was hiding. A larger corporation that just engaged in some &quot;grey-area&quot; tax dealings will probably just pay some big fines. I'd see it playing out in court like &quot;well, we didn't explicitly know these companies were fake, and we thought it was legal given the current laws&quot; or some line like that. In these cases it's probably more efficient for the government to just levy a huge fine and some future sanctions on a company rather than spending years and millions of taxpayer money to put a light prison or probation sentence on an executive. In fact, the way most major companies are set up the C-suite level guys are pretty insulated from issues like this. Not that they can't be legally liable on a company standpoint, as they have to sign off on all financial disclosures and are ultimately responsible for the company (at least for public companies here in the U.S.), but it shields them from a lot of personal liabilities if some senior manager decided to hide some profits like this to make his department look better.  </p>
<p>Now the individuals on the other hand, you will probably see some big arrests, not to mention I'd guess Panama will gladly cooperate with foreign governments seeing how much of their economy is tied to foreign investment in their country. Imagine if a major nation levied a ban on shipping through the panama canal because of lack of cooperation, or put investment sanctions on their country, not a good day. My guess is a lot more will come out once large nations start pressuring the Panama government. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to step in and answer this because the replies I see so far are either wrong or misleading. Corporations and high-net worth individuals will typically setup unique tax avoidance structures to cater to the specific business scenario in question. Ie. A tech company's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement#Dutch_sandwich" target="_blank">double irish with a dutch sandwich</a> structure is quite different than that used by PSP for its <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/pension-board-that-set-up-offshore-shell-companies-is-separate-from-government-tony-clement-affirms-1.2824974" target="_blank">investments in Berlin</a>. This means that different structures are required for different environments in order to reach the same end-goal of a tax-sheltered payback.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does the money get transferred from the shell company back to the &quot;investing&quot; company?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Typically, the <em>beneficiaries</em> that setup tax avoidance structures have connections to a foreign banker that is willing and able to confidentially open a bank account (usually in another tax haven; <em>cough</em> Zürich <em>cough</em>) for the shell company that receives the &quot;investment&quot;. Keep in mind, this shell company can be the last in a complex network of tens to hundreds of other shell companies that also have some form of anonymity/confidentiality embedded. Once a confidential bank account has been established the liquid cash or some equivalent is relatively easy to withdraw from the account anonymously as long as you can prove you're the owner which isn't a problem if you already know the banker. Bankers have incentive to keep your information confidential so that they can keep your business. This account also allows the shell company to make direct loans and investments as others have mentioned. </p>
<p>The end result is that the beneficiary is able to extract his tax-sheltered funds under the legal protection of a highly complex and confidential ownership structure. The complexity makes it extremely costly for law enforcement to fight legal battles with all the financial intermediaries and lawyers, especially when the structure may actually be <em>legal</em> (depending on where the money is coming from).</p></div>		</li>
