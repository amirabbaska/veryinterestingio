<p>Regarding when did homonids start cooking, it's unknown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't suggest an absolute timescale, but this information is interesting:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486186" target="_blank">Great apes prefer cooked food to raw</a> (NCBI)</p>
<p>I would expect that among fire-using humans cooking was &quot;discovered&quot; independently many, many times... every time someone dropped food into the fire by accident, in fact.  And that once it was discovered, it caught on immediately, literally that day, because it was very easy to do and produced a more palatable meal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tend to think the first instance of cooked meat being consumed was either from animals killed by wildfire or struck by lightning, and then scavenged upon by our ancestors and cousins.</p>
<p>If the original use of domesticated fire was to provide warmth, it doesn't make much sense that those in the tropics, where body hair was probably sufficient for homeostasis, would be using fire for anything but cooking and scaring off predators. If early hominids started using fire just to scare off predators and pests it's obviously because they know the animals don't want to get burned, so they also probably already know what burnt animals tasted like before fire was domesticated.</p>
<p>Following this line of reasoning one can conclude that domestication of fire did not lead to cooking, rather cooking lead to domestication of fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  Dogs create Neu5Gc.  They are not carries of Neu5Ac.  Dogs will always create it from eating proteins of any kind, cooked or raw.  Chimps would be a good candidate for dietary study though.  They carry both, but the Neu5Ac is much lower in their cells.  It would have to be a multi-generational study of course.</p>
<p>Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc is an absolutely fascinating subject to study.  We can trace it back to the creation of the homo genus, possible reasons humans have cancer(Neu5Gc is in all cancer cells), find cures for malaria and influenza, create supplements to increase myelin protein during infancy.  So many avenues to venture into.</p>
<p>Here's a fun fact.  Human breast milk is high in Neu5Ac.  Formulas do not.  Think about that before you decide to formula feed your child from the start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely fascinating to study, however you know such studies will just work to prove that veganism is superior, or that keto diets are better, or so. It's just going to devolve into a petty topic like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soybean has Oligosaccharide that's needed to create Neu5Ac.  Cow's milk has Neu5Gc but no Neu5Ac. Boiling it can breakdown the Neu5Gc.</p>
