			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you tried setting your alarm for one hour later than you currently have it? You'll still be getting up at the same time, but hopefully without snoozing, and therefore feel more refreshed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is likely a huge reson. I also have huge problems waking up, but you NEED to find some way to avoid snoozing. My method is to have something fun to look forward to immediately in the morning, to get me out of bed at the first alarm, so I alot some extra morning time for some gaming before work and it helps to some extent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From reading this it could just be a mindset (mentality) thing. Try going to sleep being ready to wake up so when your alarm goes off you burst out of bed giving your energy levels momentum for the morning and the day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Put your phone/alarm somewhere you have to get up out of bed to turn off the alarm. Keep a glass/bottle of water nearby, drink it when you turn the alarm off. Don't go lay back in bed, whatever you do. Have a backup alarm in case you fall asleep in a chair lol.</p></div>		</li>
