<p>It's not like a miracle cure, you're just diluting the smelly particles which have likely built up over years, you can only draw so much out at a time.  Also it's only removing odor, you're also going to want to wash/clean with something anti-bacterial to kill off the stuff that's actually making them smell.  Otherwise the odor is going to be replaced and replenished just as quickly as it can be diluted.</p></div>		</li>
