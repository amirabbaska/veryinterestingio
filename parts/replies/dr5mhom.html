			<div class="markdown"><p>With the world the way it is now, it wouldn’t surprise me.  I used to chew my cuticles till they bled so I started using hand sanitizer all the time (tastes disgusting).  That stopped me from chewing my cuticles but I haven’t been able to stop picking at my face.  Cognitive behavioral therapy has helped with the frequency that I do it, but whenever I have more anxiety than normal I’ll catch myself doing it again.  It’s annoying.</p></div>		</li>
