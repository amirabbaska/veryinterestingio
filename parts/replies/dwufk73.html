			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to that, it's not causing an absence of light <em>in total</em>, but it is redistributing it. Some parts of where the shadow is will be brighter and some will be darker. It's just a lot easier to notice the darker shadows than tge bright patches.</p>
<p>The very same concept applies to magnifying glasses. If you focus light through a magnifying glass you'll get a very bright spot, surrounded by a shadow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that why you can see the shadow of heat on the ground as well? Like from a fire. The thickness of the air making shadows from the sun going through it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, normally the light would cover the entire ground evenly. These shadows emerge when that light is being bent away from where it was going to go.</p>
<p>Nothing is blocking the light, rather the light is just being bent off-course and landing somewhere else.</p></div>		</li>
