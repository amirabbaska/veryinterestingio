			<div class="markdown"><p>Whilst that is true. The amount of herbal extract is so small it will have little effect on the body.</p>
<p>Most saw palmetto extracts are around 40-50:1 meaning 1 mg of extract is equivalent to 40 mg of herb and it is the equivalency that gets stated on the label. Most research is based on around 400 mg of extract.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. They fill the label as you say, pointless at such low doses.</p>
<p>They pretty much fulfil the same function as herbs in shampoo and cosmetics. They fill the consumer into thinking it is good and natural.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saw Palmetto contains 5a reductase inhibitors which prevent testosterone from being converted into dihydrotestostrone which is generally a negative thing for males as DHT is a 10x stronger androgen than testosterone. Plus it can mask the symptoms of potentially lethal prostate cancer... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Terribly broad and sweeping statements made here. Dihydrotestosterone also causes Benign prostate hyperplasia, And other issues. The supplements may potentially reduce the incidence of this illness and other DHT related issues.</p>
<p>Just because something is anabolic doesn’t mean you want to much of it, that is specifically the problem with the HT. Hence why the supplement is used and is proven to be effective in reducing DHT overall. Yes it can mask the symptoms of cancer, as a drug that does the same thing. Hence why you shouldn’t take this supplement before being checked, and you need to be checked for prostate cancer anyways based on a exam rather than blood work</p></div>		</li>
