			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting idea that populations with smaller alveolar ridges may be biased toward click languages, but if there is a bias, it must be a weak one considering how easily Bantu populations have acquired clicks in their languages. Unlike the San peoples, Bantu peoples have prominent alveolar ridges. To be fair though, the frequency and number of clicks in Bantu languages is much less than in Khoisan languages. It would be interesting to see if the Hadza or Sandawe people have similar palate anatomy as the San.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tangentially related research, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0065275" target="_blank">there's some evidence that says altitude influences a culture's language</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Languages with phonemic ejective consonants were found to occur closer to inhabitable regions of high elevation, when contrasted to languages without this class of sounds.</p>
<p>We suggest that ejective sounds might be facilitated at higher elevations due to the associated decrease in ambient air pressure, which reduces the physiological effort required for the compression of air in the pharyngeal cavityâ€“a unique articulatory component of ejective sounds. In addition, we hypothesize that ejective sounds may help to mitigate rates of water vapor loss through exhaled air. These explications demonstrate how a reduction of ambient air density could promote the usage of ejective phonemes in a given language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TLDR: Cultures at high altitudes use more <del>plosive sounds</del> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejective_consonant" target="_blank">ejective consonants</a> because in the thin air it's easier to pronounce and conserves moisture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article you linked writes about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejective_consonant" target="_blank">ejectives</a>, not plosives. Plosives are pervasive in all languages, but ejective phonemes are rare and do indeed have a higher concentration in languages spoken in elevated areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really interesting.  Thank you.  I wondered why a lot of people around here replace the middle t's with the d sound or drop them all together.  I figured it was just kind of lazy speech. </p></div>		</li>
