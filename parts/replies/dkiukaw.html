			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't.</p>
<p>We have some things to make landfills more eco-friendly, like tarps so chemicals don't leach into groundwater, or pumps to collect methane so it doesn't escape into the atmosphere (and we could use methane in industry). But that is really it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the idea is not that trash turns into soil. rather, we bury landfills and put nice things on top. hard to argue against more parks. in that respect, saying we'll run out of space for landfills is like saying we'll run out of dirt. it can't happen, not before the sun dies anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you're saying. 2 things though.</p>
<p>1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hard to argue against more parks and parking structures, <strong>we were gonna build those anyway</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. Since we were gonna build those anyway, then arguing against landfills is NOT arguing against more parks etc. It's that line of argument I find a little disingenuous. It's more that we can build more parks <em>in spite of</em> more landfills, not <em>because</em> of them</p>
<p>2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>saying we'll run out of space for landfills is synonymous with saying we'll run out of dirt. it can't happen, not before the sun dies anyway. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it's more like saying we'll run out of dirt that is sufficiently isolated from other systems and processes that we want to keep clean. And that's more of a question mark. And again, with innovation and effort I'm sure we could prevent that, but I wonder if that's really the best place to spend it   </p></div>		</li>

<li>
<p>Think of a landfill as a mandatory opportunity for something nice, then.  </p>
</li>
<li>I didn't mean available space, I meant literal dirt. Space is a non issue. If it really came down to it we could just put a second round of landfills of top parks that were already built on landfills. That would solve your isolation problem. If overpopulation really ends up doing us in, it's not going to be from too much trash. Like if 99% of the earth is covered and there's no more room, we will not look back and regret how we handled trash. There are a thousand other problems that will kill us long before that happens.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Golf courses and parks are pretty common uses, enough that I'm not going to list them all.  Freshkills Park (under construction) is probably the most famous (because it was also a pretty well known landfill of the same name), when complete it will be several times the size of Central Park.  Some more notable sites built on landfills include: Mile High Stadium (the old stadium where the Denver Broncos played football) and the Kennedy Presidential Library. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the eighties I visited a landfill as a field trip. They plowed over a pile of trash and pulled out a newspaper from the 60's still legible. The guide told us <em>&quot;when you are asked 'paper or plastic?' just remember that it does not matter if it ends up in a landfill.</em>&quot;</p></div>		</li>
