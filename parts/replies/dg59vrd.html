			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it was to do with the origins of the parties. Originally the two major parties were the Labor party (representing the unions/people so they were liberal) and the National Party (mostly farmers and religious, so more conservative). Disagreements in the Labor party lead to the formation of the Liberal Party. Over time they came to become more popular and support businesses and the unions stuck with Labor so they didn't have a choice. Now it's mostly Labor as left and Liberal as right. The Nationals and Liberals are good friends and are in a coalition in the federal government currently. </p>
<p>Edit: forgot some stuff. </p>
<p>They called themselves the Liberal Party because at the time they still were connected to Labor which was a central-left party so &quot;Liberal&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent explanation! I wanted to piggyback and add a couple of things. </p>
<p>American politics has also somehow managed to make itself very rigid. 'Liberals' exist in a box with a fixed set of beliefs, and 'conservatives' in another. </p>
<p>I'm not American,but the impression I get is that it is not socially acceptable to agree with some liberal and some conservative policies. You're either a republican or a democrat, and from the outside it looks like there is no overlap. Both parties don't seem to be able to agree on controversial issues - they are forced by convention to disagree, even if they personally might think differently. </p>
<p>Basically this just divides the population into 'us' and 'them'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only true in media - social and broadcast. The vast majority of Americans hold both right and left-wing beliefs and it's almost universally socially acceptable to identify as &quot;independent.&quot; Depending where you are, that may be the most socially acceptable political category to declare yourself in. </p>
<p>The thing is, the parties usually have grossly partisan platform items that many independents find so abhorrent they can't, in good conscience, support a candidate from either party. For instance, my sister is a liberal Catholic but can't vote for Democrats in good conscience because she is religiously opposed to their pro-choice views and can't vote for Republicans because she is opposed to their anti-social justice policies. She is only one data point but in my experience this is very common. </p>
<p>This, coupled with decades of deteriorating faith in the responsiveness of the federal government to the will of the people, is a major reason why voter turnout is so low here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of overlap, but those are the moderates and are usually less outspoken. When you trend toward either extreme, left or right, you get more loud, disagreeable people. It makes it seem like there is more of a us vs them mentality than I think there really is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same in the Netherlands. The political field is actually devided in a spectrum where you have:</p>
<p>Economical: left(socialist) vs right (classical liberalism)</p>
<p>Social-cultural: progressive(what you guys call social liberalism) vs conservative </p>
<p>This would be the Dutch political landscape in such a spectrum, as you can see there are parties that are both rightwing (economical liberal) and progressive(social liberal) <a href="https://m.imgur.com/a/R8lAH" target="_blank">https://m.imgur.com/a/R8lAH</a></p></div>		</li>
