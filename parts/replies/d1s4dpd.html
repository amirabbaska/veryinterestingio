			<div class="markdown"><p>The reuse of crushed concrete as aggregate is not without risks and uncertainty. The reason why 50-year roadbeds always use &quot;virgin&quot; aggregate is its enormous fractal-like surface area, which permits the cement to form a strong bond. Crushed concrete is inferior in this regard. Look closely at a piece of crushed concrete sometime and it will be immediately obvious.</p>
<p>Of course the problem with virgin aggregate is that it must be mined, which is becoming increasingly expensive for all the usual reasons.</p>
<p>A few states are testing crushed concrete in specific (marked) sections of highway, to see if its inferiority is tolerable. They are also testing whether it can be compensated for by mixing in a certain percentage of virgin aggregate, or by using advanced cements. Those tests take years and years to run, though, so you won't see crushed concrete in 50-year-life projects any time soon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We toyed around with this stuff in college during small projects, and noticed some pretty distinctive differences in setting times between fresh aggregate and recycled concrete.  It was difficult to work with and slump tests were pretty unpredictable because mix ratios were all over the place.  The chemical reactions are grossly limited with recycled material, and strength suffered as a result.  Our professor let us use it though because it's cheap and he had plenty of old cylinders and beams that he could have crushed and reused, and it wasn't like we were building bridges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing no one has mentioned Is that the recycled Concrete has air pockets which can soak up the water from the mix which is part of what affects the strength. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mention that its use as aggregate is not very reliable, but what about the use of old concrete as a foundation below the asphalt? Right now the road next to my home is being renewed and they're using concrete from some demolition works nearby as the foundation layer, so I'm wondering if there are any drawbacks to that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is a very common use. You're very correct. Recycled agg is not acceptable for state roadbuilding, but it is used as loose aggregate below the asphalt. The downsides are inconsistent compression based on different qualities of agg, but that is typically addressed by engineers and mixes of virgin / recycled and performance of the recycled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use concrete aggregate in my driveway as gravel, and for my purposes it is better in many ways than real gravel. </p>
<ol>
<li>It is less expensive (generally)</li>
<li>Because it is softer bits break off and then bed together more solidly</li>
<li>It is more abrasive and so tends not to shift as much under heavy load</li>
</ol>
<p>It should be noted that I have daily heavy truck traffic in my driveway (low speed).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason that it isn't used in pavement design is due to the reason you described where it breaks up to form a better interlock.  That is why I specifically mentioned that recycled aggregates are not used where they are subject to cyclic loading. </p>
<p>In road design the interlock/compaction relationship is calculated beforehand based on traffic flows and lifespan and the aggregate is specified based on a grading curve that matches the requirements.  The road is then placed and a compaction pattern established to achieve 95% compaction or greater of the material within 5% of the optimum moisture content.  The compaction and moisture content goals are based on the standard Proctor test, where the material is tested in a lab. </p>
<p>The last thing a road designer wants is the grading curve of the material to change during compaction or  over time, which is the bedding you describe. That will affects the compaction characteristics of the material and the compaction calculations will be wrong.  If the material isn't compacted correctly it will fail.  If the material breaks down over time, it will cause the surface to fail before the design life is achieved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, completely agree. My application is as a gravel surface. Use as an underlayment for a sealed surfaces would have significantly different desirable qualities.</p>

<p>Is this what causes the slightly U shaped gouges by wheel wear in some roads?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The compaction results are typical based on a modified proctor for road design, not standard, because the energy provided during compaction are greater in the modified. I live in the Eastern US so it may be different in the UK. For all intents and purposes i have never seen a state of federal specification that uses recycled concrete aggregate (we just call it RCA) as a sub-base. Its usually calls for a densely graded aggregate (DGA) which is basically just some sand and gravel. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I get fairly course grind most of the time, but even the finer stuff isn't too dusty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah perfect. I actually have expertise in this and worked on a few acquisitions of concrete recyclers in texas.</p>
<p>In a few regions in the US, concerete is recycled as aggregate to make more concrete. In some scenarios, such as roadbuilding, specs limit to what extent recycled concrete (or any at all) can be included. In other instances, sidewalks for example, are perfect for recycled agg because there is already cement in the agg (because it is concrete), making the stuff sticker and better adhered. The downside is that there can be inconsistencies, but I think that is mostly sales stuff from retailers and virgin agg producers to benefit the existing supply chain. A lot of construction firms i talked to actually preferred recycled agg.</p>
<p>However, recycled agg is a LOW margin game. You need to be vertically integrated in most cases to handle demolition, processing, and then resale of aggregate, and you don't net a lot of money.</p>
<p>Demand side: Houston was the largest market for recycled concrete due to high demand, based on the construction industry. They are building a 3rd ring freeway loop around the city, and there was massive commercial and residential construction as well (10x construction in NYC), so demand was excessive.</p>
<p>Supply side: However, supply was limited. Shipping costs as a percent of total costs of a material asset essentially determine the distance that it can be shipped before it becomes unprofitable. Aggregate, which is mixed with cement to make concrete, is also known as &quot;rocks.&quot; Rocks are very inexpensive, and very costly to ship. As a result, it's difficult to ship aggregate very far in a productive fasion - trucking is right out, and even trains are expensive in houston because The closest quarry is about 200 miles north. In houston, Limestone is also shipped north from the yucutan on barges for similar economics. </p>
<p>As a result of the amount of demolition, high demand, and low supply of agg, recycled concrete was popular in houston. I have no idea how it's doing now. There is not a lot of publicly available info out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, North Houston here, our business driveway is crushed concrete. I couldn't figure out how when purchasing a truckload all the places I called seemed so busy. This certainly explains it. No one was too excited to sell me a single truckload, some just said &quot;no, you are too far&quot;. Also, I certainly noticed the consolidation from one year to the next. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>haha yup, that was me! Our caveat emptor was &quot;beware economic environment shifts, particularly the price of oil, as a major driver of demand for recycled agg, displaying an even higher market beta than virgin agg.&quot; We then proceeded to completely ignore that, and then oil prices came tumbling down.</p>
<p>I've always wondered what happened in the aftermath of those acqusitions - how has the shift in oil prices and continually slowing eocnomy affected construction? What about the 3rd ring freeway construction? Last time i looked at this was late '14 or early '15.</p></div>		</li>
