			<p>The reuse of crushed concrete as aggregate is not without risks and uncertainty. The reason why 50-year roadbeds always use &quot;virgin&quot; aggregate is its enormous fractal-like surface area, which permits the cement to form a strong bond. Crushed concrete is inferior in this regard. Look closely at a piece of crushed concrete sometime and it will be immediately obvious.<br><br>Of course the problem with virgin aggregate is that it must be mined, which is becoming increasingly expensive for all the usual reasons.<br><br>A few states are testing crushed concrete in specific (marked) sections of highway, to see if its inferiority is tolerable. They are also testing whether it can be compensated for by mixing in a certain percentage of virgin aggregate, or by using advanced cements. Those tests take years and years to run, though, so you won't see crushed concrete in 50-year-life projects any time soon.</p>		</li>

			<p>We toyed around with this stuff in college during small projects, and noticed some pretty distinctive differences in setting times between fresh aggregate and recycled concrete.  It was difficult to work with and slump tests were pretty unpredictable because mix ratios were all over the place.  The chemical reactions are grossly limited with recycled material, and strength suffered as a result.  Our professor let us use it though because it's cheap and he had plenty of old cylinders and beams that he could have crushed and reused, and it wasn't like we were building bridges.</p>		</li>

			<p>Another thing no one has mentioned Is that the recycled Concrete has air pockets which can soak up the water from the mix which is part of what affects the strength. </p>		</li>

			<p>I don't see this as being that big of problem as moisture content of aggregate has to be factored into the mix design. The recycled concrete being porous may increase the water demand, but this can be accounted for. </p>		</li>

			<p>You mention that its use as aggregate is not very reliable, but what about the use of old concrete as a foundation below the asphalt? Right now the road next to my home is being renewed and they're using concrete from some demolition works nearby as the foundation layer, so I'm wondering if there are any drawbacks to that.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, that is a very common use. You're very correct. Recycled agg is not acceptable for state roadbuilding, but it is used as loose aggregate below the asphalt. The downsides are inconsistent compression based on different qualities of agg, but that is typically addressed by engineers and mixes of virgin / recycled and performance of the recycled.</p>		</li>

			<p>Asphalt paver here.  I have used crushed concrete (as a base) on only a few jobs.  Two instances led to complete failure of the asphalt at points where traffic was starting/stopping.  The flexible asphalt mat was shoving while the recycle concrete base had basically turned back into a rigid concrete-like structure below.  I would recommend adding a lot of virgin sand if you try it for road base.</p>		</li>

			<p>Thats an odd one to blame on the base. Shoving is a asphalt mix failure, not a base failure especially if your base is hard enough. You can pave asphalt directly onto reinforced concrete without issues. <br>Besides, don't you test the stiffness of your base before paving the asphalt on the top?<br><br>It sounds more like someone used the wrong mix design for the volume and type of traffic that road is experiencing. A high strength mix like an SMA or increasing the strength of the base is a common solution for that problem. </p>		</li>

			<p>Ya thanks.  I've been doing it for 25 years as a project manager and 8 years before that as engineering tech/materials tester.  We don't test for &quot;stiffness&quot; we test for density.  A regular gravel base still has some flexibility and will tend to both move with excess downward pressure as well as provide a better keyed surface for the asphalt to resist sliding. <br><br>Wasn't the mix either.  Same mix on the same road with the same volume of traffic but 2 intersections away - no issues on regular gravel base.  Used it later on a haul road and had the same problem with displacement from the wheel path creating rutting and tearing.<br><br>You can not pave directly onto reinforced concrete without issue.  I am taking issue with that.  Maybe you do it in a parking lot or something but don't even think of doing highways like that where there is any kind of weather and freeze/thaw cycle.  Disastrous.</p>		</li>

			<p>We've done it lots of places here including inside a motorway tunnel carrying about 180,000 vehicles per day. Freeze thaw could be a significant difference that I don't really deal with (it snows here very, very lightly about once every 70 years and it doesn't get crazy hit either so regular freezing or high temperatures aren't a design condition we have to worry about.)<br><br>How well it binds to the base could be a pretty big deal too. I can definitely see the asphalt sliding on the base leading to problems occurring in the mix that wouldn't look like a normal base failure...<br><br>Some of our sites we test density (usually with a nuclear source) but a lot of them are also tested for deflection with benkleman beam test. Ancient tech I know, but fairly standard here. </p>		</li>

			<p>Never a good idea to mix an oil based product with a water based product. Putting oil based concrete (asphalt) on top of water based concrete never works. The same applies to coatings for concrete. I wouldn't think using it as a base would be a great idea for asphalt. I have used recycled concrete as base for pipe bedding and such though and it works pretty good for that. Typically I've seen strength increases when used in fresh concrete though but it's never consistent. <br></p>		</li>

			<p>They did this all over upperstate NY.  Before paving the asphalt layer they score the concrete surface with ether diamond milling or dropping a guillotine-like device every few inches.  Sometimes they pocked the surface with many little holes, too.  It just looked like a bad idea to everyone who saw it.<br><br>In Pennsylvania they would instead cut the entire road section out and repour new concrete with new rebar, too.  It took days to cure and seemed a better but far more expensive, labor intensive, and slow idea.<br><br>TIL we're running out of concrete.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>The reason that it isn't used in pavement design is due to the reason you described where it breaks up to form a better interlock.  That is why I specifically mentioned that recycled aggregates are not used where they are subject to cyclic loading. <br><br>In road design the interlock/compaction relationship is calculated beforehand based on traffic flows and lifespan and the aggregate is specified based on a grading curve that matches the requirements.  The road is then placed and a compaction pattern established to achieve 95% compaction or greater of the material within 5% of the optimum moisture content.  The compaction and moisture content goals are based on the standard Proctor test, where the material is tested in a lab. <br><br>The last thing a road designer wants is the grading curve of the material to change during compaction or  over time, which is the bedding you describe. That will affects the compaction characteristics of the material and the compaction calculations will be wrong.  If the material isn't compacted correctly it will fail.  If the material breaks down over time, it will cause the surface to fail before the design life is achieved.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MidnightAdventurer" target="_blank">MidnightAdventurer</a>
			<p>It depends. They are caused by a failure somewhere in the pavement or of the ground underneath (which is itself a failure of the pavement to protect the subgrade or an end of the design life problem)<br><br>If the gouges are really sharp and you can see the gap between double tyres then it's a fairly shallow problem (usually with the top layer) if the ruts are deep and wide then you have a problem further downs, either at the bottom of the pavement or the ground underneath it.<br><br>Bringing it back to the crushed concrete material, if your stone in the pavement is being crushed in service then it will subside and you are likely to get this sort of failure. You can avoid the by putting it lower down where the force has been spread out by the material further up so it takes less load and by ensuring you compact it properly during construction (also by not using it where it isn't strong enough)</p>		</li>

			<p>The compaction results are typical based on a modified proctor for road design, not standard, because the energy provided during compaction are greater in the modified. I live in the Eastern US so it may be different in the UK. For all intents and purposes i have never seen a state of federal specification that uses recycled concrete aggregate (we just call it RCA) as a sub-base. Its usually calls for a densely graded aggregate (DGA) which is basically just some sand and gravel. </p>		</li>

			<p>Yup, you are correct, it's a modified Proctor. <br><br>It's been over 10 years since I worked in the states (eastern US too actually) but I was involved in material testing and road design (WACEL area) so really should have known that.  Interestingly, in the U.K. We generally don't use Nuclear density or Proctor testing to test compaction under highways and usually specify compaction patterns based on guidelines in highway construction manuals (MCDHW series 600) and then test at the top of subgrade to confirm the required CBR has been achieved.  <br><br>Same as your experience, I've never seen RCA used in road construction nevermind specifying it and would be very sceptical if I did see it being used to be honest. </p>		</li>

			<p>Ah perfect. I actually have expertise in this and worked on a few acquisitions of concrete recyclers in texas.<br><br>In a few regions in the US, concerete is recycled as aggregate to make more concrete. In some scenarios, such as roadbuilding, specs limit to what extent recycled concrete (or any at all) can be included. In other instances, sidewalks for example, are perfect for recycled agg because there is already cement in the agg (because it is concrete), making the stuff sticker and better adhered. The downside is that there can be inconsistencies, but I think that is mostly sales stuff from retailers and virgin agg producers to benefit the existing supply chain. A lot of construction firms i talked to actually preferred recycled agg.<br><br>However, recycled agg is a LOW margin game. You need to be vertically integrated in most cases to handle demolition, processing, and then resale of aggregate, and you don't net a lot of money.<br><br>Demand side: Houston was the largest market for recycled concrete due to high demand, based on the construction industry. They are building a 3rd ring freeway loop around the city, and there was massive commercial and residential construction as well (10x construction in NYC), so demand was excessive.<br><br>Supply side: However, supply was limited. Shipping costs as a percent of total costs of a material asset essentially determine the distance that it can be shipped before it becomes unprofitable. Aggregate, which is mixed with cement to make concrete, is also known as &quot;rocks.&quot; Rocks are very inexpensive, and very costly to ship. As a result, it's difficult to ship aggregate very far in a productive fasion - trucking is right out, and even trains are expensive in houston because The closest quarry is about 200 miles north. In houston, Limestone is also shipped north from the yucutan on barges for similar economics. <br><br>As a result of the amount of demolition, high demand, and low supply of agg, recycled concrete was popular in houston. I have no idea how it's doing now. There is not a lot of publicly available info out there.</p>		</li>

			<p>Huh, North Houston here, our business driveway is crushed concrete. I couldn't figure out how when purchasing a truckload all the places I called seemed so busy. This certainly explains it.

			<p>haha yup, that was me! Our caveat emptor was &quot;beware economic environment shifts, particularly the price of oil, as a major driver of demand for recycled agg, displaying an even higher market beta than virgin agg.&quot; We then proceeded to completely ignore that, and then oil prices came tumbling down.<br><br>I've always wondered what happened in the aftermath of those acqusitions - how has the shift in oil prices and continually slowing eocnomy affected construction? What about the 3rd ring freeway construction? Last time i looked at this was late '14 or early '15.</p>		</li>
