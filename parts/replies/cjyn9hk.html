			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing. As the pressure was already equalized before you plugged it with your finger, there will be equal pressure on both sides and no force will be applied.</p>
<p>If you plug the hole when you're on the ground and keep it plugged while you climb, you will be trapping the air at sea level pressure. Cabins are typically kept at a pressure equal to that of about 6,900 feet above sea level, which is ~.79bar. So, you have a pressure differential of .21bar.</p>
<p>Lets assume that the window is 10 inches by 15 inches in size. Converting to metric, we get an area of 25cm * 38cm = about 0.01m^2.</p>
<p>So, as 1bar is equal to 100,000 Newtons/m^2 , we can multiply through:</p>
<p>.21bar <em> (100,000 Newtons/m^2 )/bar </em> .01m^2 = 210 newtons, which is about 50 pounds.</p>
<p>So, if you plug the hole in the window by the time the airplane is at cruising altitude there will be 50 pounds of force being applied to the glass and the window frame. I'm going to assume that this was accounted for in the design specification of the plane, but it probably wouldn't be great if it happened all the time or on all the windows at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the plane you have a Delta P of 8 to 11ish psi (for some high flying bizjets) cabin pressure compared to ambient.  The atmospheric pressure at cruise is only a couple psi, so the force would be much greater then 50 lbs.  That being said the air still has to go through quite a small hole so it wouldn't all suddenly hit the pane if you took your finger away.</p></div>		</li>
