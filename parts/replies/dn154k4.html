			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a loud chewer myself. Had braces really young and only my front teeth touch. I suffer from TMJ issues. Having you describe my bite as a means to loud chewing is kinda weird. I've always wondered why I make so much noise while eating. I can't help it. Took my wife years to get over it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait a minute... I am also in Dentistry... at 12 he should not have baby teeth espeacially not posteriors. Something isn't adding up. His adult k9s should be coming in as his last teeth at this time though (besides 3rd molars). When those k9 teeth come in and provide K9 guidance perhaps this will help. (Btw are you looking to hire anyone from the class of 2019? haha)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, but he doesn't fit the norm. His baby molars suffer ankylosis. Actually had his baby canines extracted by the dentist this last year to allow his adult ones to finally erupt. (They haven't.).  My heart breaks for the condition of his teeth mostly due to the wear. - so much so that the loud chewing is hardly a concern anymore in the grand scheme of things. Anyway, ortho follow up next week. Hopefully, we can move forward with his treatment, and establish any sort of appropriate occlusion. Thanks for the reply. </p></div>		</li>
