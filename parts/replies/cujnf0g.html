			<p>Piggy backing on this one to point out that there is also a historical factor at play.  Modern Japanese government is no where near as old as the Yakuza.  In my reading, I've come across references to the Yakuza going back well into the Shogun era and possibly before.  <br><br>The current style of government is actually pretty new.  So you have this really old and established criminal organization and this pretty young/new government.  The power dynamics quite simply have never existed to remove the Yakuza from Japan and likely never will.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Exactly, so it's a very well established part of the culture that isn't going anywhere.  <br><br>Honestly, this is a great question to ask over at /r/history or /r/japan to get a better handle on.  I really don't have a good handle on it myself I just know that it shows up a lot in lit. about Japan as just a normal thing.  The stuff that I've seen placing it as an existing thing in the Shogun era mostly revolves around the Floating World and the wood cut artwork, so your mileage may vary.</p>		</li>

			<p>Not sure how accurate, nut you seem as interested as I am. I read about the &quot;Otokodate&quot; - Kind of a precursor to Yakuza. They were men of deep principle and protected the coomon folk from ego'd out Samurai. Often these guys were just ronin samurai but they organized and, well....next thing you know...Do you know anything about the Otokodate? Did what I read reflect accurately? </p>		</li>

I really wouldn't be surprised if you know more than I do, but that does sound familiar.  I'd ask /r/history if you really want to know.  </p>		</li>

			<p>So, I am not sure if mafias in other countries operate the same way, but the Japanese mafia does a number of things to help keep Japan safe. One of these things is through very strictly enforcing a zero tolerance drug policy. They are incredibly good at keeping drugs off of the streets.<br>The mafia also provided a lot of humanitarian relief in the wake of the recent tsunami. However, this relief came in the form of homeless workers cleaning up extremely contaminated parts of the nuclear reactor. When recruiting these people, the yakuza asked them if they wanted to work, but provided very little information as to what they would be doing and where they would be doing it. And, while they did give them work, those people then became severely indebted to the yakuza and were overall worse off than they were before. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; They are &quot;tolerated&quot; because to convict someone you need to have evidence<br><br>To a certain degree this is true. The Yakuza, Mafia and organized crimes offer a level of structure where the local authority and enforcement is antagonistic. The Italian Mafia for example provided stability in Italian neighborhoods that were being exploited by the more dominant whites. The Yakuza provided stability to immigrant neighborhoods as well as Japan's outcast, which is why a large number of their soldiers, leuitenants, etc... are of Korean-Japanese background among other nationalities.</p>		</li>

			<p>The source is old by now (likely almost a decade), it could have changed due to circumstances but I doubt it considering it is Japan. When one considers political leanings, may not have much to do in connection with organized crime's affiliation towards politics. It may just be the case the far-right is far more interested in utilizing violence, and would trade political favors to the Yakuza.<br><br>Another thing to consider is that since the far-right is much more likely to exercise violence against non-Japanese, it would be in the interest of groups like Yakuza to remain close ties to those that may threaten them the most.<br><br>edit: Another error that is common, is to ignore that the Yakuza have survived many other governments before the current Japanese government. They survived the pre-Samurai, Samurai and their chaos, the Meiji era, etc... and have been around far longer than this conception of the 'far-right'.</p>		</li>

Before he moved to Switzerland the Yakuza approached him and asked him to write an e-mail spam program or something like that. They gave him 10K Euros for it.

			<p>In the states there's RICO, which is a law passed specifically to address the issues you talked about. The mafia is 100x less powerful today than in the 60s/70s specifically because of RICO. Basically the mafia in the US today is a minor player, and most illegal activities have migrated to less organized, more violent street gangs. Kinda interesting how the road to hell is paved with good intentions isn't it?</p>		</li>

			<p>Racketeering is committing a crime for the benefit of a larger criminal organization. Like how robbing someone with a gun will get a longer sentence than doing it with your fists, the RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) Act was used to inflate the time that mob members were facing for the crimes that could be proven. That got more of them to squeal and plea bargain.</p>		</li>

			<p>It allowed the government to better tackle organized crime. Ordering people to commit crimes was now able to be prosecuted, for example. Overall, the RICO act gave law enforcement the tools it needed to deal with organized crime, which wasn't a concept old laws really dealt with. Organized crime wasn't a thing in the law, as most laws assumed that crimes were largely unrelated to each other. </p>		</li>

			<p>What does that have to do with anything? The whole series is critically acclaimed, I just gave the most recent example. It's available for preorder and will be released in a few months anyway. It's more relevant to the Yakuza discussion than Sleeping Dogs, regardless of which game someone prefers.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not sure it was true that I didn't leave a lot of evidence in that game. </p>		</li>

			<p>In the U.S. under RICO laws, they can arrest everyone with a diamond tattoo for one diamond-tattooed persons actions.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's also partly that with a few exceptions (protection racket, e.g.), the innocent public doesn't have run-ins with Yakuza. It's hard to get public support to invest resources in anti-organized-crime efforts when most people's experience with Yakuza is either neutral or <em>positive</em> (e.g. they help with relief efforts when there are disasters).</p>		</li>

			<p>if this is the case, how has the US been so successfull at eradicating our organized crime (excluding the hispanic/black street gangs)? When my grandfather grew up in queens, the italian/sicilian mob used to run the whole thing and now they are little more than a novelty.</p>		</li>
