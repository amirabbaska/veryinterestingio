			<div class="markdown"><p>This, for survivability, on the species level, having two individuals with one had each is just as good than having 2 heads on one individuals</p>
<p>Way better in fact because everything gets double the survival chances, while being simpler, not caring extra weight or consuming extra energy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Humans are social animals and we are successful because there are so many of us and we work relatively well together, one human, from the evolution standpoint, is not nearly as important as two humans, and so on. Social cooperation makes us stronger than two heads on one person.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And Zeus said, &quot;No,
You better let me
Use my lightning, like scissors,
Like I cut the legs off the whales
And dinosaurs into lizards.&quot;</p>
<p>Then he grabbed up some bolts
And he let out a laugh,
Said, &quot;I'll split them right down the middle.
Gonna cut them right up in half.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a pretty good summary of what would be a better survival strategy.  Two heads gives some minor benefits but much larger drawbacks.  But, giving each head its own body, pretty much removes all of the drawbacks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A hypothetical second head would be beneficial if one head sleeps while the other is awake and vice versa. That way an animal could spend 24 hours looking for food and mates and be fully alert at all times so predators would pose less of a risk.</p>
<p>Having said that, all the downsides people posted in this thread make a lot more sense than the weird hypothetical I just wrote down.</p></div>		</li>
