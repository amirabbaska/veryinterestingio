			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand correctly a vector is a imaginary line between an objects origin point and and a point defined by a xyz location</p>
<p>So if you rotate around this vector(line) you get a new extra number for the angle that the object gets rotated around the vector(line)</p>
<p>I tried a little experiment and made a line stretching from x=0,y=0,z=0 to x=1,y=1,z=1 for a visual reference.</p>
<p>Than i took a cube, set the rotation to quaternion and set rotation value to x=1,y=1,z=1 and than played with the W value, and as expected it rotates around the visual reference line like it is pinned.</p>
<p>So thank you for helping me understand the w value in a predictable manor,</p>
<p>You can point your object with the xyz value, but with only these values you would not be able to rotate around the pointing direction, thus therefore the w value.</p>
<p>Still, If it wasn't for some software conversion magic I would not be able to animate by inputting numbers and have a result that I can easily predict.</p>
<p>Thank you math people.</p>
<p>Edit: After some more research what I described is more like &quot;axis angle&quot; where &quot;XYZ&quot; defines the axis with a vector and &quot;W&quot; is the rotation around that axis in radians.
quaternions is similar but different.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Let me try instead, I did a whole thesis on quaternion transformations with the purpose of developing a monitoring system with sensors to help the revalidation of people with back issues.</p>
