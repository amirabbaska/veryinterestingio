<p>The problem is language. They get frustrated because they canâ€™t communicate in great detail.</p>

<p>The funny thing is if you teach them sign language, they pick that up much earlier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taught my baby a few signs (some essential every day items, basic feelings and needs, etc) and has been great for us. We're currently in that 'in between' stage, a few months shy of speaking and gets damn frustrated when her babbling isn't understood. The few basic/core signs save us so much time and frustration otherwise spent on trouble shooting or guesswork. Oh, you're cold? Bam, sweater. Tooth coming in? Bam. Tylenol. Jerry the purple hippo wants to dance but can't do so until he is wearing your Elmo socks? Bam, meltdown. How am I suppose to know that??!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  They KNOW what they want to say, but don't have the ability.  That's why toddlers throw fits half the time, they're frustrated.</p>
<p>My 1.5yo is a hoot.  She will jabber, point her finger, have all the tone like she's saying something real.  But she only says a handful of actual words.</p></div>		</li>
