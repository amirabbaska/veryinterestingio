			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very good question and there is one answer that is generally accepted to be the reason why. During the formation of the universe, specifically as galaxies were being formed, it is believed that the temperature would have been too great forthe baryonic matter to cling to itself and form self-bound objects using gravitational forces. Think about it in terms of thermodynamics in chemistry. Say we have some water. If we were to heat that water up until it became a gas we would be increasing the entropy of it. Entropy is a measure of disorder or chaos in a given system. These gas particles have so much energy that their molecular attractions to eachother is negligible. Now say we decrease the entropy of that system by cooling the gas back down. The molecules begin losing energy and eventually their molecular attractions begin to matter and you get the formation of liquid or solid water. Now apply to this dark matter swapping molecular attractions for gravity. Now as for the reason it formed a disk like shape is hypothesised to be due to cold dark matter (CDM) which is a whole other topic. Sorry for the wall of text!</p></div>		</li>

<p>The first link is an article discussing some of the newer ideas of the theory. The second link tries to explain the theory and I believe it does well explaining it as simply as possible. Hope these help! Yet again I'm sorry for formatting im on mobile. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Good analogy.  So with dark matter being a &quot;gaseous&quot; like state, do we know then if and how much entropy is lost when in a system like a galaxy?  Does it become CDM if it does?  Can dark matter gain entropy?  </p>
<p>Do we know anything about the mass and density of dark matter?  I noticed that Dragonfly 44 was found to be 99% composed of dark matter, which, if dark matter is uniformly distributed like a gas, and doesn't condense or collapse under gravity as a result, shouldn't that galaxy tell us a lot?  We know the mass, but does that mean we still can't figure out the volume?  If dark matter doesn't interact with EM radiation, but it does to gravity, what keeps a galaxy like that in a cloud like state?  Wouldn't it all completely collapse around a grain of dust?  They say they are probably made up of WIMPs, does that apply on the atomic level to where they could be compressed around a small gravitational source that's more dense than the dark matter?  There's no EM or Strong force, right?  Or really, why don't they just stick to each other?  Isn't the EM repulsion what keeps atoms from collapsing with the -electrons whizzing around them, repulsing the other atoms' electrons?  Do they really just smack into one another every once in a while?  But they've never detected anything, anywhere, even with those germanium detectors that should detect a direct hit to the nucleus.  Nothing...  </p>
<p>I'm in particular interested in the potential variation in the speed of light, especially in the early universe.  On a very basic level, most things, even light, can be altered in some way.  </p>

<p>The Horizon Problem in the early universe has me skeptical about the dark matter and inflation problems with the universe.  </p>

<p>Wouldn't it cling to, or form its own bodies, even if it's invisible?  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although gravity is the dominant force on large scales, it does not do much at the scale of atoms and molecules. For those to cling together they need electromagnetic force, which dark matter does not have (which is what makes it 'dark'). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Planets are made of normal matter that does cling together by EM forces. </p></div>		</li>
