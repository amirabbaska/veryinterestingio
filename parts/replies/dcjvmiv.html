<p>An excerpt: &quot;You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on arriving at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided that the ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, a horse splashes.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>This has a lot to do with terminal velocity rather than just weight. Dropping a mouse 10 feet isn't much different from 1000 feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Remember, there's a non-zero chance of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesna_Vulovi%C4%87" target="_blank">human surviving a fall without a parachute from cruising altitude</a>. There are also parachutists whose parachute has failed to deploy but who have still lived to tell the tale. Chances are a person falling about 1km onto a relatively soft surface will be effectively broken, but I don't think they would be pulverised.</p></div>		</li>
