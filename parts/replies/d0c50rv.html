			<div class="markdown"><p>A month would be for a REALLY small indie. </p>
<p>Avengers filmed for, I think, 90 days on main unit and 45 on 2nd unit. Something like Southpaw, for example, would be more like 50 days. Perks of Being a Wallflower was, I think, 37 days. Now keep in mind these are shooting days, and you only shoot 5 days a week in a typical scenario, so more like 2-3 months for average movies, and that's just principle production, you have another couple months of pre-production in front of that and post production on the back end. TV shoots faster, but not as fast as you'd think. A lot of those 22 episode network shows basically shoot 10-11 months a year, scheduling 8-10 days an episode with a day or 2 of 2nd unit stuff in there. They also beat the shit out of the crew and run and gun. Half the prestige, twice the work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Avengers, being one of the biggest movies of all time, isn't typical. </p>
<p>REALLY small indies either take a lot less time, because they can't afford to pay cast and crew for very long (and cast/crew can't afford to spend a long time working for little to no pay), or they take a lot longer because they have to shoot around schedules. I once worked on a feature that took over 6 months to shoot because it was shot entirely nights and weekends. Total budget was less than $10,000, mostly going to food. </p>
<p>Very few movies--including major Hollywood studio movies--have the budget for a 2-3 month production. </p>
<p>So much depends on the genre. For a show like Friends, 1 day of shooting is plenty. An action- or effects-heavy show may take 2 weeks or more per ep, which is why so many shows are moving to 13, 10, or even 8 episode seasons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>37 days is pretty average for a drama without a lot of locations/VFX - I wouldn't call that REALLY small indie. I'd call it 'indie' </p>
<p>I come from a world of a film industry that was growing, stable, and getting bigger - features were often 'home grown' in the province and shot for about 1.2 million* or around 100K - the 1.2Mil features usually shot for about 30-40 days and the 100K features shot for 20, sometimes 30</p>
<p>*the way the union works, if you shoot a feature for 1.5 million you suddenly have to pay everyone more so there are cases of productions turning DOWN some funding to keep under that so more money can go towards actually making the film</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An average good day of filming should produce 3-5 minutes of usable footage. When a production has it's shit together like I'm sure Game of Thrones has by now producing 10 episodes should be easily done in 7-10 months. </p>
<p>Writing those episodes and those episodes actually be quality writing is a whole other story. But then that's why series are often rotating writers per episode. </p>
<p>Movies usually get bogged down by budgets, like actors increasing salary demands, or creative differences between the various people involved in preproduction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HBO is also famous for taking a very long time developing their shows.  Most networks pick up a new project and have it on the air within a season.  HBO is known for taking years to refine and hone a show until it passes muster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Really I don't think we can use GoT to represent the  TV side of things because it's so much different than any other TV show in scale. We should use more &quot;classic&quot; high-quality show ala Breaking Bad or Lost. Though those shows are maybe not &quot;movie quality&quot; (though I think they are, just maybe not blockbuster statut movie, they're more similar to smaller films) like GoT is. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It probably did take two years from when HBO decided to do GoT until the release of the first episode.</p>

<p>Try four, January of 2007 to April of 2011.</p></div>		</li>
