<p>One day went to pump some gas. Got so frustrated that the screen on the pump wasn’t working that I was about to storm inside and let the attendant know my wrath. </p>
<p>Then I tilted my head. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought my phone was broken recently when I was trying to take a photo of my kids at the park. I'd go into the camera app and the screen would black out. After about 10 minutes of frustration I realized that my phone's screen was polarized as were my sunglasses and it was blacking out when I turned it horizontally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I <em>work</em> with systems just like that. You are not alone. I've had a handful of customers complain to me.</p>
<p>It's mildly annoying for <em>me</em> because it means I basically have to wear sunglasses with only a simple tint at work even though I prefer polarized.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even the aftermarket screen protectors on some phones are polarized, you’ll see the pattern as well. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phone screens themselves are typically polarized. LCD panels <em>have</em> to be; it's part of how they work and they'd just produce white light without the polarizer built in. OLED screens don't require polarization, but a lot of manufacturers include polarizing filters anyway to improve contrast ratio. I think it's unlikely anyone is selling polarized screen protectors because they'd run a risk of blocking the screen entirely, depending on polarization angle. But you're correct that phones often look wrong through polarized glasses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The prevalence of polarized sunglasses sales prompted electronic companies to do their polarization on a 135 degree instead of the 180 so that people with polarized sunglasses could flip their phone or device and still see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except for BMW. They insist on making displays that are completely incompatible with polarized lenses. I test drove a 2007 335xi and couldn't read the radio display with my polarized sunglasses on. Later models came with larger screens that couldn’t be seen while wearing polarized sunglasses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is halfway correct. The polarized lenses are allowing you to see the stress lines in the tempered glass that are created by the rollers during the manufacturing/tempering process.</p>
<p>This is also a trick used by glass blowers to see if a color is compatible with the raw glass they are using. Encase a piece of colored glass into your clear glass. Let it cool in the annealer and then look at it through polarized glasses. If there's a shimmer or rainbow effect at the transition then the color isn't a match and the stress could explode your finished pieces.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>More detail: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/OEmsutF.png" target="_blank">This</a> is one type of glass tempering quench. There are air holes at the top for quench air, and rollers on the bottom to hold/move the glass. The cooling effect of the jets and the rollers affect the stress patterns in the glass. Different kinds of machines handle and quench the glass differently, so you'll see different patterns depending on how the glass was manufactured.</p></div>		</li>
