<p>So where did those extraneous bits of grammar come from? </p>
<p>I get where new words for new things come from, but if the tendency of language is to find quicker ways to say the same things, how did we even end up with words that we can remove?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Was thinking about reposting it to r/historians or /eli5. Can you think of a better place? It's something that's always bothered me a little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm learning Ojibwe (Native language) and the grammar is exactly like this. Whole sentences are often a single word. </p>
<p>It's just too bad that the words are about 15 letters long. </p></div>		</li>
