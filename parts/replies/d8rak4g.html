			<div class="markdown"><p>With any of the gravity wave detecting instruments, you need both very precise knowledge about your laser as well as very precise control of the laser. Within that nest of reflecting and split beams, you have several specific systems. You have a source (with secondary beams split off to measure intensity and other parameters) Then you have timing and interferometry measurements to determine changes in distance between the satellites and rough absolute distance. Then you have the return path and path to the test mass (gold cube in the center) that you have to ensure that no matter how the satellite moves (from solar wind or station keeping) that you are always hitting the test mass squarely and independent of vibrations within the satellite from other systems.</p>
<p>Just what I can see and roughly know from optics knowledge etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm honestly really hyped about this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well we're still hoping to detect BHNS and binary neutron star systems. LIGO can still help us figure out the equation of state of a neutron star (which would be huge), primordial black holes (unlikely), or detect other exotic astrophysical events (dark matter, strange stars, cosmic strings, etc).  So the door is still open for many more exciting discoveries!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The advanced Virgo interferometer in Italy is about to go online as well and will cooperate with the ligo detectors. With three gravity wave detectors active at the same time we will be able to detect the exact direction from which the gravitational waves are coming. Who knows what conventional telescopes will see when they quickly turn to look at that spot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It helps, but it doesn't give you an exact fix. The remaining problem will be that all 3 detectors are in the Northern Hemisphere. The really huge source location bump will come when the India location comes online. </p></div>		</li>
