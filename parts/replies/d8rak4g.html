			<div class="markdown"><p>Well we're still hoping to detect BHNS and binary neutron star systems. LIGO can still help us figure out the equation of state of a neutron star (which would be huge), primordial black holes (unlikely), or detect other exotic astrophysical events (dark matter, strange stars, cosmic strings, etc).  So the door is still open for many more exciting discoveries!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The advanced Virgo interferometer in Italy is about to go online as well and will cooperate with the ligo detectors. With three gravity wave detectors active at the same time we will be able to detect the exact direction from which the gravitational waves are coming. Who knows what conventional telescopes will see when they quickly turn to look at that spot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It helps, but it doesn't give you an exact fix. The remaining problem will be that all 3 detectors are in the Northern Hemisphere. The really huge source location bump will come when the India location comes online. </p></div>		</li>
