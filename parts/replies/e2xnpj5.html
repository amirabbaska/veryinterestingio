			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember having asked that question a while ago with a friend on a science board. </p>
<p>We asked this scenario: Given we would have water (at 4°C [lowest density]) enclosed in a container that could withstand infinitive pressure from within without breaking or expanding, what would happen if you freeze this container?</p>
<p>IIRC, the answer was, if you would freeze this container below -28°C, the water would freeze anyways. Above, it would still be liquid. I remember some physics major student even going into his libary to look up tables in books and present us the evidence.  I will have a look if i find the post. </p>
<p>OF course, this is second hand knowledge, but the explanation sounded reasonable. I will have a look to try if I find it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wikipedia -&gt; triple point -&gt; triple point of water-&gt; high pressure phases </p>
<p>-26℃ ist about right because the crystal structure of ice changes </p></div>		</li>
