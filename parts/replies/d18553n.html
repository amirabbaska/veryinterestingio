			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course! The wall would essentially run through the middle of the Ocelot's territory as their habitat ranged between Southern Texas and down into Mexico, Central America, and South America. The wall would be detrimental to the Ocelot population living near the Texas/Mexico border as their habitat would be severely reduced. Essentially, we concluded that the wall would be detrimental to he ecosystem and used the Ocelot as one example. It has been a long time since I wrote that paper, so I don't recall anything more specific than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also wrote a paper on the US-Mexico border wall and its ecological impacts. Very interesting stuff when you bring in island biogeography and habitat fragmentation. </p>
<p>What is also interesting is the physical construction of the wall and its relationship to expansion of federal powers. </p></div>		</li>
