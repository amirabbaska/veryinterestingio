			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the type of cell. Brain neurons and cardiac myocytes have extreme energy requirements and minimal energy storage, so they start suffering from reversible ischemic injury within seconds of inadequate supply. Irreversible injury takes roughly 4-5 minutes with cell death in less than 10 minutes, at least in the large cerebellar pyrimidal neurons, which generally are the cells most susceptible to injury.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be subjective based upon the cell type, function, and metabolic demands (i.e., those that require oxygen the most will suffer the quickest without it).  But ~30 minutes without oxygen/glucose would cause irreversible cell death in neuronal tissue.  There are a few animal models or cell line cultures, that peg it around 30 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Completely cell dependent. Not all cells are created equal - some cell types are more resistant to hypoxia/anoxia than others, but for a laundry list of times they can be anoxic before apoptosis, I don't have a laundry list.</p></div>		</li>
