			<div class="markdown"><p>Bog iron is clumps of iron oxides and hydroxides. It needs a very hot bloomery to become metallic iron. </p>
<p>You're not done though. High-quality bronze is stronger and harder than low-quality iron. It is only a truly better metal if you know what you are doing, which early smiths definitely did not.</p>
<p>The &quot;strength&quot; of early iron was in its availability. Tin to make bronze is somewhat rare, and was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_sources_and_trade_in_ancient_times" target="_blank">transported long distances</a> in ancient times to combine it with copper. Iron is a single ingredient which is basically everywhere including bogs. If you can make it locally then it's really tempting to use it as much as possible instead of the expensive stuff, and with centuries of practice and accidental alloying with carbon it became possible to reliably turn iron into steel.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They take quite a few years (often decades) to refresh though, and it is likely that you would exhaust your bog iron ores in much the same way as you would a regular bedded ore. </p>
<p>It's worth remembering that ore outcrops are found because they break the surface of the land and either weather to fantastic colours (red, yellow, orange in the case of iron, green in the case of copper) and because they cause substantial variations in the type of vegetation that grows in the area. So in many ways, they are easier to find, and easier to smelt, than bog ores.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its interesting,and now I know what is the cause of those iridescent pools in the woods near my house.I always thought it was just pollution (it looked like gasoline,it was a fair guess).Id like to try and find some iron nodules though,they would make a striking conversation piece.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During the bronze age, both the copper and tin trades were incredibly important.  One of the foundational shipwrecks of nautical archaeology is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uluburun_shipwreck" target="_blank">Uluburun Shipwreck</a> which contained 10 tons of copper and 1 ton of tin in the form of large &quot;oxhide&quot; ingots, which is the ratio needed to yield 11 tons of bronze.</p>
<p>It also contained a lot of other stuff that's very important archaeologically as well;  Canaanite jars (from Israel) full of terebinth (turpentine) from that region, for example, indicating trade between modern-day Turkey and Israel and the export of that material from Canaan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to this that in 10,000+ years, humans haven't gotten any smarter. We've been this smart. We just have way more access to knowledge and the ability to pass it on through language, writing, and developing civilization.  People still expiremented and were able to learn just as now. It's not a giant leap to discover and ponder that if a soft metal like substance can be melted at a lower temperature, that a harder metal like substance might melt if you made it hotter. It's also not an incredible leap for someone to figure out that adding bone, likely as spiritual at first, would lend to a more pure metal and decide that adding things like bone leeches out more impurities from the metal itself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I find it so offensive when people insist we must have had help from ancient aliens.  Modern man develops microprocessors, sure that's reasonable but the ancient mayans piled rocks into pyramids- must have been aliens!  The arrogance of that reasoning is just infuriating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do you find that unusual at all? That's an extremely predictable and easily understandable misconception. People commonly equate intelligence and knowledge. Whether or not that's actually true is irrelevant, but it's not even remotely surprising or &quot;unusual&quot; that people use the two interchangeably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably incorrect.  One thing that's changed significantly is access to nourishment, which has made us (among other things) substantially taller than people 500 years ago, and honestly, even 50 years ago (the average American male is 30lb heavier, and one inch taller).</p>
<p>With the brain being the most metabolically active part of the body, it's pretty likely we're actually smarter too.</p>
<p>If the basis of your assumption is that natural selection wouldn't work that quickly on this time scale, you're right.  But mere selection pressure isn't the only thing going on.  Epigenetic modifiers are rampant, and absolutely operate on remarkably short timescales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On average yes. However, there are plenty of instances of sufficient nourishment in pretty much all of history.</p>
<p>So to assume that everyone lacked nourishment is likely incorrect as well.</p></div>		</li>
