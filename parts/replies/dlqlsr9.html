			<div class="markdown"><p>This post convinced me to make calls and arrange to pay my debts in installments rather than wait until I get enough money to pay them, among all my laziness issues, I have never payed my bills on time and I usually suffer to pay them with fines later. It's strange that when I get a bill for my phone, even though I have the money to pay it, I delay delay it 99% of the time, just because I want to use the money now to do things I don't need and useless stuff I never use.. </p>
<p>anyway, back to fixing my life. let's see if this cures it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post. I'm usually not convinced by persuasive internet rants but this was so relatable and well written. Too easy to fall into the pattern of instant feel good meals, then you just regret your body later. Diet is so relatable because we do it all day every day, and are absolutely making judgement wisdom calls on our overall status.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a huge problem with this. Huge as in I am huge (325 lbs) because not only is it cheaper to eat McDonalds—actually McDonalds takes too long, and there is a 7-Eleven on the next block; chips and Ben &amp; Jerry's for dinner—simple carbs calm my moods, which is way easier than actually feeling them, changing my life and relationships, or working them out in therapy. So on the therapy front it was suggested that I work out some immediate form of gratification. So I have a calendar. I get a gold star for staying on my diet and a blue one for exercising. I'm rewarding myself like a primary school student, but it works. I just wish I knew how to kick off that delayed reward desire. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple carbs are a genuine drug, in that they're strong reward system stimulators. They make you happy, for a few minutes. Then you crash and feel like crap, physically and mentally. They're the crack cocaine of foods, because it's a quick hit, hard crash and then a deep craving for more.</p>
<p>I'm sure you realize that, but it can't be overstated how nice it is to get off the roller coaster. Eating complex carbs and whole foods give you a much more even experience, physically and mentally, without the crashing. The first few days of withdrawal suck but then life is so much better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post. I've heard it referred to as &quot;momentum&quot; vs. &quot;motivation.&quot; Don't wait to be motivated, just start doing stuff and develop momentum...you are more likely to keep doing it, as opposed to being a victim to the ebb &amp; flow of motivation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Motivation can come from the momentum. By consciously choosing to exhibit self control, pass on that drive thru on the way home from work or dont browse that new sale on PSN or Steam. When you do finally realize why its worth it, youll understand through a positive, good feeling experience. That's why its more effective than just being told why you should do it. The most powerful thing tou have going for you is your mind and your ability to choose. Use it the way that would be the best for you. </p>
<p>When you start going to the gym, you may start to feel some pride in having gone. You went 3x this week, when you werent going at all prior to. Youll feel proud. And then maybe you wont feel so inclined to stop for fast food because you know you just made that healthy choice and you feel good. Youll eventually start to pair feeling good about the gym with feeling good aboit your diet choices. Then a few weeks go by. Youve stopped drinking soda. Fast food doesnt happen much at all anymore. You step on the scale and youve lost 8lbs. Holy crap. Now you wanna go back to the gym and you cant wait. This is actaually working. </p>
<p>You check your bank account, you didnt get fast food at ~$10 per meal those few times. So youve got an extra thirty bucks. Sweet, so half into savings and half for something nice. You did a great job. </p>
<p>Stacking good habits is a great way to guide yourself towards what you wanna be doing with your life. That in itself is motivating. It feels good to be doing well. But only when you build that momentum yourself. Everybody is capable of doing that no matter where they are in their lives. I have learned it the hard way myself.</p></div>		</li>
