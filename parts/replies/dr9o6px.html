			<div class="markdown"><p>What about vibration (ceiling rattling a rigid lamp etc) and oxygen contamination of the atmosphere inside the bulbs? Is that just a myth and not really a big factor? </p>
<p>I know they use halogen lightbulbs in cars, but I assumed they were designed to mitigate the damage caused by shock and vibration, whereas the added cost of shock resistance would add too much to the cost of a household bulb. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bulbs in cars don't run as hot (so the efficiency is worse).</p>
<p>It's a tradeoff - hotter, more efficient; or colder, less efficient, but longer life. You can place that tradeoff virtually anywhere you want.</p>
<p>For example some studio lamps only last 100 or less hours. And you hear stories of dim bulbs lasting decades.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, because they operate at 12V, the filaments are much heavier/thicker than what is needed for 120V, which makes them significantly stronger and more robust. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The higher something's resistance is, the smaller the ohmic heating. Assuming V constant, the power loss is V^2 /R.</p>
<p>I don't think that reasoning is correct.</p>
<p>Edit: the reduction in area might, of course, result in less capacity to radiate and hence the temperature of the thinner part would go up, but that is another thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a linear series of resistors. Let's say there are 100 of them. And let's say that 99 of them are 1 ohm resistors while 1 is a 2 ohm resistor.</p>
<p>OK, they are in series so this is easy, the total resistance of all of them together is 99 x 1 ohm + 2 ohm or 101 ohms. Easy peasy. Now, let's say you apply 110 volts across that line of resistors, how much current will flow through them? Again, this is easy, the answer is 110 volts / 101 ohms = 1.09 amps, from ohm's law (giving a power of 120 watts, incidentally).</p>
<p>Now then, how much heating does each resistor experience?</p>
<p>They all experience 1.09 amps of current flow so the answer is simple: (1.09 amps)^2 x R (for direct current, alternating current is slightly different but follows the same proportionality relationship). Which means, the 2 ohm resistor will experience twice as much ohmic heating as the 1 ohm resistors (2.38 Watts vs. 1.19 Watts).</p>
<p>Now, how does that compare to the nominal situation of 100x 1 ohm resistors? In this case the overall resistance is 100 ohms, the overall current is 1.10 amps, and the per resistor heating is 1.21 Watts. So while you are correct that the <em>overall</em> ohmic heating has gone down for the entire filament, the ohmic heating on any small portion of the filament can and will go up if it has a substantially different resistance to other parts of the filament without substantially changing the overall resistance of the filament (in this case the increased resistance reduces the localized ohmic heating by only 2% compared to a nominal doubling, which is insignificant). In a filament that is made up of a very tight coil of very small gauge wire this phenomenon of localized ohmic heating increase is indeed quite common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Localized heating. If a small length of the filament, say, doubles in resistance... that wouldnâ€™t be enough to significantly change the overall wattage. It would go down a little, but not much. So the current would be mostly constant. </p>
<p>And so locally, the power draw would double. </p></div>		</li>
