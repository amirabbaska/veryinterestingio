			<div class="markdown"><p>You're absolutely right about nitrogen. I worked in oil and gas for a decade and I've always wondered why they don't do executions with nitrogen.</p>
<p>I've read that perhaps the US don't want to be associated with gas chambers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's my understanding. The US actually did used to use gas chambers to execute people for criminal offenses. I mean, it doesn't have to be a gas chamber, a scuba tank with a regulator would work just as well as long as the patient is strapped down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gas chambers were a widely used method of execution but they didn't use nitrogen gas and usually used Hydrogen Cyanide.  It basically screws up your nervous system and kills you, resulting in a lot of drooling, vomiting, defecating and pain.  That is opposed to nitrogen which asphyxiates you and your body cannot tell it isn't breathing in oxygen.</p>
<p>Side note I wonder if carbon monoxide could work as well, tons of Poole die in their sleep in their homes from it and never leave the bed!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something like the nose-and-mouth masks and machines used to deliver anesthetic gases would work fine, except you can get rid of a lot of the fancy features those have. Just needs to deliver regular air (for putting it on to start) and be able to switch over to delivering 100% nitrogen. Maybe add headstraps on the mask so it can hold itself on. </p>
<p>Works for painless assisted suicide, too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you mentioned this. Also worth noting that you can donate organs after nitrogen asphyxiation. However, you can't donate organs after the typical lethal drug cocktail.</p></div>		</li>
