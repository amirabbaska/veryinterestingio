<p>I never really thought about this. Why is that probability so small?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The probability to find the electron in a certain region, is defined by the integration of the wave function over that volume. The size of a proton is only a few fm (10^-15 m), and the wave function has the size in the order of Ångström (10^-10 m). So the volume of the wave function that overlaps the proton is very small (remember that the volume is proportional to the length cubed!)</p>
<p>[Deleted previous comment about the wave function being zero in the origin. That is not always true]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, but I still feel like it's not quite the whole story.</p>
<p>The &quot;protons are small&quot; argument doesn't explain why a proton and an electron together weigh less than a neutron, which is unstable and would prefer to decay into a proton and electron. Whatever causes that mass discrepancy presumably also helps to explain why a proton and electron don't want to combine (into a higher-energy state). The mass discrepancy can be explained to some degree by looking at quark masses, but that still doesn't give me any intuitive understanding of what causes combined state to require more energy than the separated one (it just pushes the problem over to, why is that quark heavier?).</p>
<p>To go back to the ball-on-a-spring analogy, you can tell me that the ball doesn't compress the spring because the potential energy is minimized where it already is, but that still doesn't explain it as fully as using fundamental forces to explain <em>why</em> the potential energy is minimized where it is (the answer involving repulsion between electrons). (This is to explain my confusion with the neutrons-are-heavier argument, not yours, to be clear.)</p>
<p>A way to explain my confusion with the protons-are-much-smaller-than-electron-clouds argument is to ask: <em>why</em> are electron clouds so much bigger, given that the two particles only attract?</p>
<p>I have a feeling that the full answer is above my pay grade. Or maybe I should actually try to go through the math, for the first time in...oh god, has it been a decade?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The scale of the problem doesn't have anything to do with it, it's about how localized the particles are in position and momentum space.</p>
<p>That's not explicitly stated in the question, but they asked what would happen if you place them at a distance of 1 meter with zero momentum. Absent any information about their position and momentum spreads, all you can really do is assume that they meant a delta function in both coordinates and momenta, which is unphysical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My apologies. You are indeed correct. The scale has nothing to do with it. I was clearly tired when I typed that. Under the assumption that it is both (really either) stationary and has a definite position you are correct that does not make sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ignoring the impossibility of &quot;throwing&quot; an electron and reading this as &quot;If you give an electron sufficient kinetic energy...&quot;, yes. It would absorb the discrete amount that it could to jump to a proportionally higher state, as long as it was not too much to break free of the bond entirely. If this was an unstable state, which is very likely as nature prefers lower energy states, it would &quot;fall&quot; back to the lower state releasing a discrete bundle of electromagnetic field excitation energy called a photon. </p></div>		</li>
