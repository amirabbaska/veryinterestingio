			<div class="markdown"><p>This is off topic a bit. I remember reading somewhere that memories in the unique sense were stored on the strands and branches between the neurons and not in the neurons themselves. The theory went that there is not enough information space in just the neurons to have a whole person, and all their experiences stored, even if there was some lossless compression at work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More than likely this is somewhat close to what our mind does. For example when I remember what my SO told me to get at the grocery store the impulses go from neuron A to K (though not necessarily in a-b-c-d etc form) and when I think about it later to remind myself it reinforces that pathway, strengthening the memory. The more you review something the more it can be retained, this would also explain why certain other stimuli (music/smell etc) can enhance memory if those same neurons are also used somehow to process that sensory information, therefore those neurons are more apt to be activated. This is kinda my own take on it though, based on what I have learned.</p></div>		</li>
