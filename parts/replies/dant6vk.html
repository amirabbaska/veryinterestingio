			<div class="markdown"><p>Welders operate at lower DC voltages, so the body's internal resistance is enough to prevent any serious harm. Typical voltages range from about 20v to about 100v. While you can certainly feel 100v DC if you're sweating, it's generally not enough to seriously harm you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So one thing to note is the current is likely NOT flowing through him, it's likely coming through the welding cable, into the work piece with current return via a physical connection to the work piece (ground wire) or something like a 1 wire system, where the Earth itself is the return conductor. </p>
<p>As long as the current density and voltage gradient isn't too high, the effective voltage across your body is very low, and thus the current is as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is. When you are working at depth you have to be very, very, very careful of differential pressure. If you accidentally end up in a position between a low pressure zone such as a broken pipe and a high pressure zone such as being 100m+ under the ocean, you could have your entire arm or leg sucked into a space the diameter of a small walnut. </p>
<p>Since decompression diving at those depths sometimes requires more than a week of sitting in a decompression chamber before you can return to the surface, you will die, even if you managed to get free from such a pressure gradient without the rest of your body being mangled.</p></div>		</li>
