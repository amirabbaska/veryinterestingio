			<div class="markdown"><p>There are tv shows that are about how winning the lottery has ruined people's lives.</p>
<p>I remember this guy because I lived in Maryland for the first half of my life plus it was the largest jackpot won by a single person at that time.</p>

<p>They say to immediately sign the back of the ticket. But I wouldn't tell a soul I had won. I would immediately set up a trust and claim the winning through the trust. A woman in New England signed her name on the back of a winning ticket and had to go to court to allow it to be changed so her trust could claim it. Thankfully the court ruled in favor of her. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but someone ruining their own life because absent a budget they can't control themselves (in the example Whittaker's family ODs and goes into massive gambling debt) isn't really the fault of the lottery, or perhaps is a much more fundamental question than the lottery should be answering.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually, people's lives aren't ruined by their own lack of self control (though there IS a certain element of not being mentally prepared to even understand the concept of how much money they have), but because when your identity is publicly released, not only can anyone who has a relation to you find out and come looking for handouts and ruining relationships, but thousands more who have no connection to you at all will come knocking, from people asking for charity outright, to people looking to scam you out of the money.</p>
<p>Not to mention that there are documented cases in some countries of lottery winners being kidnapped.  IIRC, Australia actually has laws in place to protect lottery winners, and does so specifically because of such on occurrence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just responding to the person above me saying not enough terrible things happened. This guy was robbed at least twice and sued at least one.</p>
<p>I do agree that most of his and his family's problems were self inflicted. </p></div>		</li>
