			<div class="markdown"><p>Why are we not meant to lick a wound such as a small cut when it starts bleeding? I can see that being the case for example whilst hiking and you cut yourself on some random stuff but say, with a kitchen knife cutting vegetables it'll have no real effect right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s our animal brain’s thinking. We’ve evolved past it - in normal human settings, cleaning and dressing a wound is far superior. I’m of the no-way-medical opinion that cleaning is always better than not, but if you lack water at all to clean a wound with, that might be a bigger issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of antibacterial stuff in our mouths but on top of that, it is natural painkiller and a quite potent one. If your mouth is relatively clean, there are no gum diseases and it is not dirty, it is most likely that it aids healing in a pace that is very comparable with what modern medicine.</p>
<p>The problem of course is that we don't know what balance we have in our mouth, you can brush your teeth and still cause an infection. And our sugar rich diet does not make this any better but neither does eating lots of meat.. so the idea that you should not lick is still sound advice. It is a bit bad since our saliva is almost magical in it's healing powers.. just way, way too random and unpredictable.</p>
<p>Quite sure that the &quot;reason&quot; for it's powers is entirely the fact that we have those bony things in our mouth that can literally eat the things around them; we bite our tongues and cheeks, our food also can cause small wounds and scrapes so things need to work fast in there..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL. I always thought salivary amylase would have a significant effect on clots and clotting factor agglutination. Although, I really didn’t base that on anything but an assumption. </p></div>		</li>
