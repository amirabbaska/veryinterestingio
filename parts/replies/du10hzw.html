			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have a lot of carb intake before bed your insulin spikes to take all the carbs and put it in your body cause that’s what insulin does. </p>
<p>But since you had a lot ur body was like “OH SHIT” and accidentally produced too much insulin, so your blood sugar gets low because the insulins took too many carbs. </p>
<p>So you wake up with low blood sugar and your body says to you “eat something or I’ll make you suffer bitch” and you feel hunger </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the &quot;spike&quot; is produced by foods with a high glycemic index, not just any carbs. Those that release their sugar slowly will not cause the same oversupply of insulin as those that release it all at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesnt store carbs as fat lol if thats what you're saying. The insulin allows the cells to access the carbs. Thats why  intramyocellular lipids (fats in the muscle cells due to fatty diets) block the effectiveness off insulin and cause type II diabetes. Then sugars/carbs become an issue because the body cannot effectively use the glucose in the blood ie spikes. </p>
<p>De novo lipogenesis (carbs into fat) is not done in the body unless you eat a large excess of carbs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our body says we are hungry when the glucose level in our blood goes down. </p>
<p>During the night and in the morning, our body secretes GH (growth hormone - night; also why our parents told us why we grow when we sleep when we were small) and glucocorticoids which are hyperglycaemic hormones (they increase the glucose level in our blood). </p>
<p>Brain activity increases at night and while heart rate may be lower, there is more circulating blood as fluids that went outside our vessels because of gravity during the day come back. </p>
<p>You may sometimes wake up hungry when your body doesn't have enough deposits or your circadian cycle was off. </p>
<p>I hope I didn't get into too many details here. </p></div>		</li>
