			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah seriously. And as I've commented, they're missing the family demographic. I have brothers and so we used to go out of our way to only buy games we could play together. Now if we did that we just couldn't buy any games, and thus we don't buy as many </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have brothers but we don't play games together on consoles and never have, however I used to have gatherings of friends at my house with two consoles and two tv's and we could play 8 player split screen in two teams on opposite sides of the rooms.</p>
<p>This was easily the most fun i've ever experienced in any gaming, it wasn't just my house and one off events, we also went to eachothers houses, 4 player split screen halo nights were a very common occurance.</p>
<p>Nowadays to get the same experience you need 8 consoles, 8 tv's, 8 copies of the game - oh and don't forget 8 memberships, I don't even have that much room in my house to do that. So instead we plug in an old xbox and halo game and play the original, it's quite sad that to have the same experience we have to go back to that.</p>
<p>So it's not just a family demographic, it's friends as well, you could argue it's not as common for those events to happen especially as people get older.</p>
<p>The only 'games' that are new that i've been able to have this sort of experience with nowadays are these ones where you all connect your smart phones and you play these sort of mario party style minigames together, to me that's not nearly as fun.</p>
<p>You can argue that the developers want to save on processing power, but I really think the gaming industry is suffering from greed, this new microtransaction/day one dlc/new copy of the same game reskinned every 5 months etc mindset that the industry is getting into is really starting to grind my gears. I remember playing games like Dungeon Keeper 1 where you could FEEL the love put into the game, because they wanted to make a good game, and just that.</p></div>		</li>

We had 4 apartments in the complex that would play, and anytime we wanted to get a huge multi game going, we would string the 4 Xbox's to the same router with a few hundred feet of cat5 cable, then get up to 16 people playing. Fun times. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about other recent games but I know Black Ops 3 has split screen on PC. Is it not the same for consoles?</p>
<p>I usually use nvidia surround as I have two monitors so each player will be on one screen and so we can have them back to back to prevent screen peeking etc.</p>
<p>I don't think it's a case of developing MTX over split screen, I think consoles literally do not possess the necessary power to render and run two games at once. The more advanced games get, the harder it will be, especially if consoles continue on a 7 year hardware cycle. Look at BO3 on Xbox 360 compared to on Xbox one. A 360 can barely run one instance of BO3.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're not alone, I'm right there with you.</p>
<p>My distaste for this kind of stuff has made me really just stick to the titles I have that <em>don't</em> do that kind of stuff (or at the very least, do it as minimally as possible).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is the demographic of families buying multiplayer games is a lot smaller than the demographic of 20 and 30 somethings buying games to play with friends online. </p>
<p>It used to be couch multiplayer was the only multiplayer. Once the Internet changed that, they realized that leaving that part out but keeping online in didn't cause them any loss in revenue, so why spend the money on it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2 days ago I read an artikle about the age of gamers (but it was only for Germany, Austria and Switzerland). Most of the gamers were 30+ only 16-18% were 15-29.
So when they got rip off the splitscreen a few years ago a lot of people where 20+ with enough money, but no family. And I think that's why the things mentioned a few comments before started happening.
The gaming industry got more money cause they sold more games so friends could game together. And not just the games, the consoles/PCs/equipment/...</p>
<p>And yeah, maybe that'll change cause a lot of gamers starting a family and want to play with the children and stuff. Let's hope for the best.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Okay, let's not dive down that rabbit hole.  It's really just developers making the choice (and maybe a publisher here and there) due to sometimes valid reasons and sometimes greedy reasons and sometimes just not enough time.  It's not some industry-wide conspiracy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Developer here (worked on several AAA games). The &quot;extra processing power&quot; argument isn't really a problem, most big games are fill rate limited which means that the performance cost is relative to the resolution you're running the game at. This cost doesn't go up with split screen because you're still rendering the same number of pixels, just using them to render different views. </p>
<p>The real technical problem for a lot of big AAA titles is that they're open world, which means the world data needs to be loaded around each player. If you have two players in potentially different locations then you need twice the memory and twice the streaming bandwidth. Both of these are normally a bottleneck on console.</p>
<p>You can design around it of course, forcing the players into the same area or doing separate non open world missions for split screen, but its a lot of extra work and in some cases loses the essence of the game.</p>
<p>But the main reason is non technical: the rise of online multiplayer.</p>
<p>Selling more copies of the game to groups of friends has nothing to do with it. How many people got into CoD from playing split screen with their mates, or got into Burnout from playing crash mode? It's free marketing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, days he regrets taking out splitscreen from Halo 5.  He thought that 60 fps was what players wanted most.  As well as high resolution.  So they put that at #1, but the technology they used to achieve perfect 60fps.</p>
<p>This tech renders reach frame with dynamic resolution, if the gameplay is so crazy that the fps will dip then the game lowers the resolution of frames to maintain 60fps - the lowered resolution is variable depending on the frame and happens so quick you can't see it.  So it works very well.  But they couldn't get it to work with splitscreen and thought that was gonna be an ok trade off with most people.</p>
<p>They said Halo 6 will have splitscreen and have admitted not including it was a huge mistake.  Which was.  Insanely huge mistake.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe they could have lowered the resolution of the game to maintain 60 FPS parity but manage to leave enough processing power for split screen. </p></div>		</li>
