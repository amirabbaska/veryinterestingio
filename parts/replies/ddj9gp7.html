			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good explanation! Freedom, and the bravery that's required. To me, not having grown up with that idea, it's a bit scary. I must say that I'm rather a tame, domesticated Scandinavian than a wild American, just because it's more comfortable. Generally speaking. :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this explanation the best. Europeans who come from heavily social subsidized countries don't understand this different kind of freedom. To Europeans (especially countries who have good school system and good health care) think that they're free because they don't have to worry about getting a good education or not getting medical help. Which I definitely agree has its advantages and I actually prefer this system better.</p>
<p>But the American freedom is, you can make your own decisions. If you don't like the school your kids are at, then it's your responsibility to relocate to get your kids attending a different school. If you don't like your doctor, you have the liberty to choose a different doctor you trust, not stay with the same one just because the government only allows you to have this doctor.</p>
<p>Freedom is responsibility. Governments that give you social benefits are the responsible ones. Governments that don't give you social benefits, force you to be the responsible one. Whether or not you can handle it is up to you.</p>

<p>But in practice the USA has for the most part forgone that ideal and it just like all the other western countries but instead sniffs its own farts with rhetoric it has abandoned.</p>

<p>Yeah, this is also very true...</p></div>		</li>
