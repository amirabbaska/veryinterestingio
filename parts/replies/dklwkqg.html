			<div class="markdown"><p>It's attached to the placenta, which comes out shortly after the baby. So they could have left it on and it would have shriveled up and fallen off on it's own. They could have made &quot;knives&quot; out of wood, or before that kind of tool-making they could have used sharp rocks or even chewed through it like chimpanzees.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude with how hungry you are a couple days into breastfeeding I would've eaten my placenta if it was still around.  The only thing I wanted 3 days into breastfeeding was steak and more steak.  I'm not even a big meat eater traditionally, just generally once a month I crave hamburger or steak before I menstruate. </p>
<p>I totally would've chewed through the umbilical cord if it meant getting the baby free and out of me.  You are so tired of gestating and having someone inhabit you for close to a year....it's a fairly desperate situation by most accounts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something pretty amazing about umbilical cords after birth is that once the blood drains into the baby and stopped pulsating, it actually twists and accomplishes what a clamp would. You can then cut it with ease and not worry about your baby missing 1/3 to 1/2 of their blood volume by clamping prematurely. (This practice also cuts down on iron deficiencies in infants!)</p>
<p>Edit: Looks like my stats were a little off, after doing the math it is more likely that delayed cord clamping will result in your baby receiving closer to 1/4 - 1/3 their blood volume through placental transfusion. However the benefits remain the same.
Here's my math: Blood Volume for term newborns, it is about 80ml per kg of weight. I Went off the weight of an 8lb infant (8lb = 3.6kg &amp; 80 x 3.6 = 288ml)</p>
<p>According to these stats by ACOG (American College of Gynecology and Obstetrics) after a 3 minute cord clamping delay, approximately 100ml of blood will be transfused to the infant.
So 100ml added to a blood volume of 288ml is pretty significant. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Delayed-Umbilical-Cord-Clamping-After-Birth" target="_blank">https://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Delayed-Umbilical-Cord-Clamping-After-Birth</a></p>
<p>&quot;Physiologic studies in term infants have shown that a transfer from the placenta of approximately 80 mL of blood occurs by 1 minute after birth, reaching approximately 100 mL at 3 minutes after birth (7–9). Initial breaths taken by the newborn appear to facilitate this placental transfusion (10). A recent study of umbilical cord blood flow patterns assessed by Doppler ultrasonography during delayed umbilical cord clamping (11) showed a marked increase in placental transfusion during the initial breaths of the newborn, which is thought to be due to the negative intrathoracic pressure generated by lung inflation. This additional blood supplies physiologic quantities of iron, amounting to 40–50 mg/kg of body weight. This extra iron has been shown to reduce and prevent iron deficiency during the first year of life.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya! The placenta is a fascinating organ, preventing mothers blood and babies blood from coming in contact with eachother. Many things can go wrong with it, like when the majority of a fetus's blood flows back in to the mom, called fetal maternal hemorrhage. There's a test called a KB test to look at the percentage of fetal blood in the maternal blood to see if that happened. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And your intestines. A lot of areas of the human body do not have good receptors for pain or temperature like our skin does. So, general surgeons doing a colonoscopy can burn off polyps without the need to administer analgesics, as your colon can't feel anything except for stretching. A lot of your organs have similarly weak afferent innervation as well, which is why you can have a heart attack where a portion of your myocardium dies, and yet you only feel pain in your arm or jaw.</p></div>		</li>
