			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the air is full of non magnetic things floating around. Once you separate the magnets, they get in between and prevent the magnets from closing in enough to get pulled together.  </p>
<p>Disclaimer: This is a very simple analogy using magnets. Real life is not that simple. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a disclaimer, there is an entire field of science dedicated to studying the deformation of materials, the way materials fracture, chip, and crack. The physics that explains what happens when something is cut has become very advanced over the last few decades. You don't need a knowledge of physics to learn the basics, but if you want to know about it, I guess PM me or something because I can't fit it in an ELI5 post.</p>
<p>When you cut a piece of paper with scissors, you are exerting an insane amount of pressure (but this pressure isn't observable without lab equipment because it's being applied to micrometer sized planes) on the paper. Specifically you're putting tons of pressure with your &lt;1mm sized scissors onto nanometer sized molecules.</p>
<p>The pressure is so strong that it is breaking weak intermolecular forces that occur between cellulose fibers in the paper. The same hydrogen bonds that were formed between cellulose fibers when the paper was formed, the bonds that hold the paper together, are broken when you cut paper. When the bonds break, the cellulose fibers that were previously entangled are now broken apart, irreversibly. Yes hydrogen bonding is reversible, but breaking H bonds resulting in a physical structural change prevents their reassembly. When you pull apart two magnets, you aren't breaking any intermolecular forces between molecules of the material..you aren't physically disrupting the bulk physical structure. Side note since I'm sure those better than me at chemistry will call me out, when you cut paper you probably to a very small extent be cutting through the fibers themselves, which means you are breaking chemical bonds that hold a polymer chain together. This also happens because of the intense energy of the pressure from the scissors, but it plays a very minor role in the overall process. </p>
<p>One other reason you're not breaking many of the actual fibers themselves is because when you cut something, the cut naturally tends to occur along an interface composed only of weak intermolecular forces. I can't explain why this occurs, but maybe someone else can fill in my gap of knowledge here.</p>
<p>Hope that answered your question.</p></div>		</li>
