			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note, though, that flowers are usually pretty specialized for a specific type of pollinator. Yes birds and bats and beetles are all pollinators, but only flies pollinate the corpse flower and snapdragons are all-in on bees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If honeybees disappear, what takes a huge hit are orchards and vegetable farms.  Those have no nectar sources at all for most of the year, then there is a huge abundance of flowers for a week.  Depending ont eh cultivation technique, there is also reduced habitat for native pollinators.</p>
<p>Bees return to their hive at night, so beekeepers are paid to drive tractor- trailers full of bees around the country for various flower seasons,  No other pollinator is suitable for that.</p>
<p>Wheat, corn, and most other field crops are wind pollinated, they don't need any insect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only the massively intensive orchards are going to have problems. The UK's more relaxed and interspersed farming methods provide quite a lot of habitat. It's one of the biggest arguments for relaxing farming intesity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Native flora&quot; might be fine, but in our modern world there are obviously massive amounts of un-native flora that depend on the honeybees.  The almond groves won't be pollinated by a few native solitary bees. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Problem for us. The rest of the native ecosystem, not so much.</p>
<p>The almond that you and I know and love is only an aberration anyway. It's a random mutation that occurs that makes an otherwise poisonous tree nut edible.</p>
<p>I wouldn't argue for a minute that the loss of the European honey bee would be catastrophic in North America, for humans. Native bees, wasps, other insects, and small birds are more than capable of taking up that niche in the native ecology of the continent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure many animals need those pollinated plants too.</p>
<p>If the plants take a hit, the entire ecosystem takes a hit. </p></div>		</li>
