			<div class="markdown"><p>Just read up on him and this last bit I read was very interesting.</p>
<p>&quot;Near the end of his life, Molaison regularly filled in crossword puzzles. He was able to fill in answers to clues that referred to pre-1953 knowledge. For post-1953 information he was able to modify old memories with new information. For instance, he could add a memory about Jonas Salk by modifying his memory of polio.&quot;</p>
<p>Do you have any insight into what was going on in that context?</p>
<p>Edit - I find it very interesting and I believe it displays how complex the system that forms and retains memories is. He couldn't remember new information but was somehow able to modify old ones to remember new information. I think it also displays how it's possible for someone to believe their own lie or version of an event happening so much that they themselves believe their lie or version to be truth. Maybe they are using the same &quot;ability&quot; without realizing it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a small stroke several years ago and I've noticed this phenomenon with my own memory. Things I learned before the stroke came back fairly easily but trying to learn a new skill is much more difficult. Once I could concentrate reliably again, I picked up the crafts I'd abandoned in the order in which I'd previously learned them. Knitting was too hard until I started crocheting and somehow unlocked access to my muscle memory for all things with sticks and strings. </p>
<p>I had trouble making change one day until I was able to relate it to a previous experience and now I can do it in my head again although I prefer to use a calculator just to be safe. </p>
<p>It's crazy what I'm able to do again and at the same time, struggle with other things. Data recovery on a damaged hard drive is a crap shoot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you are recovering. Thats really fascinating about your experience!  It really is wild how the pathways can recover or reroute around the stroke.  </p>
<p>I had a physical trainer who ended up focusing on his own method of stroke mobility recovery.  He found that using different emotional or reflex responses, he could get muscles to respond.  For example, a patient who couldn't stand on her left leg was taught to walk again, where he'd toss something like a super light beach ball, but make it look really heavy.  In response, the person would brace, lock their legs, and stand against the oncoming force.   Then it was about getting the patient to use that startle feeling to consciously control the leg.  The musculature was still connected, just not through the same system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He passed after my schooling, and did not learn about that part.  However, his amnesia was due to removing sections of the brain.  I never looked at his brain and science doesn't have the ability yet to know exactly what each cluster or structure does, but small changes would have large impacts on function.  After many years, its more than likely that his brain had recovered use of some pathway left intact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I looked into that Jonas Salk guy and he actually created one of the first successful polio vaccines. Makes a little more sense that he could modify his polio memory with that of Jonas Salk.</p></div>		</li>
