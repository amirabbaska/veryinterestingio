			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does this just seem like your trying to sell Bruce Kushnick's book? I don't need to know anything about this man or his blog in my ELI5. Saying something like &quot;if you want to know more check out this blog...&quot; would have been more than enough. This feels spammy, especially because the author also posted a very ad like rant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because both links cited by the OP were from articles either by Bruce Kushnick or citing his book, so I wanted to make clear where the claims came from--especially that it all seems to be work authored by one individual. I only referred to information found in the links provided by the OP. To be fair I probably should've made a tl;dr.</p></div>		</li>
