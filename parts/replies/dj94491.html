			<div class="markdown"><p>The acceleration due to gravity at sea level is around g=9.8 m/s^2 , and we know this because of many experiments involving dropping things and timing the falls. If you want to find g for another planet, you would use g=Gm/R^2 , where g is the acceleration at a specific point due to gravity from a body, the mass of that body, and the distance from that specific point to the center of mass of that body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you can. Theres a lot more mass in the sky than there is beneath our feet. However because the mass in the sky (I.E, the rest of the universe) is very far away, we are more influenced by earths gravity than we are by Sagittarius A*. Its why we dont fall up. </p>
<p>However we are effected by at least some of this distant mass. We orbit the sun, and the sun orbits the galaxy. Our galaxy and a nearby big one are on a collision course. Not sure how things work on even larger scales tho. They say dark energy overpowers gravity and causes the universe to do its expansion thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe your numbers are correct. I calculated a gravitational acceleration of 14.25 m/s^2 if you are on the inside edge of the torus, 14.76 m/s^2 on the outside edge, and 14.59 m/s^2 on the top edge. Which is interesting because it means that the 95% of mass actually only accounts for around 0.3 m/s^2. However I did derive my answer completely differently. I made a Java program to create a list of vectors in the shape of a torus and added up their gravitational acceleratations between another arbitrary vector representing a person/object. I'm actually quite surprised I didn't make any mistakes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting method. You basically did a volume integral over the torus. A numerical method like yours is probably better; trying to do that integral analytically would have been quite complex. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I knew that I couldn't use calculus to solve the problem without things getting out of hand really quickly but I figured a numerical integration wouldn't be too complicated so I went that. The thing that I probably spent the most time on was trying to create the array of torus points so it didn't take an eternity to process and didn't have more indexes than arrays can even have.
EDIT: yeah I did the math (or I guess I didn't do the math) and got [this] (<a href="http://www.HostMath.com/Show.aspx?Code=G%5Cint_%7B0%7D%5E%7B2%5Cpi%7D%5Cint_%7B0%7D%5E%7B2%5Cpi%7D%5Cint_%7B0%7D%5E%7Bc%7D%5Cdelta%5Cfrac%7B%5Cbig%20%5Clangle%20x_0-%28r%20cos%5Cphi%29cos%5Ctheta%29%5E2%2Cy_0-%28r%20cos%5Cphi%29sin%5Ctheta%2Cz_0-a*sin%5Cphi%5Cbig%20%5Crangle%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B%28x_%7B0%7D-%28r%20cos%5Cphi%29cos%5Ctheta%29%5E2%20%28y_%7B0%7D-%28r%20cos%5Cphi%29sin%5Ctheta%29%5E%7B2%7D%20%28z_0-a*sin%5Cphi%29%5E%7B2%7D%7D%5E%7B3%7D%7Ddrd%5Ctheta%20d%5Cphi" target="_blank">http://www.HostMath.com/Show.aspx?Code=G%5Cint_%7B0%7D%5E%7B2%5Cpi%7D%5Cint_%7B0%7D%5E%7B2%5Cpi%7D%5Cint_%7B0%7D%5E%7Bc%7D%5Cdelta%5Cfrac%7B%5Cbig%20%5Clangle%20x_0-%28r%20cos%5Cphi%29cos%5Ctheta%29%5E2%2Cy_0-%28r%20cos%5Cphi%29sin%5Ctheta%2Cz_0-a*sin%5Cphi%5Cbig%20%5Crangle%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B%28x_%7B0%7D-%28r%20cos%5Cphi%29cos%5Ctheta%29%5E2%20%28y_%7B0%7D-%28r%20cos%5Cphi%29sin%5Ctheta%29%5E%7B2%7D%20%28z_0-a*sin%5Cphi%29%5E%7B2%7D%7D%5E%7B3%7D%7Ddrd%5Ctheta%20d%5Cphi</a>
) as the integral you would need to solve. Except I doubt I even did the integral correctly so it's even more complicated. So yeah have fun with that.</p></div>		</li>
