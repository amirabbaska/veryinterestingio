<p>Similarly, if you have ever seen a waterbug, or other lightweight object floating on the surface of a pool, you will notice they create round shadows where they touch the water. This is because they make &quot;dents&quot; in the water which bend the light away and leave a dark spot.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The insect's feet touch the water at essentially a single point. Just like if you push your finger into a mattress with a tight sheet over it, or into any other soft, springy surface, the pushed down portion has a circular shape around your finger.</p>
<p>The insect's feet push down on the surface of the water (which has enough surface tension to act like a sheet in this case) and form a round depression. It is this depression, or pit, that bends the light, so the resulting shadow is round.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool pic, and I’m not a fire scientist but fire is a chemical reaction that is mostly hot gas and it emits light. So you can’t see through it not because it is opaque/ blocks light but because it is light. </p></div>		</li>
