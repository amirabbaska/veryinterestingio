<p>although who has saline at home</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A great tip I picked up from a local chemist - just grab a box of <a href="http://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/180691832019-0-1/s-l1000.jpg" target="_blank">contact lens saline tubes!</a> They're small, come in a pack of like 12, easy to squeeze out directly onto a wound. Can also be used to flush out eyes if they're gunky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or you could make your own. Boil some water, throw in a tsp of salt per 8oz while water is still warm, mix until dissolved, store until needed. </p>
<p>Preferably use uniodized salt, but table salt will probably work, too.</p>
<p>(PS I use this for sinus rinses, and I'm not sure how well it works for anything else. I would think boiling the water would kill most bacteria though.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's best (in my experience for homemade saline, for piercing anyway) is 8oz of distilled water to 1/4 tsp of sea salt. Table salt is a no-go.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know it's a minuscule chance, but they scare the ever loving shit out of me and now buy saline solution when I use it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, just the ones that actually say saline. Other contact solutions have different chemicals in them and would probably burn your wound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fell off my skateboard a few years ago and scraped myself badly and had a &quot;moist&quot; wound. I let it heal by airing it out as much as I could, and even now I still have some scar tissue left over. A year later I fell off my skateboard again with nasty scrapes and a nurse told me this. Those wounds healed faster and left less scar tissue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually JUST finished putting together and posting a video I made to teach longboarders to patch up roadrash, documenting 5 weeks of healing.</p>
<p>I'm not trained on wound dressing or anything like that, but I did try to do as much research as a could in anticipation of the video. </p>
<p>This is more or less the advice I gave, But I'd really like anybody who know what their talking about to review the information I've put together, that would be really good and I can put up annotations/revisions correcting anything as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I don't mean to, hijack or or self promote or anything.
But I am trying to make sure I'm putting good information out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, did the same except I peroxided the shit out of it too.  I got tired of changing the gauze every 2 hours because it kept weeping clear fluid so I let it dry up.  Much easier to deal with dry, but it takes longer to heal.  It was on my palm too, so the tape/gauze never quite stayed on and it was a pain in the ass to use my hand until I let it dry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Peroxide is no longer recommended by most because it damages the tissue and increases scarring. Alcohol works fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what i recall out of my history and first aid classes &quot;keeping wounds dry and letting them breathe&quot; had more to do with trying to prevent or limit the onset of infections relating to unsanitary medical practices and lack of water purity standards way back in the day. A &quot;wet wound&quot; and moist bandages there in were more likely to harbor and promote the onset of various sorts of infections... where as keeping them dry was less so. That is all really quite literally medieval medical care and battle field triage related stuff... and somewhat relevant all the way to the 2nd world war.</p>
<p>However, with the advent of basic sanitation, antibiotics and readily available sterile medical supplies those concerns of the past are not really an issue anymore. A &quot;Wet wound&quot; heals much better than a dry one in terms of a lot of thing since we can treat and prevent potential infections related to it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that you raise a valid point.</p>
<p>In a hospital, where the wound will be kept in a relatively sanitary environment and, more importantly, the patient will be placed on antibiotics, wet wounds may be good for healing. </p>
<p>In an environment where the wound may not get thoroughly cleaned and redressed twice a day, and where no antibiotics are available, wet and warm = infected.</p></div>		</li>
