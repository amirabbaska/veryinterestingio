			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that on a LCD screen, the white pixel is formed with red, green and blue subpixels;  a single white pixel between to black pixels will display a clear red border on the left, and blue border on the right.</p>
<p>Maybe the eyes also pick this slight tint to increase the subconcious color-balance; It would be interesting to print your image on a white paper to eliminate this bias.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like an easy way to explain this but it really doesn't work if you actually download his pic and try it.</p>
<p>You can zoom in a ton and put your face as close as you want to the screen and there really isn't any sign of red sub-pixels.  But without bothering to zoom out at all, you can just squint at it and/or especially stand up and back away from the screen, and suddenly it's &quot;red&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theory on what you said. There is never really any &quot;sign&quot; of red sub pixels. If you're using a recent LCD monitor, the pixels are so small you can't really see them the way you could when you got up close to an old CRT screen when you were a kid.</p>
<p>But there's still there, just in varying amounts. When you have it zoomed out, you're seeing a much higher percentage of the white, blue, and black all at the same time. Let's say you're zoomed out all the way. You're seeing all the pixels at once, and all of the red sub pixels at once, evenly distributed. Even, as in even for this photo. </p>
<p>When you zoom in all the way, you're only seeing a small portion of it, and each &quot;pixel&quot; is now multiple pixels all trying to show you either blue, white, or black. So in each &quot;pixel&quot;, you're actually seeing less red because it's reproducing a large, solid square &quot;pixel&quot; of color, rather than what's closer to actual pixels, and many of them.</p>
<p>I don't feel like I explained that correctly.  I'll try again. Photo is 138kb, let's assume each pixel is 1 byte (even though black and white is 1 byte and color is...2? 3? Doesn't matter.) And I zoomed in all the way and I counted rougly 2300 pixels on my screen.</p>
<p>So zoomed out, You're seeing 138,000 instances of the sub pixels, more importantly, the red. When you zoom in, there are only 2300 of them, and they're large colored blocks. You're still seeing the red, but the proportion of the red to the blue in the blue &quot;pixel&quot; block is way way less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Color relationships. There's a video by SYCRA on YouTube called &quot;how to pick colors when painting&quot; and he briefly discusses that when you use one color, in full saturation, if you want to use another color from the other side of the color wheel, you need to use a less saturated version of that color.</p>
<p>Ie, if you have a bright green tree, your orange fruits don't need to be PURE ORANGE, they can be a greyer orange and still communicate the same thing.</p>
<p>In this case, it's light and cyan and red are opposites of each other so you can communicate the red by using greys when compared to cyan </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stuff that's actually cool about this is all hidden behind methods he didn't explain.  It's going to be some combination of histogram equalization methods, probably.  Basically, the image has a few different spectra (red, blue, green), and the image has been modified so that the histograms of these spectra are compressed and/or translated to a different range of the spectra than they originally occupied.  If you can invert those transformations, you get the original image.  I don't know if that's what he ultimately did (in a direct way), but I think that's how the correction is solved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't even need white, just any three primaries whose colorspace somewhat contains the image colors. I made <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1kAuSVB.gif" target="_blank">this</a> using only grey and two different shades of blue and you can still see red. The problem is that red is a relatively &quot;bright&quot; color so you need at least one bright primary like cyan, yellow, or green to dither it with.</p>
<p>White isn't even really a color, and I don't just mean that in &quot;well technically...&quot; kind of way. The &quot;white point&quot; is kind of an arbitrary color that you reference to compare other colors to. Since you can choose and change your color reference, this white point isn't constant, so even the concept of &quot;white&quot; as a single color is kind of fuzzy.</p>
<p>If you really want to get precise about color, you'll have to look at spectral power distributions which measure which wavelengths of photons actually exist, but then this has very little relation to color as we perceive it.</p></div>		</li>
