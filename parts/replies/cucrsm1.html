			<div class="markdown"><p>Well at the solid boundary, in the fluid state, the circulating coconut oil will be bound by the &quot;no-slip condition&quot;, which means that the velocity of the fluid at the wall equals the velocity of the wall, which in this case would be zero.  That will interfere with the circulation everywhere near the wall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. But in the picture, we see cells interfacing directly with the wall (look at the top of the first image), which I wouldn't expect if circulation was the mechanism. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. I think if there's even a 0.004 K difference there could be formation of a convective cell. </p>

<p>The Rayleigh number of interest is calculated as Ra = (g <em> beta </em> deltaT <em> L^3 )/(nu </em> alpha), where there is convection if Ra is greater than critical Rayleigh number Ra_crit = ~1100.</p>
<p>For a first pass estimate I did some rounding and used approximate values for similar materials where I couldn't find values for coconut oil. </p>
<p>g = gravity = 10 m/s2</p>
<p>beta = thermal expansion coefficient. I used the value for glycerine, 485E-6 K^-1</p>
<p>L = height of the coconut oil in the jar, I assumed 5 cm = 5E-2 m</p>
<p>deltaT=temperature difference that would drive convection, such as between the top and bottom</p>
<p>nu = kinematic viscosity = 2.74E-5 m2/s = 27.4E-6 m2/s</p>
<p>Do not confuse kinematic viscosity and dynamic viscosity...</p>
<p>alpha = thermal diffusivity. I used the value for paraffin, 0.081E-6 m2/s</p>
<p>so if there's convection for Ra &gt; Ra_crit, we can use the relation for Ra above to find out a critical temperature above which there would be convection:
deltaT&gt; (Ra_crit <em> nu </em> alpha)/(g <em> beta </em> L^3 )</p>
<p>here's what I get for the right hand side of that relation: </p>
<p>(Ra_crit <em> nu </em> alpha)/(g <em> beta </em> L^3 ) = (1100 <em> 27.4E-6 m2/s </em> 0.08E-6 m2/s)/(10 m/s2 <em> 485E-6 K^-1 </em>125E-6 m^3 )
=(1100 <em> 27.4 </em> 0.08)/(10 <em> 485 </em> 125) = 0.0039 K</p>
<p>So, for deltaT&gt;0.0039 K, convection should spontaneously arise.</p>
<p>Alternately, if you assume deltaT = 0.1 K between the top and bottom surface of the coconut oil, which is a fairly reasonable assumption, you'll get Ra = 27700, which is more than the critical number of 1100, indicating the presence of convection.</p>
<p>Ra = (10 <em> 485E-6 </em> 125E-6 <em> 0.1)/(27.4E-6 </em> 0.08E-6) = 27700</p>
<p>Cheers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what's the Rayleigh number of the jar of coconut oil? Don't just say it's convection-driven, show under reasonable assumptions that the Rayleigh number is at or above the critical Rayleigh number for reasonable conditions.</p></div>		</li>
