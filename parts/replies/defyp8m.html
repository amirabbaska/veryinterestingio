			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm astounded this is so far down. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 were in just about every living room in the US with a console in the late 90s and early 2000s. As a skater in the late 90s, it was a shock shift in everyone's consciousness. Basically overnight everyone knew who Tony was and had some basic skating literacy (grinds, flip tricks, vert vs. street, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But his name was pretty damn well known before those games. And like others have mentioned, it's the same reason I know who Shaun White is even though I've never watched snowboarding, and can't name a single other one... People that win, win, win make it through even to the people not paying attention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had probably heard of Tony Hawk before those games but they were definitely the reason I know so much about him. Same could be said for the copies that were made for bmx and surfing (Dave Mirra and Kelly Slater).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had to scroll way too far to see this. OPs question wasn't about why he's well known in skateboarding circles, it's why he's well known even outside of skateboarding circles.</p>
<p>It's almost entirely the fantastic videogames that millions of people played, with his name plastered on the cover.</p></div>		</li>
