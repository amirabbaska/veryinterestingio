			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very good answer. Addicts that fit the stereotype of the most extreme addiction aren't living right, and that lifestyle alone makes people seem crazy, ugly, and vile. If a person doesn't eat right, sleep properly, take care of their hygiene at all, and they live off of scrounged up small amounts of money, it doesn't matter whether they're abusing opiates, amphetamines, alcohol, or whatever- they are going to look like hell and act erratically. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ritalin is Methylphenidate. More norepiphrene, less dopamine and serotonin action. The main reason it's prescribed so often over dextroamphetamine can be condensed pretty much to &quot;drugs are bad m'kay&quot;, sadly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just going to mention that. So much of it depends on the amount used, right? I have clients on Desoxyn or on opiate pain meds, who I have no reason to think are abusing their meds, and they are in good health and maintain their hygiene. Probably actually better when they're on the meds, because they're better able to be present in their lives.</p>
<p>Oh, and with street drugs, you have no idea what's in it or how much you're taking. I've actually told my teens that, yes, drugs are bad and it's probably best to just not, but I want them to be aware as part of their decision-making process that prescription meds are made in a controlled factory and labeled with their dosage, you can look up what dosage is approaching dangerous, and people don't generally get stabbed in an alley or arrested for seeing what happens if they take more Percocet than the bottle says to. </p></div>		</li>
