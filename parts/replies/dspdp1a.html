			<div class="markdown"><p>Also I will add that when I said “proposed”, I meant that it is fairly we’ll documented and agreed upon by climate scientists that nuclear testing did have an impact on global temperatures. The impact would not have been regional, but probably would have been contained to the northern hemisphere due to atmospheric circulation patterns. Great question!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply. So if anything nukes would generally lower the temperature short term, but would there be any destabilizing effects from the atmospheric nuke detonations that countries were doing up until the 80s?
I can't help but think that the 2000+ nuclear explosions during the 20th century has done something detrimental to the environment and atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but a few things to consider:</p>
<p>Many of the tests were underground/water, and would produce much less pollution than might be expected. Atmospheric tests are going to be localised and short lived in their effects, thunderstorms transport large quantities of material to great heights all the time.</p>
<p>The amount of materiel put into the atmosphere is probably much smaller than you may think (compared to other sources like fossil fuel use, wildfires and volcanoes ), and it is relatively short lived. Great comment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7qhogt/has_nuclear_testing_during_the_20th_century/dspr7nv/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>And to digress a little:</p>
<p>The worries about a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter" target="_blank">nuclear winter</a> (following a major USA-USSR exchange) seemed well founded in the 80's - but there is plenty of room for argument about the severity, especially with the smaller, current stockpiles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, yes. There is talk in the field of geo-engineering about suspending aerosols (sulfates) in the stratosphere which yield a similar effect that volcanoes produce. This effect is short lived (2-3 years) and has other consequences. For instance, these aerosols may lower our global temperature, but they do not effect the root cause of climate change. This method could be used in tandem with attempting to reduce C02/CH4 emissions to buy us some time. It is very complicated both scientifically, politically and ethically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uhm, you probably should point out that you can inject aerosols into the stratosphere <strong>without</strong> exploding nuclear bombs, which have a whole lot of problematic consequences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a recent paper that indicated the disasterous cooling that followed chicxulub impact was due to the asteroid/meteor striking into a shallow sea with high sulfate rock/crust. The debris cloud thrown up by the impact had a much greater, longer lived cooling effect due the amount of sulfur/sulfates that were put into the atmosphere. If the impact had been in the deep ocean it was theorized the climate effects would not have been nearly as severe, perhaps allowing greater survival of dominante dinosaur species and not quite as enabling the mammals to radiate into empty niches</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a sci-fi/fantasy short story where the main character is a down on his luck scotsman who hates life because a solar shield the Americans have orbited between the Earth and the Sun has resulted in an almost continual rain in Scotland. I think it also blocks the sun in Scotland so it is dark pretty much all the time (more so than normal). It's only a sideshow to the main plotline, but does give an example of some of the ethical and winners/losers effects from possible Geoengineering fixes to Climate change. However, the same really applies to climate change without geoengineering.  Countries like Canada and Russia (and perhaps Scotland) are slated to see a possible positive effects of a warmed climate with increased growing seasons and more temperate climate in very cold areas  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have a read of this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_engineering" target="_blank">climate engineering</a></p>
<p>Generally speaking climate engineering is considered to be a bad idea. We are very new at this and it's not clear what knock on effects deliberately altering the climate might have. Who knows though, at the rate we are going I suspect it might be necessary in years to come.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't even need to do much. Earth without the sun would be a toasty 40 K. With the sun it's 288 K. Ergo, the sun delivers ~250 degrees of warming. Cut it by just 1%, barely even noticeable, and that would more than eliminate the warming we've incurred in the last century. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When aerosols are suspended for years, they are able to circulate quite effectively. Volcanic ash is an example that is fairly common. The eruption of Lake Toba in Indonesia yielded ash on both the Antarctica and Greenland ice sheets. The nuance about atmospheric circulation is that particulates are unlikely to move across the climatic equator (ITCZ).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting thought. I would say that it depended on the settling period of the dust, as well as precipitation after it settled. Over all though, probably not enough to flip the net impact. Most of the dust would have deposited on land or in the ocean, with only some of it depositing on glaciers or ice sheets (since if would have deposited relatively uniformly). </p></div>		</li>
