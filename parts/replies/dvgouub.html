			<div class="markdown"><p>A simple, and yet mind blowing calculation: 5cm a year over 20 000 years is a kilometre of ice... 1mm a year for 1 million years, 1km of ice. The ice sheet is what, tens of millions years old?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I'm trying to say is that it just puts in perspective how long 20 000 years is. Also a bit of a stab at you non metric folks. &quot;How many inches in a mile, ehh, I don't know&quot;.</p>
<p>edit: You mean, how did they find how old it is? I imagine you could drill down all the way and then measure isotope ratios either of things in the ice on the bottom or of the material covered by ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s kinda like tree rings. The lighter parts of a tree show faster growth, the darker ones show slower. A pair of dark and light bands represent 1 year. </p>
<p>The CO2 in earths atmosphere does the same thing. Most of the land in the world is in the northern hemisphere, so there’s more plants that take in CO2 during the summer in the north than in the winter. This causes the global CO2 to fluctuate each year. If you measure the concentration of CO2 in the ice, you can see these fluctuations reach back 1000s of years (though not as bad as it does now). </p>
<p>TLDR:
1 light band+1 dark band = 1 year for a tree
1 band of lower CO2+1 band of higher CO2=1 year in ice</p>

<p>While the precipitation is low. The  ice melt is also low. So it's just hanging around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some water is young.</p>
<p>Whenever you burn anything organic, new water is formed from the hydrogen in the thing you're burning and the oxygen in the air.</p>
<p>So the burning of fossil fuels creates quite a lot of new water. Not enough that it'll ever become a problem or anything, just saying that not all water is the same.</p></div>		</li>
