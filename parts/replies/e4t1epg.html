<p>A molecule capable of resonance, when receiving a specific energy wavelenght via light, will prefer to discharge this energy by emitting a longer wavelenght than it has received, instead of discharging the energy by the means of vibrating (generating heat) like most molecules do. This is called the absorbance peak</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not quite... materials are colored because they usually absorb some wavelengths of light better than others - the color that you see the material as is due to the colors it doesn't absorb (so the colors it reflects). What you are describing is actually emission or luminescence, which is when a molecule is excited by a photon of light, and then gets rid of that energy by giving off another photon of light of a slightly different energy. Things can be colored without being emissive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the more resonance you get, the longer the wavelenght absorbed gets and in turn, the longer the wavelenght reflected becomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, not quite true - I've made compounds that absorb in the red and yellow regions of the spectrum and they are actually blue/green in color (blue and green are actually <em>shorter</em> wavelengths than red and yellow). Edit: Of course they also reflect the wavelengths in the infrared that they don't absorb as well (which would be longer in wavelength) but we can't see that.</p>

<p>Not sure if you are referring to any kind of specific molecule or structure, but I guess it depends on what you consider a sensor and what you design your molecule to do. Rhodopsin is the name of the protein in your eye that starts the whole process of being able to &quot;see&quot; - it absorbs a photon and part of the protein basically changes shape in response, and this conformation change starts a whole cascade of other events relevant to your vision. Some types of molecules also undergo conformational or molecular changes when they absorb light - sometimes the changes are reversible and sometimes they are not. You can also design your molecule to react with certain substrates so that they change the wavelength they absorb or emit or go from nonemissive to emissive (or emissive to nonemissive).</p>

<p>In the case of atoms and molecules, the electrons have discrete energy levels that they can be at called electronic states, and these electronic states are at well defined energies. If an atom or molecule absorbs a photon with an energy that corresponds to one of these electronic states, it is &quot;excited&quot; to this higher energy state. Molecules in their excited state can do a few things - they can either just vibrate and release this extra energy as heat to get back to their lowest energy ground state (sometimes they populate other lower energy excited states on the way back down if they relax this way), they can give off a photon of the correct energy to get back to their ground state, or they may be able to interact with another molecule in some way (electron transfer, energy transfer, photochemical reaction, etc.) I guess you can think of it as using a ladder - each rung on the ladder exists at a specific position and you will require a specific amount of energy to get to each rung (but you aren't going to hang out between rungs of the ladder). Once you are given enough energy to get up to that specific rung, you can now reach the thing that you needed to get on the ladder to do but couldn't reach from the ground (the photochemical reaction), you can slide down the ladder like a fireman right back down to the ground (kind of like emission), or you can kind of wiggle your way back down to the ground and probably step on a few rungs on the way down (kind of like vibrational relaxation).</p>
<p>Edited: Just thought of this, but I guess one of the examples of photoactive compounds that are the most relatable to our everyday lives (or used to be I guess haha) are the silver halides that they use in photographic film!</p></div>		</li>
