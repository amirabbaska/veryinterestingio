<p>sugar (carbohydrates) is not high in calories... both carbohydrates and proteins have the same amount of calories per gram:  4.  however fat is more calorically dense with 9 calories per gram.</p>
<p>the reason we associate sugar with high-calorie foods is because our brains associate sweet with reward.  since sweet things tend to be in short supply in the wild (fruits have a very limited time of availability, and honey gathering has its own risks), we're evolutionarily programmed to seek them out.  </p>
<p>fat is where you'll get the most long-lasting energy.  we crave sugar and it gives shorter bursts of energy, but 100g of sugar will have the same caloric content as 100g of protein.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why do you think our brains are hardwired to associate sweetness/sugariness with reward? Why do you think evolution drove that adaption? ...<em>because it's a calorie dense compound in an easy to utilize form.</em></p>
<p>Evolution doesn't just give animals a taste for something just because it's rare. Evolution gives animals a taste for something because it provides a survival advantage. The rarity factor definitely contributed to making our brains want it even more, but that only matters because acquiring sugar meant the different between life and death for many of our ancestors.</p>
<p>The comparative energy density figures you cite are irrelevant because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bioenergetics is far more complicated than just one figure.</li>
<li>Non-sugar energy sources generally still get converted into sugar by our bodies, so it's not surprising that skipping the slower-to-process intermediary forms of energy had an evolutionary appeal.</li>
<li>Availability &amp; form matters far more than an energy density difference of only a few calories.
<ul>
<li>Proteins usually came on the bones of animals, and hunting animals takes quite a bit of work, you're either hunting many small ones or a few large and dangerous ones.</li>
<li>Fats come on both animals and plants, but fats on animals suffer the same problem protein does, and fats in plants isn't great because plants don't carry very much. For example, it takes about ten pounds of olives to produce four cups of olive oil.</li>
<li>Sugar, on the other hand, being a ready-to-use form of energy, was (and is) commonly used by plants to feed seedlings. That's what fruits are.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Sugar is good for us. Our bodies would die without it. The problem is quantity. We can consume far more sugar in a few spoonfuls of processed table sugar than we ever could in a few wild fruit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>except that fat is twice as calorically dense than sugar.</p>

<p>i'm well aware of this, but this is ELI5, not askscience.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>no, they don't, and you don't get to accuse me of oversimplifying and then go do it yourself.  i'm well aware of the process of glucogenesis, however that process only creates small amounts of glucose for what the brain needs, and doesn't create NEARLY as much as we ingest on a regular basis.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>only a few calories?  fat has over twice the amount of calories as protein or carb.  that's not &quot;only a few&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>except they wouldn't.  there are plenty of examples of people going months without sugar sources, living on proteins and fats, and thriving.  i'm not discounting the fruit, but you're ignoring that fruit contain more than just sugars.  we need the fiber and the vitamin content far more than the fructose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it is much easier to eat 100g of sugar and far more common for food to have an exorbitant amount like that than it is to have 100g of protein (I can't even begin to think how hard that would be to eat at once. that's like what, a pound of chicken breast?) For comparison 100g of sugar is like, two and a half Cokes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to point out, that 2.2 lb is 1 kg (1000g), hence 100g is .22 lbs, or a bit more than 1/8 of a pound. Approximately 300 grams of chicken meat will have that much protein, which is around 3 chicken breasts from KFC (94g of protein), and it's not irregular to have that much chicken in one meal.</p>
<p>To get 100g in sugars, you'd have to drink 942ml of Coka-Cola (from nutrition facts in their website), which is almost 3 cans of Cokes.</p>
<p>But in the wild, the hunter-gatherers would probably get their sugar from fruits, and to have 100g of sugar, you'd need to eat 2 kilograms of strawberry, or 1.1kg of oranges (11 oranges), or 5 apples. So depending on the fruit, it is much harder to eat 100g of sugar than protein.</p>
<p>But the fruit we have now are bred generations upon generations to be sweeter and better tasting, so the fruits back then had a much lower sugar content. </p>
<p>Fruits also have many other important nutritional values, which may have made the mind crave sugar.</p></div>		</li>

<p>no.</p>
<p>according to <a href="http://lifecdn.dailyburn.com/life/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/What-25-Grams-of-Protein-Looks-Like.png" target="_blank">this infographic</a> that displays protein in 25g servings, you could easily do a handful of cashews, 4oz of cheese, and 6oz of chicken.  it's not nearly as much as you think it is, especially considering that we have easy access to protein powder, so 1-2 scoops would do it.</p>
<p>now granted, it's easier to get 100g of sugar because it's easier to find sugar in its raw form... meat sources generally have fat attached to them.  and again, we seek out sources of sugar because our brains have evolved to like sweets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as someone trying to put on muscle I eat 160 grams of protein every day. Eggs in the morning, some peanut butter or soy for lunch, meat or fish for dinner, easy peasy. If I want to break from that routine, there's protein shakes made from whey which are really good for you, but generally most of my meals look like what I posted above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actually no... the reason they replace the fat with sugar is because early attempts at low-fat and fat-free foods failed miserably because they tasted horrible.  fat adds flavor, as any good chef will tell you.  in order to make the foods palatable, companies had to add sugar.</p>
<p>and since sugar contributes more to obesity than fat ever did, we find ourselves in the midst of an obesity epidemic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salt isn't for retaining water, it is used for transporting molecules into the cell through co-transport processes and to aid in the cell's electrochemical gradient. This salt, NaCl or table salt, is what your body will crave. Cells can break down multiple types of molecules from food, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids (fats) which each allow the cellular respiration to occur. Lipids contain long chains of H-C, unsaturated are ideal that have no Oxygen attached to the chain of H-C already, allow for a larger amount of ATP production which is a renewable source of energy for your cells to do work as long as they have energy available from the breaking of the H-C bonds. Your brain knows this, also fiber usually refers to cellulose which your body lacks the ability to digest so cells in your lower intestine will increase their secretions to help it on its way, constipation is also when you have trouble pooping fyi.</p>
<p>TLDR: Salt good for bring good molecule into cell. Good molecule make happy cell. Fats have lot energy. Yumm yumm. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually it is. Everything you wrote after that is true too.</p>
<p>But our bodies do retain water through sodium (Na). We can accumulate the sodium, retaining it in our blood, thanks to the aldosterone (secreted by our adrenal glands) acting on our kidneys to make the distal tubules and collective ducts to reabsorb the filtrated sodium and keep it in our system. Those resulting high sodium concentrations have an effect on our hypothalamus by stimulating the secretion of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH or vasopressin) which also acts on our kidneys by increasing renal water absortion and thus retaining water (the sodium triggers another effect on our hypothalamus, and it's thirst). Such system (the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) is triggered by low blood pressures. When blood pressures are normalized or high, the heart secretes atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) to do the opposite (to eliminate sodium through urine).</p>
<p>While another sodium main function in our bodies is to make the sodium potassium pump (Na/K ATPase) work, its role in the water retention (through our hypothalamus and kidneys) is also a main function of sodium within the whole human physiology (and other animals physiology too).</p></div>		</li>
