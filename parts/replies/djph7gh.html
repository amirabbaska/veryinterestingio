			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing about professors is a bit of an odd one. </p>
<p>Very few professors at top tier universities are there because they want to teach kids fresh out of high school. They're almost all there to do research and publish papers - lessons and grading student papers are a major drain on their available time to write papers. The only marginal benefit to the professors is the possibility they will identify good research assistants.</p>
<p>So there's this assumption that graduates from prestigious universities have recieved education from the best educators possible that may be a lot less true than people think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My university has a lot of professors who do incredible research, are involved in medical innovations, etc. </p>
<p>And so many of them are the most monotonous lecturers ever. They have absolutely no desire to be teaching the basics of their field to a bunch of overly keen med kids when they have far more important things to do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a top tier university and this is not really true. There's both great teachers and ones who don't care, and the ratio defers from university to university (and between departments too). Intro classes are usually taught by the profs focusing on teaching, and they're generally pretty great (e.g. look up Walter Lewin, Mehran Sahami, or Alexander Nemerov).</p>
<p>The profs focusing on research can be terrible at lectures sometimes, but they're often in the center of their field so they can be a great resource. But yeah a lot of them don't care much about the classes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't mean to say the lecturers at top tier universities are necessarily bad - I went to one and had my fair share of lecturers who were both very good and very bad, more that the fact a university is highly ranked often bears little on the quality of tuition, particularly at the undergraduate level and particularly if you don't plan on going into academia - outside of a small handful of subjects the cutting edge of academic research is a long way removed from the nuts and bolts of working in industry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also the filtration factor.</p>
<p>If you graduate from a university that is well known for letting subpar students graduate, your degree is not worth as much. If you graduate from a prestigious school that only allows top-tier students in, and fails out any student that does not perform to expectations, your degree will be more valuable. </p>
<p>Part of your degree's value is based on every person who has already gotten that degree and every person who <em>will</em> get that degree. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^This. Too many people are beating around the bush. It ultimately comes down to how people perceive and judge you. Graduating from a top university, simply put, is impressive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. To me it's best described as potential in regards to what a student could get out of it. For example there is more potential knowledge of engineering to learn from at Harvard than at a public state school (university of where ever you live).</p></div>		</li>
