			<div class="markdown"><p>Like the other guy explained, it really isn't enough compression to stop blood flow to the extremity. As to how they help, understand that the main way that blood gets from the veins to the heart is through muscle contraction, every time you squeeze your muscles from walking or whatever it increases the pressure and pushes blood back to the heart. Theoretically, compression stockings help this because the squeezing increases the pressure. As to if their effective, people tend to go back and forth on that. I've only worked in the hospital for about half a year and on my unit all the doctors have gone from using them, to not using them at all, to one doctor using them, to all the doctors wanting them for patients again. So, they probably don't hurt. That being said, you probably don't need them if your just working at your desk day to day as long as you get up and walk around regularly (every hour) and take care of yourself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atleast in response to your first question, arteries are deeper (further in the body) than veins and are generally harder. Compression socks won't stop blood flow going to the feet/lower legs and then the compression of the sock increases the pressure in the veins near the outside of the leg (wear the sock is touching) helping them push more blood back to the heart </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Arteries are not &quot;deeper&quot; than veins.  And &quot;harder&quot; isn't the word you want to use -- arteries have a higher pressure in them so they do not compress as easily as veins do.</p>
<p>The compression stockings help circulate the venous blood (under lower pressure) back to your heart without squeezing down so hard that it blocks arterial blood flow (colloquially referred to as &quot;cutting off circulation&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was my understanding that arteries are generally &quot;less deep&quot; than veins, as veins are considered mostly superficial compared to arteries? Also I thought arteries had thicker walls. And I'm not arguing I'm eager to learn, I'm a student </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is inaccurate. Compression stockings exceed venous pressure but not arterial pressures, so they won't collapse arteries. The veins that develop important blood clot are the deep veins, which you cannot see (ie. Popliteal, femoral, and iliac veins)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your healthy i'd say in general no, but there might be specific cases when it helps. Me and my father had blood clots (genetic problems). There are valves in the veins that prevent the blood from flowing back down to your feet. In his case some of those valves got damaged which basically means the heart pumps the blood up a bit but it will just drop back down because the valves won't stop it. Now he has to wear the compression socks to make sure the blood vessels in his feet can't expand and there's no blood stuck there (which would cause more clots to form). So basically the pressure makes sure the blood can't flow back down and acts as a replacement for those damaged valves. </p>
<p>In my case no of the valves got damaged and all my blood vessels look fine, so according to the doc i don't have to wear the compression socks (which i am thankful for those things are kind of annoying).</p>
<p>But if you have low blood pressure or just problems with your vessels in general it might be a good idea. But that's something only a doctor can tell you after he checked your blood flow and blood vessels in your legs. </p></div>		</li>
