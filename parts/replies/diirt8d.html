<p>If someone backs up into your car and just says you reared him, if there are no witnesses it's your word against his and you'll lose.
I bet insurance companies will be intersested in footage like that.</p>
<p>But maybe it happens more in some countries than others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on the area. Where i grew up (Alabama), your scam would work 99% of the time. There were laws placing fault on the driver that did the rear ending and police were allowed to make a initial assessment about fault at the scene. You could challenge that in court, but it was an uphill battle going against the officer's initial assessment.  </p>
<p>However, where i live now (maryland), the scam would be much harder. there is no automatic blame placed on the car doing the rear ending. And police are normally not allowed to make any assessments of fault. All fault for an accident is shared between all parties equally unless there is solid evidence which normally entails two eye witnesses or video evidence.   </p>
<p>That all being said. I think the prospect of insurance scams is still high enough to warrant inctivising dash cams. But what do i know. I'm not in the insurance business</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insurance companies <em>specialize</em> in assessing risk and reward, surely there is <em>some</em> amount of incentive that is worthwhile for them, even if its like &quot;we will knock $1 per month off your insurance if you have a dash cam&quot;. $1 isn't much but it might be enough to make <em>some</em> people say &quot;hey I was thinking about it anyway, lets do it&quot;, and it seems pretty likely that $1 per month per dash cam would pay for itself for the insurance company.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is like that old if it costs less to settle claims than issue a recall then we won't issue a recall thing.</p>
<p>Unless they can structure an incentive that will actually get enough people to use cameras so that it saves them enough money on fraudulent claims to both pay for the incentive, and then save them money on top that, then there's not much point in incentivizing camera use. </p>
<p>So there's some threshold level of loss by scams (scams that would  be revealed by a dashboard cam) they'd have to reach for it to be worth their while</p></div>		</li>
