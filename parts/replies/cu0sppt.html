			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually drove to South Carolina to the only location of the Puckerbutt company and bought two freshly picked Carolina Reapers from the near-by nursery (the current worlds hottest pepper). </p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was how vivid their colors were and how oily it looked. Never having eaten a pepper pod before I went to my sister's house with my brother and pressured him into eating it with me. </p>
<p>At first it tasted like a spiceless green pepper, and suddenly I felt as with my arm was waking up from falling asleep, without the pain, except it was my whole body. My breath became unbearably hot but I wanted to try to make it 10 minutes without milk. 4 minutes in and I'm talking but my speech is slurred and the whole left side of my body is completely numb. </p>
<p>Having had to stand up and sit down a couple time to avoid fainting, it was time to surrender and drink milk. The milk was immediate relief but triggered horrible aftershock pain in my stomach. It felt like my stomach was having a kidney stone, has if the milk became a spiked rock. </p>
<p>I immediately rushed outside and threw everything up behind a bush and felt 100% normal right away. My brother only achieved dry heaves and ended up having to spend the night with it in his stomach. He never reported back on any pains coming out. Yup, so if you want to experience that, just drive <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?num=30&amp;espv=2&amp;q=puckerbutt&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAmoVChMI56HBxPGkxwIVRWg-Ch28YAhY" target="_blank">here</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>my dad used to do homemade horseradish (which is basically just putting it in the blender with some boiled beets, sugar and maybe vinegar if that's your thing).</p>
<p>You couldn't walk into the kitchen while he was making it.  It would just destroy you.  Walking by the door would make you tear uncontrollably.  You never had to worry about sinus blockage when he made it either.</p>
<p>We were kids we called it &quot;Nuclear Sauce&quot;.  It was so much hotter than the weak stuff you buy in a jar, I don't even understand what they did to the jarred horseradish to make it so weak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the hottest horeradish you can get buy a bit of fresh root.  </p>
<p>It will have little or no smell, <em>until you finely grate it or grind it up in a food processor</em>.  The heat developes over about fifteen minutes of exposure to air.  </p>
<p>The food processor will mix in a <em>lot</em> of air.  When you approach the work bowl do so with great caution.  <em>Do not</em> stick your nose in it and take a great big sniff!</p>
<p>You've. Been. Warned.</p></div>		</li>
