			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a TV producer. Every station I've ever worked at has only employed meteorologists. My current station has three meteorologists. They all prepare their own forecasts, graphics, etc. and go on air live and report it. Most local stations these days do it this way. No weathermen, just meteorologists who do their own forecasts on TV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would have guessed that they need to have a meteorologist on staff for when severe weather hits.  They can read the radar and look for cloud rotation to predict tornados and shit. I suppose this depends on where you live. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. My mom worked for a small town station, away from any harsh weather outside the occasional thunderstorm, so having one available all the time wasn't necessary.</p></div>		</li>
