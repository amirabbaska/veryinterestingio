			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, time also speeds up in the lower gravity that a satellite is in. However, the effect on time due to the higher velocity is stronger than the effect of lower gravity; the net effect is that time slows down for a satellite but not as much as solely due to the effects of high velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two corrections/clarifications: </p>
<p>1) GPS satellites are not in geosynchronous orbits. They are in medium Earth orbits (at about 20,200 km) and go around the Earth twice each day. </p>
<p>2) Higher orbits equal lower velocities, not higher velocities. The ISS (for example), which is in low Earth orbit, has an orbital speed of 27,600Â km/h. GPS satellites have an orbital speed of about 14,000 km/h.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The higher up you go the slower you can orbit because the pull of gravity is weaker. </p>
<p>While a higher orbit means that you travel further during a single orbit, the lower velocity means that you travel less distance during an Earth sidereal day. </p>
<p>To put another way: during one Earth sidereal day a geostationary satellite travels around the Earth exactly one time. But in low Earth orbit a satellite would go around the Earth every 90 minutes.</p>
<p>A simple case to look at is the moon. It orbits at an average distance of about 390,000 km, but has an orbital velocity of just 3,600 km/h. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The GPS satellites each transmit data showing their own location (and the precise time).</p>
<p>(It's also worth noting that only geostationary objects appear to remain stationery. Geosynchronous objects actually appear (from the ground) to move around.)</p>
<p>So your receiver gets data, from a minimum of four satellites, that tells it their exact location and uses that to calculate its own position. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tower clock is an example of general relativity. Time will be slower the <em>closer</em> you are to a large mass due to gravitational curvature of spacetime. So the further you are from the center of the earth/sun/galactic central supermassive black hole, the faster your time.</p>
<p>Special relativity applies to time dilation due to the relative velocities of two frames of reference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an actual experiment done with both towers and planes, if memory serves, that proved the theories of both General and Special relativity. <a href="https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/09/16/hafele-keating-experiment-two-atomic-clocks-flew-twice-around-world-eastward-westward-back-home-showed-different-times/" target="_blank">Here's a link to one</a> and if you google &quot;atomic clock experiment relativity&quot; then you'll see other similar experiments; It is expensive to do, but it was worth it to do because of how fundamentally important the Theory of Relativity is to how we understood physics until Quantum Mechanics came into being.</p>
<p>A fun note, GPS are one of the few problems that you need to account for both General and Special relativity to solve.</p></div>		</li>
