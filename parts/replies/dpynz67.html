			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, no. So sorry you feel that way! This is like hearing someone hasn't watched Firefly yet, because cowboys in space sounds lame... Because assembly is awesome.
CPUs are glorious beasts. They literally carry out billions of instructions per second. But on top comes abstraction layers that waters down that power.
Assembly gets you back close to the copper. That roaring power is yours to command.
Assembly is awesome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. It was interesting enough from a &quot;ok, so this is how things are working down low&quot; perspective, but by god I do not want to make anything complicated in x86 ever. I didn't struggle with the extremely basic stuff we learned, but it was obvious from that glimpse just how monumentally brain-breakingly complex creating anything large would be using those tools.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In fact, you can &quot;play&quot; any file you want through your speakers. However, for 99% of all the files you try, it will just sound like static unless you attempt to play an actual audio WAV file. </p>

<p>And I'm sure you know this, but adding something else interesting for the person you're replying to:  you can &quot;execute&quot; code that is part of your data files (such as pictures or music).  Modern operating systems and processors have protections against this, but this is and was a major source of security issues.  If an attacker could get an image, string of text, or audio file in a known location with machine instructions hidden in it they could take advantage of flaws in the program to get it to jump to that location in its execution and run code of their choosing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Several softmod methods for the Wii are like this. One of them has you put whatever mod loader you want along with an edited &quot;custom level&quot; file on an SD card and load it up in Smash Bros Brawl. The code in the &quot;level&quot; is executed, and the console starts the software. From there it has full permissions, and can install the homebrew channel, load roms, whatever you want.</p>
<p>Because the method only requires Brawl and an SD card, it's a very convenient way to get <a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/Project_M" target="_blank">Project M</a> loaded on a stock Wii, and doesn't leave it modded.</p>
<p>This actually still works today, even on a Wii-U in Wii mode.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, though I generally don't think of that term so much as describing an attack vector, but to describe the practice of hiding information with the intention of somebody else who knows it's there finding it, but not the intermediaries.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There were a series of &quot;punch cards&quot; where you would punch out the 1's and leave the 0's (or vice-versa) on big grid patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is entirely true, but even earlier computers actually had the programmer use a switch on the computer itself to toggle in the ones and zeroes or On and Offs <em>by hand</em>.  The punch card was actually quite an advancement.</p>
<p>It was taken from weavers who used a similar system to program automated looms that were invented in the early 19th Century.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Punch cards were a mess.  I remember writing my program on a piece of paper then go to the punch card room and wait for a free one.  You start typing and any error on this line code would get the card to the trash.  When all your cards were punch you would go (and wait in line) to the card reader and &amp;?%*?% one of your card get torn out by the reader, back to the punch room.</p>
<p>Once your cards were finally red by the reader there was another line up at the printer (no screen at all) and your result was good or not.  If not, redo the whole process again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yet punch cards were a huge improvement upon the <a href="https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/roger.broughton/museum/iomedia/images/pt1.jpg" target="_blank">punched paper tape</a> I started out using. Make a mistake there, and you're cutting and splicing to fix a simple typo.</p>
<p>And that paper tape was a huge improvement over the <a href="http://www.glennsmuseum.com/ibm/med/med_ibm_402_bd.jpg" target="_blank">plugboards</a> that came even earlier. Try finding a typo in that mess!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Granted, this was a hobbyist system in the 1970s, and &quot;big&quot; computers were doing more advanced things by then-- but it still serves as a good example of the sort of &quot;uphill both ways in the snow&quot; stuff people were doing to program computers not that long ago.</p></div>		</li>
