			<div class="markdown"><p>I find that it isn't so much the device, but what you're doing with it.  If I read a book on my phone or pad, I generally doze off after awhile, just as I would with a paper book.  But if I'm surfing click-bait on the internet, I'll stay awake.  Similarly, if I do a Sudoku puzzle in bed (even with pencil &amp; paper), I'll stay awake. </p>
<p>So I think it's letting your mind relax by doing passive things (get sleepy) vs keeping your mind active by doing things that require input (stay awake for hours).</p></div>		</li>
