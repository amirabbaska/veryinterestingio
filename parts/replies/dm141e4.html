(Mutually orbiting gas giants could be more likely to form, but could also be orbitally unstable, depending on the configuration of the rest of the solar system.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's feasible if that system were to form, but its formation is unlikely. A Neptune-mass moon is unlikely to form in orbit around a 20-Jupiter mass planet, since the planet will dominate the process of sweeping up available mass in the system, and it is unlikely to be gravitationally captured because a Neptune-mass object is likely to stabilize into its own orbit.</p></div>		</li>
