			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, through the vagus nerve, the gut (digestive tract) sends 90% of the signals. So your gut talks to your brain more than the brain talks to the gut. It's almost like it's independent from the brain, it will still somewhat function without the brain's input.
The gut has it's own primitive nervous system so to speak and is like a more primitive brain on its own.<br />

This is a really interesting video on the gut brain for those interested</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, the &quot;gut instict&quot; is a very old saying, originating way before we realised how the gut-brain axis works. </p>
<p>The &quot;gut instict&quot; is likely to do with the adrenergic response to stress, leading to the odd sensation in your stomach (&quot;butterflies&quot;). Trusting your gut is more to do with fight-or-flight</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found it interesting that centipedes dont control their legs, they tell the segments what direction to move in, and how to bend. The leg control unit takes over in each segment. Its interesting that something similiar happens in humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice video, which also says that probiotics work, and 50%of the dopamine and 90% of the serotonin are produced in the gut. Whenever I read about probiotics online they claim there haven't been studied which show clear benefits. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nerve injuries to the spine (/neck?) above a certain point do prevent breathing though? Does the Vagus nerve pass close to the spine at some point up the neck?</p>
<p>Also on a side note, not all parts of your body need to communicate with the brain, you can disrupt signals sent along the spine with cocaine or another sedative of your choice via injection into that region and reflexes will still work I do believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes if your injury is high enough you can not breath without a ventilator. Anything above about the first 3 vertebrae. I’m paralyzed in the 5th and can breath. But my guts bladder bowels etc do not run as they should.  Example. Need a catheter to urinate and suppository to have a bowel movement.  Almost all food causes stomach pain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nerves which innervate the diaphragm branch off of the spine at C3-C5, so fractures to those vertebra and up are the ones which are likely to have outcomes affecting respiration. The smooth muscle of the lung is not controlled in this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean the people who cannot move their arms but still breathe were extremly (un)lucky?
If i understood you right it is very rare that one loses control of the arms but can still breathe, or did i understand it wrong?</p>
<p>And if you know it, i have some more questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why can we connect the nerves on limbs (e.g. when we transplant something) but not at the spinal chord?
Are they too small/complex or can we just not reach them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would it be harder or easier to install a &quot;wifi&quot; connection at the broken nerves instead of connecting them back</p>
</li>
<li>Do synthethic nerves exist that we could use to connect the broken connections?
Or can you use donor nerves?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Edit: oh and one more question, how are the nerves that control heart, gut, etc. protected?</p></div>		</li>
