			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahhh, makes sense.  Since you seem to know a bit about this, it's my understanding that light loses energy every time it inverts it's velocity (bouncing off a mirror) which would be a shift in frequency.  </p>
<p>Is there a perceptible color shift from just one bounce off a mirror or is the energy loss too small to see? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That isn't really true. No surface is 100% reflective. The light that isn't reflected is absorbed. But the reflected photons do not lose any energy unless they are absorbed and later emitted, such as in fluorescence and phosphorescence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true. Energy/momentum conservation means that photons reflecting off a perfectly reflective surface do lose a little bit of energy, that is very near to zero as an approximation.</p>
<p>Solving the equation exactly shows that there's a small shift in frequency and a drop in energy; due to Doppler shifting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then how do solar sails work?  Aren't they essentially a large mirror?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That isn't how it works at all. Each photon has a given amount of energy, which is not altered when reflecting off of a metallic mirror. This energy is related to the frequency of the light, and nothing else. In order to change the wavelength of the reemitted light, there needs to be a shift in frequency of the light when it reflects off the surface. Interestingly, this can happen if the mirror is moving towards or away from the light that is incident on it, which can redshift or blueshift the light when it is reflected. There are devices known as acousto-optic modulators that create travelling sound waves inside a crystal. These sound waves create alternating low and high refractive index bands in the crystal, which are travelling with a given speed. When light hits these bands a little of it reflects, but its frequency is shifted by the frequency of the wave travelling in the crystal to a higher or lower frequency, thus changing the energy.</p>
<p>However, for normal mirrors the reflected photons have the same wavelength as the incident ones. There are also types of inelastic scattering like fluorescence, where the photon is absorbed in a medium and then photons are reemitted with a wider range of longer wavelengths. </p>
<p>EDIT: I'm not strictly correct here as I assumed a mirror with effectively infinite mass; if that mirror has a finite mass there will technically be a doppler shift as the mirror moves away from the reflecting photon (as I mentioned before), but for most cases that energy loss will be unmeasurable unless it is something like a solar sail that is moving at a high velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The energy of a photon is definitely altered by reflecting off a metallic surface. Any surface in fact. The frequency drops by a near-zero amount and the energy transfer is received by the metallic object as kinetic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A photon loses a very slight amount of momentum, but it is not enough to create a noticable shift in frequency.  You would have to have many thousands of reflections for the momentum loss to translate to a meaningful frequency shift, but since nothing is perfectly reflective, the odds are higher that the photon would simply be absorbed by the material before you saw the shift.</p></div>		</li>
