			<div class="markdown"><p>I see double when I'm sober with only one eye open.  Any idea what's happening there?</p>
<p>I saw an opthalmologist but she was stumped.</p>
<p>Edit: it's not astigmatism or cataracts.  I imagine we tested for keratoconus but I'm not familiar with it.  Nothing's shown up on MRI and my neurologist doesn't think it's a neurological problem.  We tried dry eye treatments.  I'm supposed to go back but haven't yet.</p>
<p>It might be caused by a medication, Lyrica. Unfortunately, it's by far the most useful for my crippling pain. If we could find some treatment that allows me to use it without going blind, that'd be great (she said that the usual cause of blurred vision from drugs is dry eyes). I stopped taking it some months ago and I think my vision is improving, but it's not fixed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine was astigmatism as well. Vision so out of balance that  LASIK etc wasn't possible.  I ended up with 'clear lens replacement' surgery (basically it's cataract surgery that implants vision correcting lenses). Wear WalMart readers now as needed! Highly recommend the surgery, easy peasy!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ask the ophthalmologist about the possibility of cataracts, astigmatism or keratoconus. Most likely one of those 3. That is, so long as you haven't had a head injury. If you have, that's the most likely source...You don't want it to be that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to strongly recommend that you get a second opinion. It could be anything from dry-eye, to cataracts, to a neurological issue, but rest assured that something is causing it. If she gave no diagnosis and didn't refer you to another doctor, I would never visit that ophthalmologist again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a friend who saw double for about 3 months after a serious head injury and damage to one of her optic nerves. Gradually it improved and disappeared all together. She thought the nerve had repaired itself but her specialist told her that her brain had simply learned to compensate. I've always wondered how that works. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Theres also a neat trick you can practice on those &quot;spot-the-difference&quot; pictures that was posted on r/learnuselesstalents, where you cross your eyes and make the brain interpret the doublevision as a single picture. This makes the differences &quot;flicker&quot; in and out as only one of the eyes can see that particular thing. The effect when the brain &quot;clicks&quot; into seeing it as a single picture is quite interesting to experience</p>
