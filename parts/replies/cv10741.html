			<div class="markdown"><p>I came here to say something similar. My Dad's a freemason, and hasn't been to a meeting for about 15 years due to illness and disability. A few months ago they sent my parents on holiday because they were having a rough time. Before that, they have paid for repairs to the house that my parents couldn't  afford, and paid for alterations to the house so my dad can get around with his wheelchair. Not to mention the times my Dad has seen other members whip out their chequebook and outright pay for kids to have home dialysis machines.  </p>
<p>The other day I overheard a conversation about someone who had gone to a &quot;freemason church&quot; and then had to go and get exorcised at a &quot;normal church&quot; because &quot;freemason christianity&quot; is evil. It just makes me laugh how ill-informed people are. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had a brother who was pursuing a vicar career in the Lutheran church, he gave up a lot to pursuit this.  At the end of it all, they found out he was a mason and was ex communicated.  After years and years of dedication to that church and then they abandon him.  Terrible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's great that they could help you and your Dad out in a dire time of need. It makes me laugh as people fear what they don't know. </p>
<p>I think it's the whole 'hush-hush secret handshake' stereotype people have. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work as a waitress at a hotel where the local Masons would use the function room on a semi regular basis. </p>
<p>I would serve food and drinks, then leave with strict instructions never to enter the room during their meetings until I was needed to serve coffee and biscuits afterwards.</p>
<p>I always wondered what they got up to in those meetings and found the secrecy surrounding the function room weird at the time. I was 15 though, so I probably wouldn't find it so strange anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My Masonic grandfather needed a kidney transplant, another mason who he was friends with but not a &quot;donating a kidney friend&quot; offered him a kidney.  After he found he was not a match, he offered to do a circle donation where he would donate to a match, and grandpas match would donate to him.  It is amazing how these men care about each other.  Unfortunately my grandfather was not in good enough health to have a successful transplant before it all went through.  Still hard for me to believe how selfless some masons are and dedicated to helping their brothers.  Regardless of the risks involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry I haven't been on in a while.  The mason didn't end up donating, while he was going through the testing they found that he had late stage cancer.  I don't remember what type but he has been battling it since.  It has actually made him and my grandfather very close as they can relate to each other's struggle.  My grandpa now does dialysis 3 days a week and has had a leg amputated so he is finally learning to walk on a prosthetic  after about 2 years.  The donator is undergoing heavy chemo therapy.  I've gone shooting with him several times and do run into him at lodge here and there but we are more acquaintances than friends so I'm not 100% sure on his status.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched my boss lose his job due to layoff and the program manager hired his Mason buddy to fill the position when it opened back up. Legally the position was supposed to be offered back to my former boss. The guy who took over wasn't mechanic, had no administrative background. No experience pertaining to a heavy equipment shop, but none the less, he got the job. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He very much was. Former employees of his refused to come back to work for him once a new company took over. He started calling them traitor to his colleagues. Very unprofessional as one highly qualified inspector went to work for a vendor that the heavy equipment shop used regularly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is awesome it's also kinda shitty. Hiring someone for a position he has no experience in is truly something a good friend or bro would do and if it was me I would be happy as fuck but a part of me also resents the fact that someone who actually knows that job didn't get hired simply because he didn't have the right connections. </p>
<p>I know this might seem negative and maybe get down votes but think about how many times you've applied for jobs and then imagine someone who has no experience getting it before yiu simply because he's a friend. What if I had to feed my family too? Because I'm not in an exclusive club &quot;fuck me&quot; right? :-/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dont get me wrong, I have used my connections for jobs I was qualified for. And it gave me the boost I needed to solidify my position within the company. But to hire someone as the fleet manager, that has never worked on the equipment, doesnt know the vendors and has never dealt with the U.S. Army logistics, is just down right wrong.</p></div>		</li>
