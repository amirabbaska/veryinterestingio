<p>Just because they aren't making games doesn't mean they aren't doing anything </p></div>		</li>

<p>They maintain, but didn't make counter strike.  I guess they did do global offensive... which seems to be basically a complete rewrite. So that counts I guess.  I think the recent AMA from Gabe said they had 4 people working on it currently...</p>
<p>Seriously, What was the last true valve game?  Left for dead 2. (Was that in house or purchase?). Honestly I don't remember.  Looking it up... DOTA2 -2013 ... CSGO -2012 ...  Portal 2 2011?</p>
<p>I don't play DOTA2 so can't really speak to it, but it's 2013... and we'll actively maintained.  </p>
<p>So the last game I'm seeing was DOTA in '13 so that's roughly a 3 year dry spell. </p>
<p>Though we do have a lot of hats being made for TF2... so I guess that counts for something. </p>
<p>Yes, a bit jaded. Yeah I get it. They do stuff. I'm sure the VR stuff takes effort as well. </p>
<p>But when I hear &quot;Valve&quot; my first (second or third) thought is certainly not &quot;productive&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, if you are looking at Valve as purely a production line for new games...then...yeah, they are a bit weak.</p>
<p>But that's not what they do.</p></div>		</li>
