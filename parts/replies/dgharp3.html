<p>I can DRINK. And I don't mean chug a 12 pack and run around a race track. I mean I can sit down and down half a bottle of whiskey and 7 beers at the bar and feel fantastic. Definitely some genetic things there.</p>
<p>Also I might be an alcoholic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I come from a family of alcoholics and drug users. Everybody likes the guy who is able to drink and party a lot. Until they don't. Take it from me, a complete stranger with nothing to gain from lying ; you are walking a dangerous path. Don't trivialize alcohol(-ism).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe there is some evidence that variations in the enzyme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_dehydrogenase" target="_blank">alcohol dehydrogenase</a> across different populations may affect an individual's metabolism of ethanol and/or their predisposition to developing alcoholism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe some research does suggest a genetic component, as well as prenatal exposure to alcohol and perhaps something related to serotonin. </p>
<p>Ultimately, blacking out means drinking too much too quickly, which also needs to be considered from a social perspective. You're more likely to black out if you take shots, drink quickly (chug rather than sip), that sort of thing.</p></div>		</li>
