			<div class="markdown"><p>Teacher here, and You're not technically wrong, or right, about that point.
Though it might be different for university professors, teachers are supposed to use their emotions for the sake of the Student's development/classroom management. If a student is doing something that annoys you/ disrupts the class, you have to use a proper show of the right emotion to let that student know that his/her behavior is not okay. This isn't to put &quot;authority&quot; over the student, but it let's them know that as a human, you <em>have boundries</em> and that if they do X to a person, they will probably react with Y. (A little more to it than that, with things like setting base rules at the beginning of the year and modeling behavior you want to see in the class, setting up a class of equals, not teacher vs student, etc). So you do need to show emotions, but they are very controlled yet genuine emotions.  Or sometimes a situation isnt getting the usual/appropriate emotional reaction as it should, but you need to act appropriately and consistantly for this too (example: maybe you had such a good evening the night before that nothing is gonna bother you today, but johny is throwing paper airplanes at another student. So you have to still act like this is bothering you for the sake of the class and johny's emotional development). As a teacher you really don't want to fly off the handle because if it's not appropriate for them to do it, it's certainly not appropriate for you to do it. And there are times when a student is going to come to difficult times in their life and you need to be able to show a really human side of yourself if you are going to help them through it.</p>
<p>When I first started teaching I thought I had to only keep up a mask of pleasantness and try to not let anything bother me, even when things were eating at me hard. Students really liked me for being nice but even my best students walked all over me and accomplishing any work was <em>so</em> difficult. I also missed a lot of chances to really connect with my students and become more involved in the school community. Then again, other teachers at this school reacted in <strong>very</strong> inappropriate ways with their students, such as excessive yelling, threatening, etc. It made professional development very hard and I left after my year was up.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: emotions are very important to a teaching environment, but they are intelligently managed genuine emotions, not off-the-handle emotions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I was going to reply in the same line, at University level you appeal to emotion (the excitement to learn something new  for example, in my field), and people with low &quot;emotional intelligence&quot; are somewhat ostracized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this answer. This question is based on nothing but perception. I have never come across a study that showed any connection between the two. </p></div>		</li>

<p>A good teacher isn't going to be emotional most of the time; it just isn't part of the job.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's an interesting word choice. I would consider passion to be within the emotional spectrum, and many people would consider a passionate teacher to be a good quality. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's out of character to have a visit with an emotional doctor</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be careful here. You have to be clear about whether you mean &quot;emotional&quot; as in experiences significant emotion, or &quot;emotional&quot; as in demonstrates strong emotion. Doctors are unique in the fields that you mentioned because they deal directly with problems stemming from the person themselves, which can include emotional states. Due to the demands of the work, they often have to be in greater control of their emotional response but they still experience emotion with their work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me qualify what I wrote.</p>
<p>It is unprofessional to cry or yell, and sometimes to laugh or smile. I personally don't consider passion to be an emotion because I can't think of the corresponding show of emotion. I suppose if you consider motivational aspects to be in the realms of emotion, then that would be the only aspect of emotion belonging to the professional world. </p>
<p>I think everyone experiences emotions with their work. I don't think the work of doctors is so unique from other fields as ultimately they too are trying to solve a problem someone has. Taking care of a patient has a lot of social components no matter what level of care or specialty you're in, components common to many other professions like social work or therapy. Most of the doctors I've known are too tired to have very strong emotions most of the time. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, are you suggesting that all other &quot;emotions&quot; have a single clear action that qualifies as a show of that emotion? </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>If you boil it down, all work is trying to solve a problem someone has. In regard to the fields you listed however, medicine is unique (as I said) because it's physical and mental health, not external problems. </p>

<p>That's not how emotions work at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would prefer doctors were a bit more empathetic than they are. They see their patients too much as hard work. I don't trust them them to help me with my problems because they seem cold and distant. I will not go to a doctor about my depression and anxiety because they rush you out of the office in 10 mins making it very clear that to them you are just another patient.</p></div>		</li>
