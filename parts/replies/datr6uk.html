			<div class="markdown"><p>Reformatting your results and notes sections for the sake of readability....</p>
<ol>
<li>Upside down: 1 minute, 12 seconds.</li>
<li>Steady Pour: 2 minutes, 30 seconds or greater. It's very difficult to do this from the beginning, since with a full vessel you can only slightly tilt it without glugging. The projected throat area is very small as a result and the flow is very very slow. This approach was very problematic and yielded very inconsistant results.</li>
<li>Hybrid pour: (upside down for half, then steady pour for half): 1 minute, 18 seconds. Surprisingly close to just having it upside down. Not a significant difference considering estimated variation in timing.</li>
<li>Vortex pour: 45 seconds. Very interesting. When I first heard about this method I assumed I'd have to swirl the vessel constantly, but after the vortex is established it maintains itself.</li>
<li>Rigid air tube: 38 seconds. As assumed, this was very fast, though it was awkward to hold the tube at the same time (air tube was roughly 1/4&quot; diameter, for reference)</li>
<li>Low pressure CO2 (DO NOT TRY TO DO THIS): Roughly 23 seconds. As predicted this was the fastest, but the considerable risk of exploding the vessel makes it NOT WORTHWHILE.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other notes:<br />
-It takes roughly 2-3 seconds to establish a vortex<br />
-It would be interesting to investigate the flowrate throughout the test; I'd assume that the smooth pour is the fastest when the vessel is nearly empty.<br />
-Bleeding CO2 into a glass container is extremely dangerous, don't try this. I knew the risks to myself and my equipment and took appropriate precautions so you wouldn't have to. It's seriously not worth the saved time.<br />
-Comparative results likely only be valid for this particular bottle geometry and fluid viscosity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used the vortex method often. People thought I was just being silly, but it really is easy and it really does work. </p>
<p>I used to work at a CVS, and would routinely have to pour out massive amounts of expired Gatorade/Powerade every few months. I noticed just dumping it was kind of slow because of the &quot;glub&quot; affect. So I channeled the one thing I remembered from 7th grade science and swirled the bottles to make a vortex. It cut my pouring time by at least half. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a homebrewer here and I can add a little additional insight. While washing and rinsing countless bottles I have also concluded that the swirling technique is much faster than pouring (I've not tried with a tube or CO2), but only when there is a large amount of water in the bottle. When you're down to the last ~10% of fluid left, I've found it becomes quicker to disrupt the vortex and let it drain just by holding the bottle upside down. At this point, the water is sufficiently disrupted for long enough the it pretty much all drains in about a second or two; it doesn't need to glug. Although, this is highly dependant on the size of the neck of the vessel you're using. A normal beer bottle with a ~1 cm wide neck will tolerate a lot less leftover fluid than a 5 L water container with a ~5 cm wide neck.</p>
<p>So my strategy for emptying bottles fastest is to turn them upside down and swirl a couple of times to get the vortex going (and it will maintain this, as you've observed). Then, when there's about 10% of the fluid left, swirl it back the other way and keep it still. Repeat about 40 more times and then refill the bottles with beer ;)</p></div>		</li>
