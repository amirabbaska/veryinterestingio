<p>The connection comes primarily from its use as a symbol in film and television.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason it worked as a metaphor for sex is because it was already a thing in real life. <a href="https://mic.com/articles/129164/does-anyone-still-smoke-after-sex-the-surprising-history-of-post-coital-nicotine#.mJqTitwrU" target="_blank">I read the same article you did just before you became an expert on the subject</a>, and it's clearly a bit of anti-tobacco-industry propaganda. The truth is people have enjoyed whatever mood-enhancing chemicals were available to them as an accoutrement to sex since time immemorial - what's a Roman orgy without wine and poppies?</p>
<p>Did the tobacco industry push to become part of the defacto euphemism for intercourse? Sure they did. Did maybe a few people try lighting up during their post-coital glow because they saw it in a movie? Maybe. But it wasn't what started the desire to get chemically altered in conjunction with sex - that's just human nature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate your skepticism, but smoking after sex is a cultural phenomenon started due in part to the Hays Code, which greatly limited Hollywood's freedom to make sexual references on the big screen, and also to the tobacco industry's heavy product placement. Now, Voyager, is an early example of this trope.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically in the 30's you had violent and sexual movies, these films got shipped and aired across the country and people were like &quot;im NOT ok with this&quot;</p>
<p>The government said &quot;alright, we'll regulate those liberal fucks&quot;</p>
<p>And Hollywood was like &quot;whoa easy there, we can do it ourselves&quot; and made the Hays code</p>
<p>So you get scenes like Hitchcock's north by northwests ending where a train going into a tunnel symbolizes the old P in V</p></div>		</li>
