			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed.  It's the lying.  If they were always open about who they had conversations with then it wouldn't be a big deal.  A dialog with Russia could be spun as an adversarial relationship.  But they deny the meetings take place until they are caught and then they squirm.  It makes reporters and investigators ask more questions and not less.</p></div>		</li>
