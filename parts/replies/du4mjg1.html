<p>You can change this preference by exposing yourself to more and more cold fast food, if you so wish. This can eliminate the dislike or even create a preference for cold food. It generally takes several (10-20) exposures over a short time frame (3-4 weeks) for this effect to start working. (or many exposures over a long period)</p>

<p>For instance, i have a small stomach, and so can only eat so much food at once. So i'll get fries and a cheeseburger, eat the fries and put the burger in the fridge, and then eat the burger an hour later, and i stopped bothering to microwave the burger a long time ago, but cold fries are still disgusting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm... I wonder if this can explain why a friend of mine can only eat food when it’s steaming hot. </p>
<p>Also, any idea why pizza actually tastes just as good (though different-ish) or even better when it’s cold?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the pizza.  Pizza made with cheap cheese only tastes okay when hot.  Cold, tastes like you are eating wax.</p>
<p>But great pizza tastes just as good room temp as it does hot.</p></div>		</li>
