			<div class="markdown"><p>But we define 0! = 1 rather than it being a fact like 1+1=2. His argument is absolutely correct because having 0! = 0 would simple ruin many theorems that involve factorials. The reason we define 0! =1 is so that it makes various theorems more general.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Uh...you know it equals 2 because we define it as such, right? You mean the concept/principle, not the actual symbols/numbers, but it's still the same thing; 0!=1 because it's defined as equaling identity 1 of the empty set.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's up to you. You can define n! = |Aut(n)| if you want to, that works perfectly well. It also allows you to easily prove lots of properties of factorials more directly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I had more Reddit accounts so I could give you more points.  That's the explanation that they never tell people in school.  They teach how to <em>compute</em> a factorial using multiplication, but never what's really going on.<br />
Did you go to school in a country other than the US?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's not the definition of a factorial, rather an effect of it so they don't teach it that way. A factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n which also happens to be the number of ways you can arrange items in a set, but it is a lot more difficult to explain that way. (I went to school in Bulgaria and in the US.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't arrange 0 items though.  The truth is that there's no real way to explain it colloquially.  Just like how dividing by 0 is undefined and 4^0 is also 1.  It is that way because the algebra works out better.</p>
<p>Edit: /u/ACuteMonkeysUncle 's explanation down below is what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Edit edit:  I have a degree in mathematics, and I am correct.  The &quot;why&quot; to these questions aren't by pattern or colloquial reasoning.  It's by the algebra and definitions that it's made up of.  Downvotes won't make that any less true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4^0 =1 could be logical. 4^x /4^y =4^(x-y). If the exponent is the difference in numerator and denominator powers than it logically follows that the zeroth power makes something equal one. </p>
<p>The fact that 1/0 is undefined (ie does not have a value) is somewhat colloquial already.</p>
<p>I agree with your overall sentiment; I'm just pointing out that whether math is comprehensible or not is as much (or more) a philosophical question than a mathematical one. If someone told me that, to them, 0!=1 was intuitive, then I wouldn't necessarily believe them but I couldn't disprove them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a cool way to look at things.  It still leaves the question of why the empty set has one subset.  It's defined to be that way, just like 0! is defined to be 1.</p></div>		</li>
