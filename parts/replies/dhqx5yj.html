			<div class="markdown"><p>That's absolutely insane.  I have a similar story.  I'm 33 right now...when I was in 8th grade (maybe 12 or 13?) we took a trip to Washington DC.  We stayed in a hotel across from the White House, in fact I could see the White House from the window of my room.  I was sharing a room with 1 other guy from my class.  He brought a small red laser pointer with him. I think you know where this is going.  We had been using the laser pointer for several days...shining into our friends rooms to get their attention.  One night he decides to shine it at the White House.  I swear he only shined the light on the White House for about 3 seconds...seriously. Within 5 minutes 4 men were at our door...armed to the fucking teeth.  They banged on the door once and said &quot;Open up or the door is coming down!&quot;.  We opened the door very timidly, to find 2 men in nice dark suits...and 2 men wearing jackets with CIA written on the back.  After questioning us, and confiscating the laser pen, they politely left. No charges...nothing...just left us with these words &quot;we are always watching son&quot;. </p>
<p>The kid I shared the room with is one of my best friends and to this day we still talk about that shit.  Our teacher was <em>pissed</em>...and once we got back to town we were both promptly suspended.  I never understood why the 2 CIA guys showed up...maybe someone out there can give me an explanation.  I'm just glad they came by the hotel instead of sniping us in the face.  We were idiots...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I was in 6th or 7th grade when this happened. My mom worked for the government in a building next to the white house before 9/11. The building had a small-ish roof patio that was mostly used for smoke breaks but they would have spots available to watch the fireworks for the 4th of July. My mom had some seniority so she was able to get tickets for herself, me, one of my friends, my stepdad (they weren't married yet), and his two kids to watch the show as a way for us all to get to know each other better. </p>
<p>Now there wasn't much to do on the patio, there were basically just picnic tables and adults talking the majority of the time, so between card games we would watch the snipers slide across the roof of the white house or pacing the balconies. At some point, card games weren't enough for us and we started chasing after each other, jumping up and down - just general hyperactive kid shit. I'm not sure which one of us it was but one of us raised our hands above the (I assume) bulletproof glass barrier between us and the white house. 30 seconds later we were informed that if we raised our hands above the glass again they would be shot. We quickly noticed the snipers trained on us and went back to card games. No thanks, secret service - I appreciate having hands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive lived outside of DC all my life and am convinced that most of the time Secret Service agents are dressed in plain clothes.  There are those wearing suits and even some with vests, but there are more who are dressed and behaving like any other average Joe on the street. Ive seen it first hand several times.  Theres nothing like standing in a deli a half block away from Obama eating lunch and realizing half the people in the deli - including the hot woman whose number you want - are wearing ear pieces. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im sure this will get buried, but......I have a friend who - ten years ago or so - had worked in the White House for more than a decade when I asked him about security.  He told me never to speak about attacking the President or the government or the buildings if I was within a few blocks of the White House (jokingly or otherwise).  It didn't matter if you were driving, walking, or whatever - it could and would be heard.  I don't know if it's true or not, but to this day Im very careful about what is said in my car if Im near the White House. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is weird as shit but i had a teacher in high school who told us he took his brother and his brother's friend to DC and they were standing at the fence talking and his brother said, &quot;if I jumped this fence, how far do you think I'd get?&quot;  and almost immediately they heard someone say &quot;not very far.&quot; so my teacher turns to see who said it but there was no one around (who was visible.) his brother swears that the voice came from either the sidewalk under them or the hedges but the hedges were way too thin to conceal a person and it didnt sound like speakers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a peice of technology that can send sound in an extremely targeted way. Kinda like a laser for sound, that can pinpoint a person and make the sound right next to them and only they can hear it. There were videos about it a couple years ago going around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since yours didn't get buried I hope mine doesn't I had a family member involved in government told me that the President is equipped with some form of two step verification that is non reliant on a security backup that literally confirms all actions the President carries out which is to say he is not the President without this clearance ....my brother and I postulated as to what it could be he thought that it is some kind of implanted device in the President and a secondary device that reacts to the other....wild shit </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgot to point out:  The secret service guys were in a bomb-defusing tube, talking to a potential terrorist, who might be carrying a bomb as far as they knew.  They were 100% cool and professional the entire time.  I was the only scared person there, and I knew there was no bomb. They didn't even break a sweat.  Though motherbleepers.</p></div>		</li>
