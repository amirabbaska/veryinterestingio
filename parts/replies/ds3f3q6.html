			<div class="markdown"><p>While I doubt many five-year-olds would understand this, it is the best explanation. My best five-year-old-ification of this would be: In order to see how the air above us distorts light coming in, we can create a fake,  &quot;perfect star&quot; by shining a laser up into the &quot;top&quot; of the air above us, and then use a bunch of fancy math to take the distorted image we get of that fake star to change it back into the &quot;perfect star&quot; and apply that same math to distorted images of other things in the sky to make them more &quot;perfect images&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would have simplified other words like create. When you have simple words in complex sentences, it simplifies it all. The reason you would need an eli5 instead of eli20, is because yo u want someone else to do the extra work so everyone else can gain a basic understanding quickly. When you don't understand a sentence the first time you read it, you go back and reread it, then if you have to read it again, you pick it apart word by word so that you can absorb the meaning in the sentence. If you just say &quot;makes photons glimmer and shine&quot;, I would be able to decipher the statement seconds faster than &quot;creates shine and glimmer outside of the photons&quot;</p></div>		</li>
