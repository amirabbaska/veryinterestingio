			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer and should be the top comment. Also, asking to have a witness treated as hostile, doesn't necessarily mean that they are against your client. It may be that they just have a hard time staying on point when the attorney asks them open-ended questions. This could be due to age, mental capacity, or just because the witness rambles when he/she talks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This gives me a chance to tell my story about being on a jury with a plaintiff represented by a terrible lawyer, and his funny  &quot;hostile witness&quot; moment.</p>
<p>I served on a civil jury a few years back.  The case was a 20-year old kid who had been picked up at work by his 19-year old girlfriend, who then got into a fender bender.  He saw dollar signs, and sued her, and retained the absolute stereotypical image of an ambulance-chasing lawyer.  Ill-fitting, wrinkled suit, a briefcase with unorganized papers sticking out all sides, the whole bit.  I almost couldn't believe it.  During voir dire, when the judge asked if any prospective juror knew anyone involved in the case, one lady stood up and said she knew the plaintiff's lawyer, and it would absolutely color her judgement as she had a very bad experience with him trying to bully his way through some community meeting or other.</p>
<p>It quickly became clear the kid had no real case, and that he was a bully to his girlfriend.  She came across as very scared and meek on the stand, as she was being questioned by her (insurance-company) lawyers.  Now, the ambulance-chaser had been bumbling his way through the case; he seemed unprepared at times, and often had to ask the judge about the finer points of law and what he was and wasn't allowed to do at various points in the trial.</p>
<p>When it came time for him to cross-examine the girlfriend, the first thing out of his mouth was, &quot;Your honor, permission to treat the witness as hostile.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't know what happened first, the insurance lawyers jumping to their feet to object, or the judge giving the biggest eye roll I've ever seen.  But I do know that we jurors were dismissed for a half hour or so, and then brought back in and given an explanation by the judge about how we were to disregard the &quot;hostile witness&quot; comment, as it was a very specific term of art, and had been misused by the ambulance-chaser.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we found in favor of the girl.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, this makes me a bit relieved.</p>
<p>Some back story:</p>
<p>My sister in law is a complete low life (and I generally don't denigrate people). She treated her mother terribly, emotionally abusing her for years up until her death from cancer.</p>
<p>She has had two children (and a smattering of abortions), one of whom had no prenatal care and was born with drugs in his system. We took him home from the hospital. We also have had her other child for very nearly for years that both parents abandoned not long after birth.</p>
<p>The mother and neither biological dad has supported either of the children. The mother doesn't work, or do anything to seek work, but she was offered a job by a family friend (whom she was living with), until she was fired for being unreliable.</p>
<p>About two years ago, her current boyfriend and baby-daddy was driving and split the car in half right behind the front seats when he hit a telephone pole. They waited until just before the statute of limitations to file a suit. They e here a few weeks ago essentially bragging about how there would be no harm to her boyfriend — who she is technically saying — and that they're going after the insurance company for an absolutely ridiculous amount of money.</p>
<p>Her lawyers are from one of those companies that advertise on TV and billboards.</p>
<p>I'm hoping they are about as competent as the lawyer in your story.</p>

<p>Oh man, I always wondered how this was handled in court!  I work in a law firm that doesn't do courtwork, but the amount of people we get who will life story the shit out of me when they call in... I mean sometimes it can help because I can help them without them needing to wait for a lawyer to call them back but holy christ caller, if you called for an appointment, I don't need to know the entire history of your family back to when Noah told them to get the fuck off his ark.</p>
<p>Worse are the ones who give you the <em>same</em> life story <em>every</em> time, before updating you with what's happened since they last talked to you.  I'm surprised I don't have forehead-shaped dents in my desk some days.</p>
<p>So do you make any attempt to kind of 'coach' rambling clients in the days leading up to trial?  Like is there a polite way to interrupt them mid-practice and say &quot;you should have stfu 30 sentences back&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are both correct.  To add to the point, however, cross-examination allows the questioner (lawyer) to provide a narrative.  The lawyer performing cross can ask sets of leading questions that conclude with a question (or questions) that force the witness to either agree or look foolish. Cross exam is the most powerful tool a trial lawyer has to directly &quot;testify&quot; or speak to the jury besides closing argument.  Many defendants, in both civil and criminal cases, try to put on few or no witnesses, preferring to rely on testimony elicited on cross in the state or plaintiff's case in chief.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was watching the trial for that 14 y/o kid who raped and killed his math teacher in the school bathroom. The prosecution attorney called up several witnesses. She asked tons of leading questions. She would say, &quot;can I assume,&quot; then make a statement and end with, &quot;is that correct?&quot; She even lead them into answers when they didn't describe photos or evidence &quot;properly&quot;. If that's not allowed, why didn't she get objections? Most of those witnesses were the police officers who were on scene finding evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could have been a few things.
1) Often times, it's a judgement call on the part of opposing counsel. Too many objections can annoy the jury and make them think &quot;why does this jerk keep interrupting this nice witness?&quot; As an attorney, your goal is to remain likable. Thus, sometimes attorneys will let things slide.
2) Additionally, you are allowed a fair amount of leeway as far as leading questions when it's biographical information (usually at the beginning of a direct) like name, where you live, job, etc.
3) Could be the attorney was just asleep at the wheel (maybe not in your example specifically, but it could happen). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume this is American law, where these terms are normal. My question from this point is, what about the defendant - can the prosecutor ask him any type of question, leading or not leading? How about his lawyer? I Norway we have a rule in the process code that says no leading question allowed to anyone - except if the question is follow up/ confirmation of a fact that has allready been established (example: the leading question &quot;did you squint while pulling the trigger&quot; will only be allowed if the pulling off the trigger is allready established undisputed). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Defendant/prosecutor language implies criminal case, in which a defendant has a constitutional right not to take the stand at all if he wishes. If he does take the stand to testify on his behalf, however, the prosecutor would be allowed to cross examine him and leading questions would be permitted in that case. </p>
<p>In a civil case (plaintiff/defendant) the plaintiff could call the defendant as a witness but could not ask leading questions unless special circumstances apply (one of which is that the defendant refuses to answer questions/is evasive in answering). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm, that's interesting. We have the same constitutional protection against self- incrimination. According to the ethics conduct we learned in law school, and what I know is general practice, a lawyer will only on occations advise their client not to take the stand, because the judge will imply guilt in the lack of explanation. The conduct goes like this: if you client insists on him not being guilty and he presents a plausible explanation which he does not deviate from, the best advise is that he gives testimony. If he says he is guilt less and has a shitty explanation, you challenge him with the problems in his explanations and go from there. But in some cases the police will withhold trial documents/ evidence for some reason (undercover operations, industrial secrets, source protection, state secrets etc.) and in those situations it's &quot;proper conduct&quot; to advise your client not to explain him/ her self. So, you have the right to remain silent in Norway as well, but a defendant that only shuts up will in general have the odds against him in court. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a loaded question - generally, the Defendant would not be testifying. Because of the 5th Amendment to our Constitution, a person cannot be compelled to testify against himself. Further, the State (in criminal cases) is not allowed to comment on a Defendant's non-testimony, and the jury cannot consider the fact that a person hasn't testified in his own defense. So, as a rule, the prosecutor won't have the opportunity to ask questions, leading or otherwise, as we will generally strongly advise our clients not to testify.</p>
<p>That being said, if a Defendant chooses to testify on his own behalf, yes, the prosecutor is permitted to ask leading questions. We are always allowed to ask leading questions on cross.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah we have basically the same protection against self- incrimination, but a silent defendant will have bad odds in court because the prosecutor will be able to present an important part of his case undisputed. He can decline to explain himself (and he can lie in court all he wants without risking punishment, contrary to witnesses) but the lawyer will usually not advice him this since it will be construed as guilt. (And, to repeat, leading questions are not allowed, unless as follow up on undisputed fact). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, in Norway we actually have a principle of free admission and observation of evidence. In other words: we don't really <em>have</em> rules regarding what evidence can be presented (but some boundries are established through case- law). So, there is no &quot;objection&quot; in our courts. Just a mild reminder from either parties representative that a question regarding evidence may have to be dealt with before further proceedings. But it takes <em>a lot</em> to deny evidence in any shape or form here. </p></div>		</li>
