			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a phase, though, if you're intentionally following a ketogenic diet. After a few hours or days (depending on how often you make this switch) one's brain starts to synthesize neurotransmitters via ketone bodies that use fats instead of glucose. So the brain fog goes away. Some people report feeling sharper in this state, oddly enough.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When the body is in a starved state, such as when you are feeling hungry, the body searches for sources and stores of glucose to chew up for energy.</p>

<p>I hope this doesnt come off the wrong way... What am I saying, this is REDDIT of course it will come off the wrong way. But I am curious. If you are a fat person why do you get hungry then? Don't you already have reserves that your body can use before getting &quot;hungry&quot;? That is if it as you say &quot;searches for sources of stores of glucose to chew up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AIUI, evolution shaped our bodies to work in an environment that was very food-starved.  So a lot of biochemical mechanisms -- including the feeling of hunger! -- are great for that environment, but really bad for the present one.</p>
<p>IOW, your body tells you to eat like food is running out, even if that overloads the tank today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they're reserves. Your body doesn't want to use stored fat until there is no other option. For basically all of our evolutionary history calorie deficiency was a much more common and dangerous risk than obesity, so your body wants to hold on to as much stored energy as it can</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the body normally already burns fat cells - you just replendish them while eating. there's 2 kinds of fat cells - those that burn it and those that store it(and function against cold). so, your body gets hungry, bit it isnt instantly goign to be able to burn all it's fat as it needs to activate those brown cells, and relying on that is stupid - if there's food around, why would you burn your stores that have to keep you goign while there is no food?</p>
<p>so first it makes you hungry, and only when it doesn't get food regulary for a while the body starts entering starvation mode where it starts activating some brown fat to burn some more white fat(not all at once - it wants it to last a while), while also burning muslces and other tissue it doesnt NEED right now as surviving starvation&gt;general health and strength. unless you're activly using the tissue in question(i.e. you're using your muscles a lot) as in that case the body basicly thinks you need that to get more food, so it's better to keep maintaining that stuff.</p></div>		</li>
