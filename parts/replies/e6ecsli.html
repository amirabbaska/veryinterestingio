			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a swarm management technique called checkerboarding, where the beekeeper rearranges the honey band above the brood nest to constantly have empty spaces. This fools the hive algorithm to prevent swarm reproduction (because one of the signals is when there is enough honey that there isn't room to lay more eggs). Think of it like hacking a computer program with a fake signal.</p>
<p>This causes the hive to keep expanding on both number of bees and stored honey, making really big hives. I did it one summer and my hives reached double the usual size. Tons of honey because of economies of scale. </p>
<p>Labor intensive though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>70,000 bees is a lot for a tree nest, but not insanely high for a large managed hive.  As to your question, I can tell you this:  beekeepers will sometimes combine two weak colonies together to make one strong colony that will make it through the winter.  You kill one queen, and then put all of the bees together.  If you combine them immediately, they'll often all kill each other.  However, if you put one hive box on top of the other separated by a sheet of newspaper, the bees will get used to each other's smells over time and when the newspaper starts developing holes in it, the bees often won't sting each other and will instead work together to clean out the newspaper.  When it works, that's how you combine colonies.  So to apply that to your question: if a tree had two bee-occupied cavities in it with a small amount of rotted wood in between the two colonies, and one queen died... I guess maybe they could combine?  But I certainly wouldn't expect it.</p></div>		</li>
