			<div class="markdown"><p>Anechoic chambers are wicked! I watched a video of a musician who played a guitar amplifier at full volume in one to see what it sounds like xD He said that if you stay in one for about 10 minutes you can start to hear your heartbeat really strongly and almost the sound of your blood moving through your body..</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has nothing to do with the chamber, but 6:20-7:20 was breathtaking. Can anyone tell me what genre or some good artists to look for for that type of reverby guitar-heavy instrumental kinda stuff? I need more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey cool! Check out Toska, that's Rabea's band. Then maybe Dorje, another band he's in. The genre is generally considered Prog Metal, or, progressive metal. It's an awesome genre. Gorjira are another awesome band, bit more vocal though. Then on the lighter side there's Plini, who does a bit more happy stuff lmao. Hope that helps :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ménière%27s_disease" target="_blank">Meniere's Disease</a> in one ear, which combines constant tinnitus with random violent attacks of vertigo.  I'm sitting here watching tv and the ringing is loud enough and <strong>never</strong> goes away, but when I'm in a really quiet room, it often becomes a deafening roar.  A soundproof room like that would probably cause me to go insane.  </p></div>		</li>
