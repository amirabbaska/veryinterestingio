			<div class="markdown"><p>Most psychiatric disorders aren't really well understood from the perspective of the underlying etiology (cause).  It's the main reason the DSMs up to present have been organized by category instead of etiology.  </p>
<p>The DSM-III and DSM-IV editors noted this in a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/201700" target="_blank">JAMA paper</a>: &quot;little progress has been made toward understanding the pathophysiological processes and cause of mental disorders. If anything, the research has shown the situation is even more complex than initially imagined, and we believe not enough is known to structure the classification of psychiatric disorders according to etiology.&quot;  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can understand that we don't know the underlying causes or full picture, but that isn't to say we don't know anything about the neuroanatomy of executive function and the pharmacological effects of ADD medications. The talk I linked implied that we have some decent biological understanding of both, but it didn't go into much detail as it was not a technical presentation. I know the basics of dopamine and norepinephrine in ADD, but there is definitely more known to researchers that I haven't kept up to date with, especially the genetic changes that he mentioned. That is what I am looking for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is research that links ADHD with the transport genes for norepinephrine and dopamine.  There is evidence genetic variations for norepinepherine transport is correlated with inattentive subtype and the genetic variations for dopamine transport correlate with hyperactive subtype.</p>
<p>Research is also looking at serotonin in relation to the emotional dysregulation component of ADHD.</p>
<p>All of it's active areas of research and I don't think any of it's really settled yet.  If you google the neurotransmitters and ADHD or ADHD genetics you'll see some of the more recent papers.</p></div>		</li>
