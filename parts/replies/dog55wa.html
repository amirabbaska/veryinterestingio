			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but the subtle point is that the bonds themselves have extra mass beyond that of the constituent atoms, and <em>that</em> is the mass that is converted to energy during the combustion.</p>
<p>Nor is that some kind of convoluted indirect odd only-technically-true way of looking at it, it is the bottom line of what really happens.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But does the fact that they have mass mean they are matter? Is everything that has mass considered to be matter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can say the bond energy has an &quot;equivalent mass&quot; based on E=MC2 but that bond energy is 100% energy stored between atoms (using shared electrons in higher orbitals and shit) and is released when burned. You do not lose any matter. No protons, electrons, neutrons were converted into pure energy.  </p>
<p>Edit: changed 'mass' to 'matter'. Maybe we can all agree now. Haha right...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When chemical bonds are altered, the electrons change to different energy states by emitting or absorbing a photon.  In the process, the resulting products of the broken or created bonds will be less massive (very slightly) than the original.  </p>
<p>Mass of an atom or an object is effectively how much energy is in the system.  When you reduce the energy in any way, you reduce the mass.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that last sentence confused the point a little.  What I took from the description is that they are actually the same thing, just in different states.  So when energy is moved, it is actually potential mass being moved.  In this way the candle isn't converting mass to energy as much as it is converting potential mass (chemical bonds) into a different kind of potential mass (heat).</p>
<p>Somebody correct me if I'm wrong here... I believe that the actual mass of a closed system will not change due to burning a candle within it.  This would require a net change in the number of particles within the system, which would only happen through fusion, fission, or annihilation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of that is on the right track, but you need to switch terminology: the &quot;mass-energy&quot; of a closed system cannot change.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No. That's precisely the misunderstanding that I was trying to correct from the start.</p>
<p>When potential energy is released, the actual true mass of the closed system does change (although the change is energy, and again the &quot;mass-energy&quot; is invariant).</p></div>		</li>

<p>any and all conversions of energy convert some (usually tiny) amount of mass into energy</p>

<p>To be pedantic, surely at very high temperatures and density of energy, more mass is created from energy than energy from matter. This is how matter comes to exist in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
