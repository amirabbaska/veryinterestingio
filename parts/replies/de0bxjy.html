			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a mathematician (I'm a physicist) but I can provide an example (totally unrelated to what I do) on the topic of the potential &quot;practical&quot; application of pure mathematics: Elliptic Curves.</p>
<p>A few years ago (until the mid 1990-ies) elliptic curves were a rather obscure topic. And to some degree it still is. The famous proof of Fermat's last theorem (∀n ∊ ℕ ∧ 2 &lt; n, ∀x,y,z ∊ ℕ+ : x^n + y^n ≠ z^n ) by Wiles was essentially a huge tour-de-force in elliptic curve theory and modular arithmetic. Modular arithmetic however connects it with the discrete logarithm problem. I won't even bother you with what these terms mean, but what it's important for: Cryptography.</p>
<p>You may or may not have read/heard that &quot;cryptography&quot; has something to do with prime numbers, factoring them and so on. Well, that's only a very specifc subset of cryptography, namely RSA asymmetric cryptography. There's also &quot;elliptic curves cryptography&quot; and what's important about that is, that it, <em>at the moment</em> offers the same protection as RSA, but at vastly shorter key lengths (or using the same key lengths as usual for RSA, currently EC cryptography is much more harder to attack).</p>
<p>And this is where pure math enters the stage. Recently there has been these slides of a talk in circulation <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~hansen/localshim.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.math.columbia.edu/~hansen/localshim.pdf</a> and a number of cryptography people got worried that this might be a first crack in EC crypto. The problem is: The math on these slides is to specialized, that hardly anybody except pure mathematicians working in the field of elliptic curves and modular algebra even know the mathematical language to make sense of these slides. It went waaaay over my head somewhere in the middle of slide 1 and from there on I could only nod on occasion and think to myself &quot;yes, I know some of these words/symbols&quot;.</p>
<p>In the meantime a few mathematicians in the field explained that this is just super far out goofing around with some interesting properties of elliptic curves without posing any real danger for cryptography.</p>
<p>But the point is: Somewhere out there might be some ingenous mathematical structure that allows to break down these seemingly hard problems into something computed very quickly, and that could make short work of cryptography.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks!  Great example.  I studied mathematics full-time for for two years and I had never heard of them.  At least not in the sense that anyone gave a specific name to them until I was reading about advances in asymmetric cryptography around the end of the last decade.  </p>
<p>I mean if you've done high school algebra you can understand what they are: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/EllipticCurveCatalog.svg" target="_blank">y² = x³ + ax + b</a> where the curve never intersects itself.  It's just a simple polynomial function.</p>
<p>Honestly I haven't done that sort of stuff <em>since</em> high school.  It's totally unrelated to the area of math I studied.  Knowing nothing about them, superficially it looks about as boring and simple a mathematical object you could come up with and I couldn't see any obvious application for it.  </p>
<p>How did I get two years of math education and not know much more about this than I did in high school?  I'm in theoretical computer science.  I can go on endlessly about how to derive efficient algorithms for mapping a function to all objects in any kind of graph, but throw some basic algebra at me and I panic.  Heh.</p>
<p>Anyway just looking at elliptic curves superficially there's nothing interesting about them to me.  They're a trivial, simple mathematical object.  But that's the neat bit... </p>
<p>The simplest of mathematical objects can lead to profoundly strange places.  Just look at the natural numbers!  1, 2, 3... and with about four minutes pondering on that the Ancient Greeks ended up positing the concept of infinity.  Which has caused a 2500 year long debate about whether the concept is even possible or meaningful.   Of course along the way people found practical applications for infinity in solving a number of problems (boom: limits! calculus!) and the furore over whether infinity really exists or not stopped being quite so important.  Who cares?  It's useful.</p>
<p>Of course if you have natural numbers... what happens if you count backwards?  Less than one is nothing.  What's less than nothing?  One less than nothing.  Negative numbers.  And now we've got integers!  </p>
<p>Integers are more interesting.  For example, if you divide one by the other, you get a number of interesting properties.  Usually, you get a rational number, which is a whole new type of number!  -1.25 and 2.49x10¹⁶ are rational numbers and a heck of a lot more useful than 1, 2, 3...</p>
<p>Of course, if you divide by zero, this is where things get <em>interesting</em>.  x / 0 is the same thing as 1 / x <em> 0.  Now the question is what number multiplied by zero gives a non-zero number?  Not a number.  You've just invented a whole headache there.  Equations which </em>do not have<em> solutions.  You can do all sorts of weird trickery of course.  For x / y as y gets infinitely small x converges towards zero but never actually </em>meets* it.  x / 0 is nonsensical.  That bothered a lot of people for hundreds of years.  Still does, I think.</p>
<p>Okay, rational numbers are definitely kind of interesting.  What happens if you have two of them?  You can plot a point on an infinite two-dimensional plane.  What happens if you have two pairs of them?  You can plot a line on a two dimensional plane.  Suddenly geometry becomes algebra becomes geometry.  No longer do you have to literally draw squares upon squares to calculate the volume of a cube - you can just calculate it with an algebraic formula: v = a³.  </p>
<p>I could go on but I'll probably lose most readers without a background in math at this point.</p>
<p>So in short the natural numbers were mathematical objects which could be extended.  And then combined.  And combined again.  Each combination had more interesting properties than the last.  Along the way we realized two branches of mathematics -- which had been split since their invention - geometry vs. elementary arithmetic and various basic algebras - were different ways of describing the exact same objects!  </p>
<p>It took us 2000 years to make that connection and yet without it there would not even be steam engines, let alone an Internet.</p>
<p>This is really outside of my area but I'd guess most mathematicians suspect that either every or an infinite number of mathematical objects exhibit such properties of emergent complexity and can often be tied to other seemingly unrelated areas in mathematics when sufficiently complex structure is developed to see the connections.</p>
<p>Of course, geometry = algebra was just the first <em>big</em> connection that was made.  And it was a theoretical one.  </p>
<p>Sometimes the connections which are made are much more applied, as others have spoken of in this thread.  Like computers.  The American engineer and physicist and mathematician Claude Shannon in 1937 wrote his Master's thesis titled <em>a Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits</em>.  </p>
<p>He originally set out from an engineering perspective.  He wanted to reduce the number of relays and vacuum tubes used in automatic telephone exchanges for cost and efficiency reasons.  Along the way, he realized that electrical switching circuits like relays are physical implementations of Boolean algebra operators.  Boolean algebra had been developed extensively by George Boole a century before and expanded on here and there by others along the way.  Boole also proved that Boolean algebra is equivalent to any other finite algebra, and thus can describe any finite mathematical structure describable by algebra.</p>
<p>In other words, he, quite accidentally, discovered that anything that is mathematically computable in a finite number of steps was, at least theoretically speaking, computable by a physical machine that could realistically be built with 20th century technology.  The first modern stored-program computer operated 11 years later -- using Boolean logic and binary numbers -- almost a century after Boole himself had died.</p>
<p>At almost the same time, both Alonzo Church and Alan Turing were attempting to define, analyze and study the properties of computation.  Computation itself is a mathematical structure by the way, which is the theoretical underpinning for why a general purpose computer can, with enough memrory and patience, simulate any other kind of general purpose computer.  </p>
<p>I bring it back to the computer because it's perhaps the ultimate triumph of mathematics.  We constructed a mathematical structure of a machine we can actually physically build, which itself can manipulate mathematical structures better than we ourselves can.  </p>
<p>All because someone once wondered what would happen if you didn't stop counting.</p>
<p>That's why people get sucked into math.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Feel free to read what I wrote and tried to explain, but I think this is an incredibly informative presentation.  It's slightly higher level than what I wrote, but it is aimed at a wide audience so it doesn't go into the specific math.  This guy is one of the brilliant minds in scientific computing and he's WAY better than me at communicating the concepts.  I know it's long, but if you really want insight into this I think it's an excellent talk:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pathlms.com/siam/courses/480/sections/732/thumbnail_video_presentations/5277" target="_blank">https://www.pathlms.com/siam/courses/480/sections/732/thumbnail_video_presentations/5277</a></p>
<p>I'm an applied mathematician.  I would say that an applied mathematician is generally someone who works on all the math behind engineering.  Engineering tends to involve a lot of really complicated math and an applied mathematician is someone who specializes in the math side, but not understand as much about the specifics behind electrical engineering or aerospace or any of those.</p>
<p>What do I work on specifically?  I work on fast methods in scientific computing.  There are a lot of REALLY complicated equations in math and engineering that you can't even really solve exactly.  If I ask you to solve the equation 2x + 5 = 3x you can solve that and find x = 5.  There are a lot of equations where we can't just solve for x, though. </p>
<p>Basically all of engineering is based off of approximations and simplifying the real world to something we can solve.  Equations like the Helmholtz equation and many other equations (the equations we work on specifically are known as partial differential equations) are really hard to solve.  There are ways to approximate these equations and tell a computer how to find an approximate solution, but many of the classical methods for solving these equations still have many shortcomings.  For example, suppose you want to know what the distribution of heat looks like as time changes in some physical application and you want to know what it looks like for 50 different beginning distributions of heat.  Most classical methods would require the computer to go through the process of solving the heat equation 50 times.  If you're working on how the heat changes in time in a metal rod then that's fairly simple for a computer to solve, partly because a metal rod is simple enough that we can just approximate it as a 1 dimensional object.  If you're working on something like what the airflow looks like through some three dimensional tunnel then that's a much more complicated problem and the computer might take a REALLY long time to solve it with good accuracy.  If your computer takes several days to solve the problem to high accuracy one time and you want to solve it for 50 different situations you're going to have a rough time.</p>
<p>There are many other problems that many numerical methods have.  I'm not going to write an essay on the shortcomings of many different solvers, but know that there are reasons why they are unappealing.</p>
<p>Most engineering companies will want really easy to use black box algorithms to solve their problems.  They don't want to fiddle with the algorithm every time they want to solve a problem.  They want to be able to just plug it in and have the computer solve it.</p>
<p>So anyways, we work on fast methods in scientific computing.  We develop methods where a computer is going to solve the desired problem quickly.  Remember how I said many classical problems will have to do the full process for solving the heat equation for each initial distribution of heat?  Well our solvers sort of do one initial solve where it gets all the data about the problem and this initial stage isn't much faster than many classical algorithms, but then each additional solve might only take one second or something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Answering the applications component of the great divide is much easier to answer than the theoretical one, so I'll start with that. Typically you will either do research (which involves the use of completed papers) to formulate a mathematical hypothesis and normally use computer programming to generate results. Otherwise it's typically using your analysis and critical thinking skills to develop trends or patterns and make projections on what could happen with different decisions. Examples of these jobs include: data analysts, project managers, consultants, etc.</p>
<p>Theoretical mathematicians can still actually dive into some of the areas that applied mathematicians typically do, but don't usually come equipped with skills regarding numerical computation and method implementation to carry out their objectives. Typically theoretical mathematicians can work with research in theoretical physics, or stick with theoretical mathematics to make a living. Solving the Millennium problems is a possibility (albeit not a very lucrative one) and since mathematics has an infinite number of problems, it's actually not too difficult to find a topic to extend and research. It's important to mention that many jobs that are available to applications mathematicians are also available to the theoretical ones, because of skill overlap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are plenty of problems today that we have no conclusive answer for. Mathematicians today are working on these problems, and the fact is that in practically all cases these problems, however abstract and inconsequential to the layman they may seem, they are there because someone has a real problem to solve. Their contribute may lead to deeper notations to describe a problem. For example, second quantization is a mathematical framework to express quantum states. Group theory is used to explain absorption spectra of molecules and crystals.</p>
<p>In some other cases, we don't even have the notation to understand the problem. Chaotic behaviors are still poorly understood, yet they are central in fluid dynamics, atmosphere science etc.</p>
<p>Statistics, plenty there. Every now and then there's a new problem due to an unexpected case of data analysis. </p>
<p>Cryptography, a disaster.</p>
<p>Optimization strategies, minimization of functions in multiple dimensions. How to do it fast, what is the real limit we can't push beyond.</p>
<p>Mathematicians are those who invent the tools, the notations, and the rules. They give us the words to express things in a more general and accurate way. Sometimes their contribute is immediate, sometimes it takes centuries until someone comes along and finds out that his newly discovered problem can be solved by what a guy did 300 years ago.</p></div>		</li>
