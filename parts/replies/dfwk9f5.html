<p>Gifs can do that too but they rarely do.</p>

<p>Gifs do not support p-frames. Everything is i-frames, people 'optimize' by shitting on the bit depth and resolution. Even then, they cannot play cleanly unless the entire file was loaded in one hit.</p>
<p>They needed to die years ago, webms are a piece of piss to make, yet people still cut gifs.</p>
<p>Hell people are still calling what is clearly a webm/mp4 a gif, or a script selector 'gifv'. Gfycat themselves say 'create and share awesome gifs!' when they convert gifs into webm/vp8 or mp4/h.264. This shit refuses to die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's more an artifact of language. To most people gif does not mean &quot;.gif&quot; or refer to a specific file format, it refers to a short, silent &quot;video&quot; clip that can be shared as easily as a picture. </p>
<p>I'd be willing to bet that the term &quot;gif&quot; will continue in even after .gifs are a relic of the last. Similar to how we still &quot;hang up&quot; a phone even though we are no longer actually hanging the receiver back on its wall hook. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more of a branding and name recognition then about the tech itself. People know what you mean when you say gifs. They don't know what most of that other stuff is. Keep the name for branding and use whatever tech you want on the back end</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have slow internet you often have to wait for the whole of a 1 minute video to load before watching it or you'll just be waiting for it to buffer the whole time. I remember just a few years ago trying to watch cartoons online and waiting over an hour to load a 20 minute video.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? Way back in '09 I remember binge watching the first season of Inuyasha with one of my friends on a DSL connection. It wasn't particularly fast either, like maybe ~350KB/s at the most. The quality was decent and I think we managed to watch it all over the course of a night or two.</p></div>		</li>
