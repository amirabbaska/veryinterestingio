<p>I too am curious how they are certain that there have not been decades, if not centuries with higher levels than today. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ice cores do not go back 3m years.
the oldest ice core goes back just 800,000 years. Supposedly there might be some 1.5m year old ice in antarctica, but no core has ever been drilled with such a long record.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Geologist here, having extensively researched Carbon Dioxide trends in the Eocene-Oligocene as part of a review paper I wrote. </p>
<p>As others have pointed out, ice cores don't really last that long. There's the Greenland cores, which date back to 125-130 thousand years, and there's the Antarctic cores, which date back to 400-800 thousand years.</p>
<p>To investigate carbon dioxide beyond that time frame, we make educated guesses on proxies. For instance, we can do stomata counts on fossilised leaves from that time period. When the atmosphere is more concentrated in carbon dioxide, leaves will have less stomata. A team of researchers in 2010 discovered that stomata growth in new leaves is directed by an enzyme that can &quot;detect&quot; atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and if these levels are lower, more stomata will appear on the new leaves in order to maximise carbon intake, hence explaining the inverse relationship. We count stomata densities from fossilised leaves (see Steinthorsdottir et al., 2016 for an excellent and recent paper). This isn't that easy, however, since counting stomata leaves involves studying modern, hopefully related (I'd say 9 in 10 studies this is not possible, so we go for a &quot;Nearest Living Equivalent&quot;) species that behave in a similar way. </p>
<p>There are other proxies, mostly involving isotope fractionation. For instance, studies on boron isotopes allow us to learn about pH of the ocean in the past, and from that we can infer past carbon dioxide levels. Studies on carbon isotopes allow us to reconstruct past sea surface temperatures, and from that we can also infer past carbon dioxide levels. Many chemical proxies are multi-step, involving many assumptions, but that's not to say they are wrong or useless - often, they are the only methods we have in the geological record. </p>
<p>To answer your other question about how long the atmosphere was &quot;at that level&quot; to appear in the ice core:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the atmosphere doesn't &quot;stay still&quot;, it is inherently dynamic. Carbon dioxide values fluctuate between summer and winter because of greater rates of photosynthesis in summer than winter, so unfortunately I'd like to kindly point out that your question is not very well phrased. </p>
<p>Ice cores allow us to investigate carbon dioxide through trapped bubbles of gas within the highly compact snow. Think about snow falling in Greenland, and this snow will be compacted as new layers of snow fall onto it. Gases will circulate in indiscriminate little pore spaces within this snow, and eventually, after some time, these pore spaces will be sealed due to the snow becoming compacted through burial by newer snow. So, the age of that sealing is far younger than the age of the surrounding ice, which is problematic for us to assign an age to it. (We know however, that it will be younger than the surrounding ice, and we can date the surrounding ice through alternating dark/light layers in the ice, as someone else has pointed out in this thread). The gas that is trapped, we'd like to assume (but not always the case, of course), is representative of the atmosphere exactly at the time that it was sealed - it's not going to be a weekly or monthly or yearly average. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ice cores only go back 800,000 years, when the ice age started and the ice was made. The ice didn't exist before the ice age. They have other methods of figuring out historical co2 and temperature that don't rely on the ice and go back much further in time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the ice sheets in antarctica are much older than 800,000 years, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the ice thickness is too high the old ice at the bottom is getting so warm by geothermal heating that it is melted away,&quot; Fischer explains. &quot;This is what happens at Dome C and limits its age to 800,000 years.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I forget what I was originally reading, but I thought I read some dude around 1850 or 1870 did some geology research on it. In any case the charts exist and here's a WP article on some of it:</p>

<p>&quot;Various proxy measurements have been used to attempt to determine atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations millions of years in the past. These include boron and carbon isotope ratios in certain types of marine sediments, and the number of stomata observed on fossil plant leaves&quot;</p></div>		</li>
