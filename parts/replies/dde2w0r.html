			<div class="markdown"><p>Surface chemist here:</p>
<p>You've gotten some good answers, but what nobody has mentioned is that when you break a bond, it doesn't just remain there as half a bond - it rearranges or reacts with air.
And not just metals! Almost any solid material will do one of these two things if its bonds are broken.</p>
<p>An absence of a bond is unstable and high-energy. This is called surface energy and it was introduced when you put energy into the bonds to break them. Usually, the surface energy is reduced immediately by reaction with oxygen or water in the air, essentially forming a layer on the material which discourages recombination. What can also happen is the structure of the material rearranges at the newly-created interface to minimize the surface energy. </p>
<p>This rearrangement, purely a result of energy seeking a minimum (like a ball rolling down a hill) is what makes spontaneous bond reformation impossible.</p>
<p>edit: I just saw your second question. A knife can't be any &quot;sharper&quot; at the tip than an atom. The atom is held together with really phenomenal forces, to boot. It would be like trying to cut a beach ball in half with a knife made out of equally-sized beach balls. You'll knock them around, and you might even separate some beach balls, but you aren't going to cut any beach balls in half no matter how hard you swing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this similar to why cold welding is an issue in a vacuum, such as in space, where metallic materials (especially those polished and very clean) bond to each other? Because there was nothing for that unstable or high energy chain to bond to other than the other metallic material?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were to rip apart a substance in an ultra-high vacuum, would you be able to reintroduce the bonds between previously separated material? Would it depend on the type of attraction at play between the molecules ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can say now without even looking that reddit is going to mention cold-welding a bunch of times - but I have a feeling you're asking about more than just metal-metal bonds!</p>
<p>You're right that it would depend entirely on the type of molecules involved. Metals, when bonds break, just hold onto those &quot;extra&quot; electrons with no trouble because of how free all of their valence electrons are in the first place. There's plenty of room for a few more.</p>
<p>Materials with different atoms, however, wouldn't do this - if they were unable to hold onto the extra electrons in a stable fashion, they would rearrange into a lower-energy state, minimizing the surface energy by self-reacting or rearranging their electronic structure. </p>
<p>So the answer to your question is, yes, <em>sometimes</em>. For metals, absolutely, but for things like paper or other materials? Not at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) Normally edges are too rough to correctly align the bonds back. This is due to the grain boundaries mentioned in the above comment. In the example of metals, oxides form quickly at the newly formed area exposed to air. The oxides prevent the metal crystal structure from reforming, going to the lowest energy state, and bonding again. Though if you do this in a vacuum, it <em>can</em> reattach.</p>
<p>2) we don't cut atoms in half to make a nuclear bomb. We throw an extra neutron at it, and it becomes unstable enough to separate itself in half (or some other fraction of the original atom, minus some energy).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible to achieve the same (to a certain degree) in atmosphere too! You just have to finely polish two pieces of metal and they will attach to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/gbsd2OpPOMw?t=15" target="_blank">BOLTR: GAUGE BLOCKS (youtube)</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>E=mc^2. so the energy released is proportional to the change in mass of the atom. Even heavy atoms don't have much mass so a chain reaction is necessary.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re: 1) you can, it's called cold welding ( example here <a href="http://m.imgur.com/gallery/H8H0Zfv" target="_blank">http://m.imgur.com/gallery/H8H0Zfv</a>) buy it doesn't occur normally because as soon as you cut the thing 'stuff' gets in between ( hand oils, water vapor, an oxide layer, etc) so that you basically can't ever get them to touch again like the parts did before you cut the thing. For polymers , which can be thought of as a bowl of spaghetti, when you cut it it's like using 2 forks to separate the spaghetti into half. You separated the bowl of spaghetti, but you didn't break many if any actual bonds ( you didn't rip many individual strands they just kinda untangled) you can see how squishing the  2 piles back together doesn't 'retangle' the strands so it doesn't stick together well</p></div>		</li>
