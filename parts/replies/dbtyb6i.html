<p>Not in anaerobic glycolytic muscle fibers which typically don't have any myoglobin to begin with. Look at these fibers under a microscope and they'll be almost completely clear. </p>
<p>The short duration that humans can sprint for has very little to do with ATP production, it has to do with the sarcomeres in your muscles physically breaking down and no longer being able to cross-bridge cycle and therefore can't generate tension. These muscle fibers don't use oxygen to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's going to increase your willpower to do it. In most cases, like running for a bus, people would probably stop sprinting before they hit the energy limit so when running for life, yes, they would go longer. But when athletes run in competitions, they usually push all out of themselves so it wouldn't affect them. I've tripped over after finishing a 200m race because one of my legs just wouldn't move fast enough with the momentum I had from crossing the line, so I guess it's anecdotal evidence for that.</p></div>		</li>
