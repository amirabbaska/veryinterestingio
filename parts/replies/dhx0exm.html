			<div class="markdown"><p>Many reasons why you may never even enjoy beer. Flavor is also about a combination of texture, sight, olfaction, and taste. You may not like beer not on a chemical level, but due to a combination of these factors. The taste receptors responsible for what we call &quot;bitter&quot; taste may be less damaged or more plentiful in your case. That aside, what food or drink someone enjoys is also influenced by culture. Growing up on a sweet and salty diet would build a particular taste palette for that individual where food that does not fit on that palette is perceived differently, sometimes negatively. And of course, even if we are all biologically identical, our experiences and the way we perceive the outside world can differ between our tongue and the final output, that is, somewhere along the countless pathways in our neural network your association with the taste of beer to your memories and emotions would be very different than another person's, and the final effect would be that your judgement of that particular taste is to avoid it because you do not like it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then how come some people like salad and others don't? Can't we also learn what tastes &quot;good&quot; and what doesn't? Or is all taste built up on first breaking down your taste receptors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taste is a combination of texture, temperature, olfaction... something tasty is not as tasty if you chew with your nose plugged and eyes closed. In fact, your ability to taste food reaches nearly zero when you eat it without your nose open to receive the aromatic particles that exude from your food. Someone who doesn't like salad might not like the texture of floppy leaves, or the oily texture of having balsamico on it, or the particular flavors of that salad.</p>
<p>Different cultures perceive more complex flavors differently, so our preferences CAN be learned. A Chinese individual would eat crickets on a stick, but given the same opportunity once in my life, I found it unappealing. It was not part of the taste palette that I grew up with, so when I eat it, my brain compares it to what flavors I already know as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; and categorizes it as &quot;bad.&quot; For someone wishing to taste food without being influenced by their pre-existing choice they would have to try the food with similar characteristics to what they already enjoy in order to isolate just the taste. </p>
<p>Taste can vary from individual to individual, particularly their perception of it. That being said, it is difficult to find people who dislike chocolate, and that says something about our taste being influenced on a more genetic level as well. As a previous commentator had said, there is a genetic component to taste in that it increases our fitness to enjoy sweet foods and avoid bitter foods as the chemicals that cause bitterness in food are often part of something that would irritate the body or poison it. The chemical substances that bind to our taste receptors and cause this sensation of &quot;bitterness&quot; irritate other receptors in our body like our skin. Rub anything bitter on a sensitive area like an open wound or your eyes and it will irritate your body. So in reality, if your body was built in a way in which we are irritated by the chemicals that make sweet foods sweet, and instead felt positive effects and no irritation from the chemicals that make bitter food bitter, then our perception of what is good and bad to eat and consequently what is good or bad to taste would be very different. If we still developed chocolate confections at that point, they may be enhanced in other ways - pure cocoa, no sugar, but rather spiciness or some other additions. Then sweet chocolate made with milk would be the odd one out.</p>
<p>Our bodies are fascinating things, more complex than we will likely ever know, and the more you learn and investigate these things and connect them together, the more questions you end up having about why we turned out the way we did. What's so special about us being this way? So many questions.... and all just because we noticed that some people don't like some types of food. :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because if you get a Psychology degree in America, it is considered a Bachelor of Arts... apparently. -_- Why do I have to wait a year after taking MCATs to apply to medical school? Why do we spend years learning about the American civil war as if it were a religious subject only to have it be useless information for anyone not interested in studying american history? Lots of questions... lots of questions...</p></div>		</li>
