			<div class="markdown"><p>I studied in east Asia in college and made a very good friend who had access to a kitchen and would cook us amazing meals from scratch. To thank him, a few of us Americans offered to make him some cheesy mashed potatoes. The only cheese we could find was the powdery grated Parmesan that usually goes on top of spaghetti. Cheese-deprived, we were sprinkling it into our hands and eating it plain. Our host asked us if he could try it or if it would give him diarrhea before it was heated. When we gave him the go-ahead, he threw a handful into his mouth and immediately choked and gagged. He described it as rotting sand. He actually seemed a little miffed that we'd told him it was okay to eat-- like he couldn't believe we'd been eating it because we liked it so much, and it had just been a set-up to get him to eat something disgusting.   </p>
<p>All was forgiven when he tasted cheesy mashed potatoes, though. Almost a decade later, he got in touch and asked me for the recipe because he was still thinking about them. (Peel potatoes. Cut. Boil. Mash some. Add whatever cheese you have. Add a little milk if you have it. Mash them all until they're mashed potatoes. Add salt and pepper if you think they need it.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was hysterical. Having been subjected to the culinary assault known as &quot;stinky tofu&quot;, I'm glad to see some sweet, sweet culinary justice.</p>
<p>Although to be fair, real Kung Pao chicken from Chongqing blows away anything you can find in the West</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha. I'm American but being of Chinese descent I actually enjoy stinky tofu (<em>and</em> cheese!) so it's kind of hilarious seeing either side turn their nose up (literally) at either food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was little, many things were still rationed and required food stamp, including milk, this is the early 80s in Shanghai. If you know friends or relatives with newborns you would save and give them your milk. Maybe that's why a lot of people still associate milk with babies?</p>
<p>In the late 80s and early 90s, when I was in elementary school I recall milk were sold only in the morning (because they are not homogenized and probably not pasteurized, also there was a lack of refrigeration, so they go bad fast). Many parents buy their kids milk for breakfast. Kids would walk to school drinking milk in plastic bags. TV ads pushed milk and milk powder pretty hard as a source of calcium for kids. </p>
<p>Cheese simply weren't available anywhere. My introduction to cheese was via a Japanese hamburger restaurant and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle TV show where they showed pizza with cheese. That was prior to any Pizza Hut opened in China. </p>
<p>Honestly I was unaware of lactose intolerance is a thing east asians are known for until I moved to US. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last time I was there (2010) they still did milk in the bags for breakfast. But I didn't know the history behind it. </p>
<p>And they still do the ads. I get Chinese TV and there's tons of milk powder ads on TV. Especially imported powder. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So have I. Asians don't have as much body odor as white people. Something to do with sweat glands. Never heard about the comparison to milk though. </p></div>		</li>
