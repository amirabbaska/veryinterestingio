			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually can take your house that you live in, depending on equity you have in it. Same with primary car.</p>
<p>Say in a state it is 250k in equity. You have a 400k house, but still owe 100k. The house would be sold for 400k, then 100k pays off the loan which leaves 300k. You would get 250k and then the left over 50k would go to pay the debt.</p>
<p>Works the same for cars, but most states don't give you much equity in a car, generally just a couple or a few thousand.</p>
<p>But, you would get a fresh start and nearly all debt discharged. However, say in a court judgement case, if it was intentional fraud/tort that the judgement was on, that would not be discharged. But say I got a $5 million judgement for killing someone while I was texting while driving, that would get discharged (DUIs fines/damages are not dischargeable).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being able to take you house or car depends on the amount of debt, the kind of debt, and the State that you are in. In most there are protections for things you need to survive. And we are talking about extreme sums, not things under 500K. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your ability to get a visa in that other country would be fairly dependent on the country and what crimes you were charged with.  I know Canada is pretty picky, but I don't know if other countries are.  </p>
<p>Then there's the issue of what happens if you come back.  I wonder if extradition is a factor in some cases like this?</p></div>		</li>
