			<div class="markdown"><p>Knowing the mass is the easy part... it was first DEFINED to be a specific mass in terms of carbon, so that was piece of cake. </p>
<p>Then, to go from one element to another, that is an easy task too because we know the atomic masses of elements quite precisely as well. (H=1; C=12, etc)  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. The amount of mass was defined by the atomic mass. I believe they choose the somewhat arbitrary number to define a standard amount to use when running experiments with gases, in particular.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately that definition tying mass (kilogram) to mole would go away soon (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_redefinition_of_SI_base_units#Mole" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_redefinition_of_SI_base_units#Mole</a>). Instead, mole will be defined as a de-coupled Avogadro constant. </p>
<p>There are reasons behind that, but I still find it counterintuitive. Intuitively, the now abandoned project of inverting the relationship between kilogram and mole seems to make more sense to me (as in, defining kilogram <em>from</em> mole, rather than mole from kilogram).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The experiment measured the charge of an electron. This was done by admitting a fine mist of oil into a chamber built with two plates at the top and bottom. Mist droplets were allowed to fall through a hole at the top and a voltage was applied to the plates. Electrons were then beamed across the mist flow.</p>
<p>By measuring the rate at which the oil blobs fell with the voltage on and off, they could determine that the charge that had accumulated on the drops during descent was always a whole number multiple of a certain value. That value must be the charge of a single electron. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know a whole lot about it, but I do know that it was just before this that scientists (I think Faraday again) had isolated elections and discovered that they were the source of electricity. So first you study lone electrons, them you can calculate those which are in the atom.</p>
<p>I'd love for a proper chemist or historian to explain more, since it blows my mind what these people were able to discover about a subatomic world that I usually take for granted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply! A few questions if I may.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Michael Faraday worked in the 1830s on electrolysis, and he had been able to calculate the electric charge per mole of electron. The number of elections was still not known, though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, is this where you would examine the mass of an electrode before and after a certain amount of current flows through it? And that the charge correlates directly with atoms leaving the electrode?</p>
<p>You said he could calculate the charge per mole of electron, but how did he know how much a mole of electrons was? I think I'm missing some link. </p>
<p>I think I understand the Millikan experiment- which allowed us to measure the charge and mass of electrons and protons? But how did he know the mass of a mole of hydrogen? If not knowing the # of atoms in the mole, was he going off of mass (In this case 1 gram?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're welcome! The follow up answers, as best I can offer:</p>
<p>1) I don't know anything about Faraday's actual technique. I can only say that he was able to very closely calculate the number of elections in a gas. Perhaps your description is correct.</p>
<p>2) Before the charge was ever calculated, the mole was already established. Avogadro didn't know about electrons, and he never came up with 6.02x10^23 . Essentially, he needed to conduct calculations on a given &quot;lump&quot; if mass. He worked I believe mostly with gases, and gases are tricky beasts because their volumes change all. In order to make a standard &quot;lump&quot; of hydrogen, etc, he used the a.u. and just made the mole that many grams. So a mole of hydrogen (a.u. 1.01) could be understood across Europe as 1.01 grams.</p>
<p>Exactly how many particles we're in that lump wouldn't be discovered until long after Avogadro had died. The eponymous constant is honorary.</p>
<p>There's of course more to the story than I know. For example, someone else but me could tell you why Avogadro needed the constant to be a different amount of mass for each gas - I think it relates to how gases take up volume - instead of just doing calculations with 10g if each gas.</p></div>		</li>
