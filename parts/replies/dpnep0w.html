			<div class="markdown"><p>I have read this too. Hobson in his 2002 book <a href="http://a.co/1CfkPvE" target="_blank"><em>The Dream Drug Store</em></a> claimed this phenomena was well known to sleep researchers and they labeled this phenomena 'prozac eyes.' He also claimed that SSRIs degraded sleep architecture and this change was relatively permanent. </p>
<p>I have been unable however to find any reference to this phenomena however which is extrordinary given how important this phenomena (if proven) would be and how simple the data would be to collect given sleep medicine is now a burgeoning field and myriad  patients have their sleep patterns analysed every night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it is a side effect with so many implications that they don't really want to research it. Or maybe it would take more efforts to evaluate patients just before they start taking SSRI to see the longitudinal effects. </p>
<p>I work in a physical rehab clinic. Many people are given SSRI for chronic pain. It is sad, because it inhibits a part of the pain signal, but then they get a postural syndrome (asymetry of activation of paraspinal muscles) wich by itself brings in some pain. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>But isn’t reducing the pain the goal of care?  I’m just a med student, but considering the overlap between fibromyalgia diagnoses and depressive symptoms that I see in the hospital, I’d say a large percentage of people with chronic pain are experiencing somatization of their depression.  TCAs and SSRIs often help a lot better in reducing symptoms than anything else we can give, and can help return the patient to functional status.</p>
<p>Seems like doctors could help the paraspinal issue by encouraging more patients to exercise.  I doubt most doctors are going to take time to actually palpate the paraspinal muscles and diagnose a paraspinal dysfunction (and that includes most DOs).</p></div>		</li>
