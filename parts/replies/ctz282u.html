			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say it's any more &quot;far off&quot; than any other fusion reactor technology. There are multiple teams researching it. Granted, it hasn't received the relatively massive funding that the Tokamak research has. There are significant benefits to aneutronic fusion, not the least of which is the lack of neutron damage to the reactor itself. It also allows for direct electricity conversion by capturing charged alpha particles and transferring their energy directly into high voltage current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its more accurate to say aneutronic fusion as <em>greatly reduced</em> neutron output.  There are still neutrons produced as low probability or side reactions in all of the aneutronic fuel choices I'm aware of (pB11, pL7, etc).</p></div>		</li>
