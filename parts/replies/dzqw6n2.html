			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, a lot of this stuff should be taught in biology, it a lot more intricate than vitamins are good for you.</p>
<p>Edit. Unfortunately we don't teach biology early enough and a lot of metabolic processes gets pushed into college level courses, some dipping in chemistry classes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, there are two types of vitamin D, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol). I learned that when I was diagnosed with a vitamin deficiency and put on both at the same time. D2 is usually only available by prescription, or at least, I didn't see it on the shelf in the supplement aisle. D2 is found in plant sources and D3 is from animal sources and is formed naturally with sunlight exposure. There are also multiple dietary sources of vitamin A, those being various water-soluble carotenoids found in plants as well as fat-soluble retinol found in animals (along with related compounds such as retinyl acetate, which is effectively the same thing with some different groups attached as far as metabolic activity is concerned). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vitamin D doesn't even need to be consumed to enter the body, so that sentence is wrong. However, yes, it's fat solluable.</p>
<p>There are also discussions on whether we should call it a vitamin or not as well. </p></div>		</li>
