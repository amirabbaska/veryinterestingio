<p>&quot;I'll find out what Sally's got
Makes a man think she's so hot&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a freshman in '99, I was the only one from my tiny hick town at a huge university. I was outside smoking on evening when a few very hip guys came out for a cigarette. One of them said to me, &quot;Hey, that jacket's tight.&quot;</p>
<p>I replied, &quot;Really? I think it fits pretty well.&quot; </p>
<p>And that's the story of how I didn't become popular at college.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could it be also because we have to use &quot;cool&quot; anyway in everyday language with its more literal meaning.  Like &quot;it is cool outside&quot;.  Since we have to use it anyway all the time we can't reject it.</p></div>		</li>
