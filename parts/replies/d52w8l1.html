			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this as an explanation. It ties in well with a brain fact I had today. Names changed. </p>
<p>I have a colleague called Fred Blair. I work with him a lot. A while ago, I had a colleague called Frank Blair. I didn't work with them much. They are no relation. </p>
<p>I saw a parcel today marked F. Blair, with Fred's employee number on it. I went in to tell him... And couldn't remember his name. All I could remember was &quot;Frank&quot;. I knew it wasn't his name but Fred had vanished. About two minutes later my brain snapped back into gear, so I told Fred about his parcel. </p>
<p>I like your analogy, as clearly my brain looked up &quot;F. Blair&quot; and withdrew the Frank book and wouldn't put it back - after a minute or so I 3 able to safely &quot;shelf&quot; that one, try again and get the correct book. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is called proactive interference - old knowledge interferes with new. It's the same reason why, when I got a new car, I was still trying to turn the headlights on in the &quot;old way&quot;.</p>
<p>If the opposite happened, for example you couldn't remember Frank's name and kept thinking of him as Fred, that would be retroactive interference - new knowledge overwriting old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once forgot my PIN for my ATM card... that is, I forgot it permanently. I used it for probably 2 years and one day I went to the ATM and I just could not for the life of me remember my PIN. I even said fuck it and went home, hoping it would just come to me later. Eventually I just had to call my bank and get a new one. It was pretty odd... like something had dissolved along the pathway of connections in my brain that accessed/stored that memory. If it happened with a bunch of other shit that I might be concerned but still, it was pretty weird.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me, my pin was 1234 ^^^*Not ^^^actual ^^^pin for more than 3 years, it was also the first and only pin that I had at the time - I rocked up to the atm one day and suddenly I couldn't remember what it was. A week later I still couldn't remember it, so I went into the bank to change it. When they asked me to enter my 'new pin' I put in 1234 and it came up with an error message saying that I couldn't set the new pin code as the current pin code or any pin code used within the last 12 months, but then I couldn't cancel the change action either because I would have been left with a pinless card, so I had to create an entirely new pin code: 4321. For the next year every time I went to the atm I habitually put in 1234 and an incorrect attempt message would come up, so after 12 months I changed my pin back to 1234. Arrive at present day, and just because my brain is a fucking cunt, every time I go to an atm I habitually press 4321 as my pin code and get an error message...</p>
<p>Tl;dr. Brain is a dickwad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom did something similar (and so did I for a short time), except it was on a piece of paper in her wallet. She had a list of real phone numbers and mixed in were the pin numbers for a couple of her cards. It's pretty clever. Though the names weren't. I remember one of them was something like Tim Masters, for her Master card. ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple people at work that I've known for <em>years</em> (not super closely, but still in a few meetings a year) that I continually have problems recalling their names.</p>
<p>It's like the memory of their name somehow got associated with the memory of forgetting their name. So I have to think about it really hard for 20 seconds and eventually I'll come up with it.</p>
<p>At one point I also forgot Robin Williams' name temporarily. But I still remember my studentID# from college (20 years ago) and the phone number we had at our house in the 1970's (when I was 5).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, there's a theory that basically says your mind is like a computer sorting wise. As blu said, things get labels and such and work within a certain hierarchy. So for when you're trying to remember say, the name of an actor, the name of that actor is within a folder, in another folder, in another, etc. The top level stuff are basic associatives, and things get more detailed and form a web of sorts.</p>
<p>What happens when you know you know something is like he said, that there's a file that says it exists, but doesn't say where. Your brain basically short circuits searching the folder that that file saying you know it is in and disregards the rest. </p>
<p>Imagine trying to find Win32, but you're looking in the Microsoft Games folder. You might find stuff about Solitaire and such, and things that seem familiar in some way, but without accessing that tree that leads to Win32 you'll never find it.</p>
<p>A common way to bypass this is to actually forget it entirely, and in essence, &quot;reset&quot; your brain or where it's searching. Thus pulling you out of the Microsoft Games folder and back to the root C:/ drive, which can then find Win32. It's for this reason that later after troubling over it you'll suddenly have a random &quot;OH! THAT'S WHAT IT WAS!&quot; moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of computer analogies, human memory is more like a tagging system than a folder system. It's also a bit more complicated because the &quot;search terms&quot; (cues) are not simple words like you would use on a computer - human memory searches use explicit cues (words, images) but they are also affected by the context in which the search occurs (setting, mood, etc.).</p>
<p>In the situation we're talking about in this thread, it may be that the search cues (including context) are activating the wrong information in memory, but once those cues and that information is in mind it is difficult to disengage and start a new search with more effective cues. This can happen even when you can remember that you have the correct information in memory and when you know that the current search is not working.</p></div>		</li>
