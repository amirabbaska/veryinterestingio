			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally real.  The gimmick was that the special press would somehow magically keep the nutrients and vitamins undamaged and it's better for you.</p>
<p>As soon as it came out, a journalist debunked the whole thing, they just opened the pouch and squeezed the juice out with their hands and got 99% the exact same thing.  Shortly after they went out of business.</p>
<p>It was pretty much a bullshit snake oil product designed to take advantage of hipsters and health nuts.</p></div>		</li>
