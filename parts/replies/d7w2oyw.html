			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd want a deep-cycle/Marine type battery for this type of application.
You are correct about deep-discharge killing batteries prematurely.  a 100% discharge will give you about 200 charge/discharge cycles.  A discharge of 30% of capacity will yield close to a thousand cycles.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One correction here, you would want a deep-cycle battery, not a marine type battery.  Often assumed to be the same thing, they are not.  &quot;Marine Deep-Cycle&quot; batteries are actually a hybrid of a car starting battery and a true deep cycle battery.  They combine aspects of both.</p>
<p>You are on the right track here though, what OP wants is a true deep cycle battery.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>300 Watts is a pretty insane amount for any sort of endurance level.</p>
<p>That is about right for a very fit male (4 W/kg), ~75kg, max output over 1 hour. That would be a very hard workout.</p>
<p>200 Watts for an hour would be a hard workout for most people.</p></div>		</li>
