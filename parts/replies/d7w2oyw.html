			<p>Deep cycling lead acid batteries destroys them so cut that run time in half if you want your batteries to have any life.</p>		</li>

			<p>You'd want a deep-cycle/Marine type battery for this type of application.<br>You are correct about deep-discharge killing batteries prematurely.  a 100% discharge will give you about 200 charge/discharge cycles.  A discharge of 30% of capacity will yield close to a thousand cycles.<br><br>(I work for a battery company - Used to be the SLA battery buyer)<br></p>		</li>

			<p>One correction here, you would want a deep-cycle battery, not a marine type battery.  Often assumed to be the same thing, they are not.  &quot;Marine Deep-Cycle&quot; batteries are actually a hybrid of a car starting battery and a true deep cycle battery.  They combine aspects of both.<br><br>You are on the right track here though, what OP wants is a true deep cycle battery.<br><br>Source: Electrical Engineer</p>		</li>

			<p>That's awesome, do you have any information on phone or laptop battery discharge? </p>		</li>

			<p>Li-ion really doesn't care.  You get about 300 full charge-discharge cycles, average duty life is about 2 years.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>The one caveat to this; don't run your Li-ion batteries so dead that the phone or computer shuts itself off. Best practice is to charge it when you get the low-battery warnings, usually around 10%. Most consumer electronics have safeties that account for a little bit of reserve and will power the device down before the battery hits it's true 0% mark, but it's not a good idea to chance it.</p>		</li>

			<p>The charge control circuit built into the phone battery won't let you fully discharge the battery.  <br><br>Zero % battery on your phone isn't really a fully depleted battery.  Sometimes we see phone batteries that have been in inventory too long go into &quot;sleep mode&quot; and they won't even show voltage on a voltmeter.  But if you disassemble the battery and read the cells, you'll get a voltage reading.  <br><br>Most consumer batteries are engineered to protect the customer from themselves.</p>		</li>

			<p>Also when you are cycling you only produce maybe 200 to 300 watts, that will not be enough to charge your batteries fully in practice.</p>		</li>

			<p>300 Watts is a pretty insane amount for any sort of endurance level.<br><br>That is about right for a very fit male (4 W/kg), ~75kg, max output over 1 hour. That would be a very hard workout.<br><br>200 Watts for an hour would be a hard workout for most people.</p>		</li>

			<p>How much did you weigh? If you were particularly light (like 130 pounds or less) then an FTP of 350 watts would be pro level<br><br>Even so, a 5 minute power of 650 watts is ridiculous, no matter the rider's weight (for reference, a 70 kg rider putting out 650 watts over 5 minutes would be doing over 9 w/kg, which is far above Tour level)</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, that's much more reasonable (though still very good. If you weren't racing, then you should have been)</p>		</li>
