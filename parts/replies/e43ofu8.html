			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain that further?  What about the orbit is wrong if u dont take light speed into account?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest moons of Jupiter orbit the planet at a distance of up to a few light-seconds. So if they are behind Jupiter, it can take a few more seconds for their light to reach us than it takes from Jupiter, and if they're in front of Jupiter their light can reach us a few seconds ahead of Jupiter.</p>
<p>So if you're trying to predict when a moon will be eclipsed by Jupiter, you need to take into account the fact that it takes a few seconds for the light from the moon to reach Jupiter, and both Jupiter and the moon will have moved a little in that time. So your predictions might be off by a few seconds if you don't take this into account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd expect shorter distances, like those involved in our local solar system to appear more distorted. Space is massive and at distances of other galaxies we start seeing interesting things with decimal places becoming insignificant.</p></div>		</li>
