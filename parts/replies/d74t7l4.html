			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only answer that makes sense. You can see in the third picture that air is pumped into the tank, as is expected because the water needs exposure to fresh air. The vacuum pump would explain this, but it still doesn't seem right. What happens if the power goes out, or the vacuum pump breaks, it will be a mess!</p>
<p>edit: someone mentioned a check-valve could be used to prevent the water leaking if the pump went out, that would work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Won't work.  There will be a lot of degassing and evaporation which add more gas to the headroom, reducing the vacuum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah true, good point. There must be something to prevent it from leaking, maybe just some back up generators or batteries. This whole thing is very strange, i would love to know for sure how the tank works.  </p></div>		</li>
