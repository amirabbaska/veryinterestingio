			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a teacher said that a treatment for drinking the wrong kind of alcohol, isopropyl for example, is to chug a bottle of normal ethanol, like a bottle of vodka. </p>
<p>The reason is that your liver breaks down the alcohol from things like mouthwash into a toxin using an enzyme.  There's a finite number of the enzyme so if you are also drinking some vodka then some of those enzymes are tied up breaking down the booze and therefor not producing as much of the toxic by product from the mouthwash or isopropyl alcohol that was ingested. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mouthwash is fully safe and drinkable, it's made using normal ethanol if it contains alcohol of any type. It's not very fun to drink because of the strong flavorings, but it's a pretty normal thing to consume for drunks in states where liquor stores close on the weekends. Same thing with vanilla (or other) extract.</p></div>		</li>
