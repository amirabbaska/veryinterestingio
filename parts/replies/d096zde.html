			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever since seeing Jurassic World and the Mosasaur, I can't help but feel the size of it was wayyyy exaggerated. I know they got big (~18m) but the sheer size of it in that .gif seems rather unrealistic. Although now that I'm thinking about it, the premise of the movie <strong><em>is</em></strong> about a genetically modified dinosauer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to comment this as well. Showing that gif does give a good visual representation of what a mosasaur physically looks like, but gives a very misleading idea of the actual size. The one in the movie is ridiculous and several orders of magnitude bigger than anything in the fossil record.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be right. I had the same skepticism over using that gif, but couldn't resist. Except for the consideration that it was &quot;genetically modified,&quot; which is a good theory. Also why the T-Rex didn't have feathers along with the Velociraptor, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/q3GyldM.jpg" target="_blank">which was more of a Utahraptor.</a></p></div>		</li>
