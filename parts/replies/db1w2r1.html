			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer to this question is (no offence ;) ) that the question is wrong. The electron doesn't literally move around in the wave-function. It is like functor7's comment: It isn't a very small thing with a position. Instead, it is fundamentally delocalized, as described by its wave-function.</p>
<p>EDIT: I stand corrected. There is actually movement within the wave-function in a nuanced way. But not in a classical way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure it does, just not in a classical manner. But it has a kinetic energy (which the Schr√∂dinger equation itself defines), and it works analogously to classical motion, in that motion with angular momentum gives rise to a magnetic moment, multiple-electron systems exhibit correlations of motion, and they exhibit the special-relativistic effects of motion. Delocalization does not mean they don't move - in fact the amount of delocalization is related directly to the kinetic energy (e.g. a narrowly confined particle has higher kinetic energy than one allowed to spread out spatially)</p>
<p>In the field of quantum chemistry we use the term 'electron motion' all the time, but it is understood then that we are not talking about classical motion, and one of the defining differences then is that quantum particles do <em>not</em> follow trajectories, (or alternately, in the path-integral formulation, that they do, but then not a <em>single</em> trajectory). And since they do not follow trajectories, there is no problem in getting from A to B without passing a point in-between.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since OP is talking about OChem class, I interpreted the question from the perspective of an undergraduate chemistry curriculum. The OP specifically asked about nodes in the s wavefunctions. These are <em>defined</em> as the point where the wavefunction is zero, where the wavefunction switches sign upon passing through. I believe the top answer is not addressing this at all. </p>
<p>My answer is not making claims about electronic motion, I'm merely stating that the shape of the node in this case is a spherical shell (or nested shells for higher n). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can plot the probability of finding the electron in a certain volume of space, if you do that for all radii from zero to infinity, you'll find that at the node the probability is zero. So there is a way in which the electron cannot be at the node.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The electron doesn't &quot;jump around&quot; in the wave. The electron <em>is</em> the wave.</p>
<p>Imagine cutting up that electron into a billion pieces and scattering the pieces around until it looks like the wave. Not an accurate model at all, but it gets the point of delocalization across.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question, and there are a lot of good answers here, but I would like to point out that this is one reason you really need math to understand quantum phenomenon.  We simply dont have the tools in English to do this concept justice.  Only by following the mathematical reasoning behind quantum mechanics, and by comparing to the mountain range of data that supports the assumptions and calculations it makes, can you really grasp what's going on.</p>
<p>Our brains didnt evolve for this kind of thing to make intuitive sense to us.  We are fortunate that Nature abides by mathematical laws which give us our only true insight into what's going on.  But to expect Nature to further obey our feelings about what makes 'sense' to us is asking too much.</p>
<p>To try to answer your question, you have to realize that a probability distribution is the best you're going to get out of Nature.  At some level, something has to be fundamental, and when you take the wave function, (and the square of it which is the measurable probability distribution) as fundamental, you get the best and most predictive scheme by which to understand what your experimental apparatus is telling you.  It just so happens to be telling you that you have a non zero probability in some places, and a zero in others.  To suspect that you can instill your own logical connections about what is 'really' happening when the electron transitions from one orbital to another is hubris.  Thinking about it 'jumping' 'passing' or 'teleportation' is really just a bad English approximation for quantum state transitions in the Schrodinger equation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if I understand this correctly, this is just like how a vibrating string has nodes for certain wavelengths within a set length... The have function of an electron has them too? That makes sense I suppose.</p></div>		</li>
