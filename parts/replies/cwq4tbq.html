<p>Trade, no matter how much it has been demonized by some is a good thing.</p>

<p>The only arguments against the TPP that I've ever really seen have been over the protectionist clauses (extending and enhancing enforcement of patent protection, <em>preventing</em> competition and trade on generic markets) and on ISDS measures, which could potentially reduce sovereignty and allow companies to eg sue a nation for trying to reduce carbon emissions. Eg, a high pollution company could invest in a country, that country could then try and pass carbon reduction measures, and an ISDS clause could in theory let that company sue that country for loss of profits/for changing the playing field.</p>
<p>Before the text was released it was impossible to know how far either would go, whether it was pharmaceutical protectionist and granting excessive power to corporations under <em>the guise</em> of a free trade agreement (ie whether we were being misled) or whether it's all above board. There doesn't seem to be as much of an outcry post-release, so I'm guessing it's not as bad as many of the &quot;demonizers&quot; feared.</p>
<p>But in any case. Just because something's called a &quot;free trade agreement&quot; doesn't mean it shouldn't be scrutinized on the grounds that &quot;trade is good&quot;. Politicians are notorious for passing legislation and signing documents that are called one thing but the text actually is the opposite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I totally agree that the agreement should be scrutinized.  The whole secrecy behind this pact was ridiculous and of course it made it look bad.  Now that its out, we'll be seeing more info on it, I hope, but like the link I posted above, its encouraging that Vietnam has agreed to the worker provisions included in the pact.</p></div>		</li>
