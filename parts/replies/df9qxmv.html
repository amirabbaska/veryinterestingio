<p>Immodium, an over-the-counter diarrhea medicine is actually not much different from heroin or other strong opiates. The reason it doesn't get you high is because it can't cross the BBB</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypothetically speaking, you would probably need to go read up on organic chemistry, the college class of which is very polarized on the loved it/hated it meter.</p>
<p>For simplicity's sake, it's probably a small handful of chemical reactions with stuff easily attainable.</p>
<p>For safety's sake, you might blow up your room or release toxic and/or corrosive gas into it. IE you probably want to do this in a lab environment which get expensive if you can't borrow one.</p>
<p>For posterity's sake, you also might fuck up the reaction and make a toxic product hard to distinguish from the actual product and poison yourself.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>So... it can be kinda easy if you know what you're doing. But if you have to ask, you probably don't know what you're doing and it would be neither easy nor safe.</p>
<hr />
<p>EDIT: I forgot this was ELI5 --  You'd use processes from organic chemistry, many of which are simple to describe, but can be dangerous without the right equipment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Loperamide is actively transported out of the endothelial cells that make up the BBB by a drug efflux pump (P-gp). A much easier way to get loperamide across the BBB should you care to do so would be to take a P-gp inhibitor at the same time as loperamide. </p>
<p>This is the reasons the government listed it as Schedule II when it was first released in the mid-70s. The government de-scheduled it in 1982 when they realised that there were much <a href="http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/234/772/71e.jpg" target="_blank">less shitty</a> ways to get opioid highs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mm, the structure of loperamide, which is what Wikipedia tells me Imodium is, looks completely unrelated to morphine/heroin. It does definitely share some features of fentanyl though, so there's that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah sorry, I don't mean to devalue your comment, it's super interesting! I was also surprised to see that fentanyl looked nothing like morphine/heroin - I thought all opioids were pretty chemically similar.</p></div>		</li>
