<p>Physics models reality. Reality is not physics. If a model says there's some effect at high precisions you'll never get remotely close to, it's not correct to talk about those effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah exactly, I was just saying E=mc^2 because that's the form people tend to misunderstand. Obviously here it follows from the full equation as there's no momentum change, but it absolutely does not mean mass is somehow converted into some form of &quot;pure energy&quot; or whatever people seem to believe happens. It's an equivalence, not a conversion. </p></div>		</li>
