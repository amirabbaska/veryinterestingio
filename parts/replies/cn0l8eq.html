			<p>&gt; Computers are replacing people, and taking their jobs.<br><br>I'm a programmer.<br><br>What I've seen is computer aren't smart enough to take over skill labor in general.<br><br>What it does is take over brain dead job and free up the work force to do more productive things. We can't even get car to drive itself yet and it's still hard.<br><br>And in general computer open up new jobs than the jobs the computer have replaced. It's just the population are unwilling to move toward newer or even learn new skills.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm totally with you on the fact that had we more tech savvy people, we could be advancing faster. My guess at the issue is, our education system hasn't come close to advancing at the same rate as our technology the past twenty some years. Also, the generations that didn't grow up with it were slow to catch up and unlikely to get educated in it to the point of keeping up with the younger generation that did grow up with it.<br><br>I think what we need are more leaders in tech, actually. Unfortunately a lot of would-be leaders are getting bought out early and many really cool projects get wrecked, mishandled, or slowed to a snails pace.<br><br> </p>		</li>

			<p>You are making wonderful points regarding the boomers living longer with a decent retirement/cushion (yes that is generalizing but I would say it is common), and about mechanical / computerized technology. <br><br>But I want to say that the boomers are starting to die off. The oldest ones (think Joan Rivers, 81. Lauren Bacall, 89) They're in their 80s, that group/age is starting to leave. So, as they go, aren't we earning jobs/spaces where they used to sit? Plus, we younger people are going to need to stay longer in their jobs they left (IMO) because we don't have the knowledge/experience that they did. It's not overnight, maybe 15 years to finally have all the seats and us wise people should have a good shot at those seats as they open up. (Sorry if I sound like an ass, but I'm being pragmatic.) Yes we will go against a rising technology wave, but if we keep our eyes on it/ hands in it, we have a better chance.<br><br>Pretty soon, our generation (I was born in 70s) and Millennials will have more access to jobs that pay better than we have.  </p>		</li>

			<p>I'm with you. I could have left out &quot;the future looks bleak.&quot; That's too pessimistic. It's unlikely to be simple or easy, but I do believe the upcoming generations can and will make the best of our situation. <br><br>And you are right about the boomers aging out of the workforce. I'm looking forward to the future, whatever it brings, it will be interesting!</p>		</li>

			<p>Computers are replacing jobs that humans used to do, or in the least mechanization is decreasing the amount of humans doing certain jobs.<br><br>Of course, we all want to be the higher ups in big companies and be doing what our culture considers to be &quot;quality&quot; jobs. However, we can't all be managers, CEOs, and so on, it's simply impossible. <br><br>What the US should be an example of is subjective. But wouldn't it be awesome if, instead of worshiping only the higher-ups that make the big bucks, we appreciated everyone, and decided that even Joe-bag-o-donuts deserved to live a pretty comfortable life, instead of struggling by? His kids having to take on massive debt just to have a small chance of moving up the social ladder is not likely what our fore-fathers has in mind.<br><br>The sooner we realize our economy is fueled by the middle and lower classes, and pay them adequately to fuel a constantly moving economy the better off we'll be, in my estimation. But what do I know, I'm just a guy on reddit.</p>		</li>

			<p>Absolutely. It was great to grow up and be told &quot;hey lil guy, you can be whatever you want when you grow up!&quot;<br><br>The reality is, most of us can't be whatever we want for a multitude of reasons.<br><br>It's not as &quot;sexy&quot; sounding, but, &quot;hey kid, if you work hard and think critically about the world around you, you just might go places.&quot; <br><br>I do believe we're getting better at this, but it might take a generation or so for us to be great at it, and even longer to see the results.</p>		</li>

			<p>I hope you enjoy some gold. This is unequivocally the truest answer to OP.<br> <br>&gt; Our older generations are retiring more comfortably than any generation before them, with more of the money and longer lives, causing somewhat of a burden on our social security system.<br><br>This adds up to a lot nowadays; you're right, they get it for free. 25% of boomers have <em>nothing</em> saved for retirement, but count on aid for medical bills, plus a marginal amount for Social Security. Whether you think 25% is low or high depends on your age, I've found (anecdotally).<br> <br>&gt; There are more old people hanging around in the job market, and more and more young people pouring into the market. This can drive down pay because there isn't a shortage of people looking for many of these better jobs.<br><br>This occurs with high-skill jobs as well. Engineers younger than 30 <em>will</em> make more money faking their way in the service industry as sommeliers to rich boomers than in any field save petroleum. This wouldn't happen if useless Social Security-collecting septuagenarian engineers would fucking retire already. </p>		</li>
