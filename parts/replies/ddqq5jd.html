			<div class="markdown"><p>When we talk about a uniformly accelerated observer, we mean that the constant acceleration is measured in the momentary rest frame of the accelerating observer. So the guy on the rocket always feels a constant acceleration. We call that the proper acceleration of the rocket.</p>
<p>But a fixed inertial observer back on Earth does not observe a constant acceleration. Indeed, the inertial observer sees the rocket's acceleration strictly decrease as a function of time.</p></div>		</li>
