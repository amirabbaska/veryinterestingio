			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted those same companies use plenty of automated processes and machinery.  The powertrain and chassis may be assembled by hand but they aren't carving out pistons by hand (if done with care they can assemble powertrain and chassis with as high a quality).  Most of the true handmade stuff is body and interior.  In that area most of the issue with parts are fit and finish.  When done by hand they can easily meet and almost always exceed automated parts.  They rework parts until gaps are uniform and flush, the paint is impeccable, and everything is perfect.  You simply won't find that kind of perfection with cheaper cars unless you get really lucky (of course most people don't care if their hood gap is 1mm overflush).  To be fair it's way better than it was 20-30 years ago but doing that work by hand can turn a good looking car into perfection.  In fact when we wanted to use a car for a show car we sure as hell didn't grab one off the end of the assembly line and ship it to a car show.  We reworked the shit out of it by hand until it was perfect.</p>
<p>With that said doing work by hand can make trouble shooting really tough and will cause random issues that may never get fixed, and the people working for you cannot be someone you just grab off the street.  They have to be highly paid and highly skilled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're much more correct than the comment above. There's nothing low-tech about manufacturing a Rolls Royce, they just forgo cheap efficiency for meticulous assembly and detail work: Interior leather and wood hand-chosen for perfectly matching color and grain, skilled sewing machine operators and wood finishers doing custom requests, expert pinstriping and paint work, and as you mentioned, the willingness to fix it or do it over if it's not perfect.</p>
<p>Toyotas might be more reliable in the long run, but that's due to decades of refined engineering and process improvement. Not because Rolls techs are building a car with a hammer and chisel. </p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/02/12/toyota-leads-all-automakers-in-us-recalls" target="_blank">Toyota led all automakers in US recalls in 2014</a>. In the same year, Rolls Royce recalled <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/11987568/Rolls-Royce-announces-recall-for-one-car.html" target="_blank">one single car</a>. So there's that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for Toyota and I can tell you for a fact that the Toyoda family (they changed the spelling because they thought it was easier to pronounce) never wants to sit and testify in front of congress again. Having the most recalls in no way correlates to shitty quality. I argue it's the opposite. They will recall and spend the money if they <em>think</em> there could be an issue. They're not perfect but they don't fuck around with any human cost vs manufacturing savings. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the fortunate opportunity to tour the Aston Martin factory recently. The quality assurance processes were  just insane. The stitching on the seats alone must have been checked at least three times before the car was signed off for delivery. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely this. </p>
<p>High end cars still have computer controlled machining of parts, laser welding, and stuff like that just as cheap mass produced cars do. The difference comes in the fit and finish, the quality of the materials used (you don't get plastic trim in a Rolls-Royce), and the luxury features fitted. </p>
<p>There are also so many bespoke features in a Rolls-Royce. It is apparently very rare for any two cars to be identical, and automation is impossible to economically adapt for all those changes. </p>
<p>Recently Mercedes-Benz have decreased the amount of automation involved in building the S-Class due to the inability of the robots to actually adapt to all the customisation options they offer on the car. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you mentioned, there are certain things, such as leather and woodwork where the subtle details of craftsmanship and human skill and care are evident, and it just means more than something done robotically. It's personal, and unique, and for rich people who can buy anything, and who hang out with people who can buy anything, buying something that can't be exactly replicated is all the more special. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's certainly not the entire cost difference between a Bentley and a Buick, but I would say the finishing and the materials are a big part. Top grain leather from Italy, exotic dashboard woods from Brazil and Africa, carbon fiber bodies, your typical car doesn't deal in these materials, and they definitely don't have experienced craftsman refining them like fine furniture. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Robots, like humans, have a sliding scale of competence and reliability. It's just that the better you go on those scales the higher the cost goes, and it's not linear.</p>
<p>There are plenty of circumstances where you need robots with error rates in the one in a million - on extremely high volume with high cost per failure it's worth shelling out 1000x the cost on robots to decrease your failures.</p>
<p>If you're making cheap semi-disposable consumer goods where the cost per failure is measured in cents then it's cheaper, easier, and faster to throw bad product away than it is to ensure that only good product comes off the line.</p></div>		</li>
