			<div class="markdown"><p>damn didn't even notice the decimal. Reminds me of this one time at work. I used to work for a company that did coding for bank transactions. What people didnt know was that the banks would do transactions to the thousandths decimal place with cash. So i wrote a little code that would take these thousandths of pennies and deposit it into an account. No one person is going to notice that little amount of money missing. I mean its less than a penny. But I figured if i did it long enough and after enough transactions i would be well off. Well unfortunately for me, i miss placed a decimal and instead of taking thousandths of a penny, i took the entire change of all transactions. After about a day I realized my mistake and wrote of out all the earnings. I placed the check in my bosses office because i didnt want to get in trouble and did not want anything leading back to me. Then the building somehow burnt down and that check is probably gone. </p></div>		</li>
