			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. There are lots of living cells in bones and ligaments, but many of them don't do much in the way of division once you're an adult. </p>
<p>Leukaemias and lymphomas are kind of bone cancers though- they're due to those changes effecting the source of the blood cells, namely the bone marrow. </p>
<p>What's more common for cancers in bone is when a different type of cancer spreads (metastasises) into the bone. Bone is quite a common place for cancers to spread to, and has pretty poor outcomes (like any metastasis).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bone marrow cancer or multiple myeloma is the reverse. It's a form of blood cancer. It starts there in the bone  and metastasises to other places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, orthopaedic surgeon here.</p>
<p>Yes, any tissue in the body can turn cancerous.  Muscles, bones, arteries, cartilage, connective tissue all can turn into cancer which is called a sarcoma.</p>
<p>Bones, tendons, etc all have viable cells in them.</p>
<p>Sarcomas are quite rare- only about 7-8,000 occur each year in the USA, as compared to 500,000 carcinomas( cancer of the glandular tissues- breast, prostate, lung, colon thyroid, kidney, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is however a fun little non-cancerous condition called heterotopic ossification. It literally means bone growth in unusual and undesired locations. </p>
<p>For reasons that are still somewhat mysterious, after a serious bone trauma (like hip replacement, amputation, or some impact injuries), some people experience spontaneous bone growth within the surrounding muscle tissue that look like hard, irregular little bony tumors. It's uncommon but painful and can mess with healing, with prosthetic fitting, and with mobility. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be a dumb question, but based off of your explanation about cell multiplication and how muscle cells duplicate far less frequently; would somebody like a bodybuilder in theory be more susceptible to muscular cell errors since they are constantly building a lot of muscle and losing weight for competitions and then building muscle again? </p></div>		</li>

<p>you tend not to cannibalize muscle quickly or easily, and most of the weight loss is in water (body builders take diuretics for this purpose), leaving the cells intact, but deflated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No such thing as a dumb question!</p>
<p>They're not particularly, at least not due to the muscle mass. When you train a muscle and it grows you don't actually generate new cells, you increase the size of the existing ones. Same goes for fat (to a point). However, anyone eating large amounts of food, be they a bodybuilder, a very active person, a tall person, or just an obese person, has increased risks of various cancers as there is more cellular activity in various places, for example an increase in the turnover of the lining of the bowels. You also get exposed to more carcinogens in foods, although I'd expect bodybuilders tend to have less issues there than obese people as they tend to eat quite well to keep low bodyfat etc. Overall more cells=more chances to go wrong, although it's relatively minor as far as risk factors go, and for many people it's completely unchangeable (you're not going to stop the 6'5 man from being that tall!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does the body not keep a 'master' copy? </p>
<p>Basically a cell or set of cells that never reproduces, but is just used as a master copy for some part of the immune system to compare new cell DNA against?</p>
<p>... I know this glosses over the enormous complexity of everything related to cell production &amp; how immune systems function, but I'm still curious if anything like this exists in nature</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You kind of already have it- the massive complexity of everything. </p>
<p>There is kind of error correction already. DNA can only go together in certain ways, and there is error correction machinery to make sure that happens. When it goes wrong, the cell should either die or mark itself for destruction. Cancers occur when this machinery is broken too. </p>
<p>There isn't a mechanism for checking against a 'true' code. And at any rate, that one master copy might actually be damaged anyway, as that cell had to come from somewhere to begin with- it could have been damaged in the very first division after fertilisation. </p>
<p>The main reason is that there simply isn't an evolutionary pressure for more accurate error checking. Animals have lived long enough to reproduce without it for the last few billion years quite happily, and if you make it to the reproduction stage the evolutionary pressure kind of disappears once your offspring are capable of fending for themselves. For humans this is really about the mid 30s to early 40s, and is why genetic diseases like Huntington's haven't been bred out. </p>
<p>Most cancers occur either in childhood (and are typically new mutations) or once someone is much older. Cancer rates are increasing, and this is a good thing because it means people are living longer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is kind of a master copy of our DNA, which we use to pass on to our offspring. In a developing embryo, the cells that will go on to form the ovary/testes split off very early from the cells that form the rest of the body. These cells don't reproduce much, so copying errors are minimized in the resulting sperm or ova. Unfortunately for us getting cancer, there isn't any mechanism in the body to compare the DNA in one cell with a remotely located master reference. It's difficult to imagine a workable mechanism for how to do it, and any checking process would itself have occasional errors too. </p>
<p>Another problem: DNA errors can occur in non-reproducing cells, for example direct damage to DNA from x-rays or other radiation, so any 'master copy' isn't going to be 100% error-free.</p>
<p>In any case, a total absence of DNA errors is not desirable from an evolutionary view. Evolution relies on DNA errors.</p></div>		</li>
