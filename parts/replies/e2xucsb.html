			<div class="markdown"><p>Aluminum pans are cheap which is why they're typically found in food service kitchens. They are however garbo. They corrode rather quickly and they're also terrible at heat retention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before anyone says otherwise, the stuff about aluminum causing alzheimer's is a myth. See Myth 4 <a href="https://alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers/myths" target="_blank">here</a> from the Alzheimer's Association.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/09/29/could-exposure-to-aluminum-cause-alzheimers-disease/#53b0f8ce4a3b" target="_blank">Here's</a> a more detailed Forbes article that looks like it's going to say 'yes' but ultimately says there's no evidence. As it mentions, elevated levels of aluminum in alzheimer's sufferers might be due to the tangles in their brains actually <em>collecting</em> aluminum rather than aluminum as a cause.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the stains are made of oxidized iron(rust), the aluminium will reduce the rust back to steel. It works like a [galvanic anode]( <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_anode" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_anode</a>). In that process there will be no aluminium deposited on the steel.</p>
<p>Edit: This does not seem to be the case here though. How is the reaction so fast here? Usually galvanic corrosion takes place over years and decades.</p></div>		</li>
