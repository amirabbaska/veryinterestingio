			<div class="markdown"><p>You've got a decent grasp on it. You're right.</p>
<p>I have to say though, &quot;species&quot; in biology is a bit...odd these days. Many times two species can communicate and mate with each other, and produce viable offspring, but they are called different species because they don't <em>tend</em> to do this.</p>
<p>Always be a bit suspicious when you hear people calling things a different species. In reality, if we applied their same logic to humans, you'd have several different human species. The number of species that actually exist is lower than the claimed one. Why this is, is perhaps one part useful, but also I suspect because you get more research money if you say you found a new species, rather than just a new breed of an old one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Species is an accepted concept within biology. Absolute reproductive isolation hasn't been considered a key part of what makes something a species since the 1800s. Modern biologists often use the Biological Species Concept and measures of relative genetic diversity to define species. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea but why? We have terms like sub-species and breeds if we wanted to role that way. Why redefine old words when we have ones for those concepts already?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's rather annoying. I grew up being taught that species is defined by the ability to produce viable offspring. Once two organisms cannot, they are not the same species.</p>
<p>However, recent categories go by other ideas, such as times in which members mate. Two populations of flies may be able to mate, but because they wake up from hibernation at different times, they rarely do. Thus they are categorized as different species.</p>
<p>This irks me a bit, because there will always be members of both population that, for whatever reason, occasionally wake up in the other population's mating time. And it is unlikely the two populations will ever be incompatible with each other for this reason, as slight genetic sharing will always occur. It won't be until they are physically separated by, perhaps, a mountain, that they drift genetically into two separate species.</p>
<p>A great example of this is the American and Eurasian beaver. They were eventually separated geologically, and now have different numbers of chromosomes, so they are two different species. But Dolphins can still mate with some species of whales. Not only that, but these hybrids can also produce offspring as well. So why should I categorize them as different species, when it seems clear they're just different breeds of the same organism, a la what humans have done with dogs? Like dogs, they can communicate, they cooperate, they mate, and they produce viable offspring. That's breeds in my book, not species.</p>
<p>Some people are actually beginning to take notice of this in terms of how we categorize hominids. You may have heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiregional_origin_of_modern_humans" target="_blank">Multi regional origin theory</a>, to counter the out of africa idea. Or contrary to this, attempts to categorize neanderthals as just a different race of humans, due to their skeletal structure being rather similar to more early types of humans, <a href="http://forum.bodybuilding.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=642061&amp;d=1179358381" target="_blank">still observed in Australia.</a> (Those two come from the same species, yet the skull on the left looks rather neanderthal-like) <a href="http://public.media.smithsonianmag.com/legacy_blog/skulls.jpg" target="_blank">(Comparison to a human vs Neanderthal skull)</a></p>
<p>You might see that the Australian's skull looks more like Neanderthal skull than a &quot;human&quot; one.</p>
<p>Personally, I've become rather convinced that Neanderthals are probably just an archaic breed of humans. This whole idea of a multi-region origin theory sounds like a desperate attempt to re-hash old racist arguments to justify eugenics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you read the article it says that Bottlenose Dolphins and Guiana Dolphins are distantly related. They are most definitely two separate species and the issue you bring up is wholly irrelevant to the case.</p></div>		</li>
