			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I have understood was the key reason. The dialation of the blood vessels by nitric oxide speeds recovery from being winded. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Concur nitric oxide should be near or at the top or at least included with the top reply. I mean, the scientists only won a friggin Nobel peace prize for this discovery. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be higher. The whole &quot;speed of breathing&quot; response is definitely a good secondary reason for 'in through nose, out through mouth,' but the primary reason is neurological as you've described. The only thing I'd add is that you don't need to be breathing slowly for those neurological effects you described to take place, which is why this is still effective when you're playing sports and breathing heavily and quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It is part of the feeling elicited by the breathing during laughter, as well. I should have answered when I had more time to re-read what I'd typed. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
