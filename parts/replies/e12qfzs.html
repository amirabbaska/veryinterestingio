			<div class="markdown"><p>And to add to that, the kind of crystal structure usually itself depends on the temperature and/or heat treatment. You can have the same alloying of iron and carbon at the same temperature, but with one sample being pearlite and the other being martensite, you end up with wildly different thermal expansion properties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thought process no. However, ice at different temperatures and pressures will certainly have different densities. But in general, if you know volume and mass in state 1 and density in state 2 you can determine the volume in state 2 with the simple equation above. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Units like 1 atm should be avoided and the SI units only used since these units are the modern standards and supported.  In the case of the atmosphere per Wikipedia:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit</a>)</p>
<p>The standard atmosphere is defined to be 101.325 kPa.  But in 1982, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recommended that for the purposes of specifying the physical properties of substances, “standard pressure” should be precisely 100 kPa.</p>
<p>Here you have two definitions, close but enough of a difference that can result in errors and confusion.  No errors or confusion will result when strict use of SI units is adhered to. </p></div>		</li>

<p>i.e. a cubic centimetre of water contains 1 gram but a cubic centimetre of ice (the same volume) weighs less at 0.93 grams.</p>

<p>To be technically correct, 1 cm^3 of ice will have a mass of 0.93 g, not weigh.  It's weight will be dependent on its location from the local acceleration due to gravity (g).  Assuming an approximate value of g equal to 10 m/s^2, the weight of the ice expressed in newtons (N) will be 0.00093 kg x 10 m/s^2 = 0.0093 N or 9.3 mN. </p></div>		</li>
