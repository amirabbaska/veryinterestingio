<p>The saying &quot;We don't rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training&quot; is extremely true. This is why the military puts so much focus into being able to complete a task under extreme duress and lack of sleep. So you know how to clear a weapons malfunction and return fire, even when you forget to hold pooh in.</p>
<p>To further prove the example, a police department was conducting a study of After Action Reports for incidents where they were forced to use their weapon. They found in most cases the officers had collected their brass casings and put them in their pockets. Even officers who were killed in a firefight had brass in their pockets. Why would they stop to pick up their brass? Well it turns out in range training, officers were being instructed to pick up their brass to keep the range clean after every iteration, so when shit hit the fan, they reverted back to the most basic things they were taught. Obviously that department made some changes.</p>
<p>This is why its so important to practice how you play!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard the same thing. Apparently it has to do with how in training they hand the weapon back to get ready for the next drill</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure what country you served for, but when I was in the British army I was taught the same thing but to exhale hard once the mask was on, to push out any atmosphere basically forcing a vacuum in the mask before.</p>
<p>NBC training was silly, forcing us to remove the mask in a gas chamber filled with CS gas just to prove to use it worked. Fuck that day and fuck all people what use chemical warfare!</p>
<p>edit, we also use the &quot;gas gas gas&quot; saying to, think it might be a UN thing</p></div>		</li>

Yeah those were my exact thoughts during that training. I was thinking, however came up with chemical warfare is a sick motherf*cker. For whatever reason Im fairly certain my group got a healthier dose than the rest....And that was a mild one? WTF are the terrible ones like?</p>

<p>They do stuff like cause every voluntary muscle in your body to contract at maximum strength until you die from being unable to breathe.</p>
<p>Chemical warfare is some horrific stuff.</p></div>		</li>
