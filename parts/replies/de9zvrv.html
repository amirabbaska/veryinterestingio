			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but that's because of the rules surrounding the loan, <em>not</em> because of the fact that the loan is going to a college education.</p>
<p>The government could choose to offer loans for small businesses with the same rules about payback, they are the ones making the laws after all.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also the correct answer.</p>
<p>If business loans couldn't be forgiven through bankruptcy, you'd see a lot more banks offering unsecured business loans to young people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it's a fucking scam. Once you default on your student loans, the government pays the lender. So the lender just made a buckton of money without doing anything.  Then the government sends an agency out to collect the money that you still owe, which is also about to make some money.  All because little 18 year old Johnny snowflake wanted to pay $20k a year to broaden his horizons getting a degree in French literature and didn't think about whether or not he'd be able to repay the loan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that student loans cannot be discharged through bankruptcy. You're making the point, but skirting around the central issue: the govt will help you get student loans over other loans because you HAVE to pay those ones back, so there's less risk for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd argue that most small businesses are not run (nor do they need to be) by people who went to school for business. Lots of business students end up in corporate jobs, but they rarely create their own businesses. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is absolutely true. However, a basic college education in whatever field still gives you entry level courses in what I described which can only help you be a successful small business owner and not have to pay other people to do all the backend stuff when the company consists of only a few employees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is you can't really get a business loan if you don't have some sort or degree in business. So my MA in history doesn't matter if i want to set up a consulting business. I'd have to have someone who has a business background to help me get a business loan. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is why most small businesses fail. Because the people who start them may be passionate, but they know nothing of pricing, marketing, taxes, finances, hiring/firing, labour laws, industry specific laws &amp; regulations, etc. And most can't afford or don't want to spend money on people who do. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Got home.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/Issue%20Brief%202,%20Business%20Owner%20Demographics.pdf" target="_blank">Here is a start</a> Looks like about .282 have Highschool or less, .328 have some college, .39 have a Bachelors or higher</p>
<p>If you keep hunting, I bet you could find out what types of degrees are held, and filter out all existing businesses and just look at new businesses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the political, social, legal, and financial nuances that come together to create any Federal policy, much less the policy of Federal student loans that serve to support the large and mindbogglingly complex academic institution of research and higher education in America, is worth discussing rigorously rather than dismissing offhand because it makes your little pin of a head sore.</p></div>		</li>
