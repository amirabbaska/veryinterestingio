			<div class="markdown"><p>This was awesome, and really helpful! I like how you explained this, so I have a question. </p>
<p>So basically, if I have a neutron, and I bombarded an Uranium isotope with it, that would cause other neutrons to &quot;escape&quot;(?) and then bombard more surrounding Uranium isotopes (rinse and repeat) . The &quot;escape/release&quot; of these neutrons is where the energy comes from (the nucleon &quot;glue&quot; as others have called it) </p>
<p>Someone above mentioned that the entirety of the first bomb dropped on Japan did not use <em>all</em> of the Uranium. What stops the reaction? And honestly, what starts the reaction? Is it the literal &quot;dropping&quot; of the bomb that causes a neutron to go &quot;oh shiet, time to roll out!&quot; ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I can answer your questions. Your basic understanding is correct.</p>
<p>For the chain reaction to happen, where neutrons from one fission reaction hit other fissile atoms, the atoms must be closely packed together. Bombs have a habit of taking things that are close together and making them far apart, that's what stops the reaction. The bomb blows itself apart and scatters the nuclear material, removing the required conditions for the chain reaction to take place.</p>
<p>As for what starts it, it's pretty much just having enough nuclear material in one place. Nuclear material is constantly decaying and giving off energy, a uranium rod would actually be warm to the touch, so if you cram enough of it into one place it will explode. This is called the critical mass. The challenge is keeping it below this critical mass until you want it to explode.</p>
<p>In WW2 this was achieved in two ways. The fat man had a plutonium core just below critical mass surrounded by high explosives on all sides. When these explosives where detonated it compressed the core, causing a nuclear explosion. The Little boy used two sub-critical masses of uranium and used high explosives to shoot one into the other, again triggering a nuclear explosion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost! Imagine that you bombard uranium with a neutron as if you shot jelly with a sling-shot. It will make the jelly &quot;wobble&quot;. You can imagine the neutron &quot;exciting&quot; the uranium similarly (ELI5 sense). If the excitation energy is &quot;the right one&quot;, that causes the jelly to split into 2 larger pieces, and a few &quot;crumbs&quot;, which are the excess neutrons. These excess neutrons then go on and split further atoms. If on average more than 1 neutron per fission does that, the chain reaction accelerates. You need an excitation, because before the uranium splits, its surface area has to grow (try to break a ball of jelly into two), which requires energy (see above).</p>
<p>The energy comes out as</p>
<ul>
<li>Kinetic energy (velocity) of the new pieces, which heats the surroundings</li>
<li>Kinetic energy of any other massive particles (e.g. the neutrons) being released</li>
<li>Any excess energy radiated away as massless gamma photons.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a fission bomb you need a <em>critical mass</em>, because the number of atoms that split and emit neutrons increases with volume (a <em> a </em> a) while the losses occur through the surface (~ a * a) so if you increase the size the losses get smaller compared to neutron generation. Think of it this way: a large iron ball will take longer to cool down than a small one. You need a specific size, composition, and geometry for the chain reaction to happen.</p>
<p>Not all uranium will undergo fission, simply because the temperature goes up so high so quickly (faster than a nanosecond) that the necessary conditions for the chain reaction are no longer met. The bomb material evaporates (the necessary geometry is lost) before most material could undergo fission. Making a bomb with a high yield is not as simple as just adding more mass.</p>
<p>In the simplest uranium designs (Hiroshima), you have roughly half of the critical mass as say two hemispheres (doesn't have to be equal size pieces though). Once you trigger the bomb, a specially designed regular explosive pushes the two pieces together. Sometimes you might have a neutron source in the middle to help start the reaction. If you blow up the bomb externally (e.g. the bomber crashes or you shoot down the ICBM) this geometry is again lost and the bomb will not go off.</p>
<p>In simple plutonium designs (Trinity, Nagasaki, etc) you have a hollow sphere of plutonium, which then imploded by an outer layer of carefully designed explosives. It is necessary, because plutonium has a small amount of spontaneous neutron emission, which would trigger the bomb before the critical mass is met and would lead to a premature and weak &quot;poof&quot;. This design is much harder to do, that is why it was tested in the Trinity, before going live in Nagasaki. The uranium design is &quot;easier&quot;, BUT it is harder to produce weapons-grade uranium than weapons grade plutonium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this great explanation !</p>
<p>You mentioned nuclear reactors, what is their problem regarding their wastes? Doesn't all the uranium disappear after the reaction ? What are those wastes we hear so much about ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all uranium disappears, quite the contrary. After the U-235 enrichment drops below a critical level you no longer have critical mass and the fuel has to be replaced (actual numbers depend on design). Majority of the fuel (95-97-99%) is U-238, but you mostly split the U-235.</p>
<p>While the reactor works,Two important things happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not all uranium splits. Some just absorb neutrons, and by doing so, the created nucleon has a less favorable neutron number for its protons, therefore it is gonna become radioactive. Neutron irradiation can turn stable elements into radioactive ones.</li>
<li>In Uranium the neutron:proton ratio is ~5:2, or 2.55-2.6.  In the most stable isotopes (e.g. Iron-56) this ratio is ~2.1. So when uranium splits in two, you have a disproportionate number of neutrons for the lower number of protons. Therefore these fission products will have a large neutron excess, and so they will be radioactive as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>Natural uranium is is not really radioactive. You could move around the fresh fuel with bare hands. But due to neutron irradiation and fission, the created isotopes are more radioactive. This is the waste that has to be dealt with. It is comparatively little in terms of total mass, especially if you consider the bazillion tons of pollution we pump in the air, sea and soil everywhere else in industry. But it is highly toxic (in part because it is so concentrated), so care is needed.</p>
<p>I think it is good to have high standards for nuclear waste and industry, but I am very sad we don't apply the same level of rigor in every other industry. Sure you heard about Fukushima, right? Thousands had to be relocated, but thankfully nobody died. Now, have you heard of the Banqiao Dam disaster? It lead to ~170 000 deaths and 11 million relocations. Yet nobody considers hydro power dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I understand better, thank you very much !</p>
<p>And what's the proper way to dispose of these ? Just sealing them in concrete ?</p></div>		</li>
