			<div class="markdown"><p>The only currently known way to completely transform mass into energy is by annihiliting matter and anti-matter. This is very difficult to do, because (at least in our known surroundings) there is no anti matter. It would be theoretically possible for entire different galaxies to be made of anti-matter, but many scientists argue that the likelyhood for this is too small to be considered, we know for sure that our galaxy is pretty much just &quot;normal&quot; matter.</p>
<p>Anti-Matter is present on the earth, it gts created by photons from the sun hitting the upper athmosphere, however that anti-matter instantly reacts with the surrouding air to nothing, and it is unlikely that we will ever be able to &quot;farm&quot; it. </p>
<p>We are able to create anti-matter in accelerators such as CERN, but it would take literally trillions of years to produce even a single gram of it, so not really an option, either. </p>
<p>It would defenetly create an explosion, because the energy-density at whatever spot would be too high, however it is possible, as with any other explosion, to stop this from happening by simply finding a way to get the energy away from that location and spread out quickly enough... it is unlikely that we will ever find such a method that would work for anti matter.</p>
<p>Based on Einstein E=m*c^2, so Energy equals Mass times the speed of light, if we divide by the speed of light squared, then we have: Mass is equal to energy times 3 times ten to the power of 16 (9 times 10^16 is c^2, we just use it as a factor here, the actual speed part cancels out with the units). so 1kg of mass (half of it matter, the other half anti-matter) translates to 90.000.000.000.000.000 Jules of Energy. It does not matter how that Mass is composed, it can be a killogram of helium, or a killogram of iron. However, note that a single iron atom is of course heavier than a single helium atom, because a iron atom is larger (has more protons and neutrons). But in the end a killogram of iron weights the same a a killogram of paper.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  I knew that antimatter is created in modern particle accelerators, but I didn't know the rate of creation was so slow.  </p>
<p>If we put our heads together, would it be possible with current technology to somehow create antimatter &quot;pellets&quot; and keep them magnetically contained for use (let's say, in spacecraft) as a fuel source in some kind of timescale that is even remotely human?  Like, we turn to antiproton creation as a goal in itself?</p>
<p>Obviously this would require a huge amount of energy input, so it's not really getting any &quot;advantage&quot; in terms of the pure energy calculus - I'm just thinking more about the antimatter fuel pellet(s) being extremely low mass and easy to move.  (Well, relatively - you'd need the containment system of course, but I'm thinking relative to huge multi-ton chemical rockets...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is nothing physically preventing us from creating large amounts of antimatter.  It's a matter of funding the engineering to  produce it in bulk.  In 1945 it would have taken all the computing power in the world a trillion years to do what your cell phone does in seconds.  You need to find someone with deep pockets that has a need for the first few grams of antimatter to fund the necessary engineering r&amp;d and then continue scaling until you get full bulk production.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One major problem is keeping any amount of antimatter contained. Right now we can keep a small number of antiprotons contained with electromagnetism, but they push each other apart when there are enough of them. If the antimatter was magnetically neutral it wouldn't push itself apart, but then it would be unaffected by magnetic fields.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear power and weapons work because they are transforming mass into energy.</p>
<p>It's not complete annihilation, as in an anti-matter collision, but rather a fractional change per sub atomic particle. Nuclei of very small atoms and very large atoms are relatively heavy, compared to the expected value based on protons and neutrons (tritium has 1 proton and 2 neutrons, but weighs 3.016, carbon-12 has 6 each and weighs 12.00, plutonium 239 has 94 protons, 145 neutrons, but weighs 239.056). Consequently, the process of transforming light nuclei to heavier ones, or heavy nuclei to lighter ones, releases energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's the right track. The important thing missing above is protons and neutrons have about the same mass. </p>
<p>A naked proton has a mass of  1.0072766 a.m.u., and a naked neutron has a mass of 1.0086654 a.m.u. Using those weights carbon 12 should weigh about 12.1.  Instead, it weighs 12.00. That's because the process of arranging sub atomic particles into nuclei releases energy, and the source of that energy is a change in the mass of the particle. Thus if you take 6 deuterium (one proton and one neutron, mass 2.014) and smash them together to form carbon 12, you will be transforming that 0.1 amu into energy. </p>
<p>On the heavier end of the scale, with plutonium, it has less mass than all of the particles would have if separated, but more mass than if they were arranged into something of moderate atomic mass like carbon or iron. Treating neutrons and protons as the same weight, you can see in carbon 12 the weight for each is 1 and in pu-239 the weight for each is about 1.002. Thus if you could pull a carbon nucleus out of plutonium about 0.024 amu would be converted to energy. </p>
<p>This amount is smaller than the deuterium case (per particle) which demonstrates in part why nuclear fusion gives off more energy than nuclear fission.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual weight of the atoms are heavier than the sum of their protons and neutrons. This extra mass is what's converted into energy through e=mc^2. If I remember correctly, this extra mass is proportionally higher for the small atoms like hydrogen-helium, compared to the change in mass for fissile atoms, leading to fusion generating vastly more energy per mass than fission. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, the mass of neutrons and protons in their uncombined state is higher than when in the atomic nucleus because of the energy put in to get them there. There is no corresponding change in the matter per se, it's just that the energy that was required to be put in is so significant that we can actually measure it when we put them on a scale, so to speak. </p>
<p>Is this correct?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mass and energy are the same thing. That's what E=mc^2 means. Nothing you said is exactly wrong, but it sounds like you are trying to make a distinction when there isn't one. </p>
<p>It may be helpful to consider the reverse process and that those protons and neutrons are heavier because they haven't lost that mass as energy yet. Most of the universe is hydrogen, and the atomic mass unit is relative to carbon 12 which is a weird point to define it. We could instead define it relative to the hydrogen nucleus, in which case everything else would be relatively lighter because of the lost energy/mass of binding. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say &quot;matter&quot; I'm going to assume you mean stuff that has mass, and not just the elementary particles that make everything up, as most of your mass doesn't come from elementary particles but from bonded energy^<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztc6QPNUqls" target="_blank">[1]</a>  . You can convert mass into energy for example by burning something, like wood. The ashes and carbon dioxide will have less mass than the wood and oxygen had. In fact, every reaction that releases energy will lower the mass of the system. This encapsulates in Einstein's famous formula E=mc^2 . The question &quot;Will it explode&quot; depends on how much mass is converted to energy. For wood, the mass to energy ratio is 1.5970189*10^-10 ^<a href="https://www.decodedscience.org/is-there-a-connection-between-a-burning-log-and-emc2/22390" target="_blank">[2]</a> . For uranium, it's about 0.00089701847^<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density" target="_blank">[3]</a> , and for antimatter+matter, it's 1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To add to the question - does the number of protons an atom have affect the conversion to pure energy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you try to annihilate an iron atom and and an hydrogen anti-atom, only one proton and electron will annihilate, as the hydrogen anti-atom has only one anti-proton and one positron (anti-electron). Of course with mutiple anti-hydrogen-atoms ^(*anti-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium" target="_blank">deuterium</a> ^to ^be ^precise) ,you would be able to annihilate the entire iron atom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what would it take to convert iron to pure energy compared to helium?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to convert iron to pure energy in a way that the iron would disappear, and all of it's mass would convert to energy, you're out of luck.  There are some laws like baryon number conservation that prohibit annihilating matter particles without the corresponding anti-particles <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/100955/is-there-any-way-to-annihilate-matter-without-the-use-of-anti-matter" target="_blank">^[4]</a>, and the only way to create antimatter is to make regular matter at the same time. The best thing we have, is hydrogen to helium fusion, which converts 0.00427257621% of the mass to energy^<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density" target="_blank">[3]</a> .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for being the only poster in the thread to mention baryon number conservation. That's the most important part to the core of OP's question, since that explains why we don't see proton decay, and why we do see stable nuclei. I would love to post a top-level comment clearing up some of the bullshit in this thread, but I'm not a nuclear physicist and not going to claim to be an expert.</p>
<p>People should be able to tell that the top-level answers in this thread are made up of mostly bullshit. Physicists may not completely understand matter-antimatter asymmetry, baryon # conservation, lepton # conservation, etc. But they understand a pretty damn good amount of it.
