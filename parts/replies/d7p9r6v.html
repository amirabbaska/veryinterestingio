			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;ceramic&quot; here is the oxide of whatever the metal is. For iron it's rust, for copper it's copper oxide, and for aluminium foil it's a thin layer of aluminium oxide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, your foil does.   As for 'why', in simple terms is that oxygen and metals like to bond with each other. Now instead of a 'pure' metal on the surface, one would have aluminum oxide. After this layer is thick enough, no more oxygen can work its way in, as there are no more bond points left for free oxygen to hook up to. Also once this layer exists, bringing another piece of aluminum in contact (pure or oxidized) will have no effect, as there are no more 'bond points' to hook up to. This is heavily simplified, a high school level chemistry book will explain this a bit more. Crash-course chemistry on Youtube or Kahn academy also explains what is going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't the oxides affect the metal differently? Or is it that some oxides are more porous than others. Oxides on steel will still allow steel to rust. While Oxides on aluminum protect it completely. Or is that characteristics of steel vs aluminum. If either metal didn't have an oxide layer would they both rust? Or does aluminum not rust at all to the point of degradation similar to steel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is simply not true. </p>
<p>Most, but not all, metals oxidise. Gold, chrome and platinum come to mind as metals that don't oxidise. And of the metals that oxidise, not all of them form a &quot;thin ceramic layer&quot; like aluminium does. Iron comes to mind as the oxidation process disrupts the underlying crystal structure which allows oxygen to penetrate further, repeating the process.</p>
<p>I'm not completely discounting your comment. It may be true for some metals but certainly not all metals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The noble metals are ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, osmium, iridium, platinum, and gold. They can maintain an oxide-free surface in the presence of oxygen and moisture. </p>
<p>Chromium is self passivating, just like any other non-noble metal that is oxidation-resistant in practice. </p></div>		</li>
