			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case l just mentioned it seems the sedative part of the lethal injection cocktail is expiring (Kenneth Williams who was just executed apparently 'convulsed and groaned' when being put to death) so l guess if the sedative expires so would a poison. Though l have no desire to try weak poison anytime soon!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The expiration date of a medication means that the drug is 90% effective. Manufacturers are required to use an expiration to show that time. This applies to the U.S.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this doesn't apply to everything since some things may be reconstituted and become less stable or no longer be considered sterile. Oral antibiotics in liquid form are a good example. When reconstituted, some are reduced to 7, 10, 14 days.</p></div>		</li>
