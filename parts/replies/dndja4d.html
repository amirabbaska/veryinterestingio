			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're told from a young age, head to the side, hard shoulder contact first it all comes natural. From what i see most gridiron players try go shoulder first anyway.
Rugby league has fast players to ( not to be confused with Rugby/Rugby Union which is a slower more technical game) and in rugby league you aren't allowed to tackle a player without the ball. Often you a faced with multiple players who can be ball runners and you have to make a decision on who to tackle in a fraction of a second. In a fraction of a second you  can go from having to tackle player A with your right shoulder and switch to player B with your left shoulder, yet because tackling technique is ingrained from an early age it's instinctive to protect your head</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah all these people saying &quot;Oh football is worse, etc etc&quot; aren't realizing that CTE is caused by just the stop-go of momentum, which absolutely still happens during a rugby game. </p>
<p>Those rule changes to limit concussions are nice, but it won't stop this.  CTE has been shown now in Hockey, Boxing, Football, Rugby players, it's every contact sport.  </p>
<p>I will never let my child play a contact sport after this research has been shown.  It's not a risk, it's an eventuality. </p></div>		</li>
