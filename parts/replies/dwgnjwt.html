			<div class="markdown"><p>Some philosopher said the human mind isn't meant to comprehend concepts beyond polarization. Seems so strange that our perception is limited considering the obvious ability to think. Maybe there is some weird or strange phenomena that can't exactly translate to our monkey brains. Makes me think. Well only in the confines of my biology.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That might not be an answerable question. </p>

<p>Because this is the first time it would be statistically likely enough to find life for us to exist.</p>

<p>Why not? The air in the room you are sitting in moves around in random directions. Given enough time, you'll find all of the air in the room occupying a tiny corner, causing you to suffocate to death. Wait even longer, and it could undergo fusion.</p>
<p>Given that time has no meaning in a dead universe, a billion years is the same thing as graham's number of years. eventually, a statistical random flucation could be enough for a big bang, and would start us from &quot;nothing&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How is that physically possible? The huge potential energy would push it apart long before then. That's before even talking about it staying there while you suffocate to death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure it's entirely clear that we're near the beginning. That depends upon your definition of time. To me, time is a way of measuring events. More events == more time. Looked at that way, time is slowing down as the universe cools. There may well end up being a finite number of events even if in the standard view of time, it goes on essentially forever. They just become incredibly rare. Looked at this way, we may be closer to the end of time than the beginning.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's actually just matter and energy, dark or not. Dark energy was specifically invoked as a way of making observations of red-shift consistent with observations of the energy density of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although i agree that his use of dark matter there was flawed, i believe his use of dark energy was correct as far as my understanding goes. Dark energy is just the undefined energy causing the universe to accelerate outward, which is exactly what he’s referring to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point. Dark matter just makes up a much larger portion of the matter in the universe, so I typically think of it as the big contributor to the density of the universe, as inexact as that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the expansion factor of the universe and the balance of the major components of the universe. The three major components of the universe at a cosmological scale are radiation, matter, and the cosmilogical constant (also known as dark energy.) these forces behave differently with respect to distances. Radiation is inversly proportional to distance ^3, matter is inversly proportional to distance squared and the cosmilogical constant is a constant. So at diffrent scales diffrent forced dominate. When the universe is really small radiation is the dominant force. Once it expands enough matter is the dominant force. If it expands more than all of a sudden the cosmilogical constant will dominate. </p>
<p>For our universe to end in a Big Crunch we have to be matter dominated such that the attractive force of gravity causes the universe to reverse expansion and “crunch”. However our universe is actually accelerating in its expansion and scientists have determined that we are past the size that matter dominates. The dominating force in the universe now is the cosmilogical constant and we will continually accelerate our expansion until either a Bug Chill or Big Rip happens. Most likely a big chill. </p></div>		</li>
