<p>One way, for example, is not to have basements, less mass for the building to absorb energy.</p>

<p>So that means modern earthquake-resistant buildings doesn't have carpark basement or the like? O.o</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from chile. We have one of the best earthquake resistant set of codes for buildings.</p>
<p>I don't know the regulations in the US, but almost none of the points in the post above are true for us. Buildings are made with huge subterranean parking and infrastructure. The buildings are made to dissipate the energy by moving around basically and for the largest buildings there are various kind of dampeners built throughout the walls.</p>

<p>Wow that is a <strong>strong one</strong>! There's not a single crack in your apartment's wall after that?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Earthquakes mostly affect buildings specifically at the same natural frequency as the earthquake. There are a lot of examples where earthquakes destroyed all the buildings that are the same height, but they left all the buildings taller and shorter than these.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This absolutely depends on local geology, the biggest issue is 'liquefaction' in porous soils/sands leading to rapid and uneven subsidence (<em>this kills the building</em>). If you can remove all that crappy soil (type B and C soil as OSHA likes to call it) and expose bedrock or very overconsolidated soil, not a problem. Otherwise you are looking at driving pilings down to bedrock. [Millennium Tower](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Tower_(San_Francisco%29#Sinking_and_tilting_problem" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Tower_(San_Francisco%29#Sinking_and_tilting_problem</a>) is a great case study on what not do, their soil was so porous that a neaby tunnelling project supposedly compromised its already deficient foundation from draining ground water. In fact I would as a good rule of thumb, if your 'soil' is fairly impermeable to water it probably won't subside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Structural engineer here. Some of this is true. &quot;Loosening up connections&quot; isn't really something we do for seismic design. Steel connections in the lateral system are designed to be strong enough not to fail in the design earthquake, but also to fail, if they're going to fail (in an earthquake larger than anticipated), in a manner that's &quot;safer&quot; for the building - for example, ensuring that beams fail before columns so the building doesn't collapse. </p>
<p>Expansion joints aren't really for energy release- they're to allow two buildings, or two building segments, to move independently without banging into one another. </p>
<p>The concrete bathtub idea, and similar practices, are known as base isolation. This can be very effective for large, heavy buildings. San Francisco City Hall, as an example, is base isolated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question though. Can you explain further the concept of isolation? Coz I imagined it as the bases floating above a concrete bathtub. How does the base got isolated. Sure, it is isolated to the ground because of the <em>bathtub</em>, but how does the bathtub reduce any force to reach the base?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the &quot;bathtub&quot; a.k.a. second foundation is embedded into the ground and the isolation between the upper mentioned bathtub and the actual building is done with &quot;seismic isolators&quot; - huge rubber cylinders, that are stiff vertically, but deformable laterally. </p>
<p>Tl;dr the isolated structure sways in the bathtub via rubber cylinders</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The building is actually INSIDE the bathtub... I imagine the building sitting on ball bearings, so when the quake happens and the bathtub moves, the building can remain stationary. Springs and dampers will allow the building to be cushioned against the sides of the tub.</p>
<p>This is all just how I imagine it, and is in no way a true explanation of reality.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I call my structural engineer and say &quot;What's our seismic category?  Do I need to clip these ceiling tiles or anything?&quot;  And then she takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>So that's how architects design for earthquakes, hire good consultants. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you.  I feel like the first architect came on a bit strong about knowing how to design structures for seismic loads.  Really is quite specialized work for a structural engineer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>S.E. here also with a few notes to add:</p>
<p>Ductility of the structure is also a key concept in seismic resistance. Ductile members and structures dissipate energy better and effectively lower the design stresses in the structure. I would argue that this is the most commonly applied seismic resistance measure. </p>
<p>Also, I would add that expansion joints do allow for an otherwise irregular structure to be more uniform in plan reducing eccentricities and therefore seismic loads.</p>
<p>Totally agree with all of the other points made. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That may be because they aren't actually that relevant to the main conversation. They are appropriate for less than 1% of buildings, and it wouldn't be surprising for an individual to never step foot into a building with one in their life.</p>
<p>In this case, most of us read the question to be about buildings in general and not specifically edge-case high rises, so a lot of the answers are aimed more at average buildings (still largely wrong but a bit more on track for the question, at least).</p></div>		</li>
