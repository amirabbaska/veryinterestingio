			<div class="markdown"><p>That &quot;dress&quot; analogy goes pretty deep, too, because in particle physics and solid state physics, we talk about &quot;dressed&quot; particles. An electron in a crystal lattice, for example, can carry around it a &quot;cloud&quot; of lattice distortions (phonons) and thus become &quot;dressed&quot; with them, turning into a composite object called the polaron.</p></div>		</li>
