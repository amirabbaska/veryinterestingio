			<p>Yea, there are lots of bad answers here.<br><br>Am I remembering this wrong or didn't MS actually explain this when installing windows 10. There was a link in text title &quot;explain this to me&quot; or something similarly opaque. If you followed the link it has 2 or three sentences that summarize that PINS protect your password by being device specific.<br><br>Am I the only one who clicked that link and read it?</p>		</li>

			<p>You're not remembering wrong, there's a screenshot of the link over on <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/3703/hands-on-with-windows-10-build-10125" target="_blank">Thurrott's site</a>. I couldn't find a screenshot of what's displayed when the link is clicked on though.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yep that it. I remember being really taken back by the statement on the page, that pins were safer. Then I saw that link and was like &quot;Ok, convince me..&quot; After I read it I was actually impressed with the answer. The key is that in W10, unlike W8, you use your PIN for admin things so that you never put your password at risk.<br><br>It really is smart.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;The argument that people will choose easy-to-remember passwords falls over once you start looking at dumps of PINs, where the most common ones are '0000', '1111', '1234', etc.<br><br>What would you <em>expect</em> the most common PINs to be, 7254? 2885?<br><br>This applies to the &quot;most common passwords&quot; lists too...  Unless everyone is literally perfect about choosing a random value, there will be some asymmetry to the distribution of PINs towards what we recognize as &quot;easy&quot; or &quot;memorable&quot; values.  Even if 999 out of 1000 users pick a perfectly random PIN and the other 1 out of 1000 pick one of those &quot;easy&quot; values, when you do the analysis, you're going to find &quot;hey, the most common PINs are really insecure!&quot;</p>		</li>
