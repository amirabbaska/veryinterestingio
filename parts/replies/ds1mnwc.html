<p>The short version of how neurons works is that they need to be &quot;depolarized&quot; before they can fire. In other words, neurons are negatively charged when they're at rest, but when they're made positively charged, that's when they activate and send signals. Positively charged ions typically enter the cell when neurotransmitters bind to ion channels on the neuron, which lets positively charged ions in.</p>
<p><strong>Opiods</strong> decrease neurotransmission in 3 main ways.</p>
<p>1.They open potassium channels</p>
<p>This happens when the opiod receptor opens up potassium channels. Potassium flows out of the cell, and since potassium is positively charged, the cell becomes <strong>more negative</strong>, which decreases firing. You can think of this as needing <em>more</em> neurotransmitter to activate the cell.</p>
<p>2.They close calcium channels</p>
<p>This is a similar mechanism, where opiod neurons act on the pre-synaptic neuron (the one that releases the neurotransmitter) and close calcium channels. This causes a decrease in the rate of neurotransmission</p>
<p>3.They reduce transmitter release</p>
<p>This is really similar to the last one. In this case, the pre-synaptic neuron has endorphin auto-receptors that decrease the cell's rate of neurotransmission, reducing the post-synaptic effect.</p>
<p><strong>Benzodiazepines</strong></p>
<p>However, not all neurotransmitters increase the rate at which the cell fires. GABA is a neurotransmitter that typically opens chlorine ion channels. Since chlorine is negatively charged, when chlorine enters the neuron, it makes it less likely to fire. <strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> work by increasing the rate at which GABA binds to its receptor. This causes the neuron to fire less/deactivate.</p>
<p><strong>Cannabis</strong></p>
<p>One example of a excitatory neurotransmitter is glutamate. However, excessive glutamate transmission can cause an excess of calcium to enter the neuron, which is toxic to the neuron. Endocannabinoids work by binding to cannabis receptors on the glutamate releasing neurons in order to reduce glutamate. When you smoke, and these CB receptors are activated, reduced glutamate transmission=reduced cellular activity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to preface this question by saying I have limited/undergrad education in Biology.</p>
<p>I was just wondering, when Opioids open potassium channels to increase the change in potential needed to send an action potential would that not affect all neurons? Why would this not prevent motor neurons from firing aswell? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't, since not all neurons have the same amount of opiod receptors on them. The neurons that have the most amount of opiod receptors are part of the ventral tegmental area, the nucleus accumbens, and the ventral pallidum, which are all part of dopamine reward pathways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Benzodiazepines are much safer than opiates. Benzodiazepines are lethal at doses 1000s of times higher than the prescribed dose. Opiates on the other hand are lethal at 10 times the medically used dose.</p></div>		</li>
