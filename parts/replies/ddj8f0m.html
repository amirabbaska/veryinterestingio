<p>Also, if congress does actually allow churches to start endorsing politicians and using their money for politics, I hope their exemption status gets reexamined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but their &quot;church&quot; often provides everything else, i.e., the church owns their house (or houses), their jet, pays for vacations, etc.  They often live lavishly without much in the way of contributing back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Churches constantly endorse politicians and use their money for politics. Tax status won't get reexamined until they start supporting the wrong parties. Politicians that protect the exemptions tend to be the one's benefiting from the violations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Churches are exempt because they are non-profit organizations.&quot;</p>
<p>So how do you deal with the obvious issue of defining &quot;profits&quot;? If you pay what would otherwise be profits, to say the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-much-is-too-much-to-pay-a-pastor_us_55d4be53e4b0ab468d9f583d" target="_blank">pastor</a>, what's the point of not calling that a profit? Claiming that their services are worth millions, taking the money, and then saying that no profit has been generated by the organization?!?</p>
<p>Very few churches are actually &quot;non-profit.&quot; Work would need to be done voluntarily or for no more than a living wage. And upgrades to services and buildings have to be gauges objectively for excess. Tax free gilded gold stained glass for organizations that are not accumulating wealth through profits? I don't think so.</p></div>		</li>
