			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially none of the top-level comments offer rational or scientific explanation, just a bunch of anecdotes and stuff people read on the internet or in baby books.</p>
<p>A lot of research is currently ongoing in this area. None of which I can comment on, because it's not my field. Worth mentioning that adults on the autism spectrum have a tendency to do this, too... or so I'm told by a buddy who does this research. Anecdotally, I've observed the elderly, especially those who have had strokes or other events impacting cognitive ability to some degree, have the same tendency. These populations obviously watch different stuff, but the repetitive nature of their preferred content remains.</p></div>		</li>
