<p>When CGI first came out, it was obviously CGI, but it still wow'd people because you had this fantastic amazing stuff happening on screen.</p>

<p>This. I remember going to see one of those early Pixar movies with friends. It wasn't really a movie we would have gone to except for being excited about the CGI. I recall us walking out of the theater and one of my friends commenting &quot;The hair! Holy shit the hair was amazing!&quot;</p>
<p>Was it really realistic? No! We knew it wasn't hair, we could tell it was CGI. It was amazing....CGI. It really looked &quot;real&quot;, not like &quot;real hair&quot; per se, but it had properties and moved in ways that made it look like it might be a real thing made up of lots of bits, maybe not real hair, but real fake hair, like it was made of nylon strands or something. </p>
<p>It wasn't fooling anyone, but compared against CGI of the day, it was a leap forward. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it was not just rendering hair that made CGI increasingly realistic - it was rendering it in different conditions. I recall a scene in &quot;The Incredibles&quot; where they come up from underwater, and their hair looks  just like real wet hair. That must have taken some doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading in some magazine at the time that came out about how Pixar had spent an insane amount of time and money just to develop the technology for that scene. Making realistic water and things appear wet had apparently never been done in a CGI movie before then. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a pretty big disconnect here between <em>animation</em> and <em>realistic</em> CGI that's getting lost. </p>
<p>Pixar Movies are animation, and were never meant to replicate real life. Even their most recent film, Coco, is deliberately made 'cartoonish' to keep it unrealistic. This allows for more mature topics like visiting the afterlife to be explored with Children.</p>
<p>for contrast, The Wolf of Wallstreet used a lot of CGI effects in an effort to seamlessly make a fake world no one would notice. And they succeeded: Wolf of Wallstreet's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pocfRVAH9yU" target="_blank">CGI was realistic</a>, did foold audiences, and may continue to hold up in many years. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3dZl3yfGpc" target="_blank">Monty Python</a>'s effects might have passed at the time, but are noticeable now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mostly everything in that VFX demo is compositing, not from-scratch CGI. A cast of extras filmed from life is still going to look like it was filmed from life after it's stitched into a room that was shot separately.</p>
<p>Not that it's not <em>very impressive</em> compositing... but it's not the same thing as digitally-created images being (and remaining) convincing.</p>
<p>That said, there are surely quite a few elements in those scenes that <em>were</em> created digitally. But if you want a really great example of modern CGI being indistinguishable from real life, a better one would probably be the 'live-action' Jungle Book movie, which is basically a 100% CGI film with live-action Mowgli composited in. Even the environments are wholesale digital creations (based on reference photos taken in India but with no actual filming of those locations).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a massive difference between compositing CGI where you take bits of real footage and stitch them together, or CGI where the 3D elements are static houses in the background, and having a moving creature as the focus of a shot. </p>
<p>Compositing is still really cool but it's a lot easier to get results, especially when the audience isn't actually expecting any CGI. All the scenes in WOWS could have been shot in real life with no effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Most people don’t seem to realize that MOST of the dinosaurs were practical. It’s all the money shots and free walking scenes where they used the CGI, but they spent a LOT of time on it, with a team of the most experienced and talented people in that business working on it. </p>
<p>Today might be...a different story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another good example for that same time period, is Babylon 5 vs Deep Space 9. I'm a huge B5 fan but DS9 made the right decision... While the producers of B5 chose to go for the best CGI you could get at the time... And it was fantastic for the time... The producers of DS9 chose to go with more traditional methods of special effects, models, transparencies, etc.</p>
<p>I still love B5 (and DS9 for that matter...)... But DS9 had aged far far better than B5.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One of the main reasons this seems true is that we don't even recognize the best examples of modern cgi, only the bad ones.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That highlights another phenomenon though: as cgi develops the stuff we attempt to do with it gets more ambitious. CGI that would have previously been reserved for the big monster centrepiece of the movie instead gets used all over the place as a 'fix it in post' thing. But 15 years ago editing an actors face in a broad daylight scene wouldn't even have been attempted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer.  In Jurassic Park the 1 CGI figure was composited into a real world shot.  Now days the actor's faces are composited into CGI scenes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because it would've looked fake as shit</p>
<p>And it still looks fake as shit</p>

<p>I go back to games that I thought looked pretty decent, even some of the early games for this current console generation, and now just look like crap. </p>
<p>Dice and a few others have really pushed the envelope on sound and graphic design to the point that these games look almost life-like (im sure people can recall some of those 4k battlefront videos, which actually looked like real life), but probably in a few years those games will look bad. </p></div>		</li>
