			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a while ago that in the ISS <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/aquatic.html" target="_blank">fish experiment</a> the fish brought up live from Earth were just very confused/disorientated and just swimming around in circles, whereas the fish born on the ISS seemed used to the microgravity and swam around '<a href="https://youtu.be/nvQoTjGCz0s" target="_blank">normally</a>'.</p>
<p>So it might be possible that newborns could get used to the new environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't sting unless they feel threatened (they would die anyways) or just generally disoriented. Oddly enough domesticated bees have 1000% less aggression than wild bees. Source: I highly dislike harvesting honey from the hive that we captured from a hollowed out trunk some 8 years ago. Blood line runs deep, lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the article, newborn gypsy moths developed in zero gravity learn to glide without flapping their wings, whereas earthborn moths had difficulty controlling pitch and wanted to use the wings for control. I assume something similar would occur in most bee populations.</p></div>		</li>
