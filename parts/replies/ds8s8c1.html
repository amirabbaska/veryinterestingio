			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the person volunteers more information afterward of their own accord.  The true &quot;test&quot; will be after the polygraph, when the operator asks &quot;Is there anything you want to add to (your story) to explain any irregularities?&quot;  That's when nervous people will alter their stories somewhat, usually with truthful or somewhat truthful statements, which leads the operator to further evidence.</p></div>		</li>
