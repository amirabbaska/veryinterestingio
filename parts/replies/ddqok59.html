			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you use a reference pitch?  If so, it's relative pitch.  If you don't have the additional step of determining the interval/singing up or down then you have perfect pitch.  I have relative pitch, as I have A440 memorized and I compare this pitch to what I hear.  If I could hear a pitch and instantly name it then I would have perfect pitch.  You can refine relative pitch to become perfect, but it takes lots of practice.  You eventually begin to memorize them if you hear them often...As A440 is the tuning note we use in band every rehearsal.</p></div>		</li>
