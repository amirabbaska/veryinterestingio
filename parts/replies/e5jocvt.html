			<div class="markdown"><p>One specific thing to add is that grapefruit causes caffeine to be absorbed by the body more slowly. Not sure what the process is, but it applies to some medications too, so theyâ€™ll include restrictions about eating grapefruit with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Grapefruit (naringin is the chemical responsible) works as an inhibitor of liver enzymes. These enzymes break down a lot of medications, and inhibiting them means you will increase the half-life of the drug in your system.</p>
<p>This could be good or bad, depending on what you want to achieve. If you're taking a medication for blood pressure (just making something up here, I don't know which medications are affected by grapefruit consumption), you might overdose if you also eat grapefruit.</p>
<p>You could also use it the other way around, and take less of something but get more &quot;bang for your buck&quot; so to speak, by adding grapefruit.</p>
<p>Naringin is also what makes grapefruit taste so bitter, and is present in other citrus fruit in much lower quantities.</p>
<p>Edit: another interesting thing about naringin is that it seems to have a stabilizing effect on hematocrit levels (% of your blood that is red blood cells). </p>
<p>Too much is what kills cyclists who use EPO by giving them strokes from thick blood. </p>
<p>Too little will make you feel lethargic and weak, and is more common with women (bleeding every month has at least some impact on this, don't know the extent).</p>
<p>There are other ways to increase and decrease your HCT levels, but naringin moves you away from the extremes no matter where on the spectrum you are. Pretty neat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Grapefruit contains high levels of naturally-occuring compounds that inhibit certain digestive enzymes.  This effect does not slow the absorption of certain drugs, it slows the rate at which the body can metabolize and eliminate them - possibly resulting in dangerously high levels of the drug in the bloodstream.</p></div>		</li>
