<p>Modern homes and modern furniture are made with synthetics which are plastic based and burn quickly and in high temps compared to traditional/older construction which are pure timber. Materials such as OSB boards, I beams, cheap furniture from rooms to go, etc, all burn quickly because of adhesive materials used to cut corners. An old Victorian house will take hours to burn.</p>
<p>Structures are rated class I, II, III, IV, depending on what they're made out of and the framing is rated to last a certain amount of hours. For example, class I is steel encased in cement and used for large commercial buildings. Type III is masonry/timber and rated better than IV - modern wood construction.</p>
<p>The average good response time for a fire department is 6-8 minutes and a modern house fire can be at the point of no return within 4. The best investment people can make is installing a sprinkler system during the construction phase of their homes. It's a good investment that can save your house in under a minute. There are ton of YouTube videos that show the difference between fires in sprinkled homes and un-sprinkled. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sounds to me like the best investment would be to use steel and masonry during the construction phase rather than timber/wood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that houses also often carry lots of fuel.  I might have 300 gallons of heating oil and 150 gallons of propane attached to my house at any given time, along with a few gallons of diesel, gasoline, 2-in1, etc.  All told, and I live in a very small old wooden house.  But if you lit up my oil tank, I imagine it'd go up like the 4th of July...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curtains are just flammable house rags!</p>
<p>Having seen innumerable episodes of forensic files, I can also contribute that anything upholstered with a foam interior is crazy flammable. </p>
<p>Molecularly, wood is fibrous and pretty strong, and there isn't a lot of air in it (vs foam!!!) so you're arranging it in order to meet certain conditions in terms of airflow and creating critical amounts of heat to allow it to catch and actually burn in a campfire vs just smoking a little and ruining the whole night...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern foam in furniture is just one of the aspects getting worse.  If you look at the studies UL has dine, house fires are getting hotter every year due to the increase in petroleum in furniture.  UL labs does controlled burns of very specific houses inside controlled environments.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Truth.  The contents usually burn faster than anything else.  Especially with all the fast-and-hot burning synthetic stuff we have these days.  </p>
<p>With that said, houses themselves do burn dramatically faster than they used to.  Many builders are using &quot;engineered wood&quot; to reduce costs - which is basically wood particles pressed together with resin.  Large solid pieces of hardwood burn slowly - but small pieces pushed together with flammable resin burn much much faster.  Builders are also using &quot;gusset plates&quot; in roofs and things, because they're cheaper than filling a beam full of nails.  Gusset plates tend to back out and fail when they get hot, causing premature collapse.  </p></div>		</li>
