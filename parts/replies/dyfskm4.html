			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s pretty common in many places and with many judges. All the judges I knew were more than happy to educate jurors (or anyone really) on the finer, more boring points of the American legal system they spent so long learning about. Bless their hearts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on a jury once in Arizona and we were told to write down any questions we have or bring them up to the bailiff when in the jury room. The bailiff then passed it to the judge who determined if it was an appropriate question that deserved an answer. Mostly it was meant so jurors could get clarification on things... not so much to come up with their own questions about the trial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely, iIsaw a documentary on a trial were one of a set of identicle twins were were being tried rape, the DNA could have been either of them, and they were pointing fingers at each other, and the victim could not tell them apart. The jurisdiction allows the judge to solicit questions for the whiteness from the jury to be asked. In that case one of the jurors noticed on the stand that one of the twins has a lisp, and nobody asked the victim if her assailant had a lisp, when the juror got to ask the question they were able to specifically ID which one was guilty.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It varies by location and even the judge. In Illinois, a juror can submit questions for witnesses and the judge decides whether it will be asked and modify it so it is proper under the applicable rules of evidence and civil procedure. Attorneys can object. I’ve been in front of judges who always allow such questions and some that leave it up to the attorneys. Same general process applies to questions during the deliberation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This baffles me. Did really; not the police, lawyers or judge notice the lisp in their investigation and that this might be a source of identification? </p></div>		</li>
