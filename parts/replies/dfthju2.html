<p>That isnt 100% accurate. It was still a Da Vinci painting and it was hung in Napoleon's room. People knew of the painting. Sure it wasn't the most famous painting in the world like it is now but it was still a known painting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bull, it was a painting by one of the greatest artist of all time. Also,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leonardo apparently carried the painting with him, first to Milan, then to Rome and finally to France, where he died in 1519. King Francis I acquired the portrait from one of the painter's heirs. It was hung in royal palaces in Fontainebleau, the Louvre and Versailles until it was placed in the new Museum Central des Arts in the Louvre in 1798. In 1800, Napoleon took it to his quarters in the Tuileries Palace, but it returned to the museum in 1804.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, from the 16th century, it was considered an artistic breakthrough, not only because the sitter both looks at the viewer and gently smiles, unusual for a secular painting, but also because of its revolutionary &quot;sfumato&quot; or smoky, technique that avoids sharp outlines.</p>
<p>By the 19th century, lithographs, postcards and photographs gave the painting universal fame</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It wasnt some hidden piece of art before the theft. Yes it gained MASSIVE appeal after it but it was still a know piece of artwork that DaVinci loved.</p></div>		</li>
