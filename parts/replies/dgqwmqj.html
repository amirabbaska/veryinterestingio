<p>It wasnâ€™t until the appearance of Homo sapiens with significantly increased cranial volume that social structure and hierarchy started to take shape,</p>

<p>That sounds like a rather suspect conclusion to me, given the fact that numerous other primate species, and indeed virtually all of the social animal species, exhibit some form of hierarchical social structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both your conclusions are suspect. Hierarchical societies did not emerge in humans until <em>much</em> more recently than increased cranial volume, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer#Social_and_economic_structure" target="_blank">most hunter-gatherer societies are egalitarian</a> and the assertion that all social animal species are hierarchical is wrong. Social insects are not actually hierarchical, each individual is simply specialised to a different role. There is no class of animals 'in charge' in these species. In pack animals hierarchies may develop but this says nothing about the social behaviours of humans. Even among higher apes there is huge variation in social behaviours amongst species which are almost genetically identical, like bonobos and chimpanzees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This person is providing some good information, but also is broadbrushing a lot of human history. There are some fallacies being repeated here. I'll comment further when I can get to my actual computer (on mobile now).</p></div>		</li>
