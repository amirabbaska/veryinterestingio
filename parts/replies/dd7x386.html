			<div class="markdown"><p>But does that mean we incorrectly perceive there to be three dimensions? Like, does the 'hologram' effect only occur in our perception,  or are the suggesting that the universe itself is a three dimensional hologram of a two-dimensional object, whether it's being observed or not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there are 3 dimensions, we can feel them and measure them, but from a greater dimension than ours we look 2D, our universe bubbled off from the black hole of a greater dimension, and our black holes bubble off to create other universe in a lower dimension(2D) but in that dimension they actually feel 3D the way we do. It's like a repeating never ending valve </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait so what is the opposite of a black hole? Is time irrelevant in this example? Do black holes just keep collecting data until they have enough to create their own separate universe?</p>
<p>I'm curious as to what it would appear as on the other side of the black hole</p></div>		</li>
