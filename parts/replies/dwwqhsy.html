			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not, this person is wrong. If anything it is more standard than his quantum book, which at least has Shankar as a viable competitor.</p>
<p>Almost nobody uses anything else for undergraduate E&amp;M.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How accessible is this book for someone who just wants to learn more physics? Im in highschool and am doing the IB program if you know what that is, I've done HL maths which is basically calc 1 and 2, will I need to do calc 3 before studying from this? Or could I learn the calculus I need from the book itself?</p>
<p>I'm going to uni for comp sci but I just want to keep my hand in with physics for fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recommend Zoya Popvic's <em>Introduction to Electromagnetics</em> for a small, <em>free</em>, but very dense book that races through the topic. If you want verbosity, then Notaros' <em>Electromagnetics</em> will cover everything in more detail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but I do agree that Griffiths' isn't the most mathematically rigorous and to me didn't do a great job at preparing me for Jackson Electrodynamics which is the standard graduate text. Zangwill is another good graduate text. For undergrad I like Purcell and an older text by Stratton. For any EM book aimed at the undergrad though I'm not for sure how math rigorous they will be. For this topic focusing on EM wave propagation my favorite is by Akira Ishimaru. </p></div>		</li>

<p>To be fair, nothing can prepare you for Jackson.  I felt Griffiths was fine as an undergraduate text, similar to Hecht for optics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I teach this stuff to undergrads.  I've gone back and forth between Purcell and Griffiths, and decided that Purcell is a liability.  Its text is mostly conceptual, but the problems are mostly difficult sneaky tricks.  Griffiths's text actually guides the student through applying vector calculus to straightforward problems, and the homework has more of those problems to practice with (plus some sneaky stuff, but it's clearly marked.)</p>
<p>I've also decided Griffiths' approach of putting all the vector calculus up front is better than Purcell's way of deriving it as needed throughout the text: it draws a sharp line between the math and the physics.</p>
<p>Purcell has much better figures, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Copper and gold are colored because their electrons can jump to a higher atomic energy level if given an amount of energy corresponding to a photon of blue light -- so they absorb that color.  Chrome, aluminum, etc. need ultraviolet photons to make that transition. </p>
<p>Here's an explanation:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine this has to do with how quickly copper oxidizes in air vs. chromium-- pure copper will quickly form a layer of copper oxide that has a much lower reflectivity. Copper is quite shiny when polished.</p>
<p>For a true comparison you would need to polish a sample of copper and chromium to equal surface roughness, and measure the reflectivity of both before any oxidation occurred. If you wanted to be truly pedantic, this would all occur in an inert environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanted to tack on a question about one other related phenomenon that I find really fascinating: the role of relativity in some metals' color. So, gold appears yellow to us even when it is absorbing/emitting through electron transitions that by all rights should be in the ultraviolet -- the &quot;same&quot; transitions in a silver atom don't give it a human-visible color. This is due to the higher kinetic energy of the electrons in the gold atom, but the exact mechanism is a bit confusing to me.</p>
<p>My impression from before was that this was more or less &quot;straightforward&quot; relativity, and it was about length contraction / time dilation. The electron in the gold atom is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to the gold nucleus (and to a human observer). From the electron's perspective, it absorbs/emits electromagnetic energy at an ultraviolet frequency/wavelength. But from our perspective, the electron's &quot;clock&quot; is running more slowly, and it judges certain distances to be shorter than we do. So it happily interacts with electromagnetic oscillations that it says are ultraviolet but that we say are blue, since we observe the &quot;peaks&quot; of the same wave to be separated by shorter stretches of time and longer stretches of space. </p>
<p>However, other <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/golden_glow/" target="_blank">writing on the same effect</a> explains it quite differently. In this formulation, the relevant relativistic effect is actually the apparent mass gain of the electron at high speed. Because angular momentum must be conserved, an electron with a higher mass must tend to be found &quot;orbiting&quot; closer to the nucleus. This causes some outer shell orbitals to be smaller than we would otherwise expect. And it is this tendency of an outer shell gold electron to behave like -- and  co-mingle with -- lower shells that causes the electron to emit at an unexpectedly &quot;lower-shell-like&quot; energy. This is also why the electron is unexpectedly shy about engaging in chemical reactions, making gold so inert.</p>
<p>Is one or both of these explanations wrong? Is there actually some underlying equivalence (no pun intended) to these two ways of describing the phenomenon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That link is quite hilarious to me because mass is not a real term in relativity. And whenever it is used, it refers to rest mass, which is not affected by lorentz boost...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am under the impression that relativity isn’t even necessary to explain this phenomenon. The absorption is caused by a narrow gap between two atomic orbitals in the gold atom, a <em>d</em> and the <em>s</em> having the next-highest principal quantum number (though don’t quote me on the particular identities of the orbitals). If you graph the energies of the radial components of the hydrogen-like wavefunctions for these orbitals, you can see them almost intersecting at a point where the difference is equivalent to a photon in the visible spectrum. </p>
<p>So quantum mechanics is sufficient to explain this absorption, based on the character of the wavefunctions. </p>
<p>Relativity can be used to create an intuitive, analytic explanation for this effect, but I don’t believe it’s strictly necessary. </p>
<p>Relativity is more applicable to things like the lanthanide contraction or the stability of certain transition-metal ions compared to what periodicity would predict. </p></div>		</li>
