			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no free BPA in plastics, it's chemically bound to form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycarbonate" target="_blank">polycarbonate plastic</a>, which is also mostly used as a bulk plastic, not as a coating. BPA is released from the plastic by hydrolysis of the polycarbonate, not by simple diffusion. (With the exception of particularly badly made plastics with unreacted BPA monomer.)</p>
<p>This is also not just related to microwaves, and any other type of heating in the presence of water can cause breakdown of the plastic in the same manner. (So heating a polycarbonate baby bottle in hot water is just as bad as heating it in a microwave.)</p>
<p>You're right about the toxicity of free BPA though, and phtalates are just dissolved in the plastic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. I did not know that BPA was liberated by means of hydrolysis reaction of the polycarbonate. That is very interesting. BPA based products are often used as coating though. For example, water pipes, food/beverage containers, etc.</p></div>		</li>
