			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume you're American. The idea of using a driving licence a social security (equivalent to national insurance in the UK I think?) is crazy. Not sure how that system would even work. </p>
<p>Your story is grim though, especially in the 90s, must have been a lot more difficult to sort things out back then. These days most companies are very aware of identity fraud because its so easy to do thanks to t'internet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually wasn't uncommon. Its a guaranteed unique number, so it made sense to use a number that already existed.</p>
<p>Here was a list of states that did as recently as 2001 if you were curious. <a href="http://www.pimall.com/nais/n.dldecod.html" target="_blank">http://www.pimall.com/nais/n.dldecod.html</a> Quite a few of them did (with having a sequential number as an option in a few), although I'm pretty sure none do now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in OK.  If you look at that list they actually used your ss# as your driver's license.  I never liked that idea and had them issue me a number which worked in my favor after my identity was stolen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand how they did it either.  It would have been very easy to notify me since she used my mothers address on her checks.  But no one ever told my mom I had 9 felony warrants nor sent her any kind of notice. So messed up and yeah it was hard to sort out and cost me a lot of money.  Thankfully it didn't affect my credit as back then it was so hard to remove that stuff from your credit report.  It took people years to clear that up   </p></div>		</li>
