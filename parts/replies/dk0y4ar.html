			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I dug around and found an old essay I wrote (about 9 pages, 2800 words) on this topic that discusses the stuff below in more detail and in a pretty ELI5 friendly way. Looking back I'm not super happy with the composition of it, but it's still factually correct AFAIK. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DmMz_KkGtjD5YjeOfDbpWm7xp-x-IXdIxtPzOmjs_Zw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Link on Google Docs</a></p>
<p>I'm gonna jump on the Peterson train here. One of the things that caught my attention was when he was talking about truth as a pragmatic concept, that is, true statements offer utility (by helping us survive, improve, breed, etc.) to the individual and species. The other is that things can have truth in them without being a fact based account of what is happening, which is to say, fiction can be true even though it's not something that exactly happened.</p>
<p>This strikes particularly at literature or art that discusses the human condition. A character doesn't have to have actually done what's in the book for their actions or the story to reveal something about us. We can empathize with them even though they aren't real and that will tend to stimulate real emotions even though the story is fake. This is why some people (like Peterson) look to religious texts as important commentary on the human experience even when they don't believe that the things in them literally happened.</p>
<p>Now I'll jump off the Peterson train to talk music, since it is a little more abstract. I've come across a lot of different facts that talk about how music works and affects us. I don't think that there's really a whole picture that describes it front-to-back. Obviously it stimulates areas of the brain associated with emotion. How it does so is not so obvious. Pitch and harmonics, as well as the function of the cochlea illuminate why particular relative pitches might be seen our our brain as important. Like, an octave is a note with a higher note that is double its frequency. A fifth (C-G for example) is a 3:2 ratio. So the waves of an octave line up after one full wave, and a perfect fifth lines up after one and a half waves. </p>
<p>Neurologically, experiments have been done to look at what's happening in our brain while listening to music. We see a lot of activation in frontal areas of the brain, similar to other things that give emotional responses. Areas that are activated are linked to reward, conflict, emotional happiness or distress. It's speculated (I don't know if there's really rigorous study on this) that part of the reason for brain stimulation has to do with music simulating stuff that we're familiar with. Pitch and tone simulate human speech, while rhythm and timing simulate motor functions like walking.</p>
<p>It might be illuminating to look at case studies. If you're interested, pick up a copy of <a href="http://www.oliversacks.com/books-by-oliver-sacks/musicophilia/" target="_blank">Musicophilia by Oliver Sacks</a>. In it he tells stories of patients who have abnormal brain functions and how it affects their relationship with music. There's a man who is struck by lightning that becomes fascinated with piano music, synesthesia patients, and a man who has almost no working memory who can still play piano pieces even though his memory span is shorter than the length of the music.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There has been <del>a lot of</del> some research though (For example Sandra Trehub: Human Processing Predisposition and Musical Universals) that seem to indicate that there <em>are</em> musical universals that (most) humans have from birth. For example, infants were much better at detecting variations within unequal-step scales compared to equal-step scales. Interestingly though, infants performed equally well when confronted with a common major scale as they did with a new unequal scale made up just for the experiment, whereas adults performed significantly better with the major scale that they were used to. So, although familiarity does seem to be a factor, we do also seem to have some biological musical predisposition. (I'd like to note that testing on Infants is always tricky, it should be taken into account. Also, you can't completely rule out the problem that infants might be able to be conditioned to a certain tonal system while still inside the mother's womb). Tests also showed that infants 'prefer' tonal music and prefer intervals with small integer ratios (So: Octave 2:1, perfect fifth 3:2, perfect fourth 4:3 etc rather than for example the tritone with 45:32) (Sch√∂nberg would be pissed!).</p>
<p>Anyway I what I mean to say is that there are many indicators that might show that there are musical predispositions upon which we build and create familiarities. </p>
<p>EDIT: It really hasn't been a lot of research. In fact, it's still a very unclear field of study. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Through our art and music, the emotion felt by an artist may be encoded through color, shadow and harmony to be decoded and experienced by an observer or listener. That is arguably one of humanity's greatest accomplishments. </p>

<p>Ironically enough this is one of the most beautiful things that I have read in a long time.</p>
<p>Kudos, OP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if this is why great animation (think Disney, Pixar, Studio Ghibli, etc.) can move us so much - you're getting a trifecta of artist color and visuals <em>plus</em> a musical soundtrack to fit the art mood <em>plus</em> the viewer's personal memories triggered by the art and music.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Big fan of good animation too but I think it extends to cinema in general. Good movies can be so powerful, partly because of the combination you describe. </p>
<p>(I think I love watching parts of the Ghibli together with my 3 year old more than him).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're actually very close to what Buddhists and Stoics practice. </p>
<p>One of the Four Seals that define Buddhism is &quot;All emotions are painful&quot;. An example of this would be falling in love. We think of love as a positive emotion, but the more we love something the more we will suffer when we lose it or it changes. This isn't to say, 'don't fall in love', it's to recognize that emotions are pain and that you can control your attachment to things through meditation and mindfulness. </p>
<p>This is why Buddhist monks shave their heads and never listen to music, they're removing attachment from their lives. </p>
<p>Stoicism has a very similar theme, that experiencing emotions strongly should be avoided, but is more philosophical whereas Buddhism is more of a combination of religion and philosophy. </p>
<p>So when you suggest that goosebumps from music are connected to taking things personally, a Buddhist and a Stoic would absolutely agree with you and suggest trying to experience each less intensely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest I can relate to it,</p>
<p>Back in high school I stopped listening to music for a while, became rather confrontational, assertive and stoic.</p>
<p>Anything else to do in everyday modern life to be more like buddhist monks and the stoics?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding of Stoicism was that emotions are not bad or to be avoided, but rather it is the practice of limiting the extent to which emotions control your actions and thoughts. Am I wrong?</p></div>		</li>
