			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask a further question please?
I was wondering about this last night actually, and just spotted this thread.</p>
<p>Why does the gag reflex (particularly say, if you put your fingers down your throat) trigger the stomach to expel its contents if it's purpose is to keep the airway/throat clear?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the OP but was curious.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharyngeal_reflex" target="_blank">Wikipedia's article on the gag reflex</a>, gag-reflex induced vomiting can help prevent choking by forcing obstructions back out through the mouth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.livescience.com/34110-gag-reflex.html" target="_blank">This article from Live Science</a> goes into a bit more, noting that in addition to preventing choking by forcing obstructions out of the airway it is also more sensitive when we're young, blocking most/all solid food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t have a source in the population as a whole, but I think I have a particularly insensitive gag reflex. I’m able to put my finger all the way to the back of my mouth without triggering a gag. I’ve mever tried to make myself throw up in that fashion, but I have been able to use my finger to remove bits of popcorn kernel that get stuck in the back of my throat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm wondering whether swallowing (and the associated suppression of the gag reflex) is an entirely involuntary response? Or is it that we &quot;force&quot; ourselves to swallow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The swallow is broken up into 3 phases: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. The oral phase is voluntary and consists of chewing the material (if necessary), collecting it into a cohesive unit on the tongue, and propelling it towards the back of the mouth. The pharyngeal and esophageal phases are both involuntary; they begin when the swallow reflex is initiated and when the material passes through the muscle that separates the pharynx from the esophagus, respectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The oral phase of the swallow (when you chew and propel the food/liquid to the back of your throat) is voluntary.  At the level of the faucial pillars (those “arches” in the back part of your mouth), the pharyngeal swallow is triggered (in normal, healthy people.  Though some delay is normal in older populations), the pharyngeal swallow is initiated.  That is involuntary and results in upper and forward movement of the larynx, closure of the vocal cords, inversion of the epiglottis (to protect the worst), and the opening of the top of the esophagus to allow food/liquid to pass through.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that swallowing (even the pharyngeal) has been found to be more than just a reflex.  Multiple areas of the brain (in the cortex) are activated during swallowing.</p></div>		</li>
