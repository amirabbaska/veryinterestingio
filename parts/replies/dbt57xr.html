			<div class="markdown"><p>Concentric Contraction: contracting your muscles while they shorten in length, e.g. curling a barbell from thigh to chest, biceps brachii shorten. </p>
<p>Eccentric Contraction: contracting your muscles while they lengthen, e.g. negative pullups where you control your descent slowly. </p>
<p>Most exercises contain both eccentric and concentric contractions (lifting and lowering usually). </p>
<p>As a bonus fact, an Isometric Contraction is one where you contract your muscles, yet they don't change length or move at all, e.g. abdominal plank. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As others said, concentric is when the muscle shortens and eccentric is when the muscle lengthens. However the important part is that the eccentric has to be <em>controlled</em>. Just letting the barbell fall after a curl isn't an eccentric movement. The muscle does no work on the way down. However if you control the weight and lower it slowly, the bicep is working for the entire movement. In addition to being the part of the movement that causes doms, it's also the part of the movement that builds the most muscle mass </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a deadlift. The concentration portion is where you pick the weight up off the floor,  the isometric portion is the lockout at the top and the eccentric portion is the lowering of the weight on the floor. </p></div>		</li>
