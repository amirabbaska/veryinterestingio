			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, as I understand it the logistics for sulfur-dioxide and carbon dioxide are completely different. For sulfur, the problem was a small number of large emission points, so it was easy to identify all of the polluters and bring them into the cap-and-trade system. For CO2, there is a far lager number of emission points. In truth, every one of us is technically an emission point... and that's before we even bring cars into the equation. To implement the same system for CO2 that worked for sulfur would require a draconian bureaucracy that would inevitably be undermined.</p>
<p>A far better system is a carbon tax system, preferably <a href="https://citizensclimatelobby.org/carbon-fee-and-dividend/" target="_blank">carbon fee and dividend</a>. Under this system, rather than trying to tax carbon at the point of emission (which is basically impossible), we tax it at the point of production... at the point where the fuel is first sold by the company that makes it, rather than the point where it is burned, as is the case with sulfur. This results in far fewer entities needing to be tracked.</p>
<p>The dividend part is important because unlike sulfur, CO2 emission is part of <em>everyone's</em> lives. Most people have to drive a car to work. The transport of goods involves heavy CO2 emission. Fuel costs impact the entire economy, not just one small portion of it. Implement a carbon fee without accounting for this would leave many Americans in a position where they lacked an affordable way to get to work, and most producers without an affordable way to get goods to market. Include the dividend, and people can still afford the substantially less affordable fuel, while still having a substantial incentive to find some way to reduce carbon fuel consumption as much as possible.</p></div>		</li>
