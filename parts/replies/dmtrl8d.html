			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, what do you need to make a rocket? You need metal, oxygen, hydrogen, silicon, etc and those are the heaviest pieces of a rocket, and also exist on the moon. </p>
<p>So in the short term, the idea is that you break water ice on the moon and turn it into hydrogen and liquid oxygen and store it. Since the lunar gravity is so low it is easy for a space craft to land, refuel, and take off without wasting much fuel. So a rocket could take off from Earth carrying just enough fuel to get to the moon, then refuel on the moon and be able to burn harder and longer towards Mars or the outer planets. </p>
<p>Long term, mining the moon's metals and fabricating parts on the moon will mean bringing even less weight out of Earths gravity well. The moon is a big chunk of the Earth and because of the destructive birth, there are metals and minerals reachable with mining on the moon, that would not be reachable on the earth because of it's depth in our mantle. You might even find moon mining where the raw materials are shipped back to the earth. This will be profitable once it costs less to mine rare minerals on the moon than deep in the earth. </p>
<p>Additionally, for very large craft, you will need to build them in space or on the moon. They would never make it out of the Earths gravity well if built on the ground, or would be too delicate to support their own weight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fuel required to launch a rocket from Earth grows exponentially with increased weight - what this means is most of the fuel in rockets is just there to lift the weight of the other fuel, which is why there's only so much you can lift on a single rocket from Earth. The Moon's lower gravity means you can make several trips there ferrying supplies for one launch that has a much larger payload than is possible from Earth.</p>
<p>Edit: To add, the water discovered a few years ago on the Moon also means only limited drinking water would need to be carried from Earth, and more importantly it can (in the future) be processed to make rocket fuel, saving huge amounts of weight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That can't be right. Are you sure it doesn't grow quadratically with increased weight? There's no way that it could grow exponentially.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not everything launched from the moon would have to be launched from earth. It would take a large investment, but with the right facilities ice (already found on the moon) could be processed into rocket fuel. Even further down the road, it would be possible to even mine materials right on the moon and manufacture rockets of equipment there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or radioactive stuff. You really don't want to start a nuclear powered spacecraft from earth. Too much of a risk that it might crash. But if the fuel is produced on the moon, well it's not like there was much that could be contaminated there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We probably won't even bring that asteroidal iron back to Earth. If we're colonizing our solar system, it will be far more valuable to have it up there. How much does it cost to bring a pound of material even up to LEO? How much would it cost in fuel to bring it down to Earth? </p>
<p>We will hopefully have space smelting and metallurgy by then. The raw material will be used to build the ships and living quarters for the next generation of colonists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes thousands of tons of rocket fuel to get a small payload up to orbit. It only takes a few hundred lbs to de-orbit. There have been suggestions of using drag lines to slow orbital velocity as well by creating aerodynamic drag in the upper atmosphere. The atmosphere is very good at slowing things down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't the lack of a magnetic field preclude the possibility of terraforming mars? Regular solar winds strip away part of Mars' remaining atmosphere, doesn't it? Plus we would need an absurd amount of nitrogen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stripping of the atmosphere takes millions of years though. If there is no new gas to replace the atmosphere stripped away, then it thins. But terraforming activities would need to out pace this &quot;evaporation&quot; anyway to make it thicker, so once an atmosphere is there, keeping it there would be easy by comparison as it takes much less to &quot;top it off&quot; than to &quot;fill it&quot;. Regular deliveries of icy bodies dropped into Martian atmosphere to burn up, would be trivial by that point. </p>
<p>Mars also has HUGE amounts of oxygen, maybe as much or more than there is on Earth, but it's all tied up in carbon dioxide and iron oxide (rust) in the Martian crust. Part of a terraforming operation would be removing the oxygen from the soil and treating the surface rocks so they wouldn't re-absorb it as quickly. </p>
<p>On Earth this is done by plants and by geothermal processes that strip gases out of the rock, and out of the air, and store the carbon, and release elemental oxygen and water vapor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the &quot;stripping away&quot; process only actually occurs over a very gradual period. We're talking tens to hundreds of thousands of years for significant change. If we throw some big asteroids into Mars and burn them up and do other things to thicken the atmosphere, it would just need a top-up every few thousand years. Not too unfeasible.</p>
<p>The lack of magnetic field is problematic in another way though - there is less protection against harmful cosmic radiation. On Earth our mag field deflects radiation particles or traps them at the poles (reason why you see auroras) and the Van Allen belts, and earth's surface is protected from most solar and extrasolar radiation. Even with a thick atmosphere Mars colonies would still probably have to be under big protective domes or underground to reduce radiation doses to human colonists, at least for long term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The new idea is to set up a magnetic field generator in space, positioned between the sun and mars, that deflects the radiation. You only need a small field if it's far enough away from Mars. </p></div>		</li>
