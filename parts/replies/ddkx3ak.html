			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it wouldn't.</p>
<p>An empty region of space (vacuum) still has a so called Vacuum energy associated to it that is roughly estimated to be 1x10^-9 J/m^3 . This Vacuum energy comes from fields (like the electromagnetic field, only more exotic) that penetrate the entire universe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a &quot;region&quot; (you wouldn't be able to call it that, but you get the idea) where there is no space, there logically can't be any field passing trough it either, so the total Energy &quot;there&quot; is exactly Zero.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the Universie is expanding, does that mean there's more space and therefore more energy associated with it?</p>
<p>If there is, how does this not violate the &quot;energy can't be created/destroyed&quot; rule?</p></div>		</li>
