			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm... But how is it that breasts aren't a &quot;turn-on&quot; in tribes? Or amongst nudists? Or is it something that is sometimes sexual, sometimes not, depending on context? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because in tribes they are comepletely aware thats how the body is and makes no difference clothed or not. Out of the many people I have met I have never met a nudist so i cant say for them but I imagine its about the same (not that i have visited remote tribes of course). In society since we dont see them that often its a turn on. </p>
<p>Imagine showing something common to a tribeman or a fancy toy to a kid. its imcredible because they have snever seen it. </p>
<p>We go through puberty and most of our lives with little to no exposure. Worse if you cant find a partner or dont have access to the internet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awhile back I was reading a reddit thread about nudists. Its not that nudist aren't turned on, they just suppress it. Its typically a family camp or whatever, so you can't have adults getting sexy with the kiddies around. </p>
<p>Its really no different from regular guys not getting full on erections just from seeing an attractive girl. </p></div>		</li>
