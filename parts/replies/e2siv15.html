			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your excellent explanation!</p>
<p>Do you know why capacitance and especially inductance have this &quot;lag&quot;, but resistance doesn't? </p>
<p>Also: if an inductive load like e.g. an A/C unit states that it consumes a certain wattage or amperage, which measurements do they mean?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeppers.  A capacitor is the clearest example. It charges up and the discharges “slowly” over time, much like a battery.</p>
<p>Imagine putting an AC voltage across a capacitor, flipping the voltage over and over. Because it takes time for the capacitor to charge and discharge, the current coming out won’t be timed exactly with the voltage. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Resistive loads don’t do this because theres no charging or discharging over time stuff involved in resistive loads, by definition. You could think of a resistive load as just a longer, or narrower, pipe the electrons need to go through, that’s all. </p>
<p>You said “especially inductive.”  Inductive works similarly but I’d need to brush up on the details to explain it decently, sorry!</p>
<p>Your second question: it’s talking real power (Watts), not imaginary power (Vars).  You mentioned amperage - there’s no real or imaginary current, current is just current. Remember, voltage and current are the cause, power is the effect, and the timing of them determines how much real power there is and how much power is lost/wasted due to mid-timing (which we call imaginary power).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your answer!</p>
<p>I said 'especially inductive' because I can kind of visualize electrons taking a while to accumulate and fill up a capacitor.</p>
<p>But I can't quite grok the inductive lag - the magnetic fields should intuitively appear basically immediately when current flows, or not? </p>
<p>....and i think I just answered my own question. The expanding (changing) magnetic field will essentially slow down the electrons, i guess? And the stronger the change, the more resistance it'll cause?</p></div>		</li>

<p>But wouldn't it be possible to deliver disproportional amounts of power through a lower-amp-rated cable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most consumer appliances will list the active power, because that's what your power company bills you. </p>
<p>Industrial units will usually list Apparent Power and Power Factor, so the enginerd can figure out the cabling and Power Factor correction needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason capacitive and inductive loads have lag but resistance doesnt is because of the electric and magnetic fields created when current or voltage goes through an inductor or capacitor. </p>
<p>As current goes through an inductor, a magnetic field is created by the very initial current going through it, meaning we see current coming out of the inductor slightly later than expected by a couple nanoseconds or microseconds depending on the inductors value. As the current stops flowing (we turn off the power supply) the magnetic field begins to reduce in magnitude, and a changing magnetic field creates current in the inductor, so the current created by the magnetic field happens after the initial current was pushed through the inductor, and that current at the end, the lagging current, was the energy that initially created the magnetic field in the inductor. The same logic applies to a voltage put on a capacitor and the resulting electric field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A classic way we use this to our advantage is the capacitative dropper power supply. Put a capacitor in series with your load, chosen so the reactance across it is equal to your supply voltage (110/240) - the voltage your circuit needs.</p></div>		</li>
