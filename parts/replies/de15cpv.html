			<div class="markdown"><p>A screwdriver, a can of compressed air, and a few minutes of blowing can do wonders. Just be sure to wear a dust mask while you do it. They can be found at any hardware store. Inhaling dust kicked up from a can of compressed air is <strong>not</strong> fun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>more likely just a dirty heatsink, unless the thermal compound wasn't applied correctly to begin with. Unfortunately, with many laptops cleaning the heatsink with more than compressed air takes an hour or two of disassembly and reassembly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fucking this. All it takes is a minor schedule to keep shit working properly, take canned air to the insides once a month (if you have good ventilation, more if not), run your antivirus and updates once a week (at least), run performance checks every so often and replace components as needed, and that includes thermal pastes, fans and the occasional necessary to run items. I just had to replace my motherboard because the previous one ended up being a lower quality than advertised and I didn't do proper homework on it (budget and all, live and learn).</p></div>		</li>
