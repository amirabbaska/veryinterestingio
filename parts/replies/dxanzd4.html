			<div class="markdown"><p>On two-stroke engines, the diverging and converting &quot;expansion chambers&quot; are vital to performance and their dimensions are tuned precisely to produce a reflected pulse of pressure at a given time to help scavenge more exhaust from the cylinder and produce more power. So they are not &quot;tuned&quot; they ARE tuned. Same principle applies to four stroke engines on cars to a lesser extent...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct!<br />
Here's the 4 stroke version. 4 stroke engines have valve overlap. At the start of the intake cycle, the piston is at or near top dead center, causing very little suck or push and both intake and exhaust valves are slightly open.<br />
All non boost engine exhaust are designed so all 4 pipes go into one, that's called the collector. So now, during the phase above, another cylinder in that bank is pushing exhaust out it's pipe, causing a vacuum in the pipe that is in overlap, pulling air/fuel from the intake into the cylinder, helping to pre-fill it.<br />
Race engines have large overlap cams, the lumpy idle is just poor vacuum at idle and some reversion back up the intake runner. Exhaust tuning is crucial. In a race header you try and get the runners as close to equal length as possible and then play with the length of the collector tube. Your normal engines have very little overlap (smooth idle) so this is not important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ill take a picture of the routing the pipes do off this 2-stroke diesel before it ends with a cheap looking tin tip with 1 loose screw holding it.  No reason I couldn't straighten the pipe out, make it bigger and just flatten the end similar?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what is the advantage of making it flow faster?  I assume the same volume would be exhausted either way (with a change in pressure?).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this... by reducing the cross sectional area of flow, the velocity of flow increases by the laws of hydrodynamics (defined and illustrated by the Bernoulli equation) and, because warm air rises, it lifts out of the cooling tower.  The increased flow rate increases cooling rate.</p></div>		</li>
