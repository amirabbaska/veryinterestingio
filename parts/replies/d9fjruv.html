			<div class="markdown"><p>The kit you're talking about there - which printed those shiny paper galleys - would have been a Lintoype Linotronic. </p>
<p>Back in the 80s, my dad worked for a major UK newspaper doing exactly what you described (great explanation by the way!) it would be hilarious if you knew him. The older Linotronics had paper tape and 8&quot; floppy drives! </p>
<p>By the late 80s/early 90s, my dad owned a couple of print companies and was mostly using Macs, so WYSIWYG pretty much killed the pasteup artist's role, (though it was still sometimes necessary). I still remember those big green boards with alignment markers and a grid on them, the Xacto blades, the little rollers, the trays of heated wax, and those weird little foldaway microscope things. Good times. Thanks for the reminisce! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I was actually still doing mechanical pasteup in 1997 - 1999, even though we had computers! This was for a pretty big alternative weekly, the Washington (DC) City Paper.</p>
<p>We used computers to lay out individual elements - a story or a display spread or an ad or a classified section - but the full mechanicals for each tabloid-sized page were still done on big green boards. Why? Because we changed a lot of things on the fly. </p>
<p>It's much faster and easier to physically pick up a 1/4 page ad and move it to another page than go back to the Quark file, make the change, and then reprint the entire page. So even though we had finished each individual element on the screen, we still used hot wax and razor blades to finalize the layout of each page.</p>
<p>Now that you can output the plates directly from a desktop-publishing file (as noted by an earlier poster), this is no longer the case. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Quark </p>

<p>I hated Quark so much.</p>
<p>I originally trained on Ventura then on to Pagemaker.</p>
<p>Didn't matter if a client used Mac or PC, Pagemaker files transferred flawlessly.  Quark files on the other hand were always a nightmare.</p>
<p>I used to love doing paste ups, but the one thing I hated was spotting - painting out hairs, dust motes on enlarged negatives.</p>
<p>Spending what seemed hours with a 10 hair brush on a billboard sized lightbox with the huge negatives hanging on it.</p>
<p>Place I left in 2005 was still making metal plates the old fashioned way for their older 2 presses.</p>
<p>It's amazing that what used to be a long drawn out process to take artwork to plate or even producing a colour proof (remember the pain in the arse Cromalin system?) is now accomplished by sending it straight to plate from a computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was still doing mechanical pasteup in the late '90s as well. We did the majority of the layout in Quark, but our print vendor could only accept printed sheets so we would have to wax them on to boards. </p>
<p>Which wouldn't have been so bad except our office printer could only print 8.5&quot;x11&quot; pages and the spreads were larger than that. So we would print at full size and it would come out in four sheets, and we would have to trim the sheets so that the four would fit together like a puzzle (masters of hot wax and razor blades). All before the wax cooled.</p>
<p>And then we went to color (just the front and back cover fortunately), and each cyan, magenta, yellow and black layers had to be laid out separately, so sixteen sheets all lined up perfectly!</p>
<p>We got an 11&quot;x17&quot; printer in the near the end which solved that cutting, and then they moved to digital submission soon after I left in the early '00s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely agree - it was usually because of a last-minute change to advertising. </p>
<p>Anyway, I'm not sure we've actually <em>lost</em> anything by the way they do things now, but at the time, computerization was hugely contentious and the print unions went mental even though there weren't many jobs lost. I mentioned my dad worked for a UK newspaper; he was actually the guy helping it to embrace technology. Their R&amp;D guy as it were. Part of his role was to teach the pasteup artists to use the Macs, (&quot;So... this is a mouse.&quot;). </p>
<p>Some of them didn't take it too well. </p>
<p>Anyway, I'm way off-topic now but enjoyed this trip to the past. Cheers! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All correct save one thing. This is photo-offset, using an optical phototypesetter. I am familiar with these beasts - I clocked myself at 80WPM on one, when I was filling in for a sick typist. (I was usually on Layout, I was good with knife and wax, too.)</p>
<p>Small newspapers are fun. You get to do everything.</p>
<p>Anyway - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototypesetting" target="_blank">Phototypesetting</a> and offset was a vast improvement over the Linotype process and the big but slow presses that ran off composited type. A lot less labor, a lot less <del>topic</del> toxic, much cheaper (And therefore nobody cared how expensive they still were) ... and they lasted for about a decade. Totally killed by the desktop computer and early DTP applications.</p>
<p>Now everything is computerized and it goes directly from the desktop to the pressroom, what happens there depends on the exact sort of press being used, but in modern shops, the printing plate is generated directly from the digital files. The plate itself is the first physical thing to be touched by human hands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a digital printer operator that works in a place that prints offset, engraving, and a few other things. More and more gets taken off the press and given to me, I'm certain in max 10 years there won't be plates anymore, just digital. A lot of typesetting is automated now too, grabbing names off the website, running it through the template, then sending it out to me to print. An order can come in and be printed within minutes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I did that from about age 9 to 12, also went around every month door-to-door with a bag of money to collect payments and give change. (Do they even allow kids to deliver anymore? It would have to be a huge risk today). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was the papergirl for my community newspaper for two years in high school. then they mandated we start paying the company to put all the flyers in the papers. Since the paper didn't have a set price and I only got paid what the people on my route cared to pay, I refused (I was making out like a bandit on the route because I was on time and dropped the papers right on the step, but if the paper wasn't going to guarantee my earnings I saw no reason why I should give up a third of my monthly income for the convenience of not doing my own flyers). They said if I didn't agree to pay the money I couldn't keep delivering papers. I said that's fine because I'm old enough to be hired somewhere else now and then took the job I'd been offered at a daycare for the summer.</p></div>		</li>
