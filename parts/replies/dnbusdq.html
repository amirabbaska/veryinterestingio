			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm.  If a human has <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/there-are-372-trillion-cells-in-your-body-4941473/" target="_blank">37ish trillion</a> cells, and they lose 10%, then they lose 3.7ish trillion cells.  Supposedly the brain has <a href="https://www.livescience.com/32311-how-many-cells-are-in-the-brain.html" target="_blank">100</a> billion cells, the liver, heart, and fat have <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/10/23/how-many-cells-are-in-your-body/" target="_blank">200ish, 2ish, and 50ish</a> billion cells respectively....etc, etc.  You would be quite a hot mess losing 10% of your cells...</p>
<p>Edit:  I will note that I am not implying that the brain will be lost first, then another part of the body, etc.  I was just showing what 10% of the cells in a human body looks like.  But thank you to those who explained what I didn't :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing that the loss wouldn't be proportional to all tissues. The sensitives like nerves would take a much bigger blow than big simple adipose cells. So a person would end up a brainless fat blob.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mathematically spot on, but biology doesn't work that way. The freezing isn't, at least not at our current technology, capable of being a precisely-directed process. It's random. Imagine losing 3.7 trillion neural cells; that's a significant chunk of risk depending on where those 3.7 comes from. You can end up either giving a permanent amnesia, or aphasia, or even lobotomising that person upon thawing. Bad idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sperm is life? I thought i was more like a virus in terms of &quot;life&quot;, although i guess it does have DNA, I never really got why viruses weren't alive anyway as the only difference i know if is that they have RNA.</p>
<p>idk what i'm talking about.</p></div>		</li>

Neither reproduce (on its own) as they come from pre-cursor cells.</p>

<p>Just to help confuse you more; Some viruses do have DNA, some have 2 strands of DNA in them.</p></div>		</li>
