<p>that depends on the testing lab... there is more &quot;sharing&quot; going on now, but for a long time it was only sequenced against those already on file.</p>
<p>there is still not a good database for native american dnaj or african american either for that matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of these companies do not use sequencing but microarrays for genotyping. Sequencing would be crazy expensive. You also throw the word mutation way to often, these are genetic variations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said. Going off this: for forensics, the name of that technique is DNA fingerprinting. From what I've learned, the number of loci (regions of the DNA) they look at is between 13 and 17. These are areas (unlike most of the genome as a whole) that are likely to be different in each individual. We don't sequence the whole genome because it would be too time costly, expensive, and unnecessary. The mutations at one locus don't affect whether or not there's a mutation at another of these loci, so there's a very small chance that unrelated individuals match at all of the loci. These few loci can usually tell us if a sample from a crime scene matches an individual. But they're far from perfect, and false positives do happen a lot more than you'd expect. It's a difficult science, and the chance of false convictions with forensic evidence is a bit scary. </p></div>		</li>
