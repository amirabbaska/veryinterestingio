			<div class="markdown"><p>My first cat totally ignored catnip but showed the exact same reactions as other cats with catnip when she was exposed to fresh basil.  I've spoken with other owners that mentioned the same (ignore catnip, loved basil).  I know the two plants are related, is it also nepetalactone or a related chemical?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm bored at work and have access to the equipment..I may have to try this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Big Cat Rescue (in Tampa, FL) frequently gives their cats such treats as catnip. And we're talking lions, tigers, leopards, bobcats, servals, etc. Some like it, some don't. Here are two of their videos:</p>

<p>BCR does a lot of things like that for their cats, and puts the videos on YouTube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347266801008?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">this paper from 1966</a>, the absence of gonads does not inhibit the response in sensitive cats.</p>
<p>Interestingly, though, and as others have pointed out here, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomeronasal_organ" target="_blank">vomeronasal organ</a> is not required for the response, though the nearby olfactory bulb is.</p></div>		</li>
