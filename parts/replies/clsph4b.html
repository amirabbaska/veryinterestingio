			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. This dr is correct of course. We had one the size of an apricot in a guys right atrium. Every time he bore down (eg pooped, valsalva) he passed out.
There are several different types of primary cardiac tumors and are usually relatively treatable but may require open heart surgery.
There can also be metastatic lesions originating from elsewhere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I realize this is a bad thing but when i got to the part about passing out every time hes poops i lost it. It would suck so much if instead of playing angry birds you wake up on the floor still having to go. Unless it happens anyway then it would be even more crappy when you came to. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is what I came here to say. So, there are actual primary heart tumors in addition mobile cancer immigrating in? TIL</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not. But the end result is the same. Heart failure, stroke, death. I think it was just the way he worded it..  The tiny tumor attached to a heart valve ready to fling off a little piece at any time causing a stroke. To me stroke is what is terrifying. I would rather be cognizant, and then die suddenly. But being half paralyzed and losing brain function and then living on barely functioning... That is what is truly terrifying </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I came here to say something similar but the top of the thread has been hijacked by a humorous typo. I knew someone who tried to kill herself after her Mum died of atrial myxoma, so heart cancer can be very nasty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but. It's not very helpful to draw a strict distinction here. The line between benign and malignant can be hazy, malignancies can arise from benign lesions and benign lesions can be fatal, and not just in the heart. If you're a pathologist then it might be meaningful, but if you tell a patient they have an abnormal mass of growing cells that's going to kill them but isn't cancer, it's benign, <a href="http://youtu.be/G2y8Sx4B2Sk" target="_blank">then you are going to have a bad time</a>. Conceptually I think you are better off bundling benign and malignant tumours together and then adding in ideas of metastasis and invasion and growth rate. I tend to think of all of these entities as &quot;cancer&quot; and then judge them on their merits. Then you won't be surprised that a stage 1 renal cell carcinoma (malignant) has a better prognosis than a grade 2 astrocytoma (benign). But yes, my example is hardly a counter to OP's question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fairness, I think most normal people tumor = cancer, and they don't bother to think that it's only <em>malignant</em> tumors that are &quot;cancer&quot;  I mean, the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2l9drw/eli5_how_come_i_hear_about_cancer_in_every_organ/clsph4b" target="_blank">thread opener</a> used atrial myxomas as an example of 'heart cancer'</p>
<p>Source: Opening your link did nothing to assure me it's not cancer.  Also, related:</p>
<p>TIL: cancer is only <em>malignant</em> tumors, not just any tumor.</p></div>		</li>
