<p>Demonstrably false, no? Bernie Madoff shows that you can either provide value or just trick people into thinking you provide value. The problem with the complexity of this industry is that it might not be necessary, but it most certainly enables bad actors to deceive others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but of the thousands of Wall Street companies,  this is the single example. The system is far better at weeding out the bad companies than you give it credit for.  Sometimes the criminals are just genuinely good at being criminals.  And even he got caught in the end. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You just proved the above point. Madoff didn't provide value for stakeholders and his scheme is no longer up and running. There was actually value received  for awhile, which is how a ponzi scheme works, people were receiving payoffs. But once the illusions of how this value was created was reviewed, it was overly apparent that it was unsustainable and thus no longer value giving. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...your comment implies it simply stopped generating value. That isn't accurate. It generated negative value, robbing investors of funds they were told they had. The end result was not simply a cessation of value generation, but a massively negative impact on those that invested with him (Madoff).</p></div>		</li>
