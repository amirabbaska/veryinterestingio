			<div class="markdown"><p>He just kind of listed the differences of multiple glasses.  Just wanted to add some additional explanations.<br />
It mostly changes the presentation, not the flavor. Although the glasses that help concentrate the aroma do sort of change the flavor as flavor has a lot to do with smell. When you go for a drink, imagine your nose entering a tiny cloud of concentrated odors from your beverage. Except, on a very marginalized size. Also there is sort of a difference between sipping and gulping, but I like to chalk that up to a difference in flavor experience. Like eating a snickers when you're already full vs starving. Still the same flavor but experienced differently</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To a degree, it makes sense. Taste is heavily influenced by the way in which something smells. Hence, something that influences the way in which this smell is directed towards the nose will affect its flavour. Moreover, the mind plays an important role in taste. Therefore, it's arguable that the glass and its presentation of the liquid will influence the taste. But, as this is conjecture on my part, the use of purported is apt. </p></div>		</li>
