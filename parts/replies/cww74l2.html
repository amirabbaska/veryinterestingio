			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard one reason humans get age related diseases is because generally we don't produce children after about 40 so our Genetics stops improving after that point. </p>
<p>If humans could reproduce into their 90's I think old age issues would become less and less common with each generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that if we reproduced at older ages our genes would magically improve and we would live longer.</p>
<p>If we evolved in such a way that reproduction was feasible and beneficial at much older ages then certainly we would live longer.</p>
<p>However, we didn't evolve in a way that living past a certain age was beneficial to our ability to pass on genes, because our offspring will pass along those genes for us. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't say anything about magically living longer only that they will live more healthy lives. This is if (a big if) the healthy elderly people have more kids than younger people. The genetic traits for living healthy into old age will become more common for future generations over hundreds or thousands of years against the people who only have kids at a younger ages.</p>
<p>As a side note in our current society we work jobs and live in houses so if a large % of humans want to work and pay off their mortgage before having kids than my pretend theory could work out.</p></div>		</li>
