<ul>
<li>Short Period Building, Long Period Building. </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/EQTips/EQTip10.pdf" target="_blank">This</a> is a very good explanation. Read it. [short pdf]</p>
<p>When the ground shakes, the base of a building
moves with the ground, and the building swings back and-forth.
The time taken (T) for one oscillation is useful for characterizing the kind of structure in earthquakes. It depends on the building height, mass and rigidity. A short building has low period of oscillation. A tall thin building, a chimney, a water tower, or a suspension bridge can take a long time for one back-and-forth motion.</p>
<p>Most buildings are flexible, and different parts
move back-and-forth by different amounts (compared to the ground)</p>
<p>[Aside: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance" target="_blank">Resonance</a> is a phenomenon where, when the natural frequency of vibration matches that of an periodic exciting force, even a small force can produce large vibrations (oversimplified by ignoring harmonics) ]</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_acceleration" target="_blank">Spectral Acceleration</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>One can measure peak ground acceleration, but for <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~bakerjw/Publications/Baker_Cornell_\(2006\)_Which_Sa,_EQ_Spectra.pdf" target="_blank">design</a> the <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/about/technical.php#accel" target="_blank">spectral oscillation</a> is more useful.</p>
<p>The Spectral Acceleration is more approximately what is experienced by a building (and is modeled based on a particle mass on a massless vertical rod having the same natural period of vibration as the building). </p>
<p>[Aside: A spectrum looks at all different frequencies] </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.asce.org/templates/publications-book-detail.aspx?id=6725" target="_blank">ASCE 7-10</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are the minimum design standards for a building as defined by the American Society for Civil  Engineers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>USGS refers to the US Geological Survey. while <a href="http://www.academia.edu/7842549/USGS_update_of_earthquake_loading_data_provided_in_2013_edition_of_Unified_Facilities_Criteria_3-301-01_Structural_Engineering" target="_blank">UFC</a> (unified facilities criteria) refers to a design standard for structures that the USGS creates for the Dept of Defense (and tries to keep in sync with ASCE standards)</p>
</li>
<li>[Maximum Considered Earthquake]( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_hazard" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_hazard</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>For buildings (as opposed to, say, dams) the earthquake hazard is figured out on basis of a simple probabilistic Max Considered Earthquake.  </p>
<p>The design code presumably asks you to consider 2/3rds of that (design earthquake) </p>
<p>So now you can specify the maximum spectral acceleration of (max earthquake intensity) for a 0.3 second period building as 0.56 g; 2/3 of that is the 'design earthquake'. </p>
<p>Similarly for the long period building.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>So now /u/engrit can say that the Nepal EQ (earthquake)'s characteristic max spectral acceleration would exceed that of NYC design standard for short / short period buildings but not that of long period buildings (skyscrapers) leading to his conclusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EQs likely don't control most buildings in New York though, most would likely be controlled by wind</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This points out that for most buildings in New York, the building design is more governed/limited by wind considerations rather than earthquake. (though the cyclical loads of an earthquake are different and may result in significant damage requiring later demolishing of a damaged/unsafe building).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which could have been further reduced to something like:</p>
<p>&quot;Due to their characteristics and construction requirements tall buildings in New York would not suffer much damage, whereas the small and medium buildings would suffer significantly or be devastad. Below are the technical reasons for that:&quot;</p>
<p>I mean to keep it simple enough for the layman.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly! Some good examples and great explanations! Thank you! Its a pain typing all this on a phone so didn't put in any links, probably should have haha also with resonance/harmonics you can get it at frequencies other than the natural (higher modal frequencies, there are as many resonance frequencies as floors on a building) and those are very cool to see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, didn't want to get into harmonics, so just tagged oversimplified  on it. (minor edit now)</p>
<p>Thanks for a good post, I see you have updated explanations ...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Although they've now amended it with a bit of explanation, at this point I'd probably grasp it.</p></div>		</li>
