			<div class="markdown"><p>It'd be the same as pushing on a door with 100kg force on each side, or zero kg, it doesn't matter since the forces are equal until you push on it. The net force is still just you pushing on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm well aware of Newton's Third Law.</p>
<p>Let's simplify this a bit.</p>
<p>W - S - W</p>
<p>If substance S is a soft, jello-like substance, with 1 micronewton of force exerted by W on each side, it will neither move nor deform. If, however, the force applied on both sides were 100 kilonewtons, both would deform S until they came into close contact.</p>
<p>Try it yourself by squeezing something between your hands, both hands applying equal force.</p>
<p>This does not, in any way, contradict Newton's Third Law.</p>
<p>Edit: grammar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but this isn't an ideal scenario. I'm assuming 10000kg on both sides will compress the door a little. Not that kg is a unit of force (assuming they meant 10000 kg * 10 m/s/s = 100000 N)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If however, the wood that the door was made of grew its entire life under that pressure than the wood is made to wothstand this pressure. Since the air inside the wood has the same pressure, the door will not be squashed, since there will be 10,000 kg of force from inside the wood pushing outside towards all directions at the same time as well.</p></div>		</li>
