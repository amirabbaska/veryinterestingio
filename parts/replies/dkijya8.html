<p>Principally yes, but then again you can come up with weird scenarios where the e.g. <a href="https://phys.org/news/2007-01-mach-scientists-faster.html" target="_blank">the group velocity of your phonons becomes faster than the speed of light</a>. Of course information can still only be transferred at subluminal speed.</p>
<p>With saying that atoms can only affect each other at most at the speed of light you are always on the save side - de facto it will usually be significantly slower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just saying that these interactions can only travel at the speed of sound in that medium or slower. It would be better to call the velocities subsonic.
The cases where the group velocity was made to be superluminal are purposefully generated, and don't apply to wave propagation through solids.
I did not know of this phenomenon before this though, so thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I've understood that report correctly, performing that demonstration and claiming you've made something go FTL is like pointing a laser at the moon, flicking your wrist, and claiming the laser dot moved FTL. None of the sound waves involved in the demo actually went that fast, the interference between them was just tuned precisely to make an apparent peak go that fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of sound is dependent on the material in use. This question has a hypothetical, unnamed material being used so saying it can't be faster than the speed of sound is not really helpful when the obvious follow-up question of &quot;Well, what's the speed of sound here?&quot; is that you don't know. You do know that the speed of sound must be less than the speed of light though.</p>

<p>I wouldn't say it's &quot;not really helpful&quot; if that's the truth of the matter.  This is askscience not ELI5, and suggesting a speed of sound relative to the material is easily understandable or explained if necessary.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Shouldn't this be &quot;If you do something with one end of the rod it can only affect the other end after a delay equal to the distance of the two points divided by the speed of sound.&quot;  </p>
<p>As it's the speed of sound for the material that measure the speed that kinetic energy passed from molecule to molecule through that material.  </p>
<p>EDIT:  Ok, about 50 other people made this same point.  I should read first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As no material is given, we don't know the speed of sound. </p>
<p>But we know that the distance over the speed of light is a lower boundary for any interaction between two photons (edit: atoms) including phonons but also more any other interaction you can come with in order to built something that behaves like a rigid body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question I've always wondered: what if for example  you had a massive train traveling at near light speed. Within that train you had another train on tracks inside traveling at a high rate of speed as well. And then inside that train you had something like a really fast motorcycle or something all traveling in the same direction : forward. Would it be possible that from an outside perspective that the motorcycle or even the interior train were traveling faster than light ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, nothing would be traveling faster than light. The Mistake that is being made is assuming that speeds can be summed together. This is a safe and easy assumption to work with at low velocities, but at relativistic velocities, another formula must be used in order to compensate for relativistic effects. The actual formula that should be used is u=(v+u')/(1+(v x u')/c^2 ) where u is the combined velocity, v is the relative velocity of object 1, u' is the relative velocity of object 2, and c is the speed of light.  As long as v x u' remains substantially smaller than c^2 velocities it doesn't affect the sum of the velocities, but near the speed of light it becomes the dominate effect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have also wondered the same question as above you.</p>
<p>So, let's say it's a rocket in space with a rocket track built on it, with another rocket track built on it, with another rocket track etc etc etc etc.  or probably some sort of weird particle thingy that launches another particle thing etc etc etc.</p>
<p>You're saying that even though particle thingy 1 (pt1) is being propelled at 1/2c, launches pt2 at 1/2c, which launches pt3 at 1/2C, etc etc etc etc...</p>
<p>We would need to get a particle (let's call it pt10001) up to more than c2 before it would actually be seen as faster than the speed of light (c)?</p>
<p>Also, is someone working on my particle thingies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, and here's one way to conceptualize it: As the bigger train moves really fast, it actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction" target="_blank">becomes a shorter train</a> along its direction of movement. At least, as seen by an outside observer still standing at the train-station.</p>
<p>This has an interesting effect on the smaller-train inside, because the observer will disagree with the passengers about how long the whole inner-track is. The observer thinks the small train is actually going a shorter distance in the same amount of time, which means a slower speed than the passengers measure. The effect repeats for the motorcycle and however many other layers you want to add. </p>
<p>That's why nothing &quot;moving normally&quot; can ever exceed light-speed -- the speed you are going actually affects your measurement of time and space. Everybody always measures the same speed for light itself, even when they aren't moving the same speed as each-other. They just disagree over how far (or how long) the trip took.</p></div>		</li>
