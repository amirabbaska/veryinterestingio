<p>For instance wouldn't there be hard limits somewhere in the UV and IR set by the atmosphere, based on what gases it contains?   </p>
<p>Edit: I guess what I'm saying is obviously there is a slight difference, but it's still most likely to be in the visible range of the spectrum, and therefore not any harder to detect than chlorophyll.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, both contribute (as does water, where photosynthesis originally evolved on Earth, and is presumably most likely to on other planets).
But among the things that go through a more or less Earth-like atmosphere, the star determines the distribution of wavelengths.</p>
<p>If you check <a href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/news/20070411/173119main_graph_spectrum_lg.jpg" target="_blank">this graph</a>, you can see the difference between the light that reaches the surface of Earth, and what it would be if Earth was orbiting other types of stars. F2V is a hotter star, K2V is a cooler star and the M stars are much cooler.</p>
<p>Our spectrum peaks in the red, but stays pretty high up through blue. Earth plants absorb some red and yellow, and lots of the higher-energy blue and violet light; green in-between is not absorbed so much (obviously).</p>
<p>Around a hot star, the red graph, the peak is in the blue, falling off quickly at shorter wavelengths but extending into the red. Our plants probably wouldn't mind that spectrum much. Native plants could look like ours.</p>
<p>But then look at the pink and green graphs of cool stars. There isn't even much red light, and nearly no blue. Our plants would hate it. Plants from such a planet would almost certainly use infrared light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The different orbital radii shouldn't matter too much; if we assume roughly constant temperature and a similar atmosphere, then the total insolation should also be roughly the same. Just means planets have to orbit closer to cooler stars to fit the criteria, and at greater distance from hotter stars (but there are a lot fewer of those).</p>
<p>The spectrum is just shaped differently, but delivering roughly the same energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not entirely sure what you're saying here, and I don't want to pick a fight disagreeing with something that we don't actually disagree on.  Are you saying that differences in <em>spectra</em> shouldn't matter or differences in <em>intensity</em> shouldn't matter?</p>
<p>Because if you're saying the former then I certainly disagree.  There may very well be chemicals that are more sensitive to other colors than Chlorophyll are, and life based upon those reactions would be favored.  Different chemicals are active in different wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>If you're saying that intensity shouldn't matter then you may be right.  Then again maybe not.  Certainly we can point to <em>terrestrial</em> examples of certain plant life that are advantaged because or greater or lesser light intensity.  Moss grows on the northern sides of trees in the northern hemisphere because the intensity of light is less than that of the southern side.  Is it really so far-fetched to suggest a different chemical might be favored in high- or low-intensity conditions?  Perhaps not on Earth, as we can see that all our plant life is chlorophyll based. (note: I assume that, but I might be wrong.  Do you know of an example?  I'd love to hear one.)  But perhaps conditions elsewhere favor might favor other forms of plant life by a less dramatic margin, and intensity makes the difference.</p>
<p>Oh, and on top of all that?  There's the dependence on orbital radii of season length.  Who knows what impact a 14-month winter might have on this speculative plant life.  And since we're talking about seasons then we have to consider rotational inclination.  Is that the term for it?  I just looked it up.  It's <em>axial tilt</em>, apparently.</p>
<p>We're speculating on life that we know nothing about on a planet we know nothing about based upon a chemistry we know nothing about.  Or at best, <em>very little</em> about - in each of these cases.  I would just say that <em>There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.</em></p></div>		</li>
