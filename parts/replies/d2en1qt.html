			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you brought up MSG and cream of tartar. They are indeed salts, and have their own &quot;taste&quot; profiles. Cream of tartar being... weird? Can't describe it. MSG being like bacon grease without the grease. Salty and savory, I guess. Someone brought up ammonium nitrate earlier too. Definitely has it's own unique flavor.</p>
<p>Lead diacetate is a good example, so is sodium acetate which tastes like vinegar and is used in a lot of salt and &quot;vinegar&quot; chips. There are also gluconates, lactates, and other organic acid bonded salts with their own properties and flavors. I guess lactic acid could technically be a salt of hydrogen and lactate ions, and it has a taste like plain yogurt.</p>
<p>Isn't taste fun?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See this is what I don't understand though. In most neurons, the sodium channels arr closed at rest, which is the reason that neurons can depolarize from sodium in the first place.</p>
<p>But clearly this cant be exactly how gustatory receptors for saltiness work - if the Na+ channels aren't gated, then there wouldn't be a resting Vm to depolarize. And sodium gated sodium channels just wouldn't work for the same reason. </p>
<p>So do the olfactory receptor cells express some specialised pumps or ions that keep Na+ concentration low extracellularly? (Like in the cochlea?) </p></div>		</li>
