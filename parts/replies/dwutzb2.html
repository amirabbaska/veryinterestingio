			<div class="markdown"><p>For a fun demonstration of this. </p>
<p>Hold your arm out, extend your fingers so that they are straight, then relax. Focus on the feeling of the muscles. </p>
<p>Notice how your fingers curl up as soon as you relax without them doing anything. </p>
<p>Also notice how the shape will fit almost perfectly over a mouse. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OR is it just as simple as muscle tightness from being in certain similiar psitions all day? We spend a lot of time holding things as opposed to bieng fully oustretched.</p>
<p>Walk around for a year with terrible posture then see how it feels straightening up again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just that, but basic mechanics. It's extremely difficult to make a hinge bend by pulling straight through the joint itself; mostly what you achieve is to put pressure on the joint. You need some degree of sideways pull. Simplistically, the further away from the centre line you apply the force (i.e. the pull through the tendon), the more leverage you get, and the less stress you put directly on the joint. So having a basic design of fingers that are naturally slightly bent when relaxed makes good sense - the pull starts off-centre, it takes way less energy to start them bending further, and puts less direct pressure on/through the joints.</p></div>		</li>
