<p>Your questions seems to have the implicit premise that supporting a stationary weight requires a constant input of energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's an electromagnet, so yes, it would require a constant input of energy: namely, the voltage required to produce a current large enough to generate an electromagnetic field large enough to hold it in place.</p>
<p>Your post seems to be working off the assumption that <em>permanent magnets</em> are used in MagLev trains. They aren't: <em>electromagnets</em> are used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is why you can suspend a magnetic material on top of a superconducting surface  with no further work required than that to keep the superconductor below its critical temperature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is called the Meissner Effect and is irrelevant to the topic in question. The Meissner Effect is not used for MagLev trains as it only works for small masses: once the mass gets too large (for example, a train) then the superconductor can no longer expel the magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If an electromagnet is supporting a stationary weighted magnet, electricity is being used, but no energy is consumed on supporting the weight. All the energy is spent on heating up the conductor.</p>
<p>If the magnet <em>moves</em>, then the moving field will induce an EMF in the conductor which constitutes energy spent on moving the magnet.</p>
<p>But an electromagnet which is levitating a stationary train, uses as much energy as the same electromagnet operating in isolation with no &quot;load&quot; on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But all you need is the currents. You don't actually want to &quot;spend&quot; that energy on anything. Sure, you have energy losses but those can be made small via careful engineering. You have to generate the currents but once you have them you only suffer the losses from resistance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's why the original question asks why overcoming drag is lower than the energy used to maintain the levitation, implying there is indeed some energy used. Just less.</p></div>		</li>
