<p>The higher energy state would manifest as heat in most things.  In the eye, it manifests via a receptor that reacts to the higher energy state by sending a signal to the brain.  (Though in practice, it would take far more than just a single photon to stimulate this process).</p>

<p>Surprisingly and remarkably, humans are capable of perceiving single photons. <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/people-can-sense-single-photons-1.20282" target="_blank">source</a> </p>
<p>For those wanting to learn more, the biochemical cascade that converts photons into neuronal signals is called phototransduction. It takes place via a classic biological signaling mechanism and I’m sure there are a bunch of YouTube videos out there describing the process. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A very technical point: humans are capable of <em>detecting</em> a single photon. Perception, or the brain’s experience of sensory input, requires a bit more stimulation to create the sensation of light </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True.  I was speaking in the context of &quot;seeing.&quot;  from the source article you posted (very interesting by the way, thank you for posting it):  &quot;The most amazing thing is that it’s not like seeing light. It’s almost a feeling, at the threshold of imagination.&quot;  The article doesn't get into much depth about how we use threshold detection.  We are very good at comparing changes.  So nothing to one photon can be detected, but we can't perceive the difference between 1 million photons and 1 million and one photons.</p>
<p>There we a recent article that applied this to our ability to detect the weight of objects.  Basically, we know the difference between holding 5 and ten pounds, but not 50 and 55 pounds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not that 0 time goes by for the photon, but that the concept of proper time itself is inapplicable to it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It isn't. Energy is a property. A photon <em>has</em> energy. It also has momentum, but nobody says a photon <em>is</em> momentum.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, all the energy a photon has is in its momentum. You make it sound like there is energy elsewhere, too.</p></div>		</li>
