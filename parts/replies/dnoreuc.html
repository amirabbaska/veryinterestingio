			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this somewhat apply to the kidney as well since it acts as a type of filtration system? I understand that kidneys take a lot of abuse but I'm not sure if it would have any cell regenerative abilities as the liver does. I apologize in advance if this is a silly question. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, the kidneys typically deal with what the liver releases when it metabolizes harmful chemicals. These less harmful chemicals are usually modified by the liver to make them easier for the kidney to filter out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most solitary liver cysts are benign and a fairly common finding on abdominal CT.  They are not a cancer risk.</p>
<p>If you have multiple cysts, then we may look for other causes.  If you're lived in or recently travelled to a developing country, we may consider a parasitic infection.  We also may consider parasites if you have a compromised immune system (e.g. positive history of HIV).  In the developed world, finding multiple cysts may be a sign that cancer in another part of the body has metastasized to the liver.</p>
<p>If you've been diagnosed with a cyst in the passed and your doctors cleared you, then I wouldn't worry too much about it.</p></div>		</li>
