<p>I'm not disputing, I'm just curious how that experimentation could be achieved with early 20th century technology.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ok so first off, ground rule, light always travels at the same speed in a vacuum.</p>
<p>You have a device in your space ship traveling at a high % the speed of light. In your device is a vacuum tube a photon emitter(light) a photon sensor and a mirror. Inside the vacuum chamber the light emits a single photon 90Â° to your space ships direction of travel. This photon travels 1 meter, hits the mirror, reflects back and the sensor records the time taken. Lets call this time 2T. 1T being time from light to mirror.</p>
<p>So see 2T no matter how fast you are travelling as light moves at the same speed and the distances dont change.</p>
<p>But an outside observer sees something different. To them the light, mirror and receiver are moving so is the light pulse sideways. You get <a href="http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/252/srelwhat_files/image017.gif" target="_blank">this effect</a></p>
<p>This increaces the distance the light mist travel, but wait, light travels at the same speed! So it MUST take longer to travel the longer distance right? Well it does so time must be running differently for the static observer and you on your space ship.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ue5Xi.gif" target="_blank">In this animation</a> the pulses are moving along the paths at the same speed. The static one on the left gets more pulses in the time the moving one does on the right so time on the moving one is slower.</p>
<p>Hope that helped explain how you can visualise it. Sorry if it doesnt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good explanation, similar to ones I've read before.</p>
<p>I guess what I'm asking is that how did we conclude that time is the factor that varies rather than distance?  Neither one of them are &quot;intuitive&quot; variances but we landed on time as the variable factor, wondering why.</p>
<p>As an aside, how does an observer know the speed of a photon that is not detected by that observer?  We say that an observer sees a photon passing by and they observe it as travelling at <em>c</em>, but without the photon colliding with the observer for detection, how can the observer know the speed?</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to answer.</p></div>		</li>
