<p>Banks shouldn't have been writing multiple mortgages to folks that work part time at McDonalds, and folks that can't afford $1200/mo shouldn't be taking out loans with $1500/mo payments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except the problem really wasn't so much your regular Joe's loans but more  the failed investment loans.</p>
<p>Germany managed to &quot;hide&quot; from the effects (at least so far) because the loans they made to the banks that failed are being paid by the respective governments after these were coerced (not to use harsher languange) into buying the banks private debt so that they could still get paid. In the end german banks are still reliant on these governments being able to sustain the debt that the private institutions owed to them. And since it will still be several decades before the hole is completely plugged, time for something to still go wrong is not on short supply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Y'know I ran into that exact problem. Coerced by definition means &quot;used threats or violence&quot; to convince. There's a concept between coercing and convincing that I occasionally want to express but can't find a concise term for it.</p></div>		</li>
