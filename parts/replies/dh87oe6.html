			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm astonished that this has so many upvotes. I usually don't post, but this is absolutely (or very nearly absolutely) incorrect. There are <em>no chemical bonds</em> formed between soap and food particles or food particles and water. The reason soap and detergents are able remove grease from plates is that detergent molecules are hydrophilic (attracted to water) on one end and hydrophobic (attracted to grease) on the other end. This causes the detergent to form a layer in between the water and grease. This layer is not chemically bonded to anything (no electrons are shared or transferred). It's actually the <em>absence</em> of grease's ability to form hydrogen bonds with water that causes this layer to form. Without going into the details of Gibbs energy, water would rather be adjacent to more water than to grease, so water is never going to sneak in between the plate and the grease of its own accord. However, the detergent layer changes that equation and makes it favorable for the water to surround the grease and thus detach it from the plate.</p>
<p>This is a physical phenomenon, not a chemical one (I'm certain someone will challenge me on the semantics of this statement).</p>
<p>There are at least two reasons that hot water is more effective. The first is that the increased temperature increases the rate of diffusion. This means that the grease will be transferred away from the plate quickly instead of detaching and reattaching to the plate before it is washed away. The second is that hot water has a lower surface tension than cold water. Surface tension is related to the Gibbs energy that I mentioned above, and it is basically a measure of how much a substance wants to glob together with itself vs spreading out against another substance. This is why water forms droplets instead of just diffusing into the air or spreading itself out very thin over a surface. Lower surface tension means it's easier for water to penetrate the gaps between the food/grease and the plate.</p>
<p>I'm not a huge fan of this sub because it encourages the peddling of pseudoscience which sounds intuitive, but is imprecise at best and very misleading at its worst.</p>
<p>Edit: typos</p>
<p>Edit edit: The Wikipedia article on surface tension has some nice visuals on this stuff - <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_tension" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_tension</a></p>
<p>Edit edit edit: /u/gauron92 's answer is probably the best ELI5 version, details notwithstanding. They are basically saying the surface tensions of the water and grease is reduced because heat reduces each substances ability to form bonds with itself (van der Waals interactions for grease and hydrogen bonds for water). Send your upvotes thatta way, people.</p>
<p>One more edit: Since I'm just now watching Breaking Bad, in the spirit of Walter White, &quot;The chemistry must be respected!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also higher solubility, I mean if you don't use soap first, hot water is far better at cleaning than cold water alone, even vs grease, also heating things up can change the viscosity of substances, so when hot water transfers heat it makes the other thing more fluid. Also hot water has a tendency to soften some solids ( I'm not sure if this is counted as something different than viscosity but to me it is different ) so now there are more easily brushed off with a towel or. Your hand, or a scrub pad</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cold water detergents utilise recycled enzymes which lower activation energy of the chemical reaction in order to bond the soap with &quot;dirty&quot; particles. This allows the detergents to be relatively temperature independent. They are marketed as &quot;cold water&quot; detergents due to their energy savings/efficiency. Also, I should add that cold water detergents are not effective against oily/grease stains since greases are temperature dependent; they only react well with higher temperature water.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That's not what enzymes do to my understanding, they don't provide energy they lower the minimum energy required for a reaction to take place. </p>
<p>This often means you need a lot less energy to do something, because that minimum energy issue can be a real barrier that enzymes mostly remove.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Enzymes do not provide energy and they're not temperature independent. &quot;Cold&quot; and &quot;hot&quot; are always relative so &quot;cold&quot; to us might be the ideal range for those enzymes, and hot to us would denature them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also you have to think of cold as a relative temperature. For example at the plant I work at, our &quot;cold&quot; water is 88°F. This is not cold like what you would think of for drinking water, but compared to our &quot;hot&quot; water (180°+) this is considered cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a follow-up question that I've been meaning to ask on this subject for a while. Why is it that sometimes, no matter how forceful or hot the water is, it just won't get something clean -- yet you can easily remove whatever it is by just rubbing your finger over it? </p>
<p>Isn't the water &quot;stronger&quot; so to speak?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the pressure is high enough, it will do the same thing that a finger or sponge can do (think pressure washers). However sometimes the heat and polarity of the water molecule still isn't enough to overpower the bonds in the food. The food has gone through both a physical and chemical change, and water can no longer simply dissolve the material. That's why soap is nice: soap/detergent is usually basic, and comes at the hardened food from a new angle and method of breaking those bonds than water and pressure can do alone. </p>
<p>Dishwasher detergent pods in a dishwasher utilize all methods discussed above for the most efficient clean: hot water, pressure, concentrated liquid detergent, and sometimes powdered detergent as well to produce manual friction. </p>

Also I'm super high so if none of that made sense, I'm so sorry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two explanations (depending on the exact situation you're taking about)</p>
<p>Either the debris is making a macroscopic bond around the fiber/dish/etc, and it's physically held there until enough lateral force is applied to it.</p>
<p>Or (and I think this is closer to what you're asking) if you have a relatively &quot;large&quot; area of debris, it is bound throughout the contact area. The water and soap can only get to the edges of the contact area. When you rub it, you massively increase the area that can be dissolved by the solution. </p>
<p>The other answer to rubbing it is to let it soak. Your grandmother probably did this after baking a casserole or lasagna. She would full the dish with hot water (higher average molecular movement) and soap, and then come back hours later to finish washing the pan.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Don't most people still do this?  What are you suggesting that this method has been replaced with, that I would have to think back to my grandmother to remember anyone soaking baked on food residue?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whatever the gunk is stuck to the plate isn't water soluble. Meaning, water won't dissolve it. Without soap, water will just run off it. If you use hot water, it'll cause the proteins in the gunk to misfold, which can release it from the plate or the rest of the gunk. Also, the amount of pressure the water puts on the gunk is less than the pressure you put on it with a fingernail or fingertip. So you're literally using more force than your faucet can produce. You can rectify that by using a faucet with the adjustable nozzle and using the setting with the fewer number of holes (which are small). This increases the pressure of the streams of water (because now it's 10 streams of the same volume of water instead of one stream of that volume of water).</p></div>		</li>
