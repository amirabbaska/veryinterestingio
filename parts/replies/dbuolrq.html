			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually F0, yeah. But sometimes there are sub-harmonics present. I don't know how the math works for that, but if you have a 100Hz F0, you sometimes have 50Hz in addition to the upper harmonics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Subharmonics are possible only from additional periodic components or from complex logic operations like what modular synths seek to pull off. If you're talking about a physical instrument, it can come from the three dimensionality of it resulting in comb filters that result in peaks below the fundamental (and indeed, an ideal physical instrument would be based almost entirely in those implied notes... that's how the violin family produces such incredibly rich tones).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the fundamental isn't the loudest frequency you will still hear the pitch as being the fundamental.  The fundamental can even be absent in the sound, and if the other harmonics are there the brain &quot;fills in&quot; the fundamental </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good example of this is double-reed instruments like the oboe, which sound as if they're playing at the fundamental frequency even though the 2nd harmonic is far stronger (by about an order of magnitude).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pitch is a psychoacoustic property - i.e., it is the subjective perception of the frequency of a complex tone. </p>
<p>Typically, pitch roughly corresponds to the fundamental frequency of a tone (F0, or the lowest frequency in a periodic sound - amplitude of the harmonics decreases with increasing frequency), as others have said. In other words, we perceive sounds with higher F0 as having higher pitch and vice versa. </p>
<p>Fun fact - most humans can hear frequencies from about 20 Hz to 20 kHz. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But the highest frequency you can hear goes down as you age. It's pretty fun to drive a class of misbehaving middle schoolers to insanity with an 18 kHz signal.</p></div>		</li>

Not relevant but I love cats.</p></div>		</li>
