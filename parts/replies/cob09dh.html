<p>There's more info in the link, but generally, the strains are selected each year &quot;based on which influenza vurs strains are circulating, how they are spreading, and how well current vaccine strains protect against newly identified strains&quot;. They list all the organizations that contribute to the monitoring and disseminating of information relation to influenza globally and locally. WHO makes recommendations, and in the US, the FDA then chooses which vaccine will be used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the flu mutates so rapidly that there is no such thing
as &quot;all known flu strains&quot; also a mega vaccine (like one with hundreds of strains) would be prohibitively expensive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it's not exactly a &quot;mega-vaccine&quot;, this is actually what currently happens. The flu vaccine comes in two forms, the mist and the injection. The mist and injection also consist of several varieties, with the most common being tri- and quadrivalent. This means that each vaccine actually covers three (tri-) or four (quadri-) strains of flu, in order to provide the broadest protection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flues are somewhat unique as a virus as their genome consists of 7 separate strands of RNA (something which is similar to DNA), there are various different versions of each one of the 7 strands of RNA and the flu virus has the ability to suddenly switch  any of the 7 strand with other flu viruses.</p>
<p>The outer casing of the virus is made of two proteins, the H protein and the N protein, which are the molecules our immune systems respond to. The flu virus H1N1 is a flu virus with the H1 and N1 variant of those proteins, there are multiple variants of each protein and the flu virus is capable of suddenly changing either protein variant over a very short period of time by the exchange of the RNA strands mentioned before.</p>
<p>This means to make a mega-vaccination you would need to include every combination of every variant of the H and N proteins that are infective to humans, which would not be possible.</p>
<p>This leaves us with our current vaccination solution, which is to research what the most common combination of H and N proteins this years seasonal flu has and to then make a vaccination specifically for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a related note, how are new flu vaccines developed and distributed every year, when it seems that all other medications take years and years for testing and approval? I am full-on pro-vac, but I've always been a bit leery of flu vaccines for this reason. </p></div>		</li>
