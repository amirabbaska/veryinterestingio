			<div class="markdown"><p>The exact phrases &quot;Dunbar's Number&quot; and &quot;Illusion of Asymmetric Insight&quot; are proper terms of art for the two key concepts on which I based my response.</p>
<p>The average web search should find nice references for these terms.</p>
<p>The specific application I put these terms to may seem a little stretched, but there's a whole continuum for most things in psychology, so it's hard to be definitive without a lot of references and cross references.</p>
<p>For instance the Illusion of Asymmetric Insight is <em>really</em> about how we view the <em>motives</em> of others at its core. But once you combine it with Dunbar's Number then you can see that two work in concert to relieve us of the burden of evaluating an unmanageable number of strangers.</p>
<p>Then I dumped my own history of people watching on top. I've noticed that I've got a whole internal taxonomy for classifying people at a glance.</p>
<p>When you then fall back and look at how we include looks in our classification system, well the whole thing gels.</p>
<p>For instance if I say &quot;he was a dude bro&quot; and &quot;the bar was sweltering hot last night&quot;, you are likely to edit in a guy in sports jersey and shorts, with sneakers or even sandals, maybe a backwards hat. But you are also going to toss in current (or fading) athletic build and likely clear skin and whatever features you might assume I'd include.</p>
<p>Simple exercises &quot;picture a fashion model&quot; or &quot;picture a friendly cop&quot; &quot;some barista&quot;... if you really think about it you've got a &quot;Default Face&quot; for most of this stuff. That face is just as anonymous and unremarkable as your default set of expectations.</p>
<p>So too &quot;surfer&quot; or whatever, and lumberjack's probably got a beard and all that.</p>
<p>So the basis is well studied and the common experience of generic regard is universal.</p>
<p>So it's not a stretch.</p></div>		</li>
