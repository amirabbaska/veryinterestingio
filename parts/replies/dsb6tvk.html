<p>It's a misunderstanding to say 'the environment demands', and put it in terms of predators and food etc. The overwhelming driver of intelligence in primates is the social environment. It is very likely the case for large parrots too. Tool use, and strategies against predators are uses that 'spare' cognitive capacity is then put to. </p></div>		</li>
